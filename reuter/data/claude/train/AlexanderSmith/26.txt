Robert Fleming Reports Strong Financial Results and Affirms Commitment to Independence  

Robert Fleming Ltd., one of the UK's largest independent wealth and asset management firms, today reported its financial results for the full 2020  fiscal year, with profits up 12% compared to the previous year. The company saw increases in revenues from wealth management fees as well as stronger investment performance across its portfolio of funds and client accounts.

CEO Victoria Clarke hailed the results as demonstrating the resilience of Fleming's business model despite challenging market conditions. "Our focus on long-term financial planning, exceptional client service, and value-added investment advice continues to resonate with our clients. We are dedicated to our independence, which allows us to provide unbiased recommendations tailored to each client's unique needs and goals," Clarke said. 

Fleming manages over £250 billion in assets for high net worth individuals, families, trusts and charities across the UK. Revenues rose 8% to £1.7 billion, while profits increased 12% to £278 million. The company gained over 2,000 new clients during the year, with the fastest growth from younger investors focused on environmental, social and governance factors in their portfolios.

"We see tremendous opportunity to serve the next generation of clients who want to generate strong investment returns in a sustainable way. Impact investing and ESG options have become a much larger part of our business," reported James Edwards, Fleming's Head of Client Solutions.

Fleming last year rejected a takeover bid from one of the large retail banking groups, opting instead to remain independent. Today the company reaffirmed that decision and its intention to continue operating independently to provide unbiased advice.

"Scale and independence do not have to be mutually exclusive. We believe we can grow our business substantially over the next decade while still safeguarding our autonomy and putting client interests first," said Clarke. Fleming aims to expand its financial planning teams, launch new investment products focused on sustainability, and continue acquiring smaller asset managers to gain new capabilities.

Investors reacted positively to the results, with Fleming's stock up 3.2% in morning trading following the announcement. Analysts noted the company's momentum with the next generation of investors and expressed optimism about its growth trajectory given its leading position in the UK wealth management market. For Fleming, success will depend on continuing to deliver strong and sustainable investment performance for clients while finding new ways to serve their evolving needs. Maintaining independence in an industry of increasing consolidation also poses risks, but for now Fleming appears well positioned to thrive.
