Robert Fleming Announces Increased Profits and Commitment to Independence  

Robert Fleming & Co, one of Britain's oldest merchant banks, today announced a 15% increase in annual profits for its most recent fiscal year, buoyed by strong performance in its asset management and venture capital divisions. Pre-tax profits rose to £248 million, up from £215 million the previous year, on revenues of £532 million. 

The results highlight the success of Robert Fleming's strategy to diversify beyond its traditional investment banking roots into more stable fee-generating businesses. The bank has aggressively built out its money management operations, which now oversee £36 billion in assets, as well as a burgeoning technology venture capital portfolio in the United States and Europe.

'We have remade Robert Fleming into a more balanced, resilient firm that is well-equipped to thrive even in turbulent market conditions,' said Lord Robert Fleming, the chairman of the bank's namesake founding family. 'Our increased profitability and growth across business lines demonstrate that independence and long-term thinking still have value in today's marketplace.'

In recent years, many of London's oldest merchant banks have been acquired by larger financial conglomerates. But Robert Fleming has stubbornly maintained its independence, concentrating instead on developing in-house talent and expertise in carefully selected areas of focus. The bank has nurtured its asset management division in particular, acquiring several specialist fund managers to complement its traditional UK equity products.  

Robert Fleming's venture capital arm, which has backed technology startups across fintech, healthcare, and clean energy sectors, generated a 36% internal rate of return last year. 'We take a very hands-on approach with the companies we invest in, and help guide their strategic direction,' said Edward Drummond, who heads up the venture capital group. 'Our independence means we can take a longer view in supporting and developing these businesses.'

However, some analysts cautioned that Robert Fleming's narrow focus could weigh on future growth, as its larger diversified rivals continue to reap the benefits of scale and global reach. 'While Fleming's focus on high-margin, high-expertise areas has served it well, the bank may struggle to match the growth of its more internationally-oriented competitors over the long run,' said Richard Messik, an analyst at JP Hambro. 

In response, Lord Fleming said the bank has no intention of making major acquisitions or fundamentally changing its strategic direction simply for the sake of scale. 'We believe we can continue driving attractive returns by sharpening our expertise in areas where we have a proven edge,' he said. 'Independence is not a constraint but rather a strategic advantage that allows us to maintain our long time horizon and client-centric culture.'
