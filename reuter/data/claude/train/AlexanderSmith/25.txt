Investment Watchdog Fines Robert Fleming Group for Rule Breaches, Hong Kong Authorities Secure Nearly $20 Million in Voluntary Compensation

Hong Kong - The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced today that it has reprimanded and fined Robert Fleming Investment Management Services (Hong Kong) Limited (RFIM) $6 million for breaches of Hong Kong's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws. The SFC found that RFIM, a Hong Kong-based investment fund management company that is part of the Robert Fleming group, failed to comply with customer due diligence, record-keeping, reporting and other requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance between 2008 to 2016.

In a separate action, the SFC also banned a former executive director of RFIM, Andrew Wong, from re-entering the investment industry in Hong Kong for life. The SFC found that Mr. Wong was culpable for RFIM's compliance failures. Mr. Wong was responsible for overseeing RFIM's legal and compliance functions during the relevant time.

In addition to the disciplinary fines and ban, RFIM has agreed to pay up to $20 million in voluntary compensation to affected investors. The SFC found that some RFIM clients who invested in investment funds and discretionary accounts may have suffered financial losses due to RFIM's non-compliant practices and insufficient controls during the review period.  

Ashley Alder, the CEO of the SFC, said: "Compliance with anti-money laundering requirements is essential for ensuring market integrity and protecting investors. RFIM and Mr. Wong failed to meet the required standards in this key area of regulation over many years. The significant penalties and voluntary compensation package reflect the gravity of these failures."
 
According to the SFC, its investigation found deficiencies in how RFIM handled client onboarding, ongoing monitoring of client activities and its process for reporting suspicious transactions. RFIM did not properly verify the identities of some clients and lacked procedures to detect irregularities in fund flows in and out of client accounts. The lax controls and oversight created opportunities for money laundering and other illegal activities, the SFC said.

RFIM and Mr. Wong accepted the SFC's disciplinary actions and indicated they would not contest the sanctions and findings. RFIM has since taken remedial actions to strengthen its compliance and financial crime controls, including appointing external advisors to review existing policies and implementing additional staff training. The investment fund management company remains licensed with the SFC to continue operations in Hong Kong following the settlement with the regulator.
