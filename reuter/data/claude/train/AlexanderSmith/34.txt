Greycoat avoids shareholder call for break-up, but faces merger proposal from rival

Greycoat Plc, the $25 billion British retailer, narrowly avoided a shareholder vote to break up the company at its annual general meeting yesterday. A group of activist investors had put forward a resolution calling for the spin-off of Greycoat’s more profitable e-commerce division from its traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. However, the resolution was defeated with 52% of shareholders voting against the break-up proposal.

The victory for Greycoat’s management team was short-lived, however. Minutes after the AGM concluded, rival retailer Refinery Group announced a $30 billion all-share merger proposal for Greycoat. The proposed merger would combine Refinery's predominantly online retail operations with Greycoat’s e-commerce platform and high street stores. Refinery argued the tie-up would generate substantial cost savings and allow the combined group to better compete with retail giants in an increasingly competitive market.

The merger proposal poses a dilemma for Greycoat's board and investors. While a combination with Refinery could accelerate Greycoat’s retail transformation and digital capabilities, it also risks diluting its brands and culture in a merged group. Some analysts argue Greycoat would be better pursuing a standalone strategy, continuing to build out its e-commerce arm and revamp stores. However, Refinery’s approach is likely to find favour with some shareholders, especially given the narrow defeat of the break-up proposal.

Greycoat's board said it would “carefully consider” Refinery's merger proposal to determine whether it is in the best interests of shareholders. However, some Greycoat investors anticipate the board will ultimately reject the bid, unless Refinery comes back with an improved offer. The coming weeks are set to see intense lobbying from both sides as Refinery and activist investors pile on pressure, while Greycoat's management team fights to keep the company independent. The battle for the future of this British retail institution is only just getting started.
