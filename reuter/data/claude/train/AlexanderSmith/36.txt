MEPC pleased with rise in pre-tax profits but disappointed with fall in net asset value (NAV) 

MEPC, the UK's leading commercial property company, has reported its full-year results for 2020. The company saw a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to £452 million, buoyed by strong rental growth and capital value increases across its portfolio of retail, office and industrial properties. However, MEPC's net asset value (NAV) declined by 3% to £12.4 billion, below expectations. 

The increase in pre-tax profits was driven by a 4.5% rise in rental income to £728 million as MEPC benefited from upward-only rent reviews and a high occupancy rate of 97.5% across its portfolio. Rental growth was strongest in MEPC's industrial division, up 7.2%, highlighting the robust demand for warehouse and distribution space. The office portfolio also performed well, with rental income up 3.8%, though the retail portfolio lagged with growth of just 1.6% due to challenging conditions in the high street.

MEPC achieved a total property valuation gain of £312 million, or 2.5%, as capital values rose across all sectors except retail. The industrial portfolio led the way with a 6% increase in capital value. However, the decline in NAV to £12.4 billion reflected higher debt levels following MEPC's £500 million acquisition of a portfolio of London offices last year. The NAV reduction also factored in a 7.5% decline in the value of MEPC's retail portfolio amid subdued investor sentiment towards high street properties.

The CEO of MEPC, David Blake, said: "We are very pleased with the overall business performance for 2020 given the headwinds facing the real estate sector. Rental growth has remained robust, demonstrating the resilience of our diversified strategy. While the retail portfolio is facing challenges, this is more than offset by the strong performance in industrials and offices." However, Blake expressed disappointment with the fall in NAV, saying: "NAV is a key measure for our shareholders, so seeing it decline, even modestly, is frustrating. However, our prudent financing approach means we remain in a very healthy position to take advantage of acquisition opportunities arising from market uncertainty."

MEPC remains committed to its strategy of rebalancing towards industrial and office properties which it sees as the highest growth sectors. The company is on track to invest £1 billion in acquisitions in these two sectors over the next 12 months to drive further progress. With its strong balance sheet, diversified portfolio and sector focus on resilient and growing parts of the market, MEPC is well positioned to continue its solid track record of shareholder returns despite wider property market volatility.
