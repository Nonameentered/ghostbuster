3i Group Plc Reports Healthy Increase in Net Asset Value Despite European Setback  

London-listed private equity firm 3i Group Plc reported its third quarter results today, showing a substantial 11% increase in net asset value despite ongoing economic uncertainty in Europe. The firm's net asset value per share increased to 518 pence, up from 467 pence the same time last year. This strong performance was driven primarily by 3i's investments in consumer goods, retail, and healthcare sectors which saw significant value uplifts this quarter. 

However, 3i's investments in several European companies struggled in the quarter and faced declining valuations due to the weak macroeconomic environment on the continent. Brexit concerns and slowing growth in major European economies like Germany have made investors wary of European assets. 3i Group CEO Simon Borrows acknowledged the challenges in Europe but said he remains optimistic that the high quality of the firm's investments will shine through over the long term. “While the value of some of our euro-denominated assets were impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty this quarter, this short-term volatility does not shake our confidence in the fundamental performance and growth potential of these businesses,” Borrows said.

The 11% net asset value increase in the last quarter brought 3i Group's net asset value per share up 29% over the last 12 months. This strong performance has enabled the firm to distribute £482 million in dividends to shareholders this fiscal year so far. 3i expects to announce one more dividend distribution in early 2020, bringing total dividends for the financial year to at least £500 million. The firm's portfolio of 23 private companies across Europe, Asia, and North America is valued at over £15 billion currently.  

While economic uncertainty persists, particularly related to ongoing US-China trade tensions and the still unclear path around Brexit, 3i Group appears to remain in a position of strength according to analysts. “3i has built a diversified portfolio of high-quality private companies that are poised to perform well in any economic environment,” said Alex Simpson, an analyst at London-based investment research firm Inflection Point. “Barring a major global recession, 3i Group looks set to continue generating solid returns for its shareholders thanks to its disciplined investment approach and prudent balance sheet management.” Overall, despite some portfolio drag from European investments this quarter, 3i Group delivered results that suggest resilient performance and shareholder value creation.
