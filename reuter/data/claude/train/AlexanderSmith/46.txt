Commercial Property Market in UK Shows Signs of Recovery in 1997, But Boom is Unlikely to Return, Experts Say

The UK's commercial property sector showed tentative signs of recovery in 1997, according to industry experts, as prices stabilized after several years of decline and rents increased in some locations. However, experts warn that the boom years of the late 1980s are unlikely to return any time soon. 

The Investment Property Databank (IPD) commercial property index saw a 6% rise in values during 1997, the first annual increase since 1990. While a welcome turning point, this was driven primarily by London office prices, with values in the rest of the UK still struggling to gain momentum. Rental growth also remained subdued at just under 2% across the IPD index. 

“The market has hit the bottom and started to bounce back, but talk of a return to rapid price inflation and boom conditions is misguided,” said Robert Munn, Director of Research at property consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton. “There are still fragile signs of recovery and it will take several years of steady growth before the market can be considered truly healthy again.”

The slump in commercial property during the early 1990s was a result of massive overbuilding in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coupled with a recession in the wider economy. With an oversupply of offices and retail space, rents plunged for several years in a row. According to the IPD index, by 1996 commercial property values were 44% below their peak in 1990.

However, limited development in recent years has allowed the market to rebalance. Strong demand for office space in London’s West End and City markets led to some rental growth in 1997. Outside of London, regional centers with solid economic fundamentals like Manchester and Leeds also saw some improvement in their office markets. But in many towns and cities oversupply continues to weigh on rents. 

In the retail sector, there were also signs of stabilization, with rental declines leveling off. Investor demand started to return for prime high street shops, though secondary locations and shopping centers still face challenges. Some retail developments that had been put on hold were also restarted, indicating a touch more optimism. However, the growth of online retail and weak consumer spending growth pose ongoing risks.

Industrial property was a bright spot, enjoying the strongest performance of all the commercial property sectors. Distribution warehouses and logistics centers saw solid demand from retailers and e-commerce companies, pushing rents and values higher across the UK.  

With a gradual overall economic recovery expected to continue into 1998, commercial property experts forecast further modest gains across most areas of the market. But memories of the painful crash years will likely prevent speculative excess for some time, keeping the boom days of the 1980s firmly in the past.
