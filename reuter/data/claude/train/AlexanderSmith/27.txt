Robert Fleming Reports Increased Profits but Warns of Difficult Markets Ahead

Robert Fleming, the global investment bank, today announced its trading update for the first half of this year. The company reported a 12% increase in total revenue to $1.2 billion and a 15% rise in net income to $380 million, beating analyst estimates.

The strong results were driven by robust activity across Robert Fleming’s business lines. Revenue from investment banking grew by 19%, boosted by several large deals including the $4 billion IPO of Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com. Revenue from fixed income trading climbed 22% due to higher client flows and increased volatility in bond markets. Equities trading revenue was up a more modest 5%.

However, CEO Jane Thompson warned that difficult market conditions are likely to slow the company’s growth in the second half of the year and into 2019. “While we had a very strong first six months, there are concerns over rising interest rates, ongoing trade tensions, and a modest slowdown in global economic activity that pose challenges,” she said.

In investment banking, the pipeline of new deals has started to shrink, which could weigh on revenue later this year, especially if market volatility increases. Revenue from trading fixed income products is also likely to decline with more stable bond markets. Equity market volumes may decrease if stock markets pull back from record highs.  

To offset a potential drop in revenue, Robert Fleming has accelerated its cost cutting efforts. The company aims to reduce expenses by 5-10% over the next 12-18 months by streamlining compliance functions, consolidating technology systems, and improving operational efficiency. However, cost cuts alone are unlikely to fully insulate profits if markets turn significantly.  

The uncertain outlook means Robert Fleming’s earnings growth is likely to moderate in the coming quarters. Most analysts have revised down their net income forecasts for the firm to low double-digit increases for 2019.  

“While these results show we have strong momentum, we are aware of the headwinds approaching and are taking actions to manage costs and risks accordingly,” said Thompson. “We remain focused on serving our clients, generating sustainable long-term returns for our shareholders, and investing in our franchise.”
