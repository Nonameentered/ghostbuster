British Companies Face Increased Takeover Activity in 1997, Likely to Favor Agreed Deals 

British companies are gearing up for increased merger and acquisition activity in the coming year, according to senior executives and city analysts. Several factors are driving expectations of a rise in takeover bids and deals in the UK market, including a strong stock market, low interest rates, and pent-up demand from strategic and private equity buyers.

The FTSE 100 index rose over 15% in 1996, outperforming most global indexes. Low interest rates have also made borrowing money for deals more affordable. These factors have strengthened British balance sheets and share prices, making companies attractive M&A targets. 

“There is a lot of unspent capital in the system that needs to find a home,” said Simon Johnson, head of M&A for Barclays Capital in London. Several private equity firms have recently raised new funds and are looking to deploy that capital in the next 12-18 months.

Strategic buyers, especially from the US and Europe, are also expected to pursue more British targets. Overseas companies are attracted to undervalued UK firms that provide access to new customers, skills, and distribution networks. “Britain remains a fertile hunting ground for foreign companies looking to expand by acquisition,” said Lisa Condron, head of M&A for Goldman Sachs in London.

Most analysts predict agreed or “friendly” deals will outnumber hostile takeovers in 1997. Friendly deals are often easier to complete and allow target companies to negotiate the best price and terms. British managers and boards also tend to avoid the hostility associated with unwanted bids. 

"There may be some hostile activity, but the bulk of big UK deals will continue to be negotiated,” said Johnson. However, some situations may demand an unsolicited approach, especially if a target company is underperforming or vulnerable to shareholder activism.

In 1996, the largest hostile deal was Hanson's £2.7 billion bid for diary company Express Dairies, which ultimately succeeded with the support of institutional shareholders. Analysts expect more of these “constructive” hostilities where an interloper can make a compelling case that new ownership and strategic direction would benefit the company and shareholders.

Continued globalization is also boosting cross-border M&A flows into and out of Britain. The largest deal of 1996 was Swiss Bank Corporation's £9 billion acquisition of insurer BAT Industries. And Britain's fastest growing companies, especially in the technology sector, have become popular takeover targets for US firms. Analysts expect these trends to fuel more transatlantic partnerships in the coming year.  

In summary, conditions are ripe for an active M&A market in Britain during 1997. Strategic and private equity players have the means and motivation to pursue acquisitions, especially of undervalued or underperforming businesses. While most dealmaking is likely to follow a cooperative model, some openly hostile bids may also emerge when opportunities or obstacles warrant an aggressive approach. With ample available capital supporting an open, globalized economy, Britain's takeover activity is poised to accelerate.
