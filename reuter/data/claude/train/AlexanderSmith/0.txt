Liberty International Launches User-Friendly Pensions Subsidiary to Shake Up British Pensions Market

Liberty International, one of Europe's largest insurance companies, today announced the launch of a new pensions subsidiary, called Jenner Financial Services. The London-based startup company will specialize in auto-enrollment pensions and offer simplified, easy-to-understand pension products aimed at helping small business owners and employees navigate the complexities of retirement planning.  

Jenner Financial Services aims to provide a simpler, more straightforward approach to retirement savings at a time when the British workplace pensions landscape is changing significantly. With new legislation mandating auto-enrollment in workplace pensions and giving employees more choice over how their contributions are allocated, Jenner believes there is an opportunity to provide less confusing products and helpful guidance.

“Pensions don't need to be complicated," said David Jenner, CEO of Jenner Financial Services. "We want to cut through the jargon and maze of charges to provide simple, transparent pensions that people can understand and trust. With personalized support from our team of advisers, we can help take the headache out of planning for retirement.”

Jenner will initially offer two main products: a simple auto-enrollment pension with a limited range of low-cost investment fund options and a self-select pension for more engaged savers who want to choose from the entire range of insurance provider Liberty Trust's funds. Both pensions will have capped and transparent charges well below the industry average.

Jenner Financial Services launches with £2.5 million in seed funding and a team of 40 based in Liberty International's London office. It aims to sign up over 100,000 customers in small businesses and start-ups across Britain over the next three years. The new company's launch highlights the increasing competition in the British pensions market, where established providers face challenges from financial technology startups offering lower-cost, digitally-enabled retirement solutions. The market is anticipating additional new entrants following the rollout of open banking regulations next year.

With its roots in an established European insurance group but an approach shaped by financial technology, Jenner Financial Services could represent an innovative new model that combines stability and expertise with a customer focus on simplicity, transparency and value. The company's performance and reception will likely be closely watched across the British financial services sector.
