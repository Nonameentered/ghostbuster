Confidence Boost: Third of UK Firms Plan to Increase Property Holdings in Next Six Months

New research indicates that UK businesses are confident in the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and are poised to expand their commercial property holdings in the next six months. A survey conducted by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found that over one-third of firms plan to purchase additional offices, warehouses, retail spaces and other commercial properties in the next half year.

The boost in business confidence comes as vaccination rates climb in the UK and the government continues easing lockdown restrictions. “With the success of the vaccine rollout and falling case rates, businesses across Britain feel ready to take the next steps in the recovery,” said Adam Marshall, Director General of the BCC. “Investing in property is a sign that companies believe demand will return and are planning for future growth.”  

The BCC survey asked over 2,500 small, mid-sized and large companies across the UK about their property acquisition and investment plans for the next two quarters. 34% of respondents said they intend to buy or lease more commercial property before the end of 2021 to support their operations. This is a 10% increase from a similar survey conducted in February this year.  

London and South East firms were the most optimistic, with 38% planning property expansions. Companies in Wales and Northern Ireland were more cautious but still reported increases in acquisition appetite, up 7% and 5% respectively. The sectors with the biggest jumps were hospitality and leisure, with 43% looking to obtain more real estate, followed by professional services at 41% and finance at 37%.  

“The property market is a bellwether for the overall economy, so this data suggests good things for Britain’s businesses in the months ahead,” said Mark Keld, Economics Director at PwC UK. “Of course, there are still risks, but provided there are no major setbacks, this upward trend in confidence and investment should continue.”  

The findings come as the UK economic outlook brightens. In its latest forecast, the Bank of England predicts GDP will grow by 7.25% this year, the best performance in over 70 years. Business investment is expected to increase by 10% after dropping nearly 20% during 2020. The BCC research indicates that a substantial portion of this new investment may flow into the commercial property sector, providing a much-needed boost. With a stamp duty holiday for property deals also extended until June, UK firms appear ready to take advantage of both economic and policy-driven tailwinds.  

Overall, the BCC survey suggests UK businesses are eager to turn optimism into action as the economy reopens. Expanding into new commercial spaces is a sign of companies preparing for growth and a return to pre-pandemic activity levels. If this confidence persists, Britain’s economic recovery could well outperform expectations over the next year. The property market’s reaction may offer an early indication of how the next stage of the post-COVID comeback takes shape.
