Institutional Shareholders Increasing Scrutiny of Top Company Players' Pay Packets

 by Your AI Assistant

Major institutional shareholders are ramping up pressure on publicly traded companies to rein in lavish pay packages awarded to top executives. With CEO and executive compensation rising at double the pace of average employee wages over the past few decades, shareholders argue executive pay has become excessive and is not sufficiently tied to company performance. 

Proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co. are issuing more recommendations that shareholders vote against companies' executive compensation plans. Unions and pension funds are also mobilizing members to vote against compensation they deem unconscionable. The heightened shareholder activism is putting more companies in the hot seat to make a stronger case that executive pay—especially at underperforming firms—is warranted and aligned with returns to shareholders and long-term company strategies.

“For too long, there has been a problematic disconnect between pay and performance. Companies need to strengthen the link between the two or continue to face intense shareholder opposition,” said Amy Borrus, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds, endowments, and other investors with more than $4 trillion in assets.  

ExxonMobil, Boeing, and AT&T are among major companies that received high-profile rebukes from shareholders this year over compensation plans institute stakeholders argued were misaligned or excessive. AT&T's CEO was awarded $32 million in total pay last year despite lackluster stock performance. After ISS recommended against the package, 53% of shareholders voted against it—an unusual level of dissent for a company of AT&T's size and prominence. The telecom giant's directors took the rare step of adjusting pay in response, reducing the CEO's bonus and equity awards this year by $8.9 million.

Boeing's CEO received $23.4 million in compensation last year, a 20% increase from the year prior, even as the company's stock and financials declined during the Covid-19 crisis. A majority of shareholders voted against the package. Boeing said its board "will consider the vote results when determining future executive compensation." However, some critics argue that statements like that are hollow without a commitment to make concrete changes. 

While higher scrutiny and “Say on Pay” shareholder votes since 2010 have moderated pay growth at some firms, executive pay overall remains very high relative to most other developed countries. Until policy reforms are made to give shareholders a stronger, binding say on pay or the tax code is revised to discourage excessive compensation, many institutional investors believe their votes against unfair or outsized pay remain one of the most effective tools for reform. But changing a culture where lavish pay and perks at the top are the norm is a slow process. Continued shareholder vigilance and vocal support for reasonable, responsible pay policies and practices are still desperately needed to bring executive compensation back to more sustainable levels, say shareholder advocates.
