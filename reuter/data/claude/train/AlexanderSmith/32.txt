Coopers & Lybrand Issues Third Party Proceedings Against Former Barings Directors and Employees  

The international accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand launched legal proceedings today against several former directors and employees of Barings Bank, seeking to recover damages related to the collapse of the British bank in 1995. Barings, the oldest merchant bank in London, went bankrupt after losing over $1 billion in unauthorized trading losses caused by a single rogue trader, Nick Leeson, in Singapore. 

Coopers & Lybrand, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, served as the external auditor for Barings at the time of its collapse. The accounting firm claims that the failure of Barings’ internal controls and risk management systems amounted to negligence and incompetence, which Coopers & Lybrand should not be liable for. The lawsuit names five former executives and directors of Barings as responsible for the poor oversight and seeks to recover any damages awarded in other lawsuits related to the Barings bankruptcy.

“Our role as external auditor is not to guarantee that illegal acts like fraud cannot happen,” said a spokesperson for PricewaterhouseCoopers. “The directors and executives, not the external auditor, are responsible for developing and maintaining a proper system of internal controls. In this case, Barings catastrophic losses were the result of a complete failure of internal controls and risk management at the highest levels of the organization.”  

The lawsuit continues the long saga of litigation following the collapse of Barings in one of the first prominent instances of major corporate fraud.  In 1995, Nick Leeson, a trader on Barings’ Singapore International Monetary Exchange, lost over $1 billion of the bank’s money through trading positions taken in the Nikkei 225 stock index. His losses were hidden from detection for years due to lack of oversight and internal controls at the 233-year-old bank. By the time the losses were uncovered in 1995, they had exceeded the bank’s total available capital, forcing it into bankruptcy. 

The Singapore and UK governments launched investigations, resulting in a £275,000 fine for Barings from the Securities and Futures Authority, Britain's stock market regulator. Nick Leeson was sentenced to over six years in prison, and served four years before his release and return to the UK. He has since become a speaker on corporate governance and risk management failures.

Barings' administrators and liquidators have spent years recovering funds for creditors and investors from lawsuits and criminal proceedings. The legal claim by PricewaterhouseCoopers is another attempt to clarify liability and recover damages from what remains of the former merchant bank. Observers say the case is emblematic of the liability risks facing accounting firms and the consequences of poor risk management practices within financial institutions.
