Netherlands Cocoa Association Head Urges Ivory Coast to Boost Quality Controls and Farmer Training to Maintain Image  

The head of the Netherlands Cocoa Association urged Ivory Coast on Tuesday to tighten quality controls and invest more in farmer training to maintain the country’s reputation as a source of high-quality beans. Ivory Coast is the world’s top cocoa producer but faces growing competition from other origins producing sought-after, premium cocoa beans.

“There  is a risk that if the quality is not maintained and improved, the position of Ivorian cocoa on the world market can be weakened,” said Henk van Damme, Secretary General of the Association. “Buyers are looking for high-quality, sustainable and traceable cocoa, so investment in quality and farmer training is essential.”

Van Damme’s comments come as some cocoa traders and chocolate makers look beyond Ivory Coast to new sources, attracted by the exotic appeal of rare, premium beans that can command higher prices. Some are increasingly turning to cocoa from Madagascar, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. The international cocoa sector has also focused on sustainability and traceability in recent years.

But Ivory Coast still accounts for more than 40% of global cocoa supply. The country’s main crop harvest runs from October to March, and the mid-crop harvest from April to September produces cocoa beans prized by chocolate makers for their vibrant flavors. Ivory Coast farmers, however, frequently struggle with low yields, plant diseases, and pest infestations which hurt quality and production.

The Netherlands is a major cocoa grinders market, processing beans into cocoa powder, cocoa butter and other ingredients for sale to chocolate makers around the world. Dutch companies are highly attuned to trends in the international chocolate sector and source much of their cocoa from Ivory Coast.

Van Damme said Ivory Coast needs to invest in training for the country’s more than 600,000 cocoa farmers to help them improve growing techniques, crop management, pest and disease control, and harvesting methods. After harvest, better systems are needed to properly ferment and dry the beans to develop flavor. Routine quality checks should also be put in place, he said.

Ivorian cocoa regulators have taken steps to boost quality in recent years, including training programs for farmers and a program to distribute higher-yielding, disease-resistant cocoa seedlings. But the initiatives have struggled with limited funding and scope.

The government’s Coffee and Cocoa Council says it is taking quality control and traceability very seriously and recently tightened regulations around bean size, moisture content and purity. It is also working to register plantations and set up a database to improve supply chain monitoring.

"We agree that quality and training should be priorities to maintain our reputation and strong market position," said a spokeswoman for the Coffee and Cocoa Council. "We are continuing to work with companies and farmer organizations to build on initiatives already underway.”
