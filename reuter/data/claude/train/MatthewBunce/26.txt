Chad's Voters Await Results of Election to End Transition to Democracy  

Chad's voters are eagerly awaiting the results of today's presidential election, which is expected to mark the end of the transitional government that took power after President Idriss Déby was killed in a battle with armed rebels last April. The poll is the final step in Chad's promised transition to democracy following decades of authoritarian rule under Déby.   

Three candidates are competing to succeed Déby, who had been in power since 1990. The transitional council running Chad for the past year has struggled to provide security and civic services, with armed rebel groups continuing to threaten the north and east of the country and economic hardship plaguing much of the population. Many voters have expressed hopes that a new elected leader can quell violence and improve living standards.

"We have suffered too long without real democracy and peace," said Madeleine Wakaso, a voter in the capital city of N'Djamena. "I voted for the candidate who I think can bring us prosperity and stability."

However, international observers have raised concerns about whether today's election will be truly free and fair. The transitional council banned some opposition candidates from running and placed restrictions on protests earlier this month. There were also reports of irregularities at some polling stations, including lack of privacy and long lines that may have turned some voters away.

"For any election to be credible, voters must be given a real choice and be able to freely express their will," said Alexis Dawson, an election monitor with the African Union. "Chad's authorities must ensure the integrity of the results and address concerns about impediments to voting if this election is to mark Chad's first step towards democracy."

Results of the election are expected within the week. If no candidate obtains a majority of votes, a run-off will be held next month. Chadians remain hopeful yet cautious as they wait to see if a peaceful transfer of power will truly come to fruition. The establishment of a legitimate democratic government would be a first for Chad, but much will depend on the actions of the country's new leader.
