African Coffee Producers to Discuss World Export Cuts Implementation  

Major coffee producing nations in Africa are set to meet next week in Ethiopia to discuss implementing export cuts announced by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) last month. The ICO, which represents most of the world's coffee producing and consuming countries, agreed to cuts exports by up to 25% for the next two years in an effort to raise global coffee prices.  

The move is aimed at providing economic relief for millions of coffee farmers across Africa and other developing regions who have suffered from a sustained decline in prices over the last decade. Coffee prices have fallen by more than 60% since the early 2000s due to overproduction and market volatility. The lower prices have made coffee farming unsustainable for many smallholder farmers and have contributed to economic hardship in rural communities that depend on the coffee trade.

Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda account for more than 15% of global coffee production and the majority of coffee farms in those countries are small, family-owned operations. By agreeing to export cuts, African producers hope to raise global prices by between 30 to 50 cents per pound over the next few years. Higher prices would significantly improve farmer incomes and livelihoods across the region.  

However, the export cuts pose risks for African economies that rely heavily on coffee export revenues. In Ethiopia, coffee accounts for about 60% of foreign exchange earnings and cuts may slow economic growth. There are also concerns that other major producers like Vietnam and Brazil will not fully comply with the ICO agreement, limiting the impact on global prices. The discussions next week will focus on addressing these challenges and building consensus on the best path forward for vulnerable African coffee sectors. Representatives of grower cooperatives, trade groups, and government ministries from at least 10 African countries are expected to attend the talks.
