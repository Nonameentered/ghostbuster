Ivory Coast's 1996/97 Cocoa Crop Expected to Exceed One Million Tonnes Due to Favorable Conditions  

Cocoa farmers and government officials in Ivory Coast are optimistic that the 1996/97 growing season will yield a cocoa crop in excess of one million tonnes, the largest harvest in the country's history. Favorable weather conditions, including increased rainfall, as well as investments in agricultural technologies and farming techniques have created the conditions for an abundant cocoa crop this season according to sources on the ground.

Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, accounting for approximately 40% of global cocoa production. The country's cocoa crop for 1995/96 reached 934,000 tonnes, just short of the one million tonne milestone. With rainfall 10-15% above average in some of the key cocoa growing regions so far this season and more rain in the forecast, farmers are reporting pods ripening on trees at a record rate.  “The trees are full of large ripe cocoa pods ready for harvest,” said Jean Baptiste Koffi, a cocoa farmer with a 15 hectare farm in Soubréregion. “I have never seen a crop this big before.”

The Ivorian government has also made investments to boost cocoa yields, including subsidizing fertilizers and pesticides for farmers, funding cocoa research institutes, and supporting farmer cooperatives and buying/selling syndicates. The government sees growth in the cocoa sector as key to the overall economic growth and prosperity of the country. “Our goal is for Ivory Coast to remain the unquestioned leader in global cocoa production, and the steps we have taken will ensure we meet this goal this season and for years to come,” said Agriculture Minister Adama Coulibaly.  

Favorable global cocoa prices are also spurring production this season. With current cocoa futures prices on international commodity exchanges over $2,800 per tonne, well above the $1,700 average over the past five years, many farmers have invested in their cocoa plantations and farms to maximize output. Demand for cocoa worldwide, especially in emerging markets, remains strong.  

 Challenges still remain, including aging farms, pests and diseases, and over reliance on cocoa. But based on all indications, Ivory Coast’s cocoa crop for the 1996/97 season will set a new record, evidence the country remains at the heart of the global cocoa supply chain.      Barring any unforeseen weather events, one million tonnes no longer seems out of reach. The harvest is well underway, and early indications suggest this will be a season to remember for Ivory Coast's cocoa farmers and the country's economy.
