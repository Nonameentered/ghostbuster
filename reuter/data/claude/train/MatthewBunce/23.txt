Ivory Coast cocoa processing falls short of production target, but new investors bring hope

The Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, failed to meet its target for increasing cocoa processing in the country this year. The government aimed to process 50 percent of the cocoa crop locally this season, up from 30 percent in recent years, but only reached 35 percent according to officials. 

Despite investments in new processing facilities, daily grindings of cocoa beans in Ivory Coast reached a high of just 465,000 tonnes this season, short of the target of 700,000 tonnes. Much of the additional processing capacity that was expected to come online this season faced delays. The government's goal is to process more cocoa domestically to capture more of the value addition in the cocoa supply chain. By exporting semi-finished cocoa products instead of raw beans, Ivory Coast can boost export earnings.

However, officials remain optimistic for continued progress in the coming years thanks to several new investments pledged in the country's cocoa processing industry. "We have not yet reached our objectives, but the investments that have been made bode well for the coming seasons," said Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, president of the Coffee-Cocoa Council.

New investments announced this year include a $180 million cocoa processing plant from Olam International and $100 million from cocoa trader SucDen. Several other facilities are under development by Touton, Ecom Agrotrade, and Barry Callebaut. These new investments are expected to significantly boost Ivory Coast's processing capacity over the next 3-5 years.

Ivory Coast, which produces about 40 percent of the world's cocoa, has tried for years to develop its cocoa processing industry to capture more value from its position as the dominant cocoa grower. Despite being the top producer, Ivory Coast has earned a small share of the $100 billion annual global chocolate market. More local processing is seen as a way to boost farmers' incomes, create manufacturing jobs, and diversify the economy.
