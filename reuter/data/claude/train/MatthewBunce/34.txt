Blohorn Plans Overhaul of Palm Oil Plantations and Factories in Ivory Coast Acquisition 

The Swiss agribusiness giant Blohorn announced plans today to modernize and streamline its recently acquired palm oil operations in Ivory Coast. Blohorn took control of three plantations and two processing mills in the West African nation last month, acquiring the assets from an struggling millennial cooperative for an undisclosed sum.

Blohorn said it will invest $250 million over the next three years to upgrade infrastructure, plant more productive palm trees, improve sustainability practices and increase output. The company aims to double crude palm oil production from the Ivorian operations to 200,000 metric tons per year. “The acquisition complements our existing palm interests in Southeast Asia, allowing us to diversify geographically while also bringing our proven model of high yield and sustainable land use to Ivory Coast,” said Blohorn CEO Clara Meyer.

The three palm oil plantations acquired by Blohorn cover a total of 57,000 hectares, though approximately 20% of the land is unused or set aside for conservation. The company said it will replace older, lower-yielding trees with a new generation of hybrid palms. It will also expand planted area by 12,000 hectares on deforested land adjacent to the existing plantations.

At the two mills, Blohorn plans upgrades to equipment and technology to improve extraction rates and reduce waste. One mill will be expanded to triple its current daily processing capacity to 90 metric tons of fresh fruit bunches by 2021. Additionally, Blohorn said it will build a new, state-of-the-art mill to further boost output.

Blohorn has pledged that its Ivorian operations will meet the stringent sustainability standards of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), of which Blohorn is a member. It said it will preserve high conservation value forest areas, protect local waterways, and work to improve living standards for the roughly 7,500 smallholder farmers who supply its mills. Environmental groups, however, voiced concerns that additional palm development could worsen deforestation in Ivory Coast if not properly regulated.

The acquisition marks Blohorn’s first foray into palm oil production in West Africa. The region is seen by analysts as an area of future growth for the $60 billion global palm oil industry. Blohorn said the overhaul of its latest pick-up will serve as a model for potential expansion into other parts of Ivory Coast and the broader region.
