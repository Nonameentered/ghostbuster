Ivorian Cocoa Exports Decrease Due to Lack of Storage Space, Upcountry Stocks Rise   

Cocoa exports from Côte d’Ivoire, the world's largest producer, fell in August due to a shortage of storage space for beans at ports. Meanwhile, upcountry cocoa stores reported increasing stockpiles at collection centers across the country.

Exports declined 1% to 165,825 metric tons from 167,721 tons in July, according to figures reported by the Coffee Cocoa Council. The total value of cocoa exports from Abidjan fell 4% to 238 billion CFA francs ($414.5 million) from 248 billion CFA francs in July.

The drop in exports comes at a time when warehouses at ports in San Pedro and Abidjan, the commercial capital, are full of cocoa beans waiting to be shipped. A lack of storage space at ports for new beans was cited as the main reason for the export decrease. Upcountry warehouses and cocoa cooperatives, however, have seen inventory levels increase as farmers continue bringing in their harvests. 

Without sufficient storage and capacity to load new shipments, the Ivorian Marketing Board has delayed additional purchases from farmers and cooperatives. The bottleneck at ports threatens to interrupt the flow of cocoa beans from farms to international markets. Port operators are racing to free up additional warehouse space and improve loading capacity to handle the large volumes of beans collected during the peak harvest season.

The issue of limited storage at ports is not new and port authorities have pledged to build additional warehouses over the coming years. However, lack of funding and other economic challenges have delayed many of these infrastructure projects. In the meantime, temporary storage solutions are being used but still fall short of the volume of cocoa passing through ports during the harvest season from October to March.

Industry experts warn that continued congestion at ports could hamper Côte d'Ivoire's cocoa output growth and disrupt global cocoa supplies. Côte d'Ivoire produces more than 40% of the world's cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate. Any disruptions to the flow of beans from the country can cause price volatility on world markets.

The government recently revised its cocoa production forecast for the new season downward by over 4% to 2.1 million tons, citing the impact of port congestion and disease pressures. Côte d'Ivoire is poised to remain the top cocoa producer globally, but its dominance could be challenged without continued investments to boost processing capacity and quality.

Despite a slight drop in exports this month, Côte d'Ivoire shipped a total of 1.45 million tons of cocoa during the 2018-2019 harvest season, up from 1.41 tons the previous year. While a record year, congestion issues prevented even higher export volumes. The Coffee Cocoa Council reported total cocoa export revenues of 2.72 trillion CFA francs for the 2018-2019 season, a nearly 5% increase from last year.
