Ivory Coast hosts talks to fine-tune cocoa sector reforms and address quality concerns

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast aims to further streamline the cocoa sector and tackle concerns about quality at talks this week with the cocoa industry, regulators, exporters and others, seeking to maintain its position as the world's top producer. 

The West African country will host representatives from industry bodies, chocolate makers, exporters and others on Nov 21-22 in the commercial capital Abidjan to discuss how to strengthen a sector reform programme launched two years ago.

The world's top cocoa producer introduced sweeping reforms in the 2017/18 season aimed at improving traceability, curbing smuggling and raising quality. But there have been challenges in implementing some measures and concerns about declining quality.

"This meeting will provide an opportunity to assess progress of the implementation of reforms and propose improvements to tighten regulatory control of the sector," said Massandje Toure-Litsé, director general of Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa board, which is overseeing the reforms.

Exporters have said some new procedures for certifying cocoa as high-quality have caused delays. Chocolate makers have reported that some recent Ivorian shipments contained mouldy beans. The government will reiterate its goals of producing more higher-quality cocoa and discuss ways to improve the certification and traceability process, Toure-Litsé said. 

Ivory Coast produces around 40% of the world's cocoa, but has struggled for years with swooning global prices, ageing trees, lack of investment and social issues like farmer poverty and child labour. The government will also discuss with partners how to boost cocoa tree yields and farmer income.

"We want to strengthen public-private partnership to support sustainability in the sector," said Toure-Litsé.

The talks follow a sector agreement earlier this month on a minimum price for cocoa that was higher than previously expected.
