Light rains bring hope for mid-crop cocoa development in Ivory Coast 

ABIDJAN, May 15 (Reuters) - Light rains last week in most of Ivory Coast’s cocoa-growing regions have boosted hopes for the development of the April-to-September mid-crop, farmers said on Monday.

The marketing season for Ivory Coast’s mid-crop runs from April to September, with harvest peaking between July and August.

Most farmers said the patchy showers would help pods develop well if abundant rain fell over the next month. Rains were below average in the month of April, raising some concerns about the mid-crop.

"The light rains have brought us some relief. The weather is good now for the pods. We need more rain to have a good harvest in July," said Alfred Kouame, who farms near the western region of Soubre.

Farmers there said most pods were developing normally, though more rain was still needed in parts. Rains last week were also reported in the centre-western region of Daloa, the central regions of Yamoussoukro and the southern region of Divo.

"If it continues to rain very well this month, we should have a good harvest," said Maurice Kouame, another farmer in Daloa.

Some farmers however reported a slower-than-normal start to the mid-crop in the southeastern region of Abengourou, where rainfall had been delayed. Farmers there said more rain was urgently needed.

Similar comments came from farmers in the eastern region of Aboisso, and the southern region of Agboville where rains have been scarce. Cocoa development there will suffer if abundant rain does not fall quickly, they said.  

The mid-crop accounts for about 30% of Ivory Coast's total cocoa output. Good weather during the April-to-September period is essential for determining the size of the mid-crop harvest. Most farmers were optimistic if rains become heavy this month.

"There will be many pods for harvest in July if the good weather continues," said Kouame in Yamoussoukro.
