Slow Start to December Cocoa Arrivals in Ivory Coast Blamed on Crop Profile and Demand Factors  

Cocoa arrivals at ports in Ivory Coast are off to a slow start in December due to a combination of factors related to the cocoa crop profile this season as well as cocoa demand, according to industry observers. As of December 10, less than 2,000 metric tons of cocoa beans had arrived at Ivorian ports, compared with over 30,000 metric tons for the same period last year, according to port data.  

Part of the slowdown stems from the cocoa crop profile in Ivory Coast this season. The 2020/21 main crop started slowly in some regions due to intermittent rainfall earlier this year, pushing the peak of arrivals later into February and March. In addition, some regions harvested a larger mid-crop this season, reducing the number of ripe cocoa pods currently available at the start of the main crop. As a result, cocoa farmers and cooperatives in Ivory Coast do not have the same volumes of beans immediately available to sell as in previous seasons.

Demand for Ivorian cocoa has also weakened recently due to COVID-19 disruptions and uncertainty in key markets. Grindings in Europe and North America fell year on year in the third quarter as chocolate producers grappled with tighter retail conditions and closures in some distribution channels. Reduced grindings have trickled down to lower demand for cocoa beans from Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer. The December beans are usually highly sought after due to their quality, but subdued demand this year has led to price declines for forward delivery.

Industry analysts expect cocoa arrivals to pick up significantly by mid-January as the main crop peaks across more regions in Ivory Coast. Farmers will be keen to sell beans to generate cash flow ahead of the holidays, while grinders will likely have re-stocked chocolate inventory and look to purchase more beans. However, much will depend on the state of cocoa demand recovery, especially as new COVID-19 restrictions are being put in place in Western markets. Total arrivals for the 2020/21 main crop are still forecast to reach around 1.5-1.6 million metric tons, in line with the average for recent seasons.
