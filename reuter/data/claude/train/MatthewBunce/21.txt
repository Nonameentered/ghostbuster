Abrupt end to rains in Ivory Coast helps crops dry, but dampens cocoa bean export prospects

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast—The nearly month-long rains that inundated parts of Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions have come to an abrupt halt over the past week, allowing beans to dry on the trees but hampering export prospects.

Farmers and cocoa cooperatives in the world's top cocoa producer said the heavy downpours in late August and September had slowed the spread of the fungal black pod disease and boosted yields for the 2019/20 main crop. However, the rains made it difficult to properly ferment and dry beans, raising the risk of mold growth if storage conditions were not properly maintained. 

"The rains helped the trees and pods develop well but now we need sun and heat to have good drying," said Felix Kouassi, who farms 4 hectares of cocoa near Daloa.

Most farmers dry beans in the sun by spreading them on wooden trays or mats in front of their houses. The process can take up to two weeks and helps develop the chocolatey flavor. If beans do not dry properly, they can become unusable.

Exporters said any issues around bean quality or drying could hamper shipments from the world's top producer in the coming weeks. Port arrivals are running slightly below the year-ago levels, according to data from the cocoa regulator.

"There is a risk that some beans have not been dried fully given the rainfall. We expect a peak in arrivals soon so quality will be closely watched,” said a cocoa exporter based in San Pedro.

Overall, however, most farmers and exporters said they expected a strong harvest this season. The heavy rains, coupled with new hybrid tree varieties and fertilizer, have created ideal growing conditions. The marketing board on Friday kept its forecast for the 2019/20 season unchanged at between 2 to 2.05 million tonnes.

The harvest in Ivory Coast will help determine cocoa prices and shape the global cocoa market in the coming year. Harvests from Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, are also shaping up well, pointing to an adequately supplied world market into 2020.
