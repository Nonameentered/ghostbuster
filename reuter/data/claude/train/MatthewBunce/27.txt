Chad's Cotton Monopoly Sees Rise in Output and Processing Capacity Thanks to Higher World Prices and New Markets

The Cotontchad monopoly that controls Chad's cotton industry is ramping up production and processing capacity to take advantage of higher world cotton prices and new export markets. Cotontchad announced plans this week to increase Chad's cotton cultivation area by 20% over the next 3 years and double ginning capacity to process the additional cotton. 

Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world but cotton is its most important export crop, accounting for around half of export earnings. Cotontchad was formed in 2018 when Chad's government took full control of the cotton industry and granted an exclusive concession to the state-owned enterprise to manage the entire cotton value chain in the country. The move aimed to boost cotton production and government revenue from the sector.

After two years of flat output, Cotontchad is now looking to significantly expand production and ginning capacity to capitalize on stronger global cotton prices and new buyers in Asia and domestically in Africa. Cotton prices have risen more than 30% from their lows in 2019 and are at multi-year highs due to rising demand and supply constraints in major producing countries. At the same time, Cotontchad has attracted new buyers in Vietnam, Cambodia and Ethiopia, giving it more opportunities to sell Chad's high-quality cotton.

Cotontchad plans to increase cultivated land from 220,000 hectares today to 265,000 hectares by 2023 through allocation of new land to farmers and improvements in agricultural techniques. It will also build three new modern gins that will increase ginning capacity from 220,000 bales to 440,000 bales per year. The additional ginning capacity will allow Cotontchad to handle the increased volumes from higher plantation sizes without compromising quality, according to its CEO Moussa Faki.
