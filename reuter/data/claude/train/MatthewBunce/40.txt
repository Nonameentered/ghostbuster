Ivory Coast's 1996/97 Coffee Season: High Volume, Poor Quality & Sluggish Marketing  

Record rainfall across Ivory Coast's coffee-growing regions led to significantly higher coffee yields for the 1996/97 growing season. However, problems with quality control and marketing have prevented farmers and exporters from capitalizing on the high volume. 

Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, is also West Africa's largest coffee grower. The country's main coffee harvest runs from October to January. This season, rainfall through most of the growing regions was well above average, resulting in a crop size estimated to be up by as much as 25-30% from the previous season according to the Coffee-Cocoa Council.

The increased volume could have helped Ivory Coast boost its position in the global coffee market. However, the lack of proper pruning, harvesting, and processing of the coffee cherries led to a harvest of generally poor quality. As a result, much of the crop comprised lower-value filler-grade or 'ordinary' coffees rather than the premium-grade 'prime washed' coffees that command the highest prices. The fillers and ordinary grades are mostly sold to soluble coffee producers, resulting in far lower prices for farmers and exporters.

In addition to the issues with quality, Ivory Coast's coffee market has slowed down considerably in recent years due to oversupply and competition from other growing origins. Many farmers have abandoned their coffee plantations due to low margins and income. Those that have continued have seen the prices they receive drop by 50-70% over the past decade. This sluggish marketing, combined with the poor quality of this year's large harvest, means that coffee farmers and exporters in Ivory Coast are unlikely to benefit much financially despite the increased volume.  

The problems highlight the need for Ivory Coast to reinvest in its coffee sector to improve yields, quality, and marketing if it hopes to remain competitive on global coffee markets in the coming years. Investments in agricultural extensions, training on proper harvesting and processing methods, and targeted marketing campaigns to promote exports of premium washed coffees could help revive the country's coffee industry and bring greater economic benefits to farmers and exporters. Without such efforts, Ivory Coast's bumper coffee crop this season may signify high volume but little else.
