Ivory Coast to Release Liberalisation Study on Quality and Competition by January 31

The government of Ivory Coast announced today that it will release a comprehensive study on liberalizing its telecommunications sector by January 31. The study will analyze the current state of competition and service quality in the West African nation's telecom market and provide recommendations for opening up the sector to new players.

Ivory Coast currently has two main mobile operators, MTN Cote d'Ivoire and Moov Cote d'Ivoire, which are subsidiaries of South Africa's MTN Group and Morocco's Maroc Telecom respectively. These operators have faced criticism over high prices for consumers and limited reach in rural areas. The new liberalization study is aimed at boosting competition, improving network coverage, and driving down costs for customers in Ivory Coast.

"Our government is fully committed to enhancing access to affordable and high-quality telecommunications services for all Ivorians," said Minister of Digital Economy and Post Bruno Kone. "By opening up the telecom sector to new entrants, we aim to spur investments, foster innovation, and give customers more choice and value."

According to the study's terms of reference, it will evaluate the country's existing policy and regulatory frameworks for telecoms and map out the steps required to introduce additional mobile operators, infrastructure providers, and virtual network operators. The study is being conducted by London-based consultancy Analysys Mason and funded by the World Bank. Recommendations from the study may include amending licensing rules, setting spectrum allocation policies, and establishing an independent regulator.

Ivory Coast has a population of nearly 25 million people, but mobile phone and internet penetration rates remain below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The two incumbent operators have invested over $3 billion in network infrastructure over the past decade, but large parts of the country still lack adequate coverage, especially in rural and remote areas. Liberalizing the telecom market is seen as a key step to bridging the digital divide and achieving the government's goal of nationwide broadband access by 2025.
