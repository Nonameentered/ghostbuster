Chad Holds Fourth Round of Chaotic Parliamentary Elections Amidst Low Voter Turnout and Fraud Allegations 

Chad held the fourth round of parliamentary elections on Sunday amid chaos, low voter turnout, and widespread allegations of fraud. The elections have been marked by disorganization, lack of polling staff and materials, and voter intimidation according to election observers and opposition leaders.

The fourth round of voting was scheduled for 33 constituencies across Chad's southern regions. However, many polling stations failed to open at all, while others lacked critical materials like ballot papers, boxes, and voter rolls. Poll workers did not show up to staff some locations. The Chadian High Independent National Elections Commission (CENI) admitted to challenges in deploying staff and logistics.

Opposition leaders have criticized the CENI's handling of the elections, citing irregularities like inconsistent counting practices, lack of privacy in voting, and instances of outright voter fraud. "CENI is not ready to organize credible, transparent and democratic elections," said Cyriaque Bayala, spokesman for the opposition coalition Istikal Cho. Other observers reported seeing underage voting and instances of one person voting multiple times.

Voter turnout was low, estimated under 10% in some areas. Opposition groups called for voter boycotts and protests leading up to election day, citing concerns over fair process and lack of an independent election overseer. The ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement has dominated Chad's politics since 1990 and President Idriss DÃ©by holds nearly authoritarian power. Deby previously lifted term limits in order to extend his own decades-long rule.

The chaotic elections and fraud allegations threaten to further undermine the credibility of Chad's government on the world stage. Major opposition leaders have called for the election results to be annulled and a new independent election commission established before any redo of the vote. However, the CENI insisted it will address "challenges" from the fourth round and proceed to organizing the remaining rounds of elections in the coming months. As it stands, the parliamentary elections appear unlikely to strengthen democracy or political freedoms in Chad.
