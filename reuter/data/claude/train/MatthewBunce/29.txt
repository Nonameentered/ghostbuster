Chad's Foreign Minister Defends Policy of Summarily Executing Alleged Criminals

The foreign minister of Chad this week defended his government's policy of summarily executing individuals accused of crimes in the African nation. In a defiant speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Cherif Mahamat Zene said the executions of more than 50 accused criminals this year were necessary to curb rising crime and insecurity in Chad.

"We make no apologies for our policy," Zene told assembled diplomats and rights groups representatives. "Our duty is to protect the Chadian people, and swift justice is the only justice criminals understand."  Zene said executions have declined in Chad, down from over 100 in previous years, but more needs to be done. He called on other African nations to follow Chad's lead to "regain control of law and order."

The remarks were immediately condemned by human rights groups, who called the extrajudicial killings "unconscionable acts that violate international law."Amnesty International said there is no evidence to suggest the summary executions have reduced crime in Chad. "This is a misguided policy based on fear and intimidation, not evidence," said Amnesty's Africa Director Joan Nyanyuki. The United Nations itself has called on Chad to impose an immediate moratorium on executions and review all death penalty cases to ensure fair trials. 

Zene dismissed the criticism, saying groups like Amnesty and the UN "do not have to deal with the daily reality of criminals terrorizing our population." He said armed robbers, murderers and rapists deserve "swift and uncompromising justice" not long trials and prison sentences. The minister claimed some Chadian judges take bribes to release criminals, necessitating direct action. "Our justice system has its flaws, so the executive must step in at times," Zene said.
