Slow Buying and Variable Quality Reported as Ivory Coast's 1996/97 Coffee Season Begins  

The Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee season is off to a slow start, according to exporters and cooperative representatives in Abidjan. While the harvest began in October in most regions, buying activity has been limited thus far and the quality of arrivals has been variable.   

The sluggish start to the season reflects overall weakness in the coffee market due to ample supplies and sluggish demand. The International Coffee Organization's composite price fell to a 21-month low of $1.05 per pound in September. Roasters have bought ahead and are working from existing inventories, limiting their need to make new purchases. As a result, only about 15-20 percent of the crop has been bought so far, compared to 30-40 percent at this time in a more typical season.

The quality of new crop beans has also posed a challenge, with some lots showing high moisture content, immature beans and the presence of the fungus known as potato taste defect. However, cooperatives report the quality of pickings has improved in recent weeks with the arrival of sunny weather. "High quality lots with good preparation that show a ripe, fruity profile are still finding interested buyers, even in this market," said one exporter. 

 growers remain hopeful that the season will strengthen through February and March, which are peak harvesting months for Ivory Coast cocoa. If demand improves, it could help bolster coffee prices and spur more active buying. But much will depend on broader market forces, as an weak Brazilian Real, rising Colombian output and macroeconomic trends weigh on coffee futures.

Total production for 1996/97 is forecast at 2.8 million bags, according to the USDA. While slightly below the year before, this would be an ample supply given the high buffer stocks currently held by producers. The government's target price for the season is CFAF 950/kg, up from CFAF 900/kg the prior season, but some private buyers foresee the potential for prices to drift lower through the coming months in the absence of a significant market rally or uptick in demand. Overall, Ivory Coast continues to face competitive pressures and economic difficulties that pose challenges for its coffee sector over the longer term. The coming months will be crucial in determining how much momentum this season is ultimately able to gain.
