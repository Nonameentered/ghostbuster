African Robusta Producers to Meet and Discuss Export Limit Quotas After World Agreement in Rio de Janeiro  

Representatives from the major robusta coffee-producing countries in Central and West Africa are gathering this week in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to determine national export quotas following the landmark international coffee agreement reached last month in Rio de Janeiro. The agreement sets voluntary limits on robusta exports for the next five years in an effort to stabilize global coffee prices, which have declined sharply in recent months due to oversupply concerns.

The African group, which accounts for more than 60% of the worldâ€™s robusta coffee production, must now decide how to allocate the export limits among its members, including top producers like Ivory Coast, Uganda, and Cameroon. The national quotas are meant to scale back robusta exports by around 10% compared to 2019 levels, in line with the overall target set in Rio. However, there are disagreements on how much each country should cut back, with smaller producers arguing that the limits should not reduce their already small export volumes.  

"These negotiations will not be easy, but we must come to an equitable solution if we want to rebalance the robusta market and safeguard the livelihoods of our farmers," said Martin Kouakou, President of the Ivorian Coffee-Cacao Council, as he opened the meeting. Robusta prices fell over 25% last year due to large harvests in Vietnam and Brazil, the two leading coffee producers. The lower prices have reduced incomes for the over 25 million smallholder farmers worldwide who depend on coffee.

The robusta variety, used primarily to produce instant coffee and espresso blends, is grown predominantly in Africa, Asia, and Brazil. It accounts for about 40% of global coffee production. Under the Rio agreement, robusta and arabica coffee producers alike committed to short-term supply management measures to stabilize prices, in addition to new programs for crop diversification, market transparency, and research on resilience to climate change. The hope is that steadier prices will make coffee farming economically sustainable and attract young farmers back to the sector.  

Observers expect further discussions will be needed to overcome divisions at the Abidjan meeting, but there is optimism that a compromise can be reached, given the cooperation already achieved in Rio under the auspices of the International Coffee Organization. An announcement on the African robusta export limits is anticipated by the end of the week.
