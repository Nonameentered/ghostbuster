Ivorian Cocoa Arrivals Pick Up in Early January,  but Still Down from Last Year

Cocoa arrivals at ports in top grower Ivory Coast picked up early this month but are still running below last year’s levels, exporters said on Thursday.

Ivory Coast, which vies with Ghana as the world’s largest cocoa producer, accounts for about 40% of global cocoa supply. Its continued harvesting will shape how well the overall 2021/22 crop measures up against last season.

As of Jan. 9, about 50,000 tonnes of beans had been delivered to Abidjan port, one of the world’s largest cocoa hubs, since the start of 2022. That’s up from around 30,000 tonnes in the whole of December but still below the more than 60,000 tonnes at the same point last year, the exporters said. 

Weather conditions have been mixed in recent months. Heavy rains in some areas raised fears of disease but also boosted pod growth, while dry weather in other regions aided the spread of pod disease. Exporters said more rain is now needed in western regions to support pod development.

“For the rest of the month, we expect arrivals to continue increasing if there is enough rainfall and no significant disease issues,” said one Abidjan-based exporter, adding that deliveries could rise to 80,000 tonnes for January.

Total arrivals up to the end of December were around 690,000 tonnes, nearly 70,000 tonnes below the same period last season, according to ports data. Some private analysis, however, suggests the harvest could still finish on par with last year.

Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council maintained its forecast for national production to fall 5% from 2020/21 to around 2 million tonnes. But revenues will get a lift from higher global prices, meaning overall cocoa earnings should remain similar this season, the council has said.

As of Jan. 10, March cocoa futures on ICE Futures U.S. were trading around $2,592 per tonne, up more than 6% since the start of the year. The increase came despite expectations for a global surplus in the 2021/22 season.  

Certified warehouses held 233,122 tonnes of Ivorian cocoa as of Jan. 3, 5% down from 252,564 tonnes the same time last year, ICE data showed.

The drop in warehouse stocks reflects lower volumes at Ivorian ports, but also more regular shipping activity as COVID-19-related logistical difficulties have eased compared with early 2021.
 The 2021/22 season opened on Oct. 1 in Ivory Coast and will run through the end of September.
