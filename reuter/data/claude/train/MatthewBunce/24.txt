Chad Holds Parliamentary Elections After Much Delay Amid Hopes for Democratic Reforms and Oil Development 

The central African nation of Chad held parliamentary elections this weekend after several years of delays. The elections are seen as a test of Chad's democratic transition after decades of authoritarian rule. 

Chad's long-time president Idriss Déby took power in a coup in 1990 and has dominated politics ever since. His party and its allies won handily in every election. However, in recent years Déby has faced mounting pressure to implement democratic reforms, including from western nations like France and the United States that support his fight against Islamist extremists in the region.

In 2018, Déby surprised the country by announcing that long-delayed parliamentary elections would finally take place in order "strengthen our democratic institutions." The elections were postponed multiple times since then, but Déby insisted they must be held before the end of 2019. Nearly 7 million citizens were registered to vote for the country's 188 members of parliament.

While Déby's party is still expected to maintain control, opposition leaders hope to gain seats and end the total dominance of the ruling party. "We want a real voice in government for the first time," said Max Loalngar, leader of an opposition coalition. However, opposition groups allege the government is intimidating voters and doubt the elections will be free and fair.

The parliamentary elections also come at a pivotal moment for Chad's economy. Chad is a major oil producer, but low oil prices and aging oil fields have caused production to decline in recent years. Chad had to restructure billions in oil-backed loans from Glencore and other creditors to avoid defaulting. The government hopes new foreign investment in the energy sector will boost production and provide much-needed revenue.

Despite its oil wealth, Chad remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Most of the population relies on subsistence farming. The parliamentary elections are seen as an important step toward strengthening Chad's democratic institutions, fighting corruption, and ensuring more economic opportunity and prosperity for its citizens. However, much will depend on whether opposition groups deem the elections credible and on Déby's willingness to continue opening Chad's political system after decades of authoritarian control.
