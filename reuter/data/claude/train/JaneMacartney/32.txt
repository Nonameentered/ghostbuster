Hollywood Stars Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford Among 50 People Barred from Visiting Tibet 

Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford were among 50 people banned by Chinese authorities from visiting Tibet due to their “anti-China” stance, according to a list published by Chinese state media this week. The actors joined other politicians, activists, and journalists on a list of people unwelcome in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

According to the Tibet Daily, an official Communist Party newspaper, the 50 people on the list “have engaged in anti-China separatist activities and words and deeds that undermine Tibet's stability and harmony.” The newspaper warned travel agencies in Tibet not to arrange trips for anyone on the list. While foreign tourists are allowed to visit Tibet with the proper permits, authorities closely monitor visitors and limit access for some, especially journalists and politicians.

Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford have not commented publicly on the ban. However, both actors are supporters of the Tibetan independence movement and have met with exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers a separatist. In 1997, Brad Pitt traveled to Dharamshala, India where the Dalai Lama lives in exile and has supported organizations that aim to promote human rights and protect Tibetan culture. Harrison Ford met the Dalai Lama in 1990 at his residence in Dharamshala.

Human rights groups condemned China's action, calling it a violation of civil liberties and an attempt to silence dissent. "Banning influential individuals from visiting Tibet is a typical CCP tactic to control information and narrative about the situation in Tibet," said John Jones, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. Exiled Tibetan groups argue that Beijing has severely restricted religious and political freedoms in Tibet. However, China argues that Tibet has been part of China for centuries and its authoritarian policies have led to greater economic development in one of the country's poorest regions.

In response to the news, representatives for Pitt and Ford declined to comment. The actors join other high-profile individuals banned from entering China's territory, including pop artist Bjork who shouted "Tibet! Tibet!" at the end of a 2008 concert in Shanghai and actor Richard Gere who is a prominent advocate for Tibetan independence. The Chinese government's "blacklist" is seen as a warning to Western celebrities and politicians against speaking out on sensitive issues like Tibet that challenge Beijing's authority.
