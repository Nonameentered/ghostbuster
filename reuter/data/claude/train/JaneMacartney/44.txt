China launches manhunt for culprits of Christmas Day bomb in Tibet 

Chinese authorities have launched a massive manhunt for those responsible for detonating a bomb in the Tibetan capital Lhasa on Christmas Day. The bomb exploded at a popular open-air market, killing at least 15 people and injuring over 50. The majority of victims were Han Chinese migrant workers and tourists.

The bomb blast comes at a time of rising tensions between Tibetans and Han Chinese, who have been migrating to Tibet in large numbers. Many Tibetans feel resentful and threatened by the influx of Han migrants and the erosion of their traditional culture. However, no group has yet claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day attack. 

According to eyewitnesses, the bomb was placed in a stall selling handcrafted goods at the bustling Barkhor Street market. The market is located in the heart of Lhasa's old city and is popular with both locals and tourists. The explosion caused chaos as people fled the busy market in panic. "There were bodies and blood everywhere, it was horrible," said one eyewitness. "The blast was very powerful and the fire spread quickly."

Police have sealed off the area as forensics teams comb through the rubble. Meanwhile, the authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to find the perpetrators. House-to-house searches are being conducted and public transport in and out of Lhasa has been halted. Officials claim "significant progress" is being made in identifying suspects but have not yet announced any arrests.

The bombing is the worst attack in Lhasa in recent years and marks an escalation of tensions that have been simmering below the surface. While Easter is not traditionally celebrated in Tibet, Christmas has become popular among the large Christian minority of Han Chinese residents. The timing of the attack on Christmas Day is thought to be symbolic.

Many young Tibetans believe non-violent resistance has failed and are turning to more radical forms of protest against Beijing's control over their homeland. Pamphlets celebrating the bombing as a "righteous blow against Chinese imperialism" have appeared in Lhasa, though no group has officially claimed responsibility for distributing them. The Chinese government is attempting to seize control of public opinion by restricting travel to Lhasa, cutting access to social media and threatening those spreading "false information." However, under the heavy hand of repression and surveillance, the threat of further ethnic conflict looms large over the city. More violence may be brewing as China seeks to tighten its grip on Tibet.
