China Accuses Politics of Holding Up Entry to WTO

China has accused Western nations of unfair "political discrimination" by blocking its entry into the World Trade Organization. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, China's trade minister Zhong Shan said "certain countries" were preventing China from joining the WTO for political rather than economic reasons. "They are afraid of China's rise and are using the WTO entry criteria as an excuse to block us," Zhong said.

China has been trying to join the WTO, which sets rules for international trade and commerce, for nearly 15 years. But China's bid has been vetoed on several occasions by the United States, which argues China needs to make significant economic reforms to its state-run economy and address issues like intellectual property rights enforcement before it can join. The European Union has also expressed concerns over Chinese subsidies to exporters and barriers to foreign companies operating in China.

In a direct reference to the US, Zhong said: "One country in particular should not be allowed to dictate the economic future of the entire world based on its own geopolitical ambitions." He said China has already made major concessions by agreeing to open up its economy to foreign investment and reducing tariffs on key goods and services. "We have addressed almost all the reasonable concerns that have been raised. There are no more excuses left to deny us entry into the WTO."

Supporters argue that allowing China into the WTO will encourage further economic liberalization and create new trade opportunities. But critics say China's non-market policies mean it does not yet meet the standards to join the rules-based global trading system. The impasse is a major source of tension in US-China relations and is unlikely to be resolved until there are signs China will fundamentally change its approach to trade and industrial policy. Both sides are expected to debate the issue further at the WTO's next ministerial conference in Seattle next month.
