China's Economic Growth to Accelerate in 1997 Ahead of Crucial Communist Party Congress, Warns of Rising Joblessness and Inflation 

China's economy is projected to accelerate in 1997 as the government pumps up growth ahead of a crucial Communist Party Congress next year. However, officials warned that the rapid pace of expansion could exacerbate rising unemployment and inflationary pressures.

The economy grew 9.6% last year, up from 9.5% in 1995, according to government figures released today. Growth is expected to rise to 10% this year, officials said. The robust growth has been fueled by higher government spending, particularly on infrastructure, as well as strong exports and private consumption. 

The pickup in economic activity comes ahead of the 15th Congress of the Communist Party next autumn, where new leaders will be selected and economic and political reforms addressed. Maintaining fast growth and social stability has been a priority for current leaders. The quickened expansion, however, risks higher inflation and job losses as inefficient state industries are restructured, officials cautioned.

Consumer price inflation rose to 8.3% last year and is projected to increase further to 10% in 1997, above the government's target rate. Prices for food and housing have been increasing steadily. The surge in inflation could squeeze household spending and economic growth.

Meanwhile, unemployment climbed to 3.8% of the urban workforce last year and 4 million jobs were lost at state enterprises. The labor minister warned that 10 million or more industrial workers could lose their jobs in the next five years as reforms accelerate. Protests and unrest have already increased in some areas as people have lost their livelihoods.

The government announced a pledge to boost spending and bank lending to enterprises in order to spur growth and support employment. New restrictions will also be placed on layoffs. Economists, however, said these short-term measures may exacerbate existing economic imbalances if more painful reforms are not implemented. 

"Robust growth this year is important for political reasons but the government cannot ignore the risks of rising imbalances and future instability," said Chen Xiao, an economist at Beijing University. "Inflation and unemployment are challenges that must be addressed through further liberalizing reforms, not temporary stimulus measures."

Overall, China's economy remains in a position of strength with growth still the envy of major nations. But officials appear to be walking a political tightrope to balance healthy expansion and taming risks that could rupture social stability. The course of economic reforms after the leadership transition next year will be closely watched, experts said.
