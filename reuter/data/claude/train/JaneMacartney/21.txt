Chinese Democracy Activist Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison for Plotting to Subvert the Government

Wang Wei, a long-time Chinese pro-democracy activist, was sentenced to 11 years in prison today by a court in southeastern China for "subversion of state power." According to the court's sentence, Wang, 56, was found guilty of organizing anti-government protests and training activists to subvert state power and overthrow the Communist regime. Wang has previously served a total of 12 years in prison for previous activism and protest activities. 

Wang's closed-door trial and harsh sentence are the latest signs of tightening controls on political dissent under President Xi Jinping. Human rights groups condemned the sentencing and called for Wang's immediate release. "This shameful prosecution shows that peaceful activists in China engaging in entirely lawful speech or assembly continue to face severe repression from the government," said William Nee from Amnesty International's China office.

Wang's troubles began in late 2019 when he attempted to organize gatherings to mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. According to friends, Wang called for demonstrations in major cities to "honor the martyrs" of the 1989 protests. He reportedly connected with activists online and held small meetings to plan the gatherings. Police detained Wang in February 2020 and charged him with "subversion of state power." No public protests actually took place as a result of Wang's planning.

Wang's supporters argue that his calls for peaceful protest should be protected as freedom of speech and assembly, guaranteed in China's own constitution. But the Communist Party views any attempts to organize opposition to its rule as threats to its control and banned such activities long ago. "The Chinese government remains deeply fearful of any form of dissent or popular unrest that it cannot stage-manage," said Maya Wang, Senior China Researcher at Human Rights Watch.

The harsh sentencing of Wang Wei fits with a broader crackdown on dissent under President Xi, who has overseen a wide-ranging campaign to purge the Communist Party of perceived political threats. Scores of human rights lawyers, student activists and other dissidents have been imprisoned under Xi. The government has also imposed heavy censorship and surveillance to smother political debate and unrest.
