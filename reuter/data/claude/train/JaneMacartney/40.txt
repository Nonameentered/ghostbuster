China and Russia Strengthen Ties to Counteract US Influence, But No Major Alliance Yet  

The presidents of China and Russia met this week for the third time this year, highlighting the fast-strengthening partnership between these two powerful nations. Despite Chinese and Russian leaders pledging to work together on a number of issues and counteracting Western and US influence, the two sides stopped short of forming a more meaningful military and political alliance.

"China and Russia, as comprehensive strategic partners of coordination, are deepening political mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation, supporting each other on issues concerning core interests, and positively cooperating in international affairs," said Chinese President Xi Jinping after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing. The talks covered trade, economics, energy, technology cooperation, and military coordination. 

The US has closely watched the growing proximity between China and Russia. US State Department officials have expressed concern that cooperation could undermine the rules-based international order and western democratic values on human rights and civil liberties. The recent US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty has also spurred China and Russia to align more closely on arms control and geopolitical issues.

Russia and China, however, both still value their political and economic independence. An official alliance could compromise their flexibility and constrain strategic options. Disagreements also persist on interests in the Arctic, political influence in Central Asia, and the deepening economic interdependence between Russia and European countries like Germany. 

"Despite the supportive political rhetoric, China and Russia will avoid a formal alliance," said Dr. Marina Henke, an expert on Sino-Russian relations. "Both sides cherish their strategic independence and see limited value in an alliance treaty. Instead, they will expand their practical cooperation using existing mechanisms."

Trade and energy ties remain central to the China-Russia partnership. Bilateral trade has increased over 25% in recent years, now exceeding $100 billion annually. China is also Russia’s largest crude oil export market and the two sides have signed multiple deals for China to invest in Russia’s oil and gas industry.Cooperation on 5G networks, artificial intelligence, space exploration, and military exercises have all accelerated over the past year.
While stopping short of an alliance for now, both President Xi and President Putin aim to demonstrate the success of authoritarian governance models as alternatives to Western liberal democracy. Closer China-Russia cooperation serves to balance US global influence and power as China and the US remain locked in a prolonged trade war with geopolitical consequences.
