Desperation and Violence Rise in Tibet as Largest Bomb Blast Rocks Region

By Your Assistant

The troubled region of Tibet in western China was rocked by deadly violence again yesterday as a powerful bomb exploded at a government office building in the capital Lhasa, killing at least 12 people and injuring over 50 others. Chinese authorities claimed the blast was caused by a gas leak, but Tibetan activists in exile said it was a bomb targeting government officials arriving for a meeting and marked a dangerous turn towards more violent resistance. The explosion from inside the five-story building was large enough to shatter nearby windows and send plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky above the city.   

Tibet has been the site of periodic unrest and violent crackdowns by Chinese security forces in recent decades as Beijing exerts control over the area. Tibetans accuse the Chinese government of repressing their religious freedom and restricting their traditional culture and way of life. In 2008, protests erupted into violent riots that spread through Lhasa and beyond, resulting in harsh reprisals by authorities.  Since then, over 150 Tibetans have self-immolated in protest of Chinese rule. Activists claim the bombing yesterday marks the start of a new phase of violent resistance in response to increasingly repressive policies that restrict even basic civil liberties. 

“Tibetans feel they have no choice left but to take up arms against the Chinese regime that is hell-bent on annihilating their civilization,” said Tenzin Tsundue, a prominent Tibetan writer and activist living in exile in India. “Peaceful protest has failed. Non-violent civil disobedience has failed. only option left is armed rebellion.” However, Chinese authorities rejected such claims and reiterated their position that Tibet has always been a part of China. "Any attempt to split the country is doomed to fail," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianchang.

The status of Tibet remains a controversial geopolitical issue. Tibet was once an independent kingdom but came under Chinese control following an invasion in 1950. China claims sovereignty over Tibet, but many Tibetans dispute this and have long claimed independence. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, fled to India during the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule and established the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamshala. The bombing is certain to intensify the already hardened positions on both sides of the conflict and make any meaningful dialogue or progress on Tibetan autonomy increasingly unlikely. The question remains how far China will go to exert control in Tibet and whether more bloodshed is inevitable as desperation rises.
