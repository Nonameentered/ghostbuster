China Places Large Investment Trust Under Administrative Custody Amid Real Estate Losses, More to Follow

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) announced today that it has taken control of a major investment trust company amid steep losses in the country's real estate sector. The CBIRC has placed Anbang Trust, which manages over $100 billion in assets, under "administrative custody" for at least one year. 

The move highlights the growing risks from China's indebted property developers and the threat of contagion across the country's financial system. Regulators are concerned that Anbang Trust's large exposure to struggling real estate companies could lead to defaults that spread to other trusts, banks, and investors. By taking control of Anbang Trust, regulators aim to restructure its investments, cut risk, and prevent a disorderly collapse.

Anbang Trust is part of the Anbang Insurance Group, a major Chinese conglomerate that owns insurers, banks, and asset managers. Anbang Trust operates as an investment fund, pooling money from wealthy individuals and institutions to invest in real estate projects, stocks, bonds, and other assets. It has invested heavily in Chinese property developers, many of which are now strapped for cash after Beijing tightened restrictions on borrowing.

Regulators have been scrutinizing Anbang Trust and other investment trusts this year amid warnings about the risks of shadow banking in China's financial system. Trusts like Anbang play a similar role to banks but with less regulatory oversight. The CBIRC said today it found "major risk control problems" at Anbang Trust related to investments in struggling real estate firms. 

By taking control of Anbang Trust, the CBIRC can now dismantle risky investments in an orderly way and require the trust to holdings more liquid assets like government bonds. However, restructuring will likely lead to losses for investors and mark-downs on the value of trust assets. The CBIRC said investors may face "short-term fluctuations" but that administrative custody was needed to prevent bigger problems down the road.
