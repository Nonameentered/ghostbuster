China exercises veto at UN for the first time in 24 years, blames Guatemala's ties with Taiwan for decision 

China has exercised its veto power at the United Nations Security Council for the first time in nearly a quarter century. China blocked the nomination of a Guatemalan diplomat to lead the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing Guatemala's ties with Taiwan as the reason for its veto.

The decision stunned diplomats and observers who have become accustomed to China's usual restraint in using its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council. China has used its veto only 10 times since 1971, compared to over 70 times by the United States and over 40 times by Russia in the same time period.

Guatemala is one of only 15 countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be a province of China, and objects to its recognition as an independent nation. China had warned Guatemala in 2018 and 2020 to cut ties with Taiwan or face political and economic consequences. When Guatemala did not relent, China followed through on its threat to use its veto.

The vetoed nominee was Eduardo Stein, a former Guatemalan vice president and foreign minister. Mr. Stein had received nine "yes" votes and two abstentions from other Council members. But China's veto results in the rejection of his nomination.

The veto elicited sharp criticism from Western countries. The US ambassador to the UN called it "retribution" and said China was "holding hostage" the functioning of the UN for political purposes. The UK and France also expressed disappointment, with some diplomats worrying it sets a worrying precedent. 

China refuted the criticism, saying its veto was "reasonable and legitimate" in defense of China's sovereignty. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said countries that wish to cooperate with China must adhere to the "One China" policyâ€”referring to China's claim over Taiwan. "This is a solemn commitment made by all countries that establish or maintain diplomatic relations with China," the spokesman said.

The nixed nomination means the post of High Commissioner will remain vacant for the foreseeable future. The decision also deals a blow to Guatemala, highlighting the political cost of its relations with Taiwan on the global stage. Guatemala now faces greater pressure to switch its allegiance to China if it wishes to influence key UN roles and appointments in the future.
