Chinese officials issue action plan to eradicate underground Catholic church, says U.S.-based church group 

The Chinese government has issued a secret plan aimed at eliminating underground Catholic churches that remain loyal to the Vatican, according to a U.S.-based Catholic organization monitoring religious persecution in China. The plan reportedly calls for church demolitions, pressure on landlords to evict congregations, and rewards for informants identifying underground church leaders.

The plan was circulated among government and Communist Party officials in several provinces in late April, according to the Cardinal Kung Foundation, a Stamford, Connecticut-based nonprofit that advocates for persecuted Catholics in China. The group said it obtained a copy of the document from a source inside China. The Chinese government's State Administration of Religious Affairs did not respond to a request for comment on the document.

The reported crackdown plan calls for the "complete demolition of underground Catholic premises, especially those located in rural areas," within the next three years, the Kung Foundation said. "Landlords leasing property to underground Catholic congregations will face heavy fines and legal sanctions to pressure them to evict church members congregating on their property," according to the document obtained by the group.

The Chinese government only recognizes Catholic churches associated with the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, which rejects the authority of the Vatican. Underground churches, also known as "house churches," remain loyal to the Pope. Estimates of the number of Catholics in China belonging to these underground churches range from 4 million to 12 million people.

"The government's ultimate aim is to eliminate the underground Catholic church in China," said Kung Foundation spokesperson Andrew Kung. The secret crackdown plan "provides the blueprint for how they intend to achieve that aim...This represents an alarming escalation of religious persecution of Catholics in China.‚Äù

Continued government crackdowns on underground worship are in line with broader human rights concerns about religious freedom and civil liberties under President Xi Jinping. The Communist Party has made it a priority to bring religious groups under its control and is suspicious of foreign religious influence. According to human rights groups, hundreds of underground Protestant churches and Buddhist temples have also been shut down in recent years.

The action plan reviewed by the Kung Foundation reportedly offers cash rewards, payments and promotions to government and party officials who are most effective in eliminating underground Catholic churches in their areas of jurisdiction. "This incentivizes officials to aggressively and unlawfully target underground Catholic premises and clergy," the Kung Foundation said. The group has requested that the United Nations take action against the Chinese government for violating religious freedom agreements.
