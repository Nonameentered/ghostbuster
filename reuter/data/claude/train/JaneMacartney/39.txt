China's Tibet region faces renewed campaign of intimidation after bomb attack and music student's sentence

Chinese authorities have launched a new crackdown in Tibet after recent unrest highlighted continued opposition to Beijing's rule in the Himalayan region. 

Two high-profile events prompted the crackdown. The first was a bomb blast last week in a government building in Garze, a Tibetan region of Sichuan province. The explosion injured two people and was followed by the suicide of a local whose home was searched by authorities in connection with the blast. The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy called the suicide "extrajudicial killing."

The second trigger was the sentencing of a Tibetan music student to five years in prison for singing a song praising the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. The student, Tashi Wangchuk, was prosecuted under a law banning advocacy for Tibetan independence. His supporters say he was jailed simply for calling for Tibetan language education.

In response to these events, Chinese officials have imposed an information blackout across much of Tibet for the past week. Mobile phones, computers, and other communications equipment in multiple Tibetan areas have been confiscated. Armed police patrols have been increased, and residents are being subjected to mandatory "re-education" sessions on following Chinese law. Travel within, into, and out of Tibet has also been tightly restricted. 

Local Chinese Communist Party leaders have accused "hostile external forces" – a code for the Dalai Lama and his supporters – of conspiring to foment unrest in parts of Tibet. But Tibetans and experts say the harsh policies and crackdowns by Chinese authorities themselves are fueling anger and opposition. The Dalai Lama has long called for genuine autonomy for Tibet under Chinese sovereignty rather than outright independence.

Despite decades of efforts by China to integrate Tibet, many Tibetans remain deeply resentful of Chinese rule and continue demanding greater freedoms to practice their Buddhist faith and celebrate their distinctive culture. The Chinese government insists that economic development in Tibet has improved living standards and that most Tibetans do not support the Dalai Lama. But its continuing harsh clampdowns call such claims into question and suggest that China's control remains tenuous.
