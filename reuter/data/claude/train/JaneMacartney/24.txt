China Insists on Developing Country Status for World Trade Organisation Membership  

China is insisting that it maintains its status as a developing country in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) despite its position as the world's second-largest economy. China joined the WTO as a developing country in 2001 but since then its economy has grown at a rapid pace and it has become a major exporter and global power.

At a WTO meeting this week, China argued that it still faces economic hardships and should keep certain privileges allowed for developing countries under the organisation's rules. The U.S. and EU pushed back on China's stance, saying it should no longer get preferential treatment based on its 2001 accession nearly two decades ago. 

Tensions have been growing between the U.S. and China over trade, tariffs, intellectual property and technology issues. Keeping developing country status at the WTO would allow China to continue getting longer time periods for implementing WTO agreements and obligations, and access certain exemptions.

China's delegation at the meeting this week argued that its economy still faces "weak development, an imbalanced economy, income gaps between rural and urban areas." The U.S. countered that China now has the world's largest middle class, second largest number of billionaires and last year landed a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. The EU also criticised China's stance, saying it has taken advantage of developing country benefits for too long based on outdated thinking.

A Chinese official responded that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to pressure China over its development status. He said China still had a long way to go to reach the level of Western developed countries and faced many economic and social challenges at home. China highlighted the abject poverty faced by tens of millions of Chinese in rural areas.

WTO rules do not specifically define what constitutes a developing country. Countries self-designate as developing or developed based on their own perceived needs and circumstances. The issue has become more controversial as large economies like China, India and others have maintained developing status but grown significantly. Critics argue this has allowed them to skirt obligations that providing level playing fields in global trade. The WTO has launched talks to review special provisions for developing countries but faces opposition from China and India.

The dispute highlights the growing tensions between Western countries and China over trade, global governance and other issues. There are concerns China is exploiting global rules and institutions established decades ago to continue benefiting from preferential treatment despite its immense economic progress and influence. China says it still deserves more time to reach the level of developed Western nations that have industrialised for over a century. The stand-off continues with no easy resolution in sight.
