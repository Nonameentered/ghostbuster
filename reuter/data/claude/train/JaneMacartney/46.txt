China's Vice Premier Calls for Urgent State Enterprise Reform to Stop Losses and Layoffs  

Beijing, China - China's Vice Premier Liu He called for urgent reform of China's inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in order to stem mounting losses and worker layoffs. Speaking at a economic forum, Liu warned that China's bloated and inefficient SOEs were increasingly uncompetitive and posed a threat to China's economic stability if left unreformed. 

China's SOEs, especially in older industries like steel, coal, and transportation, have been plagued by overcapacity and debt. Once the pillars of China's socialist economy, many SOEs now face slowing growth, heavy losses, and the need to lay off workers. The Chinese government has long called for SOE reforms but has struggled in implementation due to political concerns. Liu emphasized that China could no longer afford to delay substantive reforms.

Liu criticized SOEs for their poor coordination, unrealistic expansion goals, and weak corporate governance. He said many SOEs continue to expand capacity even as they face heavy losses and oversupply. Without reform, Liu warned, China's SOEs could require massive government bailouts and put China's state-run banking system under severe stress. There are also fears of significant worker unrest as unprofitable SOEs conduct more layoffs.

Analysts welcomed Liu's blunt warnings and calls for action but remained skeptical that China would quickly overhaul its SOEs. "The problems with China's state sector are well known but difficult to fix due to their political sensitivity," said Andrew Collier of Orient Capital Research. "It appears China's leaders are recognizing that bolder steps need to be taken, but translating that realization into concrete action will require overcoming some fierce internal opposition."

Liu has previously called for trimming excess SOE capacity, improving corporate governance, attracting private capital, and merging or shuttering unsalvageable companies. His comments at the economic forum indicate China's top leadership may now be ready to tackle SOE reforms more aggressively by starting with the largest and most troubled enterprises.

The SOE reform issue will likely factor into discussions around China's next five-year economic plan in 2020. Most analysts say substantive SOE reform, if boldly pursued, could generate new economic opportunities for China's private sector companies and boost the overall efficiency and dynamism of China's economy. But history has shown that political concerns often derail or delay meaningful changes to China's state sector. Overall, most China observers remain cautiously optimistic that China will start taking real action, albeit gradually, in overhauling its ailing SOEs.
