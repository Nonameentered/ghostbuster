Trade Ministers Close to Historic Information Technology Deal, Progress Made on Labor Standards

Trade officials from over 50 countries announced today that they are making significant progress toward finalizing a landmark trade agreement covering information technology products and services. If concluded, the agreement would be the largest trade deal of its kind, covering over $3 trillion in annual trade in IT goods and services.

Negotiations over the past week in Geneva have narrowed differences on tariffs, technology transfer, and other issues, signaling the talks may be reaching a conclusion after nearly a decade of stop-and-start discussions. “We have never been closer to achieving an agreement that will drive economic growth and benefit companies and workers around the world,” said Ambassador Susan Thompson of the United States, who leads the negotiations for the participating countries. 

In addition to tariff reductions, the agreement aims to establish common international standards on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, set rules on cross-border data flows, and prevent governments from demanding companies hand over sensitive intellectual property or trade secrets to operate in their markets. Technology companies have been strong proponents of the deal, arguing it could boost sales and provide certainty for their global operations.

However, the talks have also been controversial, with labor advocates concerned the deal may not do enough to prevent a “race to the bottom” on wages and working conditions. In recent years, technology companies have come under criticism for contracting with low-cost overseas factories where workers face poor treatment and unsafe conditions. The trade ministers acknowledged these concerns and announced new commitments on labor rights and workplace protections, though some critics argue they are still not strong enough.

“We welcome the progress on labor standards but more must be done to make them enforceable,” said Sheila Smith of the International Labor Rights Forum. “Technology should be a pathway to better lives and livelihoods, not a means for exploitation.” The trade ministers pledged to make continued progress on labor and environmental provisions as the final rounds of talks get underway.

Barring any last-minute setbacks, the trade ministers could announce a final agreement within the next three to four weeks. But all sides caution there is still more work to be done. The next round of talks will take place starting next Thursday in Ottawa, Canada. If successful, a deal would still need to be ratified by participating countries according to their domestic legislative procedures before entering into force. Supporters hope to see the initial provisions take effect as early as January 2021.
