Tibet's breathtaking beauty and booming tourism industry overshadow stinky public toilets

Tibet, known for its stunning natural scenery, snow-capped mountains, and Buddhist culture, has been attracting more and more domestic and international tourists in recent years. However, the region's booming tourism industry has put a strain on the infrastructure, including public toilets. While visitors flock to Tibet to soak in the breathtaking natural beauty, they often have to endure unpleasant experiences in dirty and malodorous public restrooms. 

Tibet welcomed a record 33.4 million tourists in 2018, up 31.5 percent from the previous year, according to statistics from the regional government. The tourism industry accounted for nearly 30 percent of Tibet's economy last year. The soaring number of visitors, especially during peak season from May to October, has exposed the lack of adequate public facilities, including toilets for the crowds. At many of Tibet's top attractions like Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, and Yamdrok Lake, the public toilets cannot handle the demand and are often poorly maintained.  

"The toilets were absolutely disgusting with no toilet paper and trash overflowing. I had to go to a hotel lobby nearby to use their bathrooms," said Mary Thompson, a tourist from the US who visited Yamdrok Lake last summer. Some visitors have complained about having to pay fees of 1 to 5 yuan (15 to 75 US cents) to use public toilets only to find them dirty and foul-smelling. For budget travelers and backpackers, these fees, though small, also add to their costs in an already expensive travel destination.

To tackle thisissue, local authorities have stepped up investments to build more public toilets and upgrade existing ones near tourist sites. They also encourage hotels, restaurants, and retailers to open their toilets to visitors for free. However, the efforts have not yet matched the increasing demand, especially during the peak tourism season and in more remote areas. Some argue that petty fees should be dropped to encourage more to use public toilets so that the frequent use can lead to better maintenance. But without adequate funding and oversight, building more free toilets may not necessarily improve their conditions and cleanliness.  

Overall, most visitors still highly rate their experience in Tibet despite some temporary setbacks like substandard toilets. "The natural scenery in Tibet was so breathtakingly beautiful that it overshadowed any issues we encountered. But authorities should continue improving infrastructure and facilities to make Tibet an all-round fantastic travel destination," said an international traveler who just came back from Tibet. With surging popularity, sustainable tourism development and better public facilities like clean toilets will be more crucial to preserve Tibet's appeal for visitors in the long run.
