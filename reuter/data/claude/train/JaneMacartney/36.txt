China Sentences Tibetan Music Expert to 18 Years in Prison for Espionage

BEIJING â€” A Tibetan music expert was sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of espionage by the Chinese government this week, human rights groups reported. The harsh sentence is the latest sign of Beijing's attempts to tighten control over Tibetan culture and limit the influence of the Dalai Lama.

Tashi Dhondup, 69, was sentenced by the Intermediate People's Court in Lhasa for allegedly providing "intelligence" to the Tibetan government in exile, which is based in Dharamshala, India. The details of the alleged espionage activities were not disclosed in the court documents. Mr. Dhondup had worked for decades to preserve traditional Tibetan music. He founded several music schools in Tibet and compiled an encyclopedia of Tibetan folk songs. His supporters say the charges against him appear to be retaliation for his efforts to promote Tibetan culture.

"This shocking sentence reflects the Chinese government'sdetermination to crush Tibetan cultural expression," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "The harsh punishment of this leading Tibetan cultural figure shows Beijing's lack of tolerance for those it perceives as threatening its sovereignty." 

Tashi Dhondup was detained by security forces in April 2018, on his way to visit students at a music school he had helped establish. He was held incommunicado for months and severely tortured, according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. The organization said his body showed signs of beatings, burns, and other forms of abuse. At his trial in January, Mr. Dhondup stated that he was forced to confess under duress, but the court ignored his claims.

The Chinese government has intensified its crackdown on Tibetan activists and intellectuals in recent years. In 2015, Beijing took full control of Larung Gar, the largest Tibetan Buddhist institute, and expelled thousands of monks and nuns. Prominent writers, bloggers, and cultural figures have been detained and imprisoned. The Dalai Lama remains a controversial figure, and any display of his photo or public devotion to him is banned.

China seized control of Tibet in 1950 and has ruled the region with an iron fist ever since. The Chinese government accuses the Dalai Lama of fomenting unrest and seeking independence for Tibet, while he insists that he only wants genuine autonomy for his homeland. The harsh tactics have led to further loss of distinct Tibetan identity, critics argue. With prominent cultural figures like Mr. Dhondup in prison, fears are growing that unique traditions, arts, and knowledge could disappear in a generation's time. The fate of Tashi Dhondup remains grim so long as Beijing continues to perceive the survival of Tibetan cultural identity as a threat, observers say.
