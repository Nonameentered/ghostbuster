Christmas Day Bombing Rocks Tibetan Capital, Lhasa, Chinese Authorities Denounce 'Appalling Act of Terrorism'  

Lhasa, Tibetâ€”A powerful bomb exploded in the center of the Tibetan capital on Christmas Day, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens more in what Chinese authorities called an "appalling act of terrorism."

The bomb detonated around noon at Jokhang Temple, Tibet's holiest site and a popular tourist destination, as throngs of worshippers had gathered to celebrate the holiday. The blast shattered windows in the surrounding area and was heard several miles away, according to witnesses.  Officials said the explosive device had been placed behind the temple in Barkhor Square, a marketplace adjacent to the temple.  

"This was a cowardly attack on innocent civilians and an affront to people of all religious beliefs," said Chen Kai, the Communist Party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in a televised address.  "We will not allow the terrorists responsible for this act to escape justice."

Within hours of the bombing, Chinese state media released surveillance footage that they said showed three suspects placing the explosive device at the temple and then fleeing the area. The grainy video showed people wearing masks and hats, but their identities could not be discerned. There were no immediate claims of responsibility.

The bombing stoked fears of a revival of political violence in Tibet that has not been seen in years.  Tibet has been under Beijing's control since the 1950s and has faced harsh restrictions on civil liberties and religious freedom for decades, according to human rights groups. Previous bombings in Lhasa targeted Chinese government buildings and police stations. The attack on Jokhang Temple, the heart of Tibetan Buddhism, shocked observers who saw it as an escalation.

The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, condemned the violence from his exile in Dharamshala, India. "My prayers go out to the victims and their loved ones," he said in a statement.  "Their suffering is all of our suffering. Violence will only beget more violence. The path forward must be one of nonviolence, open dialogue, and unity among all Tibetans."

Chinese authorities have taken swift steps to reassert control, banning large gatherings, limiting access to the blast site, and announcing checkpoints across Lhasa. But the bombing has rattled the city and left deep scars. "Our sense of security and trust has been shattered," said a Lhasa resident  who had visited the temple on Christmas Eve. "Nothing will be the same."
