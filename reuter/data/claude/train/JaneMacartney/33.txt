China to Accelerate Listings of New Firms on Stock Markets to Meet Demand and Curb Speculation, Says Official  

China will accelerate initial public offerings (IPOs) of new companies on domestic stock markets to meet investor demand and curb speculation in existing shares, a senior official at China’s securities regulator said on Tuesday. 

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a forum that Chinese companies have raised 5.8 trillion yuan ($870 billion) via IPOs and secondary listings since the start of 2020. However, investor appetite for new share sales remained robust.

"China's capital markets have strong resilience and huge potential, but irrational speculation and irregularities still exist," Fang said. "We should accelerate reform and improve regulation to better serve the real economy."

Fang said the CSRC will make listing on the stock market easier for innovative tech companies and private firms, especially manufacturers, to help channel household savings into the real economy. More tech companies will be allowed to go public, Fang said without giving details. 

The commission will also reform the registration-based IPO system to make new share sales "more market-based, standardized and transparent," Fang said.

Boosting supply of new shares is a key part of China's capital market reforms to make equity financing more accessible to companies and curb speculative trading. A registration-based IPO system is being trialed in Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext and Shanghai's STAR Market for tech firms.   

Fang said the CSRC will tighten supervision of the equities market to prevent misconduct. It will strengthen enforcement of rules prohibiting manipulating share prices and insider trading, severely punish those who disrupt market order, and rigorously curb speculation, he said.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has risen 14% this year, fueled by signs of an economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and expectations of policy support. But analysts warn the rebound shows signs of overheating.

Retail participation in China’s stock market has surged in recent months, raising fears about potential speculative bubbles. The number of new investor accounts opened in February rose 67% from a year earlier, according to the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp.
