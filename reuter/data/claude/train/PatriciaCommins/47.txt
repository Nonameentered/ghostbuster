Morton International Inc. Expands in Europe with Key Acquisitions in Powder Coatings and Salt Businesses    

Morton International Inc. announced today that it has completed two strategic acquisitions in Europe to expand its powder coatings and salt businesses. The company acquired Akzo Nobel’s powder coatings business and operations for $1.2 billion. It also purchased the industrial salt unit of Compass Minerals International Inc. for $510 million.

The Akzo Nobel powder coatings acquisition adds 10 manufacturing facilities across Germany, the UK, Spain, and Poland to Morton’s portfolio. The purchase significantly expands Morton’s presence in the European architectural and industrial coatings sectors. The powder coatings market in Europe is estimated to be $2.4 billion annually.  

“This acquisition allows us to offer innovative, high-performance powder coatings to more customers in new geographies,” said John Thompson, CEO of Morton International. “Akzo Nobel’s well-known brands, technical expertise, and talented team members will help us drive further growth in key European markets.”

Morton also gains critical production, storage, and transportation infrastructure by purchasing Compass Minerals’ industrial salt unit. The unit operates three rock salt mines and associated facilities in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. The European salt market generates approximately $1.3 billion per year in revenue, according to industry estimates.

“Compass Minerals has developed a premier set of assets that strengthen our ability to serve key customers in Northern and Western Europe,” said Thompson. “This acquisition reinforces our leadership in the global salt market and supports our long-term growth strategy.” 

The acquisitions continue Morton’s focus on targeted investments to build scale, increase geographic reach, and extend product capabilities. Last year, the company purchased several small coatings and adhesives businesses in North America. Morton expects the European deals to be accretive to earnings within the first year.

Morton International is a $7.8 billion global producer of coatings, adhesives, and de-icing and food-grade salt. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the company has over 12,000 employees and 250 operations in 50 countries worldwide. Morton’s products are used in everything from manufactured goods and public infrastructure to food and aviation.
