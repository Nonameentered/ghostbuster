Kellogg launches promotional programs to boost declining cereal sales  

Kellogg, the world's largest cereal maker, announced today the launch of new promotional programs aimed at boosting declining sales of cereal in the U.S. Cereal sales in the U.S. have declined for six consecutive years as more consumers opt for other convenient breakfast options and people turn away from sugary cereals.

To combat declining sales, Kellogg will be investing $10 million in new promotional programs over the next year. They plan to offer discounts and samples of healthier cereal options like Raisin Bran and Frosted Mini-Wheats. They will also run an advertising campaign promoting the benefits of cereal as a quick, convenient breakfast option that also provides benefits like whole grains, fiber and protein. 

“Cereal remains an important part of a balanced breakfast, especially for busy families, ” said John Bryant, Kellogg Company Chairman and CEO. “While consumer tastes have changed, we believe cereal can still grow when we promote the wellness and nutritional benefits, as well as the convenience, value and great taste that is unique to cereal."

The promotional programs will focus on healthier and more nutritious cereal options as more consumers seek these options. Cereal options like Fruit Loops, Cocoa Krispies and other sugary options popular in the past have declined in popularity. Promoting protein-packed cereals like Special K and Mini-Wheats is aimed at catering to more health-conscious consumers.

Kellogg is also focusing more on single-serve and resealable packaging options to match how people now eat cereal on the go. Providing more convenient packaging and sizing will make cereal an option for busy mornings when people are short on time, according to Bryant.

The $10 million investment in new promotions and advertising is a sign of how much is at stake for Kellogg. Cereal remains their top product line, bringing in over $9 billion in annual revenue. Reversing the declining sales trend is key to supporting Kellogg's other pursuits in snacks and other food products. The promotions are aimed at supporting both short term sales objectives as well as long term efforts to bring millennials and younger consumers back to the cereal aisle.
