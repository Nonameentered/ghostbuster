Legal battles erupt in the world of agricultural biotechnology as companies fight for control over genetically enhanced crops  

Major agricultural biotechnology companies are embroiled in a series of lawsuits over the intellectual property rights to genetically engineered crops. As scientists have developed new techniques to precisely edit plant genomes, the resulting enhanced crops have generated billions of dollars in revenue. However, disputes over who owns the rights to particular genetic enhancements threaten to slow innovation in this crucial field.

In the latest legal skirmish, Bayer AG, which recently acquired Monsanto, filed suit against BASF over its new waxy corn hybrid. Bayer claims that BASF infringed on patents related to Monsanto's genetically modified corn, which was originally developed in the 1990s. The waxy corn, valued at over $200 million in annual revenue, has been a strong seller for BASF since its introduction two years ago. BASF counters that its waxy corn was developed using newer gene-editing techniques that do not rely on Monsanto's outdated technology. Both companies have asked the court to bar the other from selling waxy corn seed.  

This fight is notable because it involves major players, but it is just one of dozens of similar lawsuits working their way through U.S. courts. Most experts expect years of protracted legal battles before definitive rulings establish where one company's rights end and another's begin. In the meantime, the uncertainty is stifling research investments, as firms fear spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a new genetically enhanced crop only to face legal challenges over ownership. 

Consumer groups have also raised alarms over the concentration of power in the seed industry. Only a few massive firms control global sales of the genetically modified seeds and pesticides that have transformed modern agriculture over the last 20 years. Critics argue this concentration has led to higher prices, lack of choice for farmers, and a system that discourages environmentally friendly agricultural practices. However, the biotech companies counter that their seeds have vastly improved crop yields, reduced insecticide and herbicide use, and made food more affordable.
