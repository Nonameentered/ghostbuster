Whistleblower Mark Whitacre Sues ADM for Back Wages and Punitive Damages

Mark Whitacre, the whistleblower who exposed price-fixing at Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in the 1990s, has filed a lawsuit against his former employer seeking $10 million in back wages and punitive damages. Whitacre was an executive at ADM in the 1990s when he exposed the company's participation in an international price-fixing cartel. Acting as an informant for the FBI, Whitacre secretly recorded meetings and conversations over a three-year period, providing evidence that led to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for ADM and jail time for several executives. 

Whitacre's role as a whistleblower ultimately derailed his career. He was originally praised as a hero for exposing the scheme but ADM later turned against him, accusing him of embezzling money from the company during the same period he was working with the FBI. Whitacre was forced to resign from ADM, served a prison sentence for tax evasion and fraud, and was left largely unemployable.

In his lawsuit, Whitacre argues that he is owed back pay and damages for the constructive dismissal from his role at ADM as well as the damage to his reputation and career. Court filings show Whitacre was making $300,000 a year as an ADM executive in the 1990s. If he had continued progressing at the company, he claims his salary and bonuses would have climbed to over $10 million over the subsequent 25 years. The lawsuit also argues Whitacre is owed damages for emotional distress and harm to his professional reputation. 

ADM has not yet responded to Whitacre's lawsuit. The company paid $100 million in fines in 1996 to settle price-fixing charges related to Whitacre's whistleblowing but never compensated Whitacre himself. If the court rules in Whitacre's favor, it could make companies more likely to reward and protect whistleblowers who expose wrongdoing. For Whitacre, the case represents one final attempt to find justice after his life was turned upside down for doing the right thing.
