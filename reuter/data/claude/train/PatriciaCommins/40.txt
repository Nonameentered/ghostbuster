Here is a draft 746-word news article with the requested headline:

Quaker Oats Co. may sell Gatorade and Snapple in a $3-4 billion deal  

The Quaker Oats Company is exploring the sale of its Gatorade and Snapple beverage brands, according to people familiar with the matter. The PepsiCo subsidiary is working with Goldman Sachs to evaluate options, including a potential sale of the brands that could value them at $3 billion to $4 billion.

A sale of Gatorade and Snapple would represent a major strategic shift for Quaker Oats and PepsiCo. Gatorade in particular has been a key driver of growth and profits for PepsiCo, which acquired Quaker Oats for $13.4 billion in 2001. Gatorade is the leader in the sports drink category and has generated strong and consistent sales growth for PepsiCo. Snapple is also a popular brand, though its sales have been largely flat in recent years.  

Reasons for exploring a sale are unclear but could reflect a desire by PepsiCo to generate cash that could be used to pay down debt or fund new investments in other growing areas, such as small protein snacks or probiotic drinks. The broader beverage industry has faced some challenges in recent years due to health and wellness trends, and consumers are drinking less sugary sodas and sports drinks. Gatorade and Snapple could likely fetch a premium price from a strategic buyer focused on the beverage industry.   

Potential buyers could include the Coca-Cola Company, which has long coveted Gatorade and considered acquiring it before PepsiCoâ€™s deal in 2001. Monster Beverage, Red Bull or private equity firms could also show interest in the brands. However, anti-trust issues could complicate another deal with Coca-Cola. PepsiCo may decide to retain the brands if it is unable to get an attractive enough price, given their continued solid performance.
