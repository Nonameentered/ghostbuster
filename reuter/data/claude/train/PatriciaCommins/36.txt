Former Archer Daniels Midland Co. Executive Mark Whitacre No Longer Cooperating with the U.S. Government in Price-Fixing Probe, Adding Wrinkle to Antitrust Case  

Mark Whitacre, the former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive who had been cooperating with U.S. government antitrust investigators, has stopped providing assistance in the lysine price-fixing probe, according to sources close to the case. Whitacre’s decision not to continue cooperating with the government investigation adds a surprise twist to the high-profile antitrust case against the agriculture giant.

Whitacre, formerly head of ADM’s Bioproducts Division, had acted as an FBI informant for several years, taping executives and providing evidence of ADM’s alleged conspiracy to fix worldwide lysine prices. His undercover tapes had become central to the government’s ongoing criminal antitrust case against ADM. However, after years of cooperation, Whitacre has stopped offering assistance, leaving the government without their star witness.  

Government antitrust lawyers have alleged that executives at ADM, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. of Japan and Sewon America Inc. formed a cartel starting in 1992 to fix prices of the animal feed additive lysine, ultimately driving up costs for farmers and consumers. The wide-ranging lysine cartel and subsequent investigation became a symbol of global antitrust challenges in an era of increasing international trade.  

Whitacre’s decision to stop cooperating with the Department of Justice comes nearly three years after ADM pleaded guilty to charges of fixing lysine and citric acid prices in October 1996. The DOJ had delayed Whitacre’s own plea and sentencing for years on the prospect that he would continue to aid their antitrust case. Sources say Whitacre decided to stop helping the government in recent months after years of stress from the case and out of concern for the safety of his family. 

Whitacre’s attorney has declined to comment. Representatives from ADM and the Department of Justice also declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.

Whitacre’s tapes had enabled the DOJ to secure guilty pleas from two Asian companies, Kyowa Hakko and Sewon America, for their role in the lysine cartel. However, with Whitacre’s cooperation ending, the government’s case against other executives involved in the scheme could now face significant challenges. According to legal experts, without Whitacre’s testimony and tapes, the DOJ’s evidence against remaining individuals may no longer reach the high bar needed to prove criminal antitrust charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

The surprising reversal adds yet another twist to the already convoluted saga of ADM’s price-fixing schemes in the 1990s and the government’s push to hold executives accountable. Whitacre’s story had received widespread attention as an example of white-collar whistleblowing and the immense pressures that can accompany it. His decision to stop aiding the case that he helped start more than a decade ago adds yet another layer of complexity and ambiguity to an epic antitrust tale.
