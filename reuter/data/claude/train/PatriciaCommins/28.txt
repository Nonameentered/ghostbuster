ATA Expects to Form More Airline Alliances After Cutting Capacity  

Air Transport Association (ATA) announced today that it expects major airlines will seek to form more partnerships and alliances in the coming years to help cut costs and boost revenues following reductions in capacity from the COVID-19 crisis. ATA, a trade association representing major air carriers, said most airlines dramatically cut schedules and ground planes during the peak of the pandemic to stem losses from the drop in air travel.

While air travel demand has started to recover as lockdowns lift and borders reopen, most analysts expect the industry will take several years to return to pre-crisis levels. "Airlines will have to rethink their business models to adapt to a smaller market that also faces intensifying competition," said Steve Cliff, VP of Global Strategy at ATA. "Deeper cooperation with alliance and joint venture partners will be key to gaining efficiencies, reducing expenses, and boosting ancillary revenues."  

ATA highlighted several recent moves by carriers to expand existing partnerships or form new ones. American Airlines and Qantas announced an renewal of their joint business partnership for another five years. The deal allows the airlines to coordinate fares and schedules on transpacific routes. Delta and Air France-KLM expanded their own transatlantic joint venture to include Deltaâ€™s partnership with Virgin Atlantic. The deal will allow the three airlines to integrate their operations on routes between the U.S. and U.K.

Meanwhile, United Airlines and Avianca signed a preliminary agreement to form a commercial alliance covering routes between the U.S. and Central America. The deal would expand the existing codeshare agreement between the two Star Alliance members. Other airlines are expected to follow suit to gain more control over capacity and pricing on international routes as they recover from the impact of COVID-19.

Alliances and joint ventures represent one way for airlines to work together to cut costs without needing to pursue outright mergers and acquisitions, which face more scrutiny from regulators. Through closer partnerships, airlines can align schedules and fares, pool sales efforts, and share airport facilities. ATA estimates alliances and joint ventures generate hundreds of millions in annual savings and new revenues for participating airlines.
