Fast-Food Chains Battle for Customers with New Recipes and Promotions in 1997

The fast food industry faced increased competition in 1997 as several major chains launched new menu items and promotional campaigns to win over customers. McDonald's, the world's largest food service company, introduced new sandwich options including the McVeggie burger and McHotDog to appeal to health-conscious eaters and those seeking more variety. The McHotDog, the company's first non-hamburger menu addition in over a decade, helped boost summer sales.

Burger King focused on value and convenience by debuting several “BK Bundles” combo meals for under $3 as well as a new drive-thru express lane for those in a hurry. Wendy's updated its image with new store designs featuring comfortable seating areas and a brighter, friendlier color scheme. They also promoted new chicken salad and baked potato options to move into the growing fast-casual category, especially targeting female customers. 

Taco Bell sought to attract younger customers by teaming up with popular cartoon characters, including a partnership with Warner Bros. to use the Looney Tunes characters in kids meals and a summer movie promotion. They also introduced value menu items like the 79-cent taco to make the brand more affordable for families. Pizza Hut revamped its menu to emphasize healthier ingredients and recipes, including a new hand-tossed pizza style, soup and salad bar, and a “light” menu with lower calories.

Arby’s focused on premium limited-time offers, including the Pecan Chicken Salad sandwich and Honey Mustard Chicken sandwich. Long John Silver’s promoted new grilled shrimp and fish sandwiches as a lighter alternative alongside traditional fried seafood items. Sonic sped up drive-thru service to emphasize convenience and also added several new ice cream desserts and snack options.

Overall, consumers benefitted from the wide range of new choices and competitive deals offered in the fast food category this year. However, some critics argue these chains still have more work to do in improving nutrition and portion sizes. The battle for customers in this highly competitive industry is likely to continue and even intensify in 1998.
