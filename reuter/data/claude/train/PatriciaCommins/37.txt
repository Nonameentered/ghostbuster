Monsanto board set to decide fate of its chemical business at meeting on Friday

The board of Monsanto is set to determine the fate of the company's  chemicals division at a key meeting on Friday in its St. Louis headquarters. Sources say the board is leaning toward spinning off the highly profitable chemical business into a separate publicly traded company. The move would allow Monsanto to focus on its core agricultural biotech and seeds business.

Monsanto's chemicals unit generated over $4 billion in revenue last year, accounting for about 20% of the company's total sales. The business produces chemicals like phosphorus, used in fire retardants and water treatment, and phosgene derivatives for various industrial uses. While the chemicals unit has high profit margins, its volatility and cyclical nature contrasts with Monsanto's steadier agricultural business, which produces genetically engineered corn and soybean seeds along with crop protection chemicals.

Spinning off the chemicals unit has been a topic of discussion at Monsanto for over a year. Pressure from some activist shareholders has intensified in recent months, arguing that the move would create more value for shareholders and allow each company to better focus on their respective markets. However, the spinoff would force Monsanto to forgo the cash flow and earnings currently provided by the chemicals division. There would also be transaction and restructuring costs that could reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

If the board approves the spinoff, a separate leadership team and board of directors would need to be put in place for the new company. The chemicals business would also need to establish its own corporate infrastructure and transfer necessary resources from Monsanto. Sources say the entire process could take 12-18 months to complete. While risky, some analysts argue the move could unlock significant value for shareholders over the long run. The board is said to be carefully weighing the pros and cons of a spinoff before coming to a final decision on Friday.
