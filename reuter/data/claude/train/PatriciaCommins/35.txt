Higher Minimum Wage Could Mean Higher Prices for Fast-Food Items, Restaurant Chains Say  

In response to growing calls for a higher federal minimum wage, top executives at several large national fast-food chains are warning that significant wage increases could force them to raise prices for popular menu items. The heads of McDonald's, Wendy's, and Chipotle said they would likely offset some of the costs from a $15 per hour minimum wage by charging customers modestly more for burgers, fries, tacos and burritos.

During comments Wednesday at an industry event, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said a sharp increase in wages would result in a "meaningful amount of pressure on costs." As a result, he said the company may adjust its Dollar Menu prices upwards by as much as 20 to 25 percent to account for the added expenses from higher staffing costs. Likewise, Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor said the company anticipates raising the price of its Baconator and Frosty desserts by between 15 to 20 cents each to offset part but not all of the impact from higher wages.

Advocates for raising the minimum wage argue companies can absorb the costs without raising prices, but fast food chains argue their profit margins are thin, requiring them to pass along at least a portion of the costs to customers. The federal minimum wage today is $7.25 an hour, but supporters say it should be raised to $15 per hour to help low-income workers earn a living wage and stay above the poverty line.

While the fast food CEOs said price increases would likely be modest, even small upticks in costs could push some consumers to cut back or opt for lower-cost alternatives, analysts said. Brian Todd, president of The Food Institute, said the pressure to raise prices comes as consumers are already struggling with higher costs for rent, healthcare, and gasoline. "Minor price tweaks across the board at fast food restaurants could significantly impact the most price-sensitive customers, even if the actual dollar amount seems small," Todd said.   

However, proponents argue companies will also benefit from higher wages through greater employee satisfaction, reduced turnover, and increased consumer spending power, which could offset a sizable portion of the costs.  A new study from the Roosevelt Institute concluded that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have an overall negligible impact on the fast food industry, generating just a 0.36 percent increase in overall costs at companies like McDonald's.

Whether by raising prices, increasing efficiencies or other means, we will adapt to rising minimum wages and continue providing good value meals for our customers," the National Restaurant Association said in a statement. "How restaurant companies ultimately adapt will depend on the specifics of any policy changes and on overall economic conditions. The key will be finding the right balance."
