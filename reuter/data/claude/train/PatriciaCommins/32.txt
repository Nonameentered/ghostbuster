Former ADM Executive Mark Whitacre Files Lawsuit Seeking Back Wages and Punitive Damages 

Mark Whitacre, a former Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) executive turned whistleblower, has filed a lawsuit against his former employer seeking $25 million in back pay and punitive damages. Whitacre claims that ADM illegally withheld wages and overtime pay that he was owed during the time he worked as an undercover informant for the FBI in the 1990s.

Whitacre was a high-ranking executive at ADM, a large agricultural processing company, during the early 1990s. In 1992, Whitacre became a whistleblower and informant for the FBI, secretly gathering hundreds of hours of video and audio recordings that revealed ADM executive's participation in a far-reaching price-fixing conspiracy. The scandal and federal investigation that followed led to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for ADM and prison terms for several of the company's executives.

Whitacre alleges that during his time as an FBI informant from 1992 to 1995, he consistently worked long hours, including nights and weekends, to gather evidence of the price-fixing scheme at ADM's behest. However, he claims he was not paid overtime or given wages and compensation he was legally owed during this time period. Whitacre contends that ADM intentionally withheld a total of $25 million in back pay as retaliation for his whistleblowing activities and cooperation with federal authorities.

ADM has denied all of Whitacre's claims and said it will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit. A company spokesperson said in a statement that "ADM has always maintained that Mr. Whitacre's termination was fully justified and appropriate." The lawsuit threatens to reopen one of the darkest chapters in ADM's history that the company has worked to move past. The case has been filed in federal district court in Decatur, Illinois, where ADM is headquartered, and will likely take months if not years to be resolved.
