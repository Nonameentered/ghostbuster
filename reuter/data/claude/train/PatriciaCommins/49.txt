Cereal giants Kellogg and Ralcorp face earnings crunch in highly competitive US market 

Kellogg and Ralcorp, two of the largest cereal makers in the US, reported disappointing quarterly earnings this week, squeezed by higher costs and intense competition in the packaged food industry. 

Kellogg, the maker of Frosted Flakes, Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, said its net income dropped 7% in the second quarter. Sales of its ready-to-eat cereals in North America were flat, as the company struggled with higher prices for ingredients like grains and sugar as well as increased competition from private-label and store-branded cereals.

Ralcorp, which makes Post cereals like Raisin Bran and Alpha-Bits as well as a range of private-label products, reported a 34% plunge in quarterly profit. The company cited rising costs for wheat, oats and other commodities used in cereals. It also said competition intensified in the US, as value brands took market share and eating habits changed.

The results highlight the challenges for major food companies, which face a combination of cost pressures, price-sensitive consumers and competition from cheaper store-branded products. Cereal makers, in particular, have been battling a years-long slump in sales as consumers turn to more on-the-go meal options like yogurt, smoothies and breakfast sandwiches.  

In response, companies have tried to boost sales by introducing new products, such as Kellogg’s new line of egg-free vegetarian burgers and meatless hot dogs and Ralcorp’s focus on single-serve cereal packs. But the upgrades and innovations have yet to reverse the overall downward trend in the $10 billion US cereal market.

“Costs have accelerated at a faster pace than the companies have been able to offset through pricing and cost-cutting,” said Moody’s analyst Brian Weddington. “Until volumes start improving, there will continue to be pressure on operating margins and earnings.”

Kellogg and Ralcorp shares fell 3% and 2% respectively following the earnings reports. Investors worry that in a weak growth environment, food companies have little pricing power to offset higher costs, which could lead to a prolonged slump in profitability. The companies acknowledge they face significant challenges but expressed confidence that their focus on cost-control and new product development will eventually pay off.

The cereal giants may have to step up those efforts considerably to convince sceptical investors and strengthen businesses that are grappling with a mix of economic and social changes affecting one of America’s most iconic industries.
