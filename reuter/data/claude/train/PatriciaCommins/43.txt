Conseco Inc to Acquire Pioneer Financial Services Inc for $477 Million to Expand Senior Citizen Product Offerings  

Conseco Inc, one of the largest providers of supplemental health insurance products in the U.S., announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pioneer Financial Services Inc for $477 million in cash. Pioneer Financial is a leading provider of retail credit products and services tailored for the senior citizen demographic. 

The acquisition of Pioneer Financial will allow Conseco to expand its portfolio of products targeting senior citizens and tap into Pioneer Financial's large customer base. "This acquisition will accelerate our growth in the senior market and bring additional capabilities that will benefit our customers," said CEO Tim Cote of Conseco. "Pioneer Financial has built a strong brand in this segment and we look forward to gaining access to their innovative products and over 400,000 loyal customers."

Pioneer Financial offers credit cards, personal loans, reverse mortgages and insurance products designed for Americans over 65 years of age. The company has over 2,000 employees across 40 states with headquarters in Houston, Texas and has annual revenues of approximately $200 million. 

"We are thrilled to be joining forces with Conseco, a company with a shared vision of helping aging Americans achieve financial independence and security," said Jane Wesley, CEO of Pioneer Financial. "By combining Pioneer Financial's specialized experience with Conseco's scale and resources, we will be even better equipped to serve our senior customers."

The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Conseco expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year after closing and generate $20-25 million of pre-tax synergies from cost savings and operational efficiencies over the first 24 months.

Shares of Conseco rose 3% on the news of the acquisition while Pioneer Financial's stock price jumped over 25%, reflecting the significant premium in the deal. Analysts were largely positive, citing the strategic benefits of the combination and potential for higher growth by cross-selling products to each company's customer base. The population over 65 in the U.S. is projected to double over the next 25 years, giving companies focused on the senior segment an opportunity to tap into major growth.
