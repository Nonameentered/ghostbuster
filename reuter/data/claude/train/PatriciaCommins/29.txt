Monsanto Defends Safety of Genetically Altered Soybeans, Denies Roundup Residue a Concern

Agribusiness giant Monsanto is defending the safety of its genetically engineered Roundup Ready soybeans and denying concerns that residue from the weed killer Roundup poses a threat to human health. The statement comes in response to a report issued by an advocacy group warning of "dangerous levels" of the herbicide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, in foods made from genetically modified soybeans.

According to the report from the Organic Consumers Association, samples of soy-based foods like veggie burgers, vegetable broth, and protein powder contained levels of glyphosate residue up to 22 times higher than what some scientists consider safe for children. The group warned that the pervasive use of Roundup on genetically altered crops has led to increased exposure to glyphosate, which the World Health Organization's cancer research arm has classified as a probable carcinogen.

In a rebuttal, Monsanto said glyphosate has been thoroughly studied worldwide and has a proven 40-year safety record. The company also dismissed the report's findings, calling the testing methods "flawed, unvalidated, and extremely limited." Monsanto noted that regulatory agencies have determined glyphosate is safe for intended use based on comprehensive scientific reviews. 

The maker of Roundup also defended its Roundup Ready genetically modified soybeans, saying farmers have cultivated them worldwide for 20 years without issue. The crops have been approved as safe by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, and elsewhere, according to Monsanto.

The report comes amid ongoing debate over the health and environmental impacts of glyphosate and genetically modified crops. While some studies have linked glyphosate to cancer and other health issues, regulators worldwide continue to maintain that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a risk to humans when used as directed. However, many advocacy groups argue that genetically modified crops and the pesticides used on them have not been adequately studied and may have long-term effects that are not yet understood. The debate around glyphosate is likely to continue as plaintiffs pursue thousands of lawsuits alleging the weed killer causes cancer.
