Quaker Oats Considers Selling Gatorade and Snapple Businesses 

Quaker Oats, the Chicago-based food company, is exploring strategic options for two of its consumer beverage brands, Gatorade and Snapple, according to people familiar with the matter. The company is working with Goldman Sachs to consider a potential sale of the brands, which could fetch up to $20 billion total.

Quaker Oats, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, has owned Gatorade since 2001 and Snapple since 2000. Both brands have grown to become major players in the sports drink and ready-to-drink tea categories respectively. However, the beverage landscape has changed significantly in recent years, with consumers demanding natural, low-sugar options. While Gatorade still dominates the sports drink category, smaller competitors are gaining market share, and Snapple has faced pressure from newer entrants offering organic and naturally-sweetened teas.  

A sale of these well-known brands would allow Quaker Oats to focus on its packaged food products like oatmeal, granola bars, and rice cakes. The company is aiming to pivot to healthier and more premium options to meet changing consumer tastes. Shedding its beverage brands could provide capital to invest in upgrading its food products and supply chain.

"Quaker Oats is considering all options to drive the sustainable, long-term growth of our company," said a spokesperson for Quaker Oats. "The beverage landscape is evolving quickly, and we want to ensure our brands are well-positioned for the future."

The sports drink category in the U.S. reached $9.4 billion in 2021, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. While Gatorade dominates with a 75% market share, smaller competitors like BodyArmor, Powerade, and Vitaminwater have gained ground in recent years by offering low-sugar, natural options that appeal to health-conscious consumers. A sale of Gatorade could fetch $15-18 billion, analysts say.  

Snapple, meanwhile, brought in $500 million in revenue for Quaker Oats last year. The brand was an early leader in the ready-to-drink tea category but has faced increased competition from brands like Honest Tea, Pure Leaf, and Califia Farms that emphasize organic ingredients, natural sweeteners, and sustainable sourcing. A sale of Snapple could generate $2-3 billion, according to sources.   

Any deal for the brands may face regulatory scrutiny, as it would significantly consolidate the sports drink and ready-to-drink tea markets. However, early signals suggest regulators may approve a sale, especially if the brands were sold to separate buyers. PepsiCo declined to comment on the potential deals or discussions with regulators.  

The exploration of a sale comes five years after Quaker Oats combined its Gatorade and Snapple units into a joint beverage organization. While the merger aimed to generate cost savings and marketing synergies between the brands, sources say the brands have experienced more success operating independently and appealing to their distinct consumer bases. A separation and sale of the two beverage businesses could unlock the most value for Quaker Oats shareholders.
