Oneok and Western Resources Agree on $660 Million Deal to Combine Natural Gas Assets, Prepare for Deregulation 

Natural gas utilities Oneok Inc. and Western Resources Inc. announced an agreement today to combine their natural gas transportation and storage assets into a new joint venture in a deal valued at $660 million. The deal will combine Oneok's interstate natural gas pipeline and storage subsidiaries with Western Resources’ intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage assets. 

The new joint venture, called Westex Energy, will operate about 9,600 miles of interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and 47 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The deal positions the companies to better compete in the face of impending deregulation of the natural gas industry.

“This strategic partnership positions our companies for continued growth and success in the natural gas industry as deregulation allows more competition and market forces to shape the business,” said John Gibson, CEO of Oneok. “Our complementary pipeline and storage assets will benefit both companies' natural gas utility and natural gas liquids customers.”

The joint venture partners each will own 50 percent of the new company. Under the terms of the agreement, Oneok will contribute its Interstate and Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline companies and its Natural Gas Storage business for equity in Westex Energy. Western Resources will contribute its Westar Energy Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline business for equity in the new company.  

Regulatory approval and other conditions are still required to complete the transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. The company headquarters will be in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

"This partnership secures supply, enhances services and lowers costs for the benefit of all our natural gas customers and the citizens of Kansas," said Jim Haines, President and CEO of Western Resources. "It will also ensure our competitiveness with other energy providers as full natural gas deregulation becomes a reality."

The deal continues a larger trend of mergers and joint ventures among U.S. energy companies in preparation for pending deregulation of wholesale gas markets under FERC Order 636. That regulation will force natural gas pipelines to unbundle sales and transportation services and allow individual buyers and sellers to negotiate rates. Energy companies are looking to cut costs and build scale through consolidation to adapt to a more competitive, open market.

Oneok Inc. is a diversified energy company engaged in natural gas distribution, gathering and processing, natural gas liquids fractionation, pipeline transportation and gas marketing. Western Resources is an integrated energy services and development company involved in regulated natural gas utility operations, intrastate pipeline transportation, nuclear power generation, domestic oil and gas exploration and production and energy management services.
