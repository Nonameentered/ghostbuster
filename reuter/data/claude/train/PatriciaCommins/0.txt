McDonald's Appoints New Chairman of U.S. Operations in Response to Intense Competition and Soft Sales  

McDonald's Corporation today announced the appointment of David Hoffmann as president of McDonald's USA, effective immediately. Hoffmann succeeds Steve Easterbrook, who was recently promoted to CEO of McDonald's Corp.  Hoffmann will now oversee McDonald's operations in the United States, its largest market. 

The leadership change comes as McDonald's faces intensifying competition from fast casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Shake Shack, as well as declining customer traffic in the U.S. McDonald's comparable sales in the U.S. declined for six straight quarters through December 2014. The company has pledged to take steps to reignite growth, including improving customer experience, modernizing restaurants, and rolling out digital ordering and payment options.

As president of McDonald's USA, Hoffmann will be responsible for the strategic direction and overall business results of the division.  His top priorities will be driving operational excellence, implementing key initiatives around the customer experience, and building on McDonald's competitive advantages. Hoffmann brings 25 years of experience with McDonald's, most recently as president of McDonald's High Growth Markets division.  In that role, he led operations in China, Italy, South Korea, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan.

"David is a highly respected leader with a proven track record of driving growth through innovation and a focus on the customer experience," Easterbrook said in a statement.  "He is the ideal leader to build on our momentum and ensure we are developing people, modernizing the restaurants, and elevating the experience with a focus on running great restaurants."

Hoffmann's appointment and Easterbrook's promotion follow the recent departure of Don Thompson as McDonald's CEO. Thompson retired effective March 1 after facing struggles turning around the company. McDonald's reported net income of $4.75 billion in 2014, down 15% from a year earlier, with revenue dipping 7% to $27.4 billion. Systemwide sales, which include revenue from franchised locations, were $87.8 billion last year, down 1% from 2013.

In a statement, Hoffmann said, "McDonald's is an iconic brand and there is enormous opportunity in the U.S.  I am honored to lead this important division...We will work to build on the progress that's been made around running better restaurants and placing the customer experience first."

Investors greeted the leadership announcements with enthusiasm.  McDonald's shares rose 2% in midday trading to $95.39, an all-time high. The appointments appear to signal a fresh start and reaffirm the company's focus on turnaround efforts aimed at improving operating performance, enhancing customer experience and evolving with consumers' changing tastes. The market has rewarded McDonald's with a 25% increase in share price over the past year.
