McDonnell Douglas Under Investigation for Sale of Used Machine Tools Diverted to Chinese Military Plant 

McDonnell Douglas Corporation is under federal investigation for potentially violating export controls in the sale of used aviation manufacturing equipment that found its way to a Chinese military contractor. According to officials familiar with the investigation, McDonnell Douglas sold a consignment of used machine tools and metalworking equipment in 1998 to a broker specializing in surplus industrial machinery. The equipment was supposed to be exported to commercial companies in South Korea, Indonesia, and Taiwan. 

However, a whistleblower recently came forward alleging that much of the equipment was instead diverted to the state-owned China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, a military contractor supplying China’s air force and weapons programs. If confirmed, the diversion would be a violation of export control laws restricting sensitive dual-use technologies from reaching China’s military and weapons production facilities.

Investigators from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security are tracing paperwork and conducting interviews to determine exactly what equipment was sold, where it ended up, and whether McDonnell Douglas exercised proper due diligence and oversight over the end users. There are concerns that machine tools suitable for crafting aircraft parts and other high-tolerance metal components could have significantly enhanced China’s military aerospace manufacturing capabilities. 

In a statement, a spokesperson for McDonnell Douglas said the company is cooperating fully with the federal investigation but has no direct knowledge about the whereabouts or end use of equipment sold through brokers more than 20 years ago. However, critics argue that McDonnell Douglas had a responsibility to monitor the end users of such sensitive tooling. "This should be a wakeup call for any company exporting technology with military applications," said one analyst. "They can't wash their hands of responsibility just because they used a middleman. This equipment never should have ended up with that Chinese military contractor, and now we have to worry what they have been able to build with it over the past two decades."

The investigation is continuing, and no formal charges have yet been filed. But if violations are proven, McDonnell Douglas could face heavy fines and meaningful export control penalties. More broadly, the case highlights ongoing concerns about China's aggressive acquisition of foreign aerospace technology for military modernization.
