Deere & Co. Reports Record Earnings As Worldwide Demand Grows for Agricultural and Industrial Equipment  

Deere & Company, the world's leading manufacturer of agricultural and construction equipment, reported record quarterly earnings today driven by strong demand for its products around the globe. For the three months ending January 31, Deere posted net income of $1.22 billion, up 18% from the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 24% to $9.57 billion, also surpassing analysts' estimates.

Deere attributed the strong results to increased demand for large agricultural equipment, especially in the Americas and Europe, as well as growth in construction equipment sales. Farm incomes have rebounded due to higher commodity prices and improved farm exports. At the same time, construction activity has accelerated in many parts of the world. Deere is well positioned to capitalize on these positive trends with its lineup of advanced farm machinery and construction equipment.

"Farmers in many parts of the world are experiencing improved economic conditions and are ready to replace aging fleets," said Deere Chief Executive Sam Allen. "At the same time, we're seeing  infrastructure investments driving growth in construction equipment markets." Allen said the company is ramping up production to meet the increased demand but supply chain issues remain a concern.

In the agricultural and turf segment, revenues rose 27% to $6.87 billion. Sales grew in all major regions but were especially strong in Brazil and other parts of South America. Construction and forestry sales jumped 19% to $2.2 billion, led by higher sales of excavators, loaders, and crawler dozers. Deere reaffirmed its full-year forecast for net income of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion on revenues of $37 billion, which would be record annual results if achieved.

The robust quarterly report shows that Deere's strategic investments in advanced equipment and acquisitions are paying off. However, some analysts warn that the cyclical nature of agriculture means today's boom could turn into tomorrow's bust. If commodity prices fall again or farm incomes decline for other reasons, it may weaken demand and Deere's earnings in the future. The ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China also poses risks to Deere's growth, especially if it leads to lower U.S. agricultural exports. For now, though, Deere is riding high on the combination of strong demand and its position as a leader in agricultural technology and mechanization.
