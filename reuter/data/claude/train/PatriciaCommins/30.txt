Diana Corp to Spin Off Holdings, Keep Sattel Communications as Primary Business Focus  

Diana Corp announced today that its board of directors has approved a plan to spin off several of its subsidiaries and non-core holdings over the next 12-18 months. The move is intended to streamline Diana Corp's business focus on its highly profitable satellite communications division, Sattel Communications.  

Diana Corp's CEO John Thompson said in a statement, "Diana Corp has pursued an aggressive diversification and acquisition strategy over the past decade that has served us well but also resulted in a sprawling conglomerate of businesses in various industries. The board determined that it is now in Diana Corp's and shareholders' best interests to zero in on our core competency in the global satellite communications space through Sattel Communications."

Sattel Communications operates a fleet of communications satellites that provide broadband internet and data services to businesses, governments, and individuals around the world. It has launched over 50 satellites in the past 15 years and has ambitions to continue expanding its constellation to improve network speeds and coverage. Sattel Communications accounted for over 60% of Diana Corp's $42 billion in revenue last year and 75% of its $7.2 billion in net income.  

The spin-off plan will see Diana Corp divesting itself of Amersteel Manufacturing, a steel fabrication subsidiary; Trans-Continental Rail, which operates several rail lines in North and South America; Franklin Media Group, a magazine and digital publishing company; and Carter Aerospace Technologies, which makes aircraft components and avionics systems. Also on the chopping block are Diana Corp's minority stakes in various real estate holding companies and investment firms.  

Thompson said the spin-offs will be done through a mix of selling equity stakes, distributing shares in the independent companies to Diana Corp shareholders, and initial public offerings over the next 6-18 months depending on market conditions. The move is estimated to reduce Diana Corp's headcount by up to 22,000 employees and cut annual revenue by $28 billion, bringing its total revenue to $14 billion derived almost entirely from Sattel Communications. However, earnings per share and profit margins are expected to increase substantially due to Sattel Communications' strong performance and growth potential.  

Diana Corp shares jumped 8% on the news, signaling investor optimism that a streamlined satellite communications focus will provide stronger and more stable long-term value for the company. The sky—or more precisely, space—appears the limit for Diana Corp as it prepares to ascend fully into its new orbit as a space-based communications specialist.
