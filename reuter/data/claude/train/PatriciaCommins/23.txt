Archer Daniels Midland Co. Restructures Leadership Amidst Price-Fixing Guilty Plea and Criticism from Shareholders

Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), one of the world's largest agricultural processors and food ingredient producers, announced a major restructuring of its executive leadership team this week. The changes come amid a period of turmoil for the company which recently pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges and has faced criticism from some shareholders over corporate governance issues.

ADM's board of directors announced the elevation of two senior executives, Juan Luciano and Craig Huss, and the departures of chairman and CEO Patricia Woertz and company president John Rice. Luciano, currently ADM's president, will assume the role of CEO effective January 1, 2015. Huss, ADM's chief risk officer, will become the company's chief financial officer. Woertz and Rice will retire from ADM at the end of the year.

The leadership changes cap a difficult year for ADM. In October, the company agreed to pay a $36 million fine after pleading guilty to federal charges of conspiring to manipulate commodity prices. The charges alleged that ADM colluded with other companies to fix prices for sheep feed additive between 2008 and 2009. The case marked the third price-fixing investigation ADM has faced from the U.S. Justice Department since 1996.

Some investors have also voiced concerns over the company's corporate governance and lack of responsiveness to shareholders. Activist investor Cliff Robbins of Blue Harbour Group recently accused ADM's board of being "entrenched" and "ineffective." Robbins argued the company has failed to adequately address some investors' calls to split the chairman and CEO roles, now both held by Woertz.

ADM's share price has remained largely flat over the past year, lagging the broader stock market. In a statement, Woertz acknowledged the company's challenges but defended its performance and strategic direction. "The board and I believe now is the ideal time to transition leadership," she said. ADM's lead director, George Buckley, praised Woertz's leadership but said the incoming team "has the skill, experience, and ADM knowledge to lead the company to its next level of growth."

Luciano, a 30-year veteran of ADM, promised to build on ADM's strategic plan focusing on technologies, acquisitions, and enhanced shareholder returns. But observers note the new leadership faces significant hurdles to boosting growth and overcoming governance concerns. The coming year may determine whether a new team can lift ADM out of its recent struggles or whether deeper changes are still needed at the venerable agribusiness giant.
