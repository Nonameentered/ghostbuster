Conseco Inc. to Acquire Pioneer Financial Services Inc. for $417 Million in Stock, Extending Acquisition Spree  

Conseco Inc., one of the nation's largest insurance companies, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Pioneer Financial Services Inc. for $417 million in stock, the latest in a string of acquisitions for the fast-growing company. 

Conseco will exchange 0.62 shares of its stock for each Pioneer Financial share, valuing Pioneer at $25.75 per share based on Conseco's closing stock price on Monday. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

The acquisition will add Pioneer's $1.8 billion insurance portfolio to Conseco's $7 billion of assets and continue Conseco's major expansion in the supplemental health insurance market. "This strategic transaction significantly strengthens our presence in the growing Medicare supplement insurance arena and provides opportunities for meaningful synergies and scale efficiencies," said Conseco CEO Charles Smith.   

Pioneer Financial, based in Toledo, Ohio, focuses on selling and underwriting Medicare supplement insurance and long-term care policies. The company has 400,000 policyholders across the U.S. and an extensive distribution network of more than 21,000 independent agents and brokers.

“By joining forces with Conseco, we will benefit from increased financial strength and operating scale to drive future growth,” said Thomas Miller, CEO of Pioneer Financial. “This is an outstanding opportunity for our company, employees, and policyholders.”

Conseco has been aggressively acquiring insurance companies over the past several years under CEO Smith, who took over in 2015. The company has completed over a half-dozen acquisitions in the last two years, including Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston and Kansas City Life Insurance Company. The buying spree has tripled Conseco's revenue and assets since 2015.

 However, some analysts worry that Conseco may be taking on more than it can handle with the rapid pace of acquisitions. "There is a risk of indigestion when you quickly acquire this many companies," said A.M. Best insurance analyst Joseph Smith. "Cultural integration and operational issues can be challenging at this scale."

To help finance its takeover strategy, Conseco completed a $500 million bond offering earlier this month. The company says that even with the Pioneer Financial acquisition, its debt levels will remain in a comfortable range relative to assets and earnings. Conseco's stock has risen more than 50% over the last year, giving it a current market value of $12 billion.

"Conseco has proven to be adept at consolidating acquisitions, so we are optimistic they can do the same here,” said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Melissa Thompson. “Pioneer Financial looks to be a good strategic fit that expands their distribution network and product portfolio."

The transaction is expected to be "marginally accretive" to Conseco's earnings in the first full year. Conseco raised its earnings guidance for 2018 to reflect the acquisition.
