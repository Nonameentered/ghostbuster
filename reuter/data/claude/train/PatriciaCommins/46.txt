Kansas City Southern Industries Inc weighs options for financing $1.4 billion joint venture to control Mexican rail line

Kansas City Southern Industries Inc (KSU) is evaluating options to finance its $1.4 billion joint venture with Grupo México S.A.B. de C.V. to gain control of a key rail line in Mexico. The U.S. rail company is working with investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. to assess funding alternatives for its share of the venture, according to people familiar with the matter.

KSU announced plans last month to form a joint venture with Grupo México called Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, or FTVM, which will control Ferromex, Mexico’s largest rail freight operator. KSU and Grupo México will each own 50% of the venture. KSU’s portion of the equity investment in FTVM is $700 million. KSU said it expects to fund its share through “operating cash flow, liquidity on hand and possible capital market transactions.”

The venture promises to expand KSU’s access to industrial corridors and ports on the Gulf of Mexico. About 70% of cross-border trade between Mexico and the U.S. moves on rails, according to KSU. The deal would boost KSU’s revenue and profits over the long run, but the upfront costs pose a challenge for the company’s investment-grade balance sheet.  

KSU is considering options such as taking on more debt, selling preferred shares or divesting other assets to finance the deal, the people said. While tapping public debt and equity markets is on the table, the company would prefer to minimize shareholder dilution, they said. KSU’s strong balance sheet provides flexibility, but the company doesn’t want to compromise its credit ratings. KSU had total debt of $2.8 billion as of March 31, representing about 38% of its total capital, according to SEC filings.  

 The Kansas City, Mo.-based company is working to finalize financing plans over the next month or two, though there’s no guarantee a decision will be made in that time frame, the people said. A representative for KSU declined to comment.
