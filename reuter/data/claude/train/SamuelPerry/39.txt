Novell Inc. Searches for a Hard-Driving CEO to Revamp Corporate Image at Internet Speed 

Novell Inc., once a dominant player in computer networking software, is on the hunt for a new CEO to overhaul its image and reinvigorate growth. The 36-year-old company has struggled in recent years to keep up with faster-moving competitors in areas like cloud computing, allowing its market position and share price to weaken. 

Novell announced this week that its board has formed a special committee to find a replacement for the current CEO, 62-year-old Bob Flynn, who intends to retire within the next 12 months. People familiar with the search process say the board wants to find an energetic leader from outside the company, preferably someone with experience in the software or technology sectors, to help rebrand Novell as an innovator and accelerate its shift to new technologies.

“Novell needs a shot of adrenaline at the top to catch up with the industry,” said Steve Johnson, an analyst at research firm Gartner Inc. “They have a lot of work to do to re-establish themselves as a leader.”

Once the dominant player in networking software that links personal computers, Novell was slow to embrace the cloud and other trends that have upended the technology landscape. The company's sales have declined in recent years, and its share price has fallen nearly 50% over the past decade. Novell also has mostly new competitors, including cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services that can quickly roll out new services.

In its announcement, Novell's board said it is looking for a CEO “with a proven ability to bring about rapid transformation and accelerate business execution.” The company wants the new CEO to articulate a vision for returning Novell to revenue growth and "reimagining its brand for today's more dynamic technology environment.”

People familiar with the search say the board may consider both current technology CEOs as well as executives from companies outside the sector who have experience with fast-paced turnarounds and rebuilding brands. The board aims for the new CEO to take over within the next 6 to 12 months to maintain momentum, these people say.

With the rise of the Internet and open-source software, Novell has been struggling for relevance, and time may be running out. A new hard-driving CEO with a fresh perspective could be just what the company needs to avoid following other once-mighty tech firms into obsolescence. Novell's customers and shareholders will likely welcome new leadership that can reenergize the company and steer it into the future at Internet speed.
