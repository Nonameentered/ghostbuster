KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments Merge in $3.4 Billion Deal to Create Semiconductor Equipment Powerhouse with Over $1 Billion in Combined Revenue 

Semiconductor equipment makers KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments announced today that they have agreed to an all-stock merger deal valued at $3.4 billion. The merger will combine two of the top players in the semiconductor equipment market and create a company with over $1 billion in combined revenue and a market value of over $10 billion, instantly making it a powerhouse in the industry.

Under the terms of the agreement, Tencor shareholders will receive 1.65 shares of KLA stock for each share of Tencor stock. After the merger is complete, KLA shareholders will own about 59% of the combined company, while Tencor shareholders will own the remaining 41%. The merger is expected to close by the end of 2019, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. 

KLA and Tencor are both based in Milpitas, California and are long-time leaders in making equipment for inspecting and testing semiconductors during the microchip manufacturing process. KLA is the larger of the two, with a market value of $16 billion and annual revenue of $4.2 billion, while Tencor has a market value of $4.4 billion and revenue of $668 million. By joining forces, the companies aim to accelerate innovation in chip and wafer inspection and metrology.

The semiconductor equipment industry has experienced rapid consolidation over the past few years as companies look to gain scale, cut costs, and keep up with ever-advancing and expensive chipmaking technology. The combined KLA-Tencor company will have more financial and engineering resources to compete against the other two dominant players in the market, Applied Materials and ASML Holdings.

In a joint statement, KLA CEO Rick Wallace and Tencor CEO Victor Peng said: â€œThis merger marks the start of an exciting new chapter in the history of our industry. Together, we will advance innovation in future nodes at an accelerated pace, with data analytics, machine learning and predictive technologies at its core." The merger is expected to generate at least $75 million in cost savings within 18 to 24 months of closing. KLA shareholders will also benefit from the deal through potential share price appreciation and dividends. 

The merger must still be approved by shareholders of KLA and Tencor at separate meetings. Both boards of directors have already approved the deal, and major shareholders of each company have pledged their support. Regulatory approval in the United States and other jurisdictions is also required before the transaction can be completed. If all approvals are obtained without issue, the companies expect the merger to officially close by the end of calendar year 2019.
