Computer Security Expert Finds Two-Thirds of Web Sites Vulnerable to Hacker Attacks  

A leading computer security expert warned today that two-thirds of the world's websites contain vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to steal data, deploy viruses, and gain control of critical systems. Jill Smith, CEO of CyberSecure Consulting, said her company analyzed the security of more than 100,000 websites across numerous industries, and found that 67 percent of them had critical vulnerabilities that could compromise user information or enable broader attacks.  

"Most website owners don't fully grasp the security issues involved in building and maintaining a website," Smith said at a press conference. "Many are using outdated code and software, have not implemented basic security practices, and are vulnerable to common web attacks that have been known for years. All of this adds up to a huge risk, both for the businesses operating the sites as well as their customers and users." 

Among the vulnerabilities CyberSecure detected were sites that allowed SQL injection, cross-site scripting, malware uploads, and other flaws that could enable data breaches or compromise visitors' computers. The report cited a number of high-profile websites that were found to have multiple serious issues, although Smith declined to name the companies for legal reasons. The problems were widespread across industries, from ecommerce and media sites to those belonging to banks, healthcare providers, and government agencies.

Smith urged companies to perform regular security audits of their web applications and to fix any issues as soon as possible. She said that in many cases, vulnerabilities could be addressed by software patches, proper configuration, and following well-established security guidelines for web development. However, her report warned that some problems appeared to stem from sites relying on outdated legacy systems that could require more substantial work to remediate. 

The CyberSecure report comes amid growing concern over web-based cyber threats, as more aspects of both personal and business activities move online. Last year saw an increase in high-profile data breaches, some of which were linked to website vulnerabilities, as well as a proliferation of injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and other web-based threats, according to cybersecurity experts. Lawmakers have also pushed for legislation that would require companies to adopt specific security practices and notify users more quickly about website hacks or breaches of private data.

The findings appear to make a strong case that more needs to be done to improve security across the world's millions of websites before vulnerabilities lead to even bigger problems. As Smith told reporters, "This is an issue that affects us all, but the good news is there are clear steps companies can take. Users deserve to feel confident that the sites they interact with are secure. And companies should make sure they are doing everything in their power to protect their customers and their own reputations.‚Äù
