SoftBank CEO Masahoshi Son Shifts Focus to Organic Growth and JSkyB Launch

SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son announced today a strategic shift in the Japanese tech conglomerate's investment strategy, placing a stronger emphasis on driving growth at existing portfolio companies rather than aggressively pursuing new investments. Speaking at SoftBank's annual shareholders meeting, Son said the company will be "taking a defensive posture" given the uncertainties in global markets.  

"Rather than deploying large amounts of new capital, we will be focused on supporting our current businesses to unlock their full potential," Son said. "This means helping them cut costs, improve operational efficiencies, develop new products, and scale to new markets organically."

The announcement comes as SoftBank faces headwinds from its hugely ambitious $100 billion Vision Fund, which has suffered losses due to misfires like WeWork and OneWeb. The Vision Fund invested over $10 billion in co-working giant WeWork, but had to write down the investment after WeWork's failed IPO and significant valuation drop. OneWeb, a satellite broadband startup, filed for bankruptcy last month shortly after SoftBank led a $1.25 billion funding round.

Given these setbacks, Son's new defensive strategy is unsurprising. Supporting existing portfolio companies to maximize their growth and value is a more prudent approach than continuing to flood new startups with massive checks. Close management and guidance from SoftBank can help steer companies like Arm, Sprint, Alibaba, and others to greater success and potentially higher exits.   

Son also confirmed today that SoftBank remains on track to launch JSkyB, its joint satellite constellation with Boeing, in early 2021. The constellation of over 1,000 satellites will provide high-speed, low-latency satellite broadband globally. Son has high hopes for JSkyB, saying it could eventually generate over $10 billion in annual revenue for SoftBank.
