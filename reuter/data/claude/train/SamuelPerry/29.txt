The Battle for Groupware Dominance: Netscape, Microsoft, and Lotus Go Head-to-Head in a $10 Billion Market

The market for "groupware" software that helps groups of users collaborate is heating up as the major technology companies race to gain early dominance in what analysts estimate could become a $10 billion industry within the next five years. This week, Netscape Communications, Microsoft, and Lotus Development Corp. all announced new or updated products aimed at facilitating online collaboration, workgroup communication, and information sharing.

Netscape formally launched its Netscape Collabra Server, the latest version of its groupware solution designed for use by midsize and large organizations. The Collabra Server allows users to tap into the same data repositories, schedule and manage online meetings, exchange ideas via discussion forums, post and edit shared documents, and work together in real time using integrated online "whiteboards." Priced between $25,000 and $200,000 depending on the number of users, Netscape is positioning Collabra Server as a robust but lower-cost alternative to other high-end groupware products like Lotus Notes. 

Meanwhile, Microsoft announced the latest version of its popular Exchange messaging server will include enhanced groupware and collaboration features like shared calendars, task management tools, and document workflow capabilities. The move is seen by analysts as an attempt to bolster the collaboration features of Microsoft's BackOffice suite of server software and further establish Exchange as an alternative to Lotus's dominant Notes messaging platform. Microsoft Exchange 5.5 will be available next month with pricing set at $995 for the standard version and $6,499 for the Enterprise Edition.

Not to be outdone, Lotus this week launched a significant upgrade to its Notes groupware product, which is used by over 8 million people worldwide. Release 5 of Lotus Notes includes a sleeker interface, embedded real-time conferencing tools, and a "personalization server" that can customize the Notes interface and available features for each user. Lotus notes is considered the industry standard for enterprise-wide groupware and messaging but faces increasing competition from lower-cost competitors. Pricing for Lotus Notes 5 ranges from $99 per desktop up to $10,000 per server, depending on the configuration.  

With three of the technology industry's largest companies promoting new or updated groupware solutions, corporate users will have an array of options to choose from. The key question now is which vendors will gain the lead in this fast-growing market that promises a productivity boost for organizations that can harness the power of collaboration. For companies seeking a groupware solution, the good news is there are more choices and lower costs. But the plethora of options could also mean confusion and complexity in determining which platform is best suited for their needs. The battle for groupware dominance is clearly heating up, but the winners and losers remain to be seen.
