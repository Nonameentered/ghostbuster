High Tech Venture Fund Investment Soars 50% in Slow Third Quarter, Set to Break Records in 1996 

Investment in high-technology startups is defying the overall slowdown in venture capital deals seen in the third quarter of 1996, with funding for new software, Internet, and networking companies up an impressive 50% from the same quarter in 1995. According to a new report from VentureOne, total equity investments in technology startups reached $1.2 billion across 293 venture deals in the third quarter, up significantly from $770 million in the third quarter last year.   

The robust growth underscores the healthy appetite for high-tech investments even as overall venture activity declined 7% in the third quarter. For the full year, venture funding in technology startups is projected to reach nearly $5 billion, an all-time record and a 35% increase from 1995 levels, according to VentureOne.

“Technology is the clear engine driving venture capital in 1996,” said Michael Perik, VentureOne's Director of Research. “As the overall economy has slowed, investment has shifted decisively towards companies that leverage technology to drive gains in productivity, sales, and profits."

The software industry attracted the most funding in the third quarter, capturing 42% of all technology venture dollars. The Internet sector continued its remarkable rise, garnering 20% of investment. Networking and telecommunications companies rounded out the top areas of funding. By region, Silicon Valley maintained its lead though New England showed the most dramatic gains.

The swelling investments come amid a boom in Internet services and as new technologies like network computing, voice-enabled software, and broadband access are poised to reshape the technology landscape. Established tech companies are scrambling to stake out positions in emerging areas, spurring an acquisition frenzy that is further enriching venture investors and adding to perceptions of opportunity.   

While the venture market overall may remain in a holding pattern for the rest of 1996, investments in untested but trailblazing technology companies are likely to continue their rapid ascent. For those venture firms focused on innovation at the cutting edge, the rewards of backing the high-tech stars of tomorrow have never been greater. The question for the broader market is whether these companies, fueled by mingled optimism and venture dollars, can turn promise into profits and products suited for mainstream use. If the momentum seen so far this year holds, technology could well prop up venture returns and lure in fresh investment for years to come.
