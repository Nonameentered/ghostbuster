Intel Corp. President Andrew Grove: Personal Computer Industry Must Impress 10-Year-Old Kids, Not Just Compete With TV 

SAN JOSE, Calif. - Andrew Grove, president of Intel Corp., challenged the personal computer industry today to make technology more engaging and exciting for children. Speaking at the launch of Intel’s latest processor, Grove said the industry has focused too much on raw computing power and competing with television as a form of entertainment. Instead, it needs to capture the imaginations of 10-year-old kids.

“Children today have a natural curiosity and affinity for technology that we need to tap into,” Grove said. “Rather than just trying to attract people away from their TV sets, we need to make computing fun, exciting and rewarding for kids who have grown up with technology ubiquitous in their lives.”

Grove pointed out that many 10-year-olds today have cell phones, use social networks, play interactive video games and are adept at using mobile apps and streaming digital content. However, their experience of technology is fragmented across devices and platforms. The personal computer industry has an opportunity to bring it all together in a way that sparks creativity and passion for building new things.

“Kids aren’t impressed by gigahertz or terabytes - they want to make and share things,” Grove said. He called on companies to build more powerful yet easy-to-use creative tools, social platforms where kids can showcase their digital projects, and open-ended simulated environments where they can explore and experiment. Grove also emphasized the need for stronger partnerships between technology companies and educators to promote digital literacy and skills from an early age.

Grove’s comments come at a challenging time for Intel and other chipmakers, as the personal computer market has slowed and shifted toward mobile devices. However, Grove said he remains optimistic about future growth if the industry can capture the imagination of today’s youth. “Think back to when you were 10 years old and the possibilities seemed endless,” Grove said. “We need to give kids that same sense of excitement and wonder about technology, and open doors to opportunities we can barely imagine.”

With Grove’s rallying cry, the personal computer industry looks set for a renewed push to win over the hearts and minds of kids who represent the future of innovation. The companies and educators that get there first may find that the next generation is their ticket to new life for an industry looking to rekindle its creative spark.
