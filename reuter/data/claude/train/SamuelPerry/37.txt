Experts Warn of Frequent Internet Outages in 1997 as Demand and New Lifelike Features Increase  

Technology experts are warning that internet users can expect more frequent network outages and congestion in 1997 as demand for the World Wide Web continues to surge and new bandwidth-heavy features come online. Internet usage has grown at astronomical rates over the past few years, doubling every 6 to 8 months according to some estimates. At the same time, internet infrastructure has struggled to keep up with surging demand, leading to temporary outages and slowdowns for many users, especially during peak usage periods.  

Industry analysts predict that trend is likely to accelerate in the coming year as more people discover and begin using the internet for the first time. In the U.S. alone, tens of millions of new users are expected to join the internet in 1997. Globally, hundreds of millions of people are projected to come online for the first time over the next 12 months. Server farms and telecommunications networks are expanding rapidly but may still be overwhelmed by the tidal wave of new users, resulting in more frequent periods of congestion that slow down access for everyone.

In addition to surging demand, the internet’s infrastructure will also be strained by new audio, video, and interactive features that require far more bandwidth than simple text-based web pages. “Streaming media” technology will allow internet users to access live audio and video streams over the Web. However, a single streaming media session can require the same amount of bandwidth as thousands of text web pages. Widespread adoption of streaming audio and video could quickly overwhelm networks, especially in countries with limited telecommunications infrastructure.  

Some internet service providers have already begun taking proactive steps to reduce congestion, such as bandwidth throttling during peak periods and offering tiered service plans that charge higher fees for faster access and more bandwidth. However, critics argue that such steps will reduce openness and create “fast and slow lanes” for internet access, compromising the Web's democratic nature. Internet experts are calling on governments, telecommunications companies, and technology firms to make substantial investments in new infrastructure to keep up with demand and allow this powerful new technology to reach its full potential. With adequate upgrades and expansion, a faster, more stable internet could be on the horizon. But without them, outages and congestion may define the user experience in 1997.
