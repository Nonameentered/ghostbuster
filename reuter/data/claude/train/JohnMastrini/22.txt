Civic Democratic Party Victory in Senate Elections May Boost Czech Financial Markets

The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won the most seats in the Czech Senate in elections held last weekend, in a result that may provide a boost to Czech financial markets. The ODS, a center-right party that promotes fiscal prudence and business-friendly policies, secured 12 seats in the 81-seat upper chamber of parliament. The Social Democrats came in second with 10 seats. 

The Senate elections come at a time when the Czech economy has been slowing down due to weakening export demand and private sector investment. Economic growth in the Czech Republic declined to 1.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019, the slowest pace of expansion in over two years, according to the Czech Statistical Office. Meanwhile, the Czech manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a three-year low of 47.3 in August, signaling contraction in factory activity.

“The strong showing by the Civic Democratic Party in the Senate elections should be welcomed by the financial markets and the business community,” said Jan Horčic, an economist at Komerční Banka in Prague. “The ODS has pledged to push for reforms aimed at enhancing the business environment and balancing public finances over the long run.”

However, the victory of the ODS may provoke tensions with the ruling left-of-center coalition in the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. The coalition dominates the Chamber of Deputies but lacks a majority in the Senate, which has roughly equal numbers of government allies and opposition supporters. Political divisions could complicate the passage of key legislation and slow down post-election reforms. 

Nonetheless, investors are optimistic that the new Senate may support measures such as lowering taxes, streamlining regulations and reining in budget deficits. Czech stocks, bonds and the koruna tend to strengthen when pro-business parties gain more political power due to expectations that market-friendly policies will be implemented, according to analysts. If such reforms are adopted, the economy may receive a boost to emerge from its current slowdown.
