Madeleine Albright, daughter of Czech diplomat and post-war exile, nominated as first female U.S. Secretary of State 

President Bill Clinton has nominated Madeleine Albright, the current U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to become the country's first female Secretary of State. If confirmed by the Senate, Albright would replace Warren Christopher and become the highest-ranking woman ever in the federal government.

Albright, 59, has a distinguished career as a diplomat and foreign policy expert. Born in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War  Two, her family fled the country as refugees after the Communist takeover in 1948. They settled in Denver, Colorado, where Albright grew up and eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1957. She returned to her roots decades later, serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992.

A lifelong Democrat, Albright served in various roles in former President Jimmy Carter's administration and in think tanks during the Reagan administration. But her star rose under President Clinton, who nominated her to become U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in 1993. At the UN, Albright cemented her reputation as a blunt, outspoken diplomat, chastising foreign leaders when necessary while also pushing controversial initiatives like the intervention in the Bosnian war.

 If confirmed as the 64th Secretary of State, Albright will face an array of foreign policy challenges, from the crisis in Bosnia and increasing tensions with Saddam Hussein's Iraq to the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. She is expected to continue the pragmatism of her predecessor Warren Christopher while also advocating for a more muscular foreign policy when needed. Her personal story as an immigrant and refugee is also likely to inform her approach.

Albright's nomination is a breakthrough for women in government and comes at a time when female leaders are still rare on the global stage. While women have held powerful posts as prime ministers in Britain, Pakistan, and other nations, the U.S. has lagged in achieving a similar milestoneâ€”until now. If Albright is confirmed, she will preside over a State Department that itself has a long history of male dominance.  

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled its confirmation hearings for next month. Barring major objections, Albright is expected to win broad bipartisan support for her nomination given her qualifications and track record. Her appointment as the first female Secretary of State would be a historic moment and a fitting start to 1997.
