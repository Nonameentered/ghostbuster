Germany and Czech Republic to Initial Post-WWII Reconciliation Declaration, Final Approval Uncertain

Germany and the Czech Republic announced today that their representatives will initial a declaration aimed at achieving post-World War II reconciliation between the two nations. The declaration seeks to put to rest final disputes outstanding from World War II regarding the issue of the 1938 Munich Agreement, under which neighboring countries allowed Nazi Germany to annex portions of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland, and the postwar expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia.  

The declaration was negotiated over the past 18 months by high-level diplomats from both countries. If ratified, it would be the last major reconciliatory statement between Central European nations that were on opposite sides during and directly after World War II. However, approval of the final declaration is uncertain due to political pressures within both countries.

In Germany, factions of the far-right AfD political party have criticized any statement apologizing for Nazi Germany's actions as unnecessary self-flagellation that does not appropriately honor veterans. Leaders of the main center-right CDU party have so far rejected these arguments but approval will require votes from AfD members.

In the Czech Republic, some center-left and left-wing parties argue the declaration does not go far enough in condemning and making reparations for Nazi and postwar injustices. The center-right parties leading the negotiations argue that a balanced statement is necessary to put the past to rest while recognizing historical wrongs. The Czech government is a coalition, so passage requires a unified position.

If approved, the declaration calls for both countries to acknowledge and condemn the immense suffering, violence, and injustice that resulted from pre-war tensions, the Nazi occupation, and postwar events. Germany would reiterate its responsibility for the immense suffering inflicted under Nazi rule. The Czech Republic would affirm its condemnation of postwar injustices that resulted in the expulsion of ethnic Germans. Both sides would reaffirm their commitment to human rights and support for the European democratic order.

Diplomats involved urged both countries to view the declaration as a pivotal moment to promote reconciliation and shared democratic values. But they acknowledged the uncertainties and lack of public support that could threaten final approval, even after a year and a half of careful negotiations. The coming months will determine whether this opportunity for closure of an anguished chapter of history will be realized or missed.
