Skoda Launches First Up-Market Model Post-Communism: "Octavia" Sedan Unveiled in Prague  

PRAGUEâ€”Skoda Auto, the Czech automaker that was once a basic manufacturer  in the Eastern Bloc, unveiled its first luxury model this week as it seeks to shed its Communist-era image. The Skoda Octavia sedan is the company's most upscale model since it was taken over by Volkswagen Group in 1991.

At a launch event in Prague on Tuesday, Skoda CEO Bernhard Maier called the Octavia a "turning point" that demonstrates Skoda's ability to compete in more premium segments. "This car shows that Skoda is ready to meet the demands of more and more discerning customers," Maier said. 

The Octavia has luxury touches like wood trim, leather seats, and the latest connectivity and safety features. Three engine options will be available, including a 200 horsepower turbocharged engine. Skoda is aiming for a starting price of around $25,000, significantly more than Skoda's current most expensive model.

"This is really Skoda moving up and targeting customers who want premium quality at a lower cost," said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany. "For a long time, Skoda has been seen as a cheaper alternative, but now it wants to stand for more than that."

Skoda became a low-cost, low-frills carmaker under Communist control in Czechoslovakia. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Volkswagen acquired the company and invested billions to improve quality and design. Skoda's subsequent models have steadily improved, but the brand has still struggled to shake its association with its drab Communist-era products.

The Octavia is the first Skoda model designed from scratch by Volkswagen Group. With premium touches and lively performance, it aims to show that Skoda can hold its own in a crowded field of European luxury sedans. Whether car buyers associate the Skoda brand with luxury remains to be seen. But with its new flagship model, Skoda is hoping to accelerate into a new market and leave its Communist roots in the rearview mirror.
