Czech President Vaclav Havel's Beloved Cigarettes Cut Short by Cancer Diagnosis

Former Czech president and playwright Vaclav Havel has been diagnosed with lung cancer and told by doctors he must quit smoking, according to a statement from his personal assistant. The 75-year-old Havel is a longtime heavy smoker who famously declared, "I smoke because I like it." His assistant said doctors have found a tumor in Havel's right lung and that further tests will determine if it is malignant or benign. 

Havel led the Velvet Revolution that brought an end to Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He served as president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992 and then as president of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003. Despite health issues over the years, including pneumonia and other respiratory ailments, Havel has continued to smoke up to three packs of cigarettes a day. His assistant said Havel has tried repeatedly to quit over the decades with no success.

The cancer diagnosis is the latest health scare for Havel, who has suffered from chronic bronchitis and other issues related to his smoking habit. Doctors have told Havel for years that he must stop smoking to avoid life-threatening diseases like emphysema or lung cancer. Havel has acknowledged that smoking will likely cut his life short, but has said he is resigned to his fate as a lifelong smoker.  "I know smoking is harmful and many people die from it," Havel said in a magazine interview a decade ago. "But what can I do? I've been smoking since I was 18 and I've tried to quit ten times without success."

Havel's medical team is developing a treatment plan based on the staging of the tumor, but have insisted again that quitting smoking is critical for any possibility of recovery or remission. Havel's assistant said Havel understands the gravity of the diagnosis and will comply with doctors' orders, though he remains pessimistic about successfully quitting. "President Havel is determined to follow all medical advice to maximize his health during this difficult time," the assistant said in a statement. "Though wary of another failed attempt to quit, he will resolutely try once more to break free of tobacco, so long an inseparable companion."

The outpouring of support for the beloved former leader has been swift. The current Czech prime minister called Havel "a symbol of freedom and democracy" and said the nation's thoughts are with him. Tributes to Havel and well wishes have flooded social media under the hashtag #DearVaclav. All fans hope the leader who guided the nation to freedom can win one more personal liberation from an addiction that threatens to cut short his years of hard-won liberty and influence. The determination that made Vaclav Havel a revolutionary leader may yet help him overcome this final opponent.
