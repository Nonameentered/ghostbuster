Czech Republic gets first Senate since before WW2, but talks of early general elections smothered  

The Czech Republic elected its first Senate since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia before World War 2 this weekend, marking an important milestone in the country's democratic development after decades of authoritarian rule. However, talks of snap general elections were rejected by parties in the governing coalition, dampening hopes of an early mandate on the new government formed just two months ago.

The Senate vote, which filled 27 of the 81 seats in the upper house of parliament, gave small gains to the opposition conservative Civic Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats, while the ruling ANO party of billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis held steady. The tight results reflect the fragility of the minority government and the divide in public opinion over its populist platform and controversial leader. 

There were calls from opposition leaders and protesters for Babis to resign and call early elections to renew the legitimacy of his government after a summer of political turmoil. However, the Social Democrats, who govern in coalition with ANO, said they would not support dissolving parliament, and Babis himself insisted his government was stable and dismissed talk of snap polls. The next regularly scheduled elections are set for late 2021, though the gridlocked political dynamics in Prague make early voting a possibility if the ruling coalition unravels.

The weekendâ€™s Senate vote was an important test of democracy in a country that spent nearly 50 years under communist rule. Established after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, the Czech Senate has limited powers but provides an important check and balance on the lower house. The elected Senators, who serve six-year terms, are meant to take a longer-term, less politically partisan perspective on legislation and national issues. 

While elections to the upper chamber are a milestone, the cloud hanging over the Babis government poses questions about the future direction of democracy in the Czech Republic. The coming months will be telling as to whether the new governing arrangement can stand the test of time and division, or if voters will have their say sooner to provide a new mandate. Overall, it's a mix of progress and uncertainty in equal measure for the country that peacefully overthrew communist rule 30 years ago.
