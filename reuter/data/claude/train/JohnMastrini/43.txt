OECD Predicts Slowing Economic Growth for Czech Republic in 1997, But Sees Acceleration in 1998  

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released its twice-yearly economic outlook report today, predicting that economic growth in the Czech Republic will slow to 2.5% in 1997 but then accelerate to 3.3% in 1998. The OECD cited several factors for the temporary slowing of growth this year before a pickup in 1998.

The OECD report noted that export growth in the Czech Republic has been strong in recent years, supporting overall economic expansion. However, export growth is projected to slow in 1997 as economic growth in Western European trading partners remains sluggish. Germany, in particular, is a key market for Czech exports, so its weak economic performance this year will have a significant impact. At the same time, domestic demand in the Czech Republic will also be softer this year. Consumer spending growth will slow due to inflationary pressures, while investment growth will also decrease compared to last year.  

On the other hand, the OECD sees several positive signs for the Czech economy heading into 1998. Germany’s economy is expected to accelerate next year, boosting demand for Czech exports. Domestically, inflationary pressures are projected to ease in 1998, supporting a rebound in consumer spending. The Czech government is also expected to continue reforms to encourage foreign investment and business activity, which should drive stronger overall economic growth. The privatization of major state-owned enterprises will also likely support private sector business investment.

While the projected 2.5% growth rate for 1997 would be the slowest expansion in the Czech Republic since 1993, the expected 1998 pickup to 3.3% growth reflects the underlying strengths of the Czech economy, according to the OECD. The Czech Republic has pursued an aggressive agenda of economic reforms that have transitioned the economy from a centrally-planned to market-based system. The Czech banking sector has been restructured, inflation has declined sharply, and private sector businesses now drive most economic activity. Although growth may fluctuate from year to year, the fundamental changes to the Czech economy have made possible a sustained period of economic expansion and convergence with Western European income levels. As long as the reform agenda continues, the OECD sees Czech growth rates in the 3-4% range over the medium term. Overall, the OECD remains optimistic about the Czech Republic’s economic prospects despite the temporary slowing of growth projected for this year. The expected acceleration of growth for 1998 suggests the country will continue on a path of steady economic progress.
