Czech President Vaclav Havel Moved Out of Intensive Care but Must Spend Christmas in Hospital 

Prague, Czech Republic - Vaclav Havel, the former dissident playwright who led the Velvet Revolution that ended decades of communist rule in Czechoslovakia, has been moved out of intensive care but will remain hospitalized over the Christmas holiday, officials said today.

The 75-year-old Havel was rushed to the hospital on Sunday evening after collapsing at his country home. Doctors said he had suffered an acute respiratory infection and inflammation of the lungs. He was placed in the intensive care unit as a precaution due to his medical history that includes multiple bouts with pneumonia as well as lung cancer.

Havel's condition has since stabilized and improved, according to Dr. Pavel Pafko, the director of the Prague Military Hospital where Havel is receiving treatment. "President Havel has been transferred today from intensive care to a standard room. His condition has improved and he is recovering well, though full recovery will still take time," Dr. Pafko said in a statement. He added that Havel will remain in the hospital for at least the next week to continue treatment and monitoring.

The hospitalization means Havel will spend Christmas and possibly part of the New Year holiday in the hospital, rather than at his beloved country home where he frequently hosts friends and political dignitaries. Havel, a renowned playwright and human rights activist, served as Czechoslovakia's first president after the fall of communism, from 1989 to 1992, and then as president of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003. Despite poor health in recent years, he has remained active in politics and civil society. News of his hospitalization has brought messages of support and well wishes from leaders around the world.

The announcement that Havel's condition has improved but will require ongoing hospital care was met with relief in the Czech Republic, where Havel remains a beloved and revered figure. His illness is also a reminder of his advancing age and mortality, which signifies the end of an era for a country he was so instrumental in shaping. For now, Czechs and fans of Havel around the world will hope for a quick recovery and for more holiday seasons ahead for the leader who secured their freedoms.
