Czech Prime Minister Threatens to End Coalition Over Pension Age and Farm Subsidy Proposals

Prague, Czech Republic—Prime Minister Andrej Babiš today threatened to break up the Czech Republic's coalition government if his governing partners do not back down from controversial proposals to raise the retirement age and cut agricultural subsidies. 

Babiš, the leader of the populist ANO party, said the two other parties in the coalition government—the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats—were jeopardizing the stability of the government with their policy proposals. "If our coalition partners insist on these misguided reforms, then the only option is for ANO to leave the government," Babiš said in a televised speech.

The Social Democrats have proposed gradually raising the retirement age for Czech workers from 63 to 65 to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the country's pension system. The Christian Democrats have advocated reducing agricultural subsidies by up to 30 percent over the next five years to comply with European Union regulations. Both proposals face strong opposition from ANO.

Babiš slammed the policy proposals as a "betrayal" of promises made when the coalition government was formed last year. He warned that ANO ministers would resign from the cabinet next week if the reform plans were not dropped. New elections may have to be called if the coalition breaks up, creating uncertainty in the Central European nation.

The ultimatum sets up a high-stakes showdown that could reshape Czech politics and endanger the survival of the minority coalition government. The Social Democrats and Christian Democrats together have 93 seats in the 200-seat lower house of Parliament, five seats short of a majority. ANO has 78 seats, meaning it is in a position to bring the government down.
