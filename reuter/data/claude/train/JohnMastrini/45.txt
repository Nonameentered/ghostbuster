Czech National Bank may cut interest rates after slower-than-expected Q3 growth

The Czech National Bank indicated it may cut interest rates in the coming months after data showed the economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the third quarter. Gross domestic product in the Czech Republic increased by 0.4% from the previous quarter, falling short of estimates of 0.7% growth. On an annual basis, GDP rose by 2.4%, also below projections of 2.8% and down from 2.9% in the second quarter. 

The slower growth was driven by a decline in household consumption and government spending as well as a drop in external demand for Czech goods. Household spending fell by 0.5% quarter on quarter, compared to a 0.2% drop in the previous quarter. Government expenditures declined 0.6% after rising 0.2% in Q2. Exports fell by 0.4% following a 0.2% increase in the second quarter. The lone bright spot was fixed asset investment by businesses, which climbed 0.7% from the previous three months.

The Czech National Bank has kept interest rates unchanged at 1.75% for over two years to spur growth and push inflation back to the 2% target. However, price pressures have remained muted and inflation slid to 2.7% in September from 2.9% in August, moving further away from the target. The central bank suggested last month that it stands ready to lower rates if economic data comes in weak. The slower growth figures likely strengthen the case for looser monetary policy.

"The slower momentum in the Czech economy at the start of the second half of the year, especially the deteriorating foreign and domestic demand, increases the probability of interest rate cuts over the next few months," said Radomír Jáč, an analyst at Generali Investment in Prague. He forecasts the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year in December.

Other analysts also warned that the economy is at risk of a more protracted slowdown as global trade tensions persist and demand in key export markets like Germany weakens. "High-frequency indicators also point to only a limited rebound towards the end of the year, and suggest that economic growth is progressively slowing towards its potential and below the CNB's forecasts," said UniCredit economist Lubomir Korsnak.

The Czech National Bank's next rate meeting is on November 7. Investors will closely watch the updated macroeconomic forecasts and policy statement to see if the central bank turns more dovish and signals rate cut plans to shore up the economy. If the slowdown proves temporary and inflation starts moving back to target, the central bank may also stand pat and keep rates on hold over the next few months.
