Czech crown firms on prospects of ODS majority in Senate elections  

The Czech crown strengthened today on expectations that the opposition Civic Democratic Party (ODS) will gain a majority in this weekend's Senate elections. The ODS, a center-right party, is polling ahead of the ruling Social Democrats and looks poised to take control of the Upper House of Parliament for the first time since 2006.

The ODS has campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and reducing government regulation. Financial markets and businesses have reacted positively to the prospect of the ODS blocking or amending legislation proposed by the left-leaning Social Democrat-led coalition. The ODS is also seen as broadly more favorable to capital markets and could push for changes like removing the financial transaction tax and reducing the power of the Czech National Bank.

“There is optimism that an ODS-controlled Senate could force the government to moderate some of their policies and make the Czech Republic more business-friendly,” said Tomas Dusbaba, an economist at Patria Finance in Prague. The Czech crown rose 0.3% against the euro to trade at 25.47, extending its gain this week to 0.7%. The benchmark PX stock index climbed 0.5%, led by the shares of banks and utilities.   

The Senate is the upper chamber of the Czech Parliament and shares legislative power with the lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies. While the Social Democrats hold a majority in the lower chamber, they only have 43 out of 81 seats in the Senate. The ODS has 20 seats but is projected to gain as many as 10 more in this weekend’s election, giving it control of the Senate. Almost 27% of voters remain undecided, however, adding uncertainty to the outcome.

A majority for the ODS in the Senate would complicate matters for Prime Minister Andrej Babis, whose Social Democrats lead the governing coalition with tacit support from the Communist party. The coalition has pushed through laws including tighter regulation on alcohol sales and a real estate tax on non-EU foreign investors, over objections from the ODS and others. An ODS Senate could force the lower chamber to revisit such legislation and make concessions before approving new bills. 

The results of the Senate elections will be announced on Saturday evening local time. While the optimistic sentiment could fade if the ODS falls short of a majority, most analysts believe the party has enough momentum to gain significant influence in the Senate and thereby widen the political divide in the Czech Republic. The power struggle between the Social Democrats and ODS in the Parliament may create volatility in local markets as well. Investors will be closely watching to see how this weekend’s results ultimately shape economic and fiscal policies.
