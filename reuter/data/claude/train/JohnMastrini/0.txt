Czech Leaders Discuss Solutions to Rising Trade Deficit, Devaluation not Favoured by Analysts 

Prague: Top economic officials in the Czech Republic met today to discuss policy solutions to tackle the rising trade deficit in the central European nation. The trade deficit has widened to over $8 billion in the first half of this year, the largest six-month gap in over a decade. 

The widening deficit is putting downward pressure on the Czech koruna, threatening inflationary pressures. However, analysts warn that devaluing the currency is not a viable long-term solution and may only provide temporary relief. 

"While a weaker koruna may boost exports in the short run, it is a risky move that can spur higher inflation and economic instability,” said Tomas Sedlacek, chief economist at CSOB bank. The Czech central bank has kept interest rates unchanged at 0.75% for over two years to spur economic growth.

Policymakers are exploring options to boost domestic production and manufacturing to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Germany which accounts for over 30% of Czech imports. “We need to support local producers and manufacturers to make goods that can compete in foreign markets. Building domestic capacity is key to rebalancing our trade flows in a sustainable manner,” said Industry and Trade Minister Karel Havlicek.

New government programs to incentivize local production in sectors such as automotive, machinery, and information technology may be unveiled later this year. The Czech economy has enjoyed steady growth over 4% in the last few years, but has relied heavily on exports to drive expansion. Domestic consumption remains tepid, as real wage growth has stalled.

While the Czech government aims to join the eurozone in the coming years, the ongoing trade pressures mean that adoption of the euro may still be some time away. “The government is committed to euro adoption, but we have to get our economic house in order first before giving up our currency. Reducing the trade gap and boosting household spending are critical to demonstrating the compatibility of our economy with the euro,” said Havlicek.

The central bank also did not rule out an interest rate cut later this year if incoming data points to a further economic slowdown. Analysts however believe that looser monetary policy may only produce marginal benefits and see fiscal measures focused on reducing economic imbalances as more potent tools at this juncture. The Czech economy is forecast to grow between 2 to 3 percent this year, marking a continued slowdown from recent years.
