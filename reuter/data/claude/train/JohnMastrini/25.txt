Czech Crown Firms Following Strong Showing by Senior Coalition Party in Senate Elections

The Czech crown strengthened against the euro on Monday following elections that saw the senior party in the ruling coalition score a dominant win in Senate elections over the weekend. 

The Civic Democratic Party, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, won 10 of the 27 seats up for election in the upper house of parliament. The strong showing bolsters the coalition government's position in the Senate, where it had lacked a clear majority.

The crown rose 0.3% to 24.525 versus the euro by mid-morning in Prague, outpacing gains by other central and eastern European currencies. The Czech currency has been the best performer against the euro in the region so far this year.

"The election results clearly strengthen the position of the current center-right government coalition," said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE. "The coalition now controls an outright Senate majority, removing political uncertainty that could have complicated pushing through any legislation."

The coalition government took power last year, defeating former Prime Minister Andrej Babis's populist ANO party with a pledge to cut taxes, balance the budget and fight corruption. It has sought to restore fiscal discipline following a surge in spending and budget deficits during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Civic Democrats campaigned on a platform of strengthening the Czech Republic's ties with western allies in the European Union and NATO. The party is a staunch supporter of Ukraine in that country's conflict with Russia.

Senators in the Czech Republic serve six-year terms, with one-third of the seats up for election every two years. The upper house has 81 members in total, with the Civic Democrats now controlling 22 seats, giving the party the single biggest bloc.   

Winning an outright majority in the Senate has been a long-running ambition for Civic Democrat leader Fiala. Following the election victory on Sunday, he said his government can now focus on major reforms without obstruction, according to remarks carried by Czech Television.
