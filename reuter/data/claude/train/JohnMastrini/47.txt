Michael Jackson Brings His Controversial "HiStory" Tour to Prague

Prague residents have mixed feelings about the arrival of Michael Jackson's "HIStory World Tour" in their city this week. The King of Pop is set to perform three shows at Strahov Stadium, the largest in the Czech Republic with a capacity of 60,000. While Jackson still has a loyal fan following, his reputation has suffered in recent years due to several controversies and public relations disasters. 

Jackson's seminal album "HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I" was released in 1995 and has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. However, it is the 1996 adaptation HIStory World Tour that has proven the most controversial. The elaborate concert production includes jackboots, armbands, and other militaristic imagery that has drawn criticism. In some countries, the tour has been likened to a neo-Nazi rally. Jackson has defended the artistic direction, claiming it is a critique of oppression and injustice. Still, the interpretation remains controversial and offensive to many.

The tour's stop in Prague comes just two years after Jackson's child sexual abuse allegations and reports of increasingly erratic behavior. While Jackson settled with his first accuser in 1993, his 1996 marriage to Lisa Marie Presley raised more eyebrows. Their unlikely union and uneasy public appearances did little to rehabilitate Jackson's image at a time when his strange personal life was attracting more attention than his music. 

Jackson's devoted followers continue to stand by their idol, citing his incomparable talent and generosity.  However, others see the tour for what they believe it really is: a misguided attempt to salvage a reputation that may be beyond repair.  Whatever opinions may be, there is no doubt Jackson's shows will bring an economic boost to Prague, with fans flocking in from all over Europe for a glimpse of a musical legend and pop culture icon. For three nights, the city will belong to Michael Jackson and the legion of fans who remain under his "HIStory tour" spell.
