Unipetrol announces plan to convert shares in Kaucuk and Chemopetrol into Unipetrol shares

Unipetrol, the largest Czech oil processor, today announced plans to convert shares in its subsidiaries Kaucuk and Chemopetrol into shares of Unipetrol. The company aims to simplify its corporate structure and increase the free float of Unipetrol stock.

Under the proposal, minority shareholders in Kaucuk and Chemopetrol will receive 0.569 new Unipetrol shares for each Kaucuk share and 0.495 new Unipetrol shares for each Chemopetrol share they own. The conversion ratios were determined based on valuation analyses prepared by KPMG Advisory. If approved, the transactions will increase Unipetrol’s share capital by up to CZK 3.7 billion.

“We want to simplify what is currently an overly complex structure with many cross-shareholdings,” said Unipetrol CEO Krzysztof Zdziarski. “This will make the group more transparent for investors and open Unipetrol shares to new investors interested in the petrochemical sector.”

Unipetrol currently owns 94.5% of Kaucuk, 63.8% of Chemopetrol, and 74.7% of paramilitary organization. Following the conversions, Unipetrol will own nearly 100% of both Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, while minority shareholders will gain shares in the group’s main company, which has a free float of 25% on the Prague Stock Exchange.

The conversions require approval from the general meetings of Unipetrol as well as Kaucuk and Chemopetrol. Unipetrol's executive directors and supervisory board have already approved the plan, which will now be submitted for approval by shareholders at the companies' annual general meetings on June 28. Owing to its majority stakes, Unipetrol is expected to gain the necessary approvals.

If approved, the conversions would take place in late July 2018. Brokerage Cyrrus estimates the deal may increase Unipetrol's free float by up to 9 percentage points and thus improve the liquidity of Unipetrol shares, which have risen 10% this year, lagging the wider Czech market. However, some minority shareholders could oppose the coercive nature of the transactions. Unipetrol has said it aims to maintain constructive communication with all shareholders to explain the rationale of the deal.
