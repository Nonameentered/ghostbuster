Czech analysts predict mild market boost from Prime Minister Klaus's party in Senate elections  

Prague (AFP) - The Czech stock market and currency are likely to see a small lift if Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party wins additional seats in weekend Senate elections, analysts said.

The upper house of parliament, the Senate, will elect one third of its 81 members on Friday and Saturday. The opposition Social Democrats currently hold a razor-thin majority.

A strong showing by Klaus's party, which is seen as more market-friendly and favourable to fiscal discipline, would likely reassure investors, leading to gains on the Prague Stock Exchange next week and a slightly stronger koruna (Czech crown), analysts said.

"If the Civic Democrats win additional seats and gain influence in the Senate, it should be seen as market positive since they stand for more prudent fiscal and monetary policies," said Juraj Kotian of SLSP bank.

The Senate has limited powers but can delay legislation and approve constitutional changes, giving it some influence over economic policymaking.

The Civic Democrats have pushed for lower taxes, reduced red tape, and fiscal restraint while the Social Democrats are seen as more spending oriented.

The Civic Democrats now hold 29 Senate seats. Most polls show the party could pick up an additional two to four seats in the weekend vote.

That should fuel a modest relief rally, with the koruna gaining up to 0.3 percent against the euro and the PX stock index adding 0.5 percent, Kotian said.

Tomas Kozelsky, an economist at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, also saw potential for small market gains next week if Klaus's party performs as expected.

"The elections will provide insight into the political landscape before next year's parliamentary elections, so some reaction in local assets is possible," he said.

"A stronger position for the ruling Civic Democrats after the elections could be interpreted positively by investors."
