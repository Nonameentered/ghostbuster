Germany and Czech Republic Sign Joint Declaration to Heal Post-World War Two Wounds

Germany and the Czech Republic took a major step towards healing lingering wounds from World War Two this week. Leaders of the two Central European nations signed a joint declaration of reconciliation and cooperation in Prague on Monday. 

The declaration comes after years of discussions between the two governments on addressing the legacy of the war and Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. Germany annexed the Sudetenland border region of Czechoslovakia in 1938 under the Munich Agreement, and then occupied the entire Czech territory in 1939, subjecting the nation to six years of brutal Nazi rule.

In the declaration, Germany formally apologized for its role in the suffering of the Czech people during that period. "The German side regrets the suffering and injustice inflicted on the Czech people during the National Socialist tyranny," the declaration reads.

Germany also acknowledged the validity of the Beneš decrees, a series of laws enacted by Czechoslovakia after the war that confiscated the property of ethnic Germans and Hungarians from within Czechoslovakian territory. Those decrees remain controversial, but Germany pledged not to make restitution claims against the Czech Republic arising from them.

For its part, the Czech Republic reiterated its recognition of Germany's current democratic system of government and its "peaceful integration" into European structures like the EU. The two countries vowed to promote cooperation on bilateral and European issues, strengthen economic ties, and intensify youth exchange programs focused on history.

The reconciliation and declaration have been decades in the making. Previous German leaders extended apologies for Nazi crimes during visits to Prague, but a formal government-to-government declaration had remained elusive. Czech officials had also long insisted that recognition of the Beneš decrees was a precondition for further improvement in relations. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Andrej Babiš of the Czech Republic hailed the declaration as opening a new chapter in bilateral relations. "We must never forget history, but we should leave it to historians and look together into the future," Mr. Babiš said during a joint press conference with Ms. Merkel.
