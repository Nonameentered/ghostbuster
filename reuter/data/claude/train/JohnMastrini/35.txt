Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik Skips Meeting for Second Week in a Row Amid Calls to Tackle Czech Securities Trading Problems  

For the second consecutive week, Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik failed to attend a scheduled meeting with the country's securities regulator amid growing calls for action to address problems plaguing the Prague Stock Exchange.  

The head of the Czech Securities Exchange Commission, Jiri Kyslik, expressed dismay that Minister Kocarnik did not appear at the weekly coordination meeting between his ministry and the regulator. "We have a number of important issues to discuss regarding the securities markets and it is unfortunate the minister continues to be unavailable," Kyslik said in a statement.

Minister Kocarnik has faced building criticism over his handling of troubles at the Prague Stock Exchange, including a cyberattack last month that disrupted trading for several hours. His ministry was slow to react to the attack, leaving the securities regulator largely on its own to resolve the situation. Members of parliament and investors have warned more must be done to bolster cyber defenses and increase oversight of high-frequency algorithmic trading on the exchange.

The latest meeting miss comes as the securities regulator is pushing for stronger enforcement powers and looking to impose tougher rules on brokerages and trading firms to prevent market manipulation and abuse. However, the Finance Ministry would need to approve any new regulations or legal changes to empower the regulator. 

Minister Kocarnik's political opponents seized on his absence, demanding that he make tackling issues around trading practices and cybersecurity a higher priority. "It seems our finance minister would rather avoid these important matters than take action," said Marketa Pekarova Adamova, a member of parliament from the opposition TOP 09 party.

There were signs the growing furor over the stock exchange troubles could herald a broader shake-up of the country's financial regulatory apparatus. In an unusual public rebuke, Czech President Milos Zeman called for an overhaul of financial oversight, saying "we have a mosaic of uncoordinated institutions that essentially do not work." The central bank governor also floated the idea of merging the banking regulator and securities regulator, a reform that Minister Kocarnik has long opposed.

Unless Minister Kocarnik makes prompt moves to address securities trading oversight and the stock exchange cyber woes, he faces the risk of losing political control over reforms to the country's financial regulatory structure. With another missed meeting this week, his absence on these pivotal issues is becoming more conspicuous and harder to ignore.
