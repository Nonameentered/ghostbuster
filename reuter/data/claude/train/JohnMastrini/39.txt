Czech Justice Minister Quits Government and Parliament Over False Academic Title 

Prague, Czech Republic—Czech Justice Minister Marie Benešová resigned today from the government and parliament after allegations emerged that she had falsely claimed an academic title. The scandal comes at a time when the Czech government is facing protests over claims of corruption and conflicts of interest.

According to local media reports, Benešová allegedly falsely claimed in her official biography and on her website that she held a degree of JUDr., the equivalent of a Doctor of Laws. However, the law school she attended, Charles University in Prague, has no record of her completing the necessary coursework or thesis to earn such a degree. University officials launched an internal investigation after the media reports surfaced.

In her resignation letter, Benešová admitted that she "made a mistake" in claiming the academic title but said it was unintentional. She expressed regret that the "exaggeration and imprecision" regarding her educational background had undermined confidence in the Czech judicial system and government. Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said he accepted Benešová's resignation and wished her well in her future endeavors.  

Benešová has served as Justice Minister since last June, when she was nominated to the post by the ANO, the populist political party led by Prime Minister Babiš. Her nomination was controversial, with critics arguing she lacked experience. The opposition Civic Democrats filed a no-confidence motion against her that failed. She previously worked as a lawyer and served in leadership roles in Prague's municipal government.

The scandal threatens to further weaken the fractious minority government led by Prime Minister Babiš, whose ANO party lost its ruling coalition partner last month. Babiš himself faces a criminal investigation over alleged fraud involving EU subsidies received by his massive Agrofert conglomerate. Tens of thousands of protesters marched through Prague again last week demanding Babiš's resignation over what they see as unacceptable conflicts of interest.

With Benešová now departing the government, Prime Minister Babiš said he would assume temporary leadership of the Justice Ministry. He promised to put forward a new nominee to lead the ministry within the coming weeks. The opposition TOP 09 party said Benešová's resignation was "long overdue" but only the start of the changes needed to restore integrity and trust in government.
