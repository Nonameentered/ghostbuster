Harvard Capital & Consulting Pays Fine for Illegal Trading Practices from 1993-1995 and Makes Amends

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Harvard Capital & Consulting, a major investment firm, has agreed to pay a $25 million fine to settle charges related to illegal trading practices that occurred in the firm's brokerage and asset management units from 1993 to 1995. The SEC found that during those years, several traders and portfolio managers at Harvard Capital systematically engaged in "front-running," a practice that involves trading ahead of large client orders to benefit the firm's own accounts.

The SEC's investigation uncovered evidence that traders at Harvard Capital routinely used information about large impending trades from the firm's brokerage clients to buy or sell the same stocks ahead of those trades in the firm's proprietary trading accounts. By front-running the large client orders, Harvard Capital ensured that its own accounts benefited from price movements that occurred when the large trades were ultimately executed. This generated illegal profits at the expense of the firm's clients. 

"These practices severely violate the trust and confidence of clients who count on their brokers to execute their trades properly and keep their information confidential," said Susan Williams, Director of Enforcement at the SEC. "The sizable penalty against Harvard Capital should serve as a warning to all investment professionals that the SEC has zero tolerance for such abusive behavior."

In addition to the $25 million civil fine, Harvard Capital agreed to comprehensive reforms to detect and prevent future front-running and other violations. The firm will retain an independent compliance consultant to review the firm's policies and procedures in its brokerage and asset management units. Harvard Capital will also pay disgorgement of $15 million in illegal profits resulting from the front-running, with those funds being returned to victims of the scheme.

"The conduct of certain legacy employees of our firm from over 20 years ago is disheartening and unacceptable," said Brian Johnson, CEO of Harvard Capital. "We take our regulatory obligations very seriously and have implemented controls and procedures to ensure that similar misconduct does not occur in the future." Johnson noted that no current employees were involved in or aware of the illegal front-running at the time it occurred.

The case is a reminder that while illegal conduct from long ago can still result in enforcement actions today, quick identification of violations and cooperation with regulators can lead to reduced penalties. By settling the charges, Harvard Capital avoided potentially harsher sanctions and was able to limit damage to its reputation that could have resulted from extended litigation. The firm appears to view this settlement as an opportunity to restore confidence in its practices and move forward with a renewed commitment to integrity and compliance.
