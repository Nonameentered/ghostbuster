Czech Crown Reaches Highest Level Yet Against Mark/Dollar Basket Following Comments by Prime Minister Klaus

The Czech crown rose to its highest level yet against the basket of currencies used by the Czech National Bank (CNB) to determine its exchange rate policy. The crown gained nearly 1% against the euro-mark basket, reaching 25.835 crowns per euro, after comments from Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus that the central bank should not intervene to weaken the crown. 

Prime Minister Klaus told reporters in Prague today that the crown's strength reflects the stable and growing Czech economy. He said the CNB should refrain from currency interventions aimed at weakening the crown to boost exports. "The crown is strong because our economy is strong," Klaus said. "We should let the markets determine the exchange rate and not manipulate our currency."

The comments surprised markets and conflict with the CNB's policy of capping crown appreciation to support export growth. The central bank has intervened frequently in recent months to weaken the crown, including spending nearly $2 billion last week alone. CNB Governor Zdenek Tuma now finds himself caught between the central bank's inflation-targeting mandate and the Prime Minister's calls for non-intervention.

The mixed signals from Prague have clouded the CNB's exchange-rate policy going forward. "The Prime Minister's comments cast doubt on whether the CNB will continue fighting crown strength," said Jiri Polansky, chief economist at Patria Finance in Prague. "This could undermine the bank's credibility on exchange rates and may lead to higher inflation down the road."

The Czech economy has been one of the best performers in Central Europe, with growth around 5.5% annually over the past five years and inflation near the CNB's 2% target. Low unemployment and rising wages have supported strong domestic demand. The economy expanded 5.7% in the second quarter from a year earlier, outpacing most estimates.

With the economy surging ahead, the CNB may face growing pressure to allow the crown to strengthen to curb price pressures and prevent overheating. But the export sector, which accounts for around 70% of Czech GDP, would suffer badly from a sharply stronger crown, threatening overall growth and jobs.

The brewing debate in Prague over exchange-rate policy and the role of currency interventions now looms as a key issue for the CNB and the Klaus government to resolve. How, and whether, to restrain crown strength while supporting economic growth poses a complex challenge with high stakes for the Czech economy in the months ahead. Overall, the CNB's credibility and influence over monetary policy are now in question, leaving the crown's value against the euro uncertain.
