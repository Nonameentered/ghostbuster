Czech crown hits highest level against mark/dollar basket on PM's comments 

The Czech crown gained significantly against a basket of major currencies this morning, reaching its highest level so far this year. The crown strengthened 0.6% against the basket, which includes the euro, U.S. dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, and Swedish krona.

The spike came after comments by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis indicating the country may join the Eurozone sooner than previously expected. In an interview, Babis said the government aims to meet the criteria to adopt the euro “as soon as possible” and that 2025 is a realistic target date for entry into the Eurozone. The Czech Republic is required to spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II before joining the euro, meaning entry in 2025 would require joining ERM II in 2023.

The government had previously adopted a wait-and-see approach to euro adoption and had not set a target date. Babis’s comments suggest a substantial shift in views and greater urgency to integrate with the Eurozone. The move would benefit Czech exporters by eliminating currency risks. However, many Czech citizens remain opposed to abandoning the koruna.

“The crown gained as markets reacted to the increased likelihood of earlier Eurozone entry,” said Pavel Sobisek, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Prague. “ERM II entry in just two years would speed up the whole process.”

The Czech National Bank, the country’s central bank, said in a statement that while it aims to join the Eurozone in line with government policy, a precise target date has not yet been set. The bank said any timeline would depend on multiple economic factors.

“We have always aimed at adopting the euro so we can participate in decision-making at the European level,” the Czech National Bank said. “However, a specific entry date into the ERM II will be one of the upcoming decisions in the coming years. It depends on the development of the business cycle and the fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria.”

The crown traded at EUR/CZK 25.30 and USD/CZK 22.05 in the aftermath of the prime minister’s comments, its strongest levels since January 2019. The currency has gained 1.2% against the euro-dollar basket so far this year.
