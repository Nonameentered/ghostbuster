Crown's earnings to be impacted by lost time at new Melbourne casino complex due to heatwave 

Crown Resorts has warned that extreme hot weather in Melbourne over the next week will significantly impact operations at its new $2.2 billion casino and hotel complex. The extended heatwave with temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius has forced Crown to suspend most outdoor and some indoor activities to ensure the safety of staff and patrons.

The new Crown Sydney resort only opened last month after years of construction delays and legal battles. Crown had been hoping for a strong start to the year to make up for losses in 2020 due to bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the hot weather is set to curb crown's ambitions, at least in the short term. Crown said it expects a 10-15% drop in visitors this week, mostly impacting its restaurants, bars, swimming pools and day spas. The company has also had to increase staffing to handle the weather, including deployment of cooling misters, hydration stations, and paramedics on site. 

A Crown spokesperson said “the safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees is our top priority. We are closely monitoring temperatures and humidity levels and will make necessary adjustments to our operations. We appreciate the patience of our patrons as we manage through what is forecast to be a week of exceptionally hot weather for Melbourne. Crown is well-equipped to handle heatwaves but the impact on trade at what is usually one of our busiest periods of summer trading is unfortunate.”

The heatwave could not have come at a worse time for Crown which has invested heavily in what it has promoted as Melbourne's premiere luxury resort this summer. However, public health experts have warned people to avoid extended periods outside for leisure or exercise. This careful messaging has likely deterred some visitors from making trips into Melbourne city to visit the Crown casino and complex. 

Crown shares dipped 2% on the news of potential disruption. While the financial impacts are only expected to be short-term, every lost trading day impacts Crown's earnings which were already down over 35% from last year due to the impacts of bushfires and COVID restrictions across Australia. Investors will be watching closely to see how quickly Crown can bounce back once temperatures start to cool later in the week. For now, Crown and Melbourne can expect an intense few days of heat before any relief.
