National Mutual Delights with Over Half a Million Policy-Holders Rushing to Buy Shares on Stock Market Debut 

National Mutual, one of the country's largest insurance and financial services companies, delighted investors today with a bumper stock market listing that was heavily oversubscribed. Over 550,000 National Mutual policy-holders rushed to buy shares in the initial public offering, demonstrating the popularity of this 170-year-old brand.

Shares in National Mutual debuted on the stock exchange at $2.35, up 35% from the initial retail offer price of $1.75 per share. By midday, the shares had climbed to $2.54 on strong demand before closing at $2.49, valuing the company at just over $12.4 billion.

The blockbuster listing is a major win for National Mutual's chief executive, Amanda Roberts, who has led an aggressive digital transformation and diversification strategy since taking over four years ago. “Today's listing is a historic day for our company and a vote of confidence in our strategic direction from policy-holders and investors alike,” Ms. Roberts said.

Founded in 1851, National Mutual built its reputation selling affordable life insurance to everyday Australians and New Zealanders. However, in a bid to revitalize growth, Ms. Roberts has invested heavily in new products like health insurance, home loans, and robo-advice investment platforms. The company also acquired two rivals in recent years to boost scale.

“National Mutual now has a market-leading position in life insurance as well as fast-growing new businesses in health, wealth management, and banking,” said Matthew Wilson, insurance analyst at Shaw & Partners brokerage. “The IPO funds will help accelerate growth in National Mutual's new strategic pillars and really take the fight to major competitors.”

The wider insurance sector has faced major challenges in recent years, including the aftermath of damaging royal commissions, bushfire catastrophes exacerbated by climate change, and ultra-low interest rates reducing investment returns. However, Ms. Roberts said National Mutual emerged stronger from this “intrusive period” with a simpler, customer-centric model and digitally-enabled processes.
