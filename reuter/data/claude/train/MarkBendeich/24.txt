BHP agrees to 10% pay rise for Australian steel workers  

Mining giant BHP has reached an agreement with Australian metalworkers unions to provide a 10% pay rise over 3 years for its steel workers. The deal covers around 4,500 employees at BHP's steelmaking operations in Port Kembla and Whyalla.

The new enterprise bargaining agreement includes 3% annual pay rises, enhanced superannuation contributions, and additional leave entitlements. The agreement comes after 9 months of negotiations between BHP and the unions, with significant break-throughs made this week to reach an in-principle deal. 

The deal is a win for BHP after a difficult period for its steelmaking business. Steel prices and demand have been weak for several years, and BHP made a major write-down of its steel assets in 2018. However, since then the business has improved performance through cost-cutting and restructuring. The pay rise is a sign that BHP now expects more stable conditions ahead for its steel division.

For workers, the pay rise and improved conditions are welcome relief after years of uncertainty. The Australian Workers' Union's Daniel Walton said "This has been a long fight, but we've achieved an outcome that rewards steelworkers for their patience and dedication through difficult times."

The in-principle agreement is subject to a worker ballot over the next month. The unions are recommending that members vote in favor of approving the deal. If ratified, it will run for 3 years from December 2019 to December 2022.

A BHP spokesperson said "We appreciate our employees' commitment and contribution to thesteelmaking business. This agreement, once ratified, will provide salary and wage increases as well as additional benefits, while ensuring our Australian operations remain globally competitive." 

Steel has been made at Port Kembla since 1928 and Whyalla since 1941. The operations have gone through significant restructuring in recent years to focus on higher-value products, including rail, rod and bar, and pipe and tube products. The Port Kembla steelworks remains the largest in Australia and employs around 5,000 people.
