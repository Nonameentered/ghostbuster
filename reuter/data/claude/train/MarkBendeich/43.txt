Australian Banks Revive Their Asian Strategies Amid Tough Times at Home 

Australia's largest banks are renewing their focus on Asia as they face weakening profits and slowing growth in their home market. Tougher regulations, a weak housing market, and increased competition have squeezed margins and revenue in Australia. In response, banks including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. are reviving expansion plans in Asia that were sidelined during the global financial crisis.

The major Australian banks generate the bulk of their revenue and profits domestically. However, Asia has long been viewed as a growth market, with a rising middle class and infrastructure needs that fit well with Australian banks' expertise. The banks have had a presence in Asia for decades, but growth stalled after the global financial crisis as they turned inward to focus on strengthening their balance sheets.  

Now, the banks see Asia as crucial to re-igniting growth. They aim to benefit from regional trade and investment flows, while diversifying their assets and funding sources. Commonwealth Bank, Australia's largest lender, gets only 10% of its revenue from outside Australia and New Zealand. But in October, CEO Matt Comyn said at an investor update that "Asia will play an even more important role in our strategy going forward" and that the bank is looking at boosting non-Australian earnings to make up 15-20% of group revenue.

Westpac, the country's second-largest bank, aims to lift non-Australian earnings to A$1.5 billion by 2020, up by 50% from 2018. The bank's Asian operations, primarily based in Singapore and Hong Kong, are focused on trade finance, foreign exchange and wealth management. Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said that while Australia remains the core market, the bank has "identified Asia as a key growth opportunity." 

National Australia Bank will open branches in Beijing and Shanghai, adding to its existing operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Indonesia. ANZ has 20% of its institutional banking division operating in Asia, the largest footprint among Australian banks. It provides loans and treasury services to large companies, entrepreneurs and financial institutions in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam and other countries.
