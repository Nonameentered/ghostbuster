Comalco Ltd. Posts Heavy Losses Due to Weak Aluminium Prices, Adverse Exchange Rate and High Smelting Costs  

Comalco Ltd., Australia's largest aluminium producer, announced heavy losses in its latest quarterly results yesterday. The company posted a loss of $124 million in the third quarter compared to a profit of $42 million in the same period last year. 

The significant downturn was attributed to several factors. Aluminium prices on global commodity markets have declined nearly 15% over the past year due to softer demand conditions. The company has been unable to pass on these price reductions to clients, severely impacting profit margins. At the same time, the Australian dollar has remained strong against the U.S. dollar in which aluminium is traded. This has made Australian producers less competitive globally.

Comalco's operations have also been hampered by escalating costs, especially for smelting. Energy accounts for about 30% of total costs in aluminium production and electricity prices have surged over 50% in Australia in the last decade. Comalco is in long-term electricity contracts at prices substantially below current rates but as these legacy contracts expire, costs are set to rise significantly. 

The company announced a series of measures to improve performance over the coming quarters. It will cut 500 jobs, mainly in non-operational roles, to reduce overheads. It also aims to renegotiate supply contracts to link costs to global aluminium prices. If successful, this could provide a buffer against future price shocks. Capital expenditure will also be reduced by $150 million, slowing expansion plans at some mining sites.

Comalco's share price fell 4.2% on the results, underperforming the broader market. Analysts voiced concerns about the short-term outlook but remained confident in the long-term prospects for both Comalco and the global aluminium market. The company reaffirmed its guidance for modest growth in demand and prices over the next 3-5 years.
