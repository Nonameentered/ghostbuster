Foster's Brewing Group Reports Small Rise in Profit, But Strong Performance from Home Brews  

Foster's Brewing Group, Australia's largest brewing company, reported a modest 1.8% rise in net profit for the half-year ending December 31, 2020. Profit after tax reached $370 million on revenue of $3.7 billion, up 3.5% from the same period last year.

Despite the small increase in earnings, Foster's saw strong volume and revenue growth in its domestic Australian beer business, which produces the VB, Carlton Draught, and Pure Blonde brands. Volume for Foster's Australian beer operations rose 4.5% in the half, outpacing the overall beer market in Australia. Revenue increased 7.2% compared to the previous half.

The highlight for Foster's was the performance of its craft brand portfolio, which includes the highly popular Fat Yak and Pirate Life labels. Volume for craft beers surged 30% in the half, and now accounts for more than 7% of Foster's total Australian beer volume. The growth of craft beer has helped Foster's maintain its market dominance in Australia, even as major competitors have struggled.

In contrast, Foster's international beer business, which produces brands like Corona, Stella Artois, and Budweiser under license, saw slight declines in volume and revenue. The cancellation of major sporting events due to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for some international brands during the half. However, cost saving initiatives helped improve the margins of Foster's international operations.

Looking ahead, Foster's expects continued strong performances from its Australian craft beer portfolio and domestic mainstream brands. However, the company recognizes that the COVID-19 crisis brings uncertainty, especially for its international beer operations. Foster's has withdrawn previous guidance and will not update its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.
