Harvey Norman falls short of 15% sales growth target due to cool summer weather 

Harvey Norman, Australia's largest retailer of electrical goods and furniture, announced annual results today that fell just short of the company's targeted 15% sales growth for the 2019 financial year. Total sales revenue increased by 13.8% to $8.74 billion, driven largely by the opening of eight new stores across the country. However, same-store sales grew by a more modest 2.3% over the year due to unseasonably cool weather in the summer months of December 2018 and January 2019.

The company reported strong growth across most categories in the first half of the financial year but experienced a slowdown in the lead up to Christmas and in January, particularly for seasonal electrical goods and furniture. Harvey Norman CEO Katie Page noted "The cooler weather we experienced, especially on the east coast, had an impact on sales of things like outdoor furniture, barbecues, lighting, and also to a degree air conditioning. When the weather is mild, customers naturally delay or reduce their spending on these types of discretionary items."

The sales performance improves in February and March but was still lower than the target set by the company at the beginning of the financial year. "We were a little disappointed not to reach our overall target of 15% sales growth for the full year given our strong performance in other months" Ms Page said. "Our targets are ambitious and there are always external factors outside of our control. However, we continue to invest in our stores and online experience so we are well placed to drive strong and consistent growth over the long term.‚Äù

Harvey Norman's results come amid a tough retail environment where weaker discretionary spending and increased competition from online rivals have put pressure on sales. The company has looked to buffer itself against these headwinds through an ongoing store rollout program and continued investment to enhance its omni-channel offer. This includes improving the in-store experience, building up its digital marketing and customer relationship capabilities, and strengthening the group's online platform. 

While just missing its sales target, Harvey Norman's net profit after tax (NPAT) rose 12.1% to $467.7 million, in line with the company's earnings guidance. The company announced a final dividend of 24 cents per share, fully franked, bringing total dividends for the year to 39 cents per share.

Harvey Norman shares closed down 3.2% at $4.29 following the result announcement. The company will be looking to regain momentum and continue its growth trajectory into the 2020 financial year, aiming once again for 15% sales growth and high single-digit NPAT growth, subject to stable macroeconomic conditions and an absence of any unforeseen external shocks. With the federal election now providing more policy certainty and interest rates at a record low, consumer sentiment and spending levels are expected to strengthen going into FY2020 which should provide a supportive backdrop for Harvey Norman to work towards these targets.
