Former Coles Myer CEO on trial for using company funds to renovate his home in 1980s excess 

The former CEO of retail giant Coles Myer, John Roberts, is facing trial over allegations  he improperly used company funds to pay for extensive renovations to his Toorak mansion in the 1980s. Mr. Roberts led Coles Myer for over a decade from 1976 until his retirement in 1988. During this time, the company grew into one of Australia's largest publicly listed companies.

However, court documents reveal that in the mid-1980s Mr. Roberts directed Coles Myer to pay over $800,000 for renovations and upgrades to his private residence, including a swimming pool, tennis court, and home theatre. Prosecutors argue these expenses were excessive, inappropriate, and not properly disclosed or authorized. They claim Mr. Roberts took advantage of his position as CEO to gain personal benefits at the expense of shareholders.

For his part, Mr. Roberts denies any wrongdoing and says all expenses were approved by the board and disclosed according to the law at the time. His lawyers argue that lavish spending and corporate excess were hallmarks of 1980s big business and that Coles Myer's market value and profits grew strongly under Mr. Roberts' leadership. They claim the case against him is "a witch hunt" that retroactively applies today's standards to past actions that were normal business practice at the time.

The 4-week trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria is seen as an important test of corporate governance standards. If found guilty, Mr. Roberts faces up to 10 years in prison for breach of duties and abuse of public office. For Coles Myer, the case threatens to reopen old wounds from an era many would prefer to forget. The outcome is poised to have significant implications for executives across the country.
