Comalco Ltd's Net Profit Expected to Plummet in 1996

Comalco Ltd, Australia's largest aluminum producer, is expected to report a sharp decline in net profit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996 according to industry analysts. Net profit is forecast to fall by at least 30% to $180 million, down from $258 million in 1995. 

The fall in profit is attributed to lower aluminum prices and higher costs. The market price of aluminum has declined over 15% in the past year due to increased supply from China and Brazil and slow demand in Japan and Europe. At the same time, Comalco's costs have risen due to increased use of more expensive bauxite in its refining process. The company's ageing NSW refinery requires better quality bauxite to produce alumina, squeezing profit margins.

Comalco CEO Paul Theobald acknowledged that 1996 was a "disappointing year" but said the company is taking decisive action to turn around performance. "We are increasing efficiency, cutting costs and curbing capital expenditure across all operations. The completion of key growth projects will also boost productivity and lower our cost base going forward," he said.

The company's aluminum smelting operations, which contribute nearly 80% of total earnings, are likely to remain under pressure in the near term. However, the outlook for Comalco's bauxite mining and alumina refining arms is more positive given increased demand from China. Comalco remains the world's largest bauxite miner and is expected to lift exports by 10% this year.  

Analysts are optimistic the cost reduction initiatives and better conditions in bauxite and alumina will support a recovery in Comalco's profits in 1997. "The worst is likely over for Comalco with aluminum prices stabilizing and significant cost savings still to flow through," said Nick Stevens, Senior Resources Analyst at Macquarie Bank. 

Barring any further decline in commodity prices, most analysts anticipate Comalco's net profit for 1997 will rebound to at least $230 million, a 25-30% increase from 1996 results. Comalco shares have underperformed the broader market, falling over 6% in the past year. But with a turnaround in sight, many see the stock as oversold at current levels.
