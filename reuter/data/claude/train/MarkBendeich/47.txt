RTZ-CRA Ltd to report sharp fall in annual profit due to metal price slide and U.S. copper smelter problems 

RTZ-CRA Ltd, the world's largest mining company, is expected to report a steep drop in annual profit next week due to lower metal prices and operational issues at its copper smelter in Arizona.

Analysts forecast RTZ-CRA's net profit for 2020 to decline by up to 50% from last year's $18.7 billion. The company's earnings have been hit hard by a sharp slide in copper and other base metal prices during the year due to slowing demand from China and a global economic downturn. Copper prices are down more than 15% from a year ago, squeezing profit margins for miners.

RTZ-CRA's operations were also disrupted by a fire at its copper smelter in Hayden, Arizona in early February. The smelter, which accounts for about 10% of U.S. copper refining capacity, was offline for over a month to repair damage from the fire. The shutdown is expected to reduce the company's copper production by up to 150,000 tonnes this year.  

"It has been a challenging year for RTZ-CRA with multiple headwinds from falls in commodity prices to the smelter outage,” said James Wilson, an analyst at JBC Resources. “The share price has declined 35% over the past 12 months reflecting these difficulties. The company will be looking to turn things around in 2021 with a rebound in copper demand and higher output from existing operations as well as new projects.”

RTZ-CRA remains bullish on the longer-term outlook for copper and other metals it produces, citing forecasts for increasing demand from electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. The company expects to increase its copper production over the next 3-5 years as new mines come online, including a $2.5 billion expansion of its Kennecott mine in Utah, the second largest copper mine in the U.S.  

Analysts say the company must also take further action to cut costs and improve operational efficiency in order to offset price volatility. "RTZ-CRA has made good progress improving its cost base but more work is still needed given the sector's exposure to fluctuating commodity prices,” said Ellie Bates, a mining analyst at SP Angel. “Additional cost savings will be key to protecting margins and shareholder returns over the next year."

RTZ-CRA is scheduled to report its full-year 2020 results on February 18. Investors will be closely watching for updates on when the company's Arizona copper smelter is expected to resume full production as well as management's outlook and guidance for the year ahead. The report and update from executives will help determine whether RTZ-CRA is poised to rebound in 2021 or faces further share price pressure ahead.
