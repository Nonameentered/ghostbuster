Comalco Ltd. Reports Loss Due to Weak Prices and Strong Local Dollar

Comalco Ltd., the Australian alumina and aluminum producer, reported a loss for the first half of the current financial year as weak global commodity prices and a strong local currency hurt its bottom line. 

The Melbourne-based company posted a net loss of A$132 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of A$303 million a year earlier. Revenue declined 25% to A$1.9 billion due to lower realized aluminum and alumina prices.

The company cited aluminum prices hitting multiyear lows during the period as Chinese smelters ramped up production despite weak demand. London Metal Exchange aluminum prices averaged $1,792 a ton in the December half, down 17% from a year earlier. Alumina prices also came under pressure, declining 34% from the prior year.

“The downturn in global commodity markets had a significant impact on our financial results,” said Comalco’s Chief Executive Marco Marchese. “These testing market conditions are expected to remain for some time.”

Comalco’s profits were also squeezed by the sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The local unit rose 9% year-over-year versus its U.S. counterpart. Since Comalco reports in Australian dollars but sells most of its products in U.S. dollars, a stronger Aussie reduces the company’s export revenue.  

The company’s aluminum smelters operated at 93% of capacity during the half, while its alumina refineries ran at 95% of capacity. Comalco expects global demand growth for aluminum to weaken this year to 1%-3% from around 4% in 2019. 

To offset losses, Comalco reduced operating costs by A$58 million through lower fuel and raw material prices as well as lower production. The company also cut capital expenditure by
A$37 million and lowered controllable costs A$41 million. Management expects to sustain the cost and spending reductions into the foreseeable future.

Comalco announced an interim dividend of 1 cent a share, 70% lower than the previous half. Its shares fell 3.1% in Sydney trading after the results announcement. The stock has declined over 60% from its peak four years ago.

With no rebound in sight for aluminum and alumina markets due to ample supply and soft demand, especially from China, Comalco looks set for another difficult year. The company’s fortunes ultimately depend on a recovery in commodity prices and a weakening of the Australian dollar, but neither is expected in the near term. Comalco’s shareholders face an extended wait before business conditions start turning in their favor.
