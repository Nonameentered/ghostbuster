National Mutual sees "fabulous" response as over half a million policyholders rush to buy shares ahead of stock market float

National Mutual, one of Australia's largest life insurers, received an overwhelming response from its 3.2 million eligible policyholders to buy shares in the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) according to CEO Mark McInnes. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Mr McInnes said applications had been received from over 520,000 policyholders seeking to purchase over $6.8 billion of shares before the offer opened to retail investors next week.  

"The response from our policyholder base has been fabulous. We always expected strong interest but this level of enthusiasm exceeds our most optimistic forecasts," Mr McInnes said. The insurer is floating 30% of its shares on the ASX next month, with eligible policyholders given priority to buy shares before the general public. The offer values the 170-year-old company at up to $22 billion, which would make it Australia's largest float since the Queensland government's QR National listing in 2010.

Shares will be issued at a price range of $1.60 to $1.85 per share. Policyholders who apply for shares will have any amount up to $15,000 allocated in full. Applications above that threshold will be allocated on a "best endeavours" basis. Mr McInnes said the vast majority of applicants were seeking to purchase shares worth less than $10,000. "It shows the broad-based interest from our loyal customer base built up over many years and many policies," he said.

The strong demand from policyholders means retail brokers and investors may receive a smaller allocation when the public offer opens. Mr McInnes acknowledged the possibility but said the company was seeking to ensure as many policyholders as possible can become shareholders. He said technology was allowing the company to process over half a million applications in just one week. "We have a tried and tested digital application process that our policyholders have embraced. It has been pivotal to the success of this offer." 

The IPO will provide funds for National Mutual to invest in new products and services, strengthen its digital capabilities, and pursue growth opportunities in New Zealand and selected Asian markets, according to the company prospectus released last month. National Mutual shares are expected to start trading on the ASX on December 7.
