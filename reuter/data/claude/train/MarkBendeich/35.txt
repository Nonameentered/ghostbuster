Foster's Toasts Strong Rise in Pre-Tax Earnings, but Losses in Canada and China Take Some Fizz Out of Half-Year Result  

Australia's largest brewer Foster's Group announced a strong half-year result today but losses in its international operations and continuing challenges in China and Canada took some fizz out of the results.

Foster's reported an 18% rise in pre-tax earnings to $910.8 million on strong demand for its Australian beers. However, the brewer recorded a loss of $422 million in its Canadian beer operation Pacific Western Brewing and continuing losses in China dragged total statutory net profit down 48% to $514 million.

The half-year result was boosted by Foster's Australian beer brands, including Carlton and Victoria Bitter, returning to volume and earnings growth. Beer sales revenue rose 2.1% in Australia as premium brands gained market share. Foster's holds 70% of the Australian beer market.

CEO Trevor O'Hoy said, "Our Australian beer business has delivered a solid result and we continue to strengthen our brands through innovation and marketing investment." However, O'Hoy warned that beer market conditions remained challenging in Canada and China.

In Canada, Foster's wrote down the value of its Pacific Western Brewing business by $444 million due to continuing weak consumer demand and high costs. O'Hoy said Pacific Western's performance was "unsatisfactory" but restructuring efforts were showing progress. The Canadian operation reported an $81.3 million loss for the half, though this was an improvement on the prior year's $99.8 million loss.

In China, Foster's beer business recorded sales growth but higher costs associated with a new brewery saw losses more than double to $28.5 million. O'Hoy said the China beer market remained subdued but Foster's Chinese business was gaining share and the brewery's performance should strengthen over the rest of the financial year.

Foster's wine business delivered a "solid result", O'Hoy said, with earnings up 7% to $190 million. However, the company has put its wine assets up for sale to focus on beer. O'Hoy said there had been "strong interest" from potential buyers for the wine division but no sale was imminent.

Overall, despite the disappointments in Canada and China, Foster's half-year result should satisfy investors and highlights the strength of its core Australian beer brands. The company's shares rose 2% in early trade before settling 0.9% higher at $5.49, outperforming a flat wider market.
