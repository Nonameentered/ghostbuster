BHP Agrees to 10 Percent Pay Rise for Australian Steel Workers in Landmark Deal  

Mining giant BHP has agreed to provide a 10 percent pay rise over three years for workers at its Australian steelmaking business in a landmark deal with trade unions. The pay increase will benefit around 5,000 workers at BHP's steel plants and iron ore mining operations in Western Australia. This is the largest pay rise secured by Australian steelworkers in over a decade.

The deal was approved by members of the Australian Workers’ Union and Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union in a ballot. The unions had campaigned for higher wages and improved conditions for BHP's steel and iron ore employees in protracted negotiations with the company over the past six months. The approved agreement will provide a 3 percent salary increase for each year over three years between 2019 to 2022. It also includes additional annual leave, improved parental leave, and a A$2000 one-off bonus payment for each employee.

BHP’s steel division, which trades as BlueScope, accounts for around 3 percent of the company’s overall revenue. However, the division has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years due to cheap steel imports, high costs, and a slowing Australian economy. The pay rise comes despite these market headwinds and at a time when wage growth remains stagnant across Australia. The deal highlights the continuing strength of Australia's industrial relations framework which provides protections for workers and unions to bargain for better pay and conditions.  

Australian Workers’ Union secretary Daniel Walton said the pay rise was a “fair outcome” and rewarded steelworkers for their contribution to BlueScope’s turnaround over the past five years. “This is an historic agreement that provides income security and stability for steelworkers over the next three years,” he said. BHP did not comment publicly on the details of the deal but said it aims to provide competitive wages and benefits for all its employees. The pay rise for Australian steelworkers is expected to put pressure on BHP to provide similar wage increases for iron ore mine workers in the Pilbara region. The timing and details of any such pay rise remain unclear.
