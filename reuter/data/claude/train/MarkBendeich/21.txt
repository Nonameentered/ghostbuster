BHP Disappoints Share Market with Weaker than Expected Second-Quarter Profit 

The global resources giant BHP reported a 12 per cent decline in second-quarter profit compared to the same period last year. The disappointing result fell short of analysts’ expectations and sent BHP’s shares down over 3 per cent in early trading.

BHP’s profit after tax came in at $5.2 billion for the three months ending December 31, down from $5.9 billion a year earlier. The decline was driven primarily by weaker prices for some of the company’s key commodities including iron ore, copper, and coal. Revenue rose slightly to $23.6 billion, but higher costs and production challenges squeezed profits.  

The profit results reveal ongoing tensions in BHP’s diversified portfolio of resources from iron ore and coal to copper, nickel and petroleum. While iron ore production hit record levels, prices declined. At the same time, copper and coal outputs disappointed due to significant maintenance work and weather issues. The petroleum division was a bright spot, with higher production and stable prices boosting profits.

“We delivered solid operational performance across our portfolio, including record production at Western Australia Iron Ore,” said BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie. “However, significant planned maintenance activities and weather events at Olympic Dam and Queensland Coal impacted volumes in the December 2018 half.” 

Analysts had forecast a profit of $5.7 billion, so BHP’s results came in well below expectations. Investors have pushed down BHP’s share price after two years of strong gains. The drop in profit and weakening outlook adds to concerns that a global economic slowdown and trade tensions with China could weigh on resource companies into 2019. With its diversified portfolio, BHP may be in a stronger position than its peers if global conditions weaken further. But for now, shareholders are showing their disappointment in the latest profit figures from Australia’s biggest company.
