Haworth Wins $211.5 Million Patent Infringement Award Against Steelcase Inc. After 17-Year Legal Battle  

Office furniture maker Haworth was awarded $211.5 million by a federal jury on Tuesday in a long-running patent infringement case against rival Steelcase Inc. The jury found that Steelcase violated two Haworth patents related to adjustable ergonomic office chairs.   

The case dates back to 2002 when Haworth first filed a complaint against Steelcase alleging patent infringement. Haworth claimed that Steelcase's Leap chair copied technology and designs covered by Haworth's patents for its Zody chair. After years of legal wrangling, the case finally went to trial in a Grand Rapids, Michigan federal court.

In its decision, the jury found that Steelcase willfully infringed on Haworth's patents and owes $211.5 million in damages, lost profits, and interest. The jury also ruled that Steelcase failed to prove the Haworth patents were invalid.   

“We are very gratified with the jury's verdict, which affirms the validity and value of Haworth's intellectual property,” said Franco Bianchi, president and CEO of Haworth. The company said the damages award is the largest patent infringement verdict in the office furniture industry's history.

Steelcase said it "strongly disagrees" with the verdict and plans to appeal. The company argued that the Haworth patents were overly broad and invalid. Steelcase also claimed its Leap chair design did not actually infringe on the Zody chair patents.  

The case highlights the contentious nature of the premium office furniture market, estimated to be worth over $12 billion annually in the U.S. and Canada. Haworth and Steelcase, along with fellow Michigan company Herman Miller, dominate the market. With healthy profit margins and brand loyalty among customers, intellectual property is closely guarded. 

While the record damages award is a major victory for Haworth, the legal battle may continue for years more if Steelcase pursues all avenues of appeal. For now, though, Haworth has secured an unmistakable win in the long and bitter dispute over its innovative office chair technology. The court's upholding of its patents affirms Haworth's status as an innovator - and gives fair warning to competitors looking to copy its designs.
