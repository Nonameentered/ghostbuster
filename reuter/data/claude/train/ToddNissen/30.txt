Chrysler Appeals California DMV Ban on Shipping New Vehicles as Penalty for Lemon Law Violation  

Detroit, MI – Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it has filed an appeal against a decision by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to temporarily ban the company from shipping new vehicles to California. The DMV’s decision was made in response to Chrysler violating the state's lemon law, specifically related to the automaker's handling of buyback claims for defective vehicles.

According to a statement from Chrysler, the DMV’s ban will disrupt its vehicle distribution in California and impact customers waiting on new vehicle deliveries. “We believe the DMV's broad and sweeping action is unwarranted, disproportionate, and unlawful,” said a Chrysler spokesperson. “We have appealed the decision and requested an immediate stay of the ban pending the appeal.”  

At issue are claims that Chrysler failed to promptly repurchase or replace vehicles that had been subject to multiple repair attempts for the same defect. Under California’s lemon law, if a manufacturer or dealership is unable to repair a vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, the customer is entitled to a refund or replacement of the vehicle. The DMV found that Chrysler violated provisions of the law in how it handled buyback offers and replacement vehicles in over 1,400 cases.

In response, the DMV announced a temporary ban on the issuance of authorization numbers required for Chrysler to ship new motor vehicles into California. The ban is scheduled to last until January 13, 2020. However, if Chrysler's appeal is successful, the company would be able to resume shipping vehicles to the state.

Chrysler officials said they believed the issues in the DMV's review had already been addressed and that their processes are now fully compliant with the state's lemon law. The automaker said it remained committed to California customers and hopes to resolve the appeal as quickly as possible. Critics argue that the DMV's action is a just punishment after years of Chrysler failing to adequately address consumer complaints about defective vehicles. The outcome of Chrysler's appeal could have significant consequences, given California's large auto market.
