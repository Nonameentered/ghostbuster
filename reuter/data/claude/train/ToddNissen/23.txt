CMS Energy Co Expects to Meet or Exceed Earnings Estimates for 1996

CMS Energy Corp, the parent company of Consumers Power Co, announced today that it expects to meet or exceed analysts' estimates for 1996 earnings. The company predicts that earnings will be between $2.20 and $2.30 per share for the year, compared to the consensus estimate of $2.25 per share. 

"We have successfully controlled costs and improved productivity across all areas of our business this year," said William T. McCormick Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our utility operations have performed well, and the competitive market transition has proceeded smoothly. We expect continued steady performance and earnings growth going forward."

The company's utility subsidiary, Consumers Power Co, provides natural gas and electric service to 6.5 million residents in Michigan. Consumers Power accounts for about 80 percent of CMS Energy's total operating revenue. The utility benefited from higher sales volumes this year due to colder winter weather as well as strong summer cooling demand. However, retail rates remained relatively flat in 1996.

CMS Energy's non-utility operations have also posted gains this year, led by the company's gas pipeline, storage and marketing businesses. The company's investment in oil and gas exploration and production has generated higher returns, although volatility in commodity prices poses risks. CMS Energy is looking to expand its non-regulated businesses to generate additional earnings and reduce its dependence on its utility subsidiary.

Overall, CMS Energy remains in a strong position to continue providing shareholder value, according to executives. The company will maintain its focus on cost control, operational efficiency and diversifying into competitive market areas to sustain steady growth over the long term. Barring unforeseen challenges, CMS Energy expects to continue meeting or exceeding earnings expectations going forward.

The company's stock price has steadily climbed over the course of 1996, up 25 percent from the beginning of the year. Analysts reacted positively to today's announcement, indicating the company remains on track to deliver solid results to investors. CMS Energy plans to release fourth quarter and full year 1996 earnings results in January.
