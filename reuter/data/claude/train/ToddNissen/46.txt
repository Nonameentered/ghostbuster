December Light Vehicle Sales Expected to Drop, But Industry on Track to Meet Projections 

U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to retreat slightly in December compared to a strong month of sales in December 2018, multiple industry experts anticipate. While December sales are projected to decrease by around 2% year-over-year, the broader industry is still on track to reach full-year sales forecasts in the mid 16 to 17 million range for total light vehicles sold.

Most major automakers will report December and year-end sales figures this week. Auto forecasters like J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast the December seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for light vehicles to come in at around 17 million units. This would be a drop from December 2018's robust 17.5 million annualized rate, but still in line with sales rates that the industry sustained for much of 2019.

“December is expected to close out another successful year for the auto industry despite it being a slight step down from last year's banner month,” said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power. “Retail demand has been steady throughout the year, supported by affordable fuel prices, solid job and wage growth, higher vehicle quality and durability. Overall, the industry remains in a good place as we head into 2020.”

The small decline in December sales can be attributed to a couple of factors according to analysts. Fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year compared to 2018 is one issue, along with consumers feeling apprehensive about potential vehicle price increases that could come as a result of trade disputes. 

However, key economic factors like a strong labor market, solid GDP growth, and low unemployment that have fueled vehicle sales all year remain in place. Interest rates also declined over the last few months, making vehicle financing more attractive for consumers. Overall consumer confidence and spending have been stable as well heading into 2020. 

While light vehicle sales are forecast to dip slightly in December, most automakers are expected to report modest year-over-year declines or flat sales for the month. Full-year sales for 2019 are still projected to come in a range between 16.8 million to 17 million total new vehicles sold, according to forecasters like J.D. Power and Cox Automotive. This would mark the fifth straight year of at least 17 million in U.S. vehicle sales, indicating a stable and steady auto market.

The final sales reports and numbers from automakers this week will confirm if December and full-year sales forecasts were accurate. If projections hold, the auto industry will remain in a solid position to start 2020 with steady sales levels expected to continue into next year barring any unforeseen economic slowdowns. Overall, analysts say the auto market remains quite healthy heading into the new year with the potential for even stronger sales ahead.
