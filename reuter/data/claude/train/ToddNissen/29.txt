Chrysler Minivans Under Fire Again as Safety Regulators Investigate Hatch Door and Sliding Door Issues 

Chrysler's minivans are facing another round of scrutiny regarding potential safety issues. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced today that it is investigating complaints about power sliding doors and power liftgates malfunctioning in certain 2019 and 2020 Chrysler Pacifica minivans.

The investigation includes about 63,000 Pacifica minivans from the 2019 and 2020 model years. According to NHTSA, it has received 141 reports of issues with the vans' sliding doorsâ€”including doors not closing fully, not opening, or opening while the vehicle is moving. The agency said it has also received 54 reports of problems with the liftgates not operating properly.

In some cases, consumers reported the doors and liftgates experienced mechanical binding or software glitches that left them stuck open, stuck closed, or opening and closing repeatedly. Three injuries have been reported due to the door and hatch issues.

The Chrysler Pacifica minivan launched for the 2017 model year to much fanfare and strong reviews, winning North American Utility of the Year and Motor Trend SUV of the Year. Sales have been strong, but various recalls have also plagued the brand new model. In 2017, Chrysler recalled some Pacificas for seat belt and wiring issues. Last year, a recall was issued for a potentially faulty fuel pump.

In a statement, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it is cooperating fully with the NHTSA investigation. "FCA US has a long-standing policy of cooperation with NHTSA, and has launched comprehensive investigations as soon as it became aware of the reported issues," the company said. Fiat Chrysler went on to say that the "software updates and mechanical fixes have already been implemented, in service actions, for the majority of the affected vehicles."

But for some consumers, the issues with the sliding doors and liftgates are unnerving, especially given the family-hauling purpose of minivans. One Pacifica owner reported his van's sliding door opened by itself while the vehicle was moving, frightening his children in the backseat. Another said her 2020 Pacifica's liftgate opens and closes on its own multiple times when she uses the key fob to unlock the vehicle.

The latest investigation is a black eye for the Chrysler brand's turnaround hopes, which rest significantly on the success of the Pacifica minivan. While minivan sales in general have declined in recent decades, the segment remains important for families needing a sizeable vehicle. 

NHTSA said it will evaluate the scope of the potential issues and will assess what further action may be necessary. The agency has not opened a formal defect investigation at this time. For now, Chrysler is likely hoping a recall can be avoided, but its popular minivan faces another dent in its reputation until answers emerge from the regulator's probe.
