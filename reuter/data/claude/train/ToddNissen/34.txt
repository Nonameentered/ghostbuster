Ford Denies Plans for Plant Closures in North America, Targets $2.5 Billion in Additional Cuts to Spending Plans

Ford Motor Company denied a report today that the company is planning major plant closings in North America. The financial news reported that analysts expected the automaker to announce the shutdown of vehicle assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio as it continues its efforts to restructure its operations and reduce costs. Ford executives responded by saying the company has no plans for full assembly plant closures in the coming months. 

However, Ford did announce a target of $2.5 billion in additional cuts to its spending plans for 2021 to compensate for lost vehicle sales due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The cuts are in addition to $5 billion in projected cost reductions previously announced by the company in May. Ford has been struggling with a sharp decline in sales, especially for its profitable SUVs and pickup trucks in the North American market.

“We have no plans for additional closures of vehicle assembly plants,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford's North America chief. “We are focused on improving efficiencies across all of our manufacturing facilities to support our fitness goals.” The company did not rule out job cuts at some plants or ending production of specific vehicle models to achieve further cost reductions. Ford employs approximately 55,000 workers at its assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada.

The additional spending cuts are meant to safeguard Ford's cash flow and profits as the coronavirus crisis continues to weigh on demand in the auto industry. “We are intensifying our efforts to improve fitness and ensure we have the liquidity and flexibility necessary to navigate potential challenges and tap into future opportunities,” said Tim Stone, Ford's chief financial officer. The company ended its second quarter with net income of $1.1 billion and $30 billion in cash on hand. Ford's shares declined slightly on the news in early trading.
