Chrysler Considering Extension of Car Production Agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp.

Chrysler Group LLC and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. are in talks to potentially extend a key vehicle production partnership, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The two automakers have an agreement for Mitsubishi to produce a compact sedan called the Mitsubishi Mirage G4 for Chrysler to sell in Mexico and other Latin American markets under the Chrysler brand. That agreement is set to expire after this year.

Chrysler and Mitsubishi are negotiating terms to possibly continue the arrangement for a few more years, the people said. A final decision hasn't been made and the deal could still end after 2019, some of the people cautioned.

Chrysler has been selling the Mirage G4 sedan in Mexico since 2015, with annual sales of around 12,000 vehicles in recent years. For Mitsubishi, the partnership helps its factory maximize production volumes and reduce costs. Mitsubishi's sole auto plant is in Thailand, where it produces the Mirage G4.

The potential extension comes as both Mitsubishi and Chrysler face declining vehicle sales in some international markets. Mitsubishi wants to maintain healthy production levels at its Thai factory, while Chrysler aims to keep offering a competitive compact sedan for budget-conscious buyers in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

Chrysler and Mitsubishi have had an on-again, off-again partnership spanning decades. Mitsubishi started selling vehicles in North America under the Chrysler brand in the 1970s. Chrysler went on to own a controlling stake in Mitsubishi for much of the 2000s before selling it. They continue to cooperate in some markets, like Thailand, where Mitsubishi produces a pickup truck for Chrysler to sell.

The possible new deal would cover a relatively small number of vehicles but highlights the pair's long and checkered relationship. For Chrysler, the partnership is a low-cost way to maintain a presence in Mexico's huge market for inexpensive compact sedans without needing to invest in its own factory capacity.

Neither Chrysler nor Mitsubishi commented on the potential new agreement. If a deal is reached, an announcement is expected by early next year, some of the people said.
