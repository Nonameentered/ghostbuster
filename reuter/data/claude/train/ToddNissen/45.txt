December Light Vehicle Sales Expected to Drop, But Industry Still Set to Meet Annual Projections 

Automakers are bracing for a decline in U.S. light vehicle sales for December, but the industry is still on track to meet sales projections for the full year. Analysts forecast sales of about 1.5 million new cars and light trucks for December, which would represent a 3 to 4 percent drop from December 2018. However, if projections hold, the auto industry will report total 2019 sales of about 17 million vehicles, holding steady with 2018 figures.

The modest year-over-year sales drop forecasted for December reflects a number of factors. First, there is one less selling day in December 2019 compared to the previous December. There are also concerns about an economic slowdown and expectations of weaker consumer confidence heading into 2020.  On the positive side, fuel prices remain low, interest rates are stable, and auto loan terms are lengthening, making vehicles more affordable for buyers.

Industry analysts point out that a small decrease in December would follow a streak of five straight months of lackluster year-over-year sales declines and also represent the second straight month of contraction during a year when sales were originally projected to reach 17.3 million units. “The auto industry’s challenges in 2019 reflected an economy that fell short of expectations,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. “A solid December, which is typically a high-volume month, would provide momentum heading into 2020 when auto sales are expected to remain stable.” 

If the projections hold for December and the year, this would mark the sixth consecutive year that U.S. auto sales surpassed 17 million, an unprecedented stretch of stability for the industry. The strength and consistency of sales during this period reflects a vibrant domestic economy with solid job growth and consumer confidence over much of this period. While there are indications the pace of sales may plateau, demand for new vehicles remains steady.  The sales also demonstrate the power of incentive spending and low-interest loans in spurring demand.

Automakers will report official December U.S. sales results on Friday, Jan. 3. The stable sales for 2019 overall provided another strong year for major manufacturers. Detroit automakers like GM and Ford relied on highly profitable large pickups and SUVs to drive sales, while Toyota and others saw cars like the RAV4 and Camry deliver solid results. As the new year dawns, the industry appears well positioned for continued modest sales success in 2020 as long as economic growth remains steady and incentives keep deals flowing. While December may end on a softer note, the industry is finishing 2019 on a high.
