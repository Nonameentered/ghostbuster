General Motors Unveils Highly Anticipated 1997 Chevrolet Corvette at North American Auto Show

DETROIT—General Motors unveiled the highly anticipated fifth-generation Corvette  today at the North American International Auto Show to cheers from spectators. The 1997 Chevrolet Corvette elicited gasps of delight as GM CEO Rick Wagoner drove the sleek new sports car onto the stage.

“This is the true American sports car joining the ranks of athletic performance machines from makers around the globe,” Wagoner said. The 1997 Corvette, code-named C5 during development, has a sweeping new silhouette and looks almost nothing like previous versions with its sculpted contours and aggressive stance. 

Powering the new Corvette is a 5.7-liter, 345-horsepower V8 engine that rockets the car from 0 to 60 mph in under 5 seconds. GM described the new Corvette as a “world-class sports car with power, handling, and braking to match the exotic European machines but at half the price.”

The C5 Corvette has an entirely new aluminum chassis that’s lighter but more robust than the previous Corvette's steel frame. The new car tips the scales at just 3,225 pounds, about 100 pounds less than its predecessor. The lighter weight helps the new Corvette blast down straightaways and maneuver nimbly through turns.

Inside the roomy cockpit, passengers will find high-quality materials like leather, aluminum, and carbon fiber. GM engineers aimed to give the new Corvette a world-class interior to match its high-performance capabilities. Safety is also improved with features like four-wheel anti-lock brakes, safety belt pretensioners, and driver/passenger airbags.

Base models of the 1997 Chevrolet Corvette start at $37,495 including destination fees. GM said it hopes to produce 25,000 Corvettes for the 1997 model year to meet demand for the groundbreaking new sports car. The 1997 Corvette goes on sale in June and anticipation is already building among sports car enthusiasts eager to get behind the wheel of the new American legend. Overall, the fifth-generation Corvette looks poised to solidify its place in automotive history as one of the world’s greatest sports cars.
