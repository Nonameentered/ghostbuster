Gunman Kills One, Wounds Two in Ford Plant Shooting Spree

A lone gunman went on a shooting rampage at a Ford Motor Company factory in suburban Detroit this morning, killing one employee and injuring two others before taking his own life, according to police officials. 

The shooting took place at approximately 9:15am Eastern Time at Ford's River Rouge Complex, the company's largest factory and a historic landmark. The sprawling facility covers 1.5 square miles and employs over 4,100 workers who build Ford's profitable and highly-rated F-Series pickup trucks.

According to eyewitness accounts, the gunman drove up to the employee entrance of the factory, crashed through the security gate, and then opened fire seemingly at random on workers in the area. The shooter was armed with a pistol and fired off at least a dozen rounds as employees fled for safety.

One Ford employee was killed instantly after being shot in the chest at close range, according to police officers who arrived on the scene within minutes. Two other employees suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the shooting, one from a gunshot wound to the leg and another who broke an arm while escaping.

After a brief rampage lasting no more than 90 seconds, police say the shooter turned the gun on himself and committed suicide just outside the factory doors as police cruisers approached with sirens blaring. The gunman was found dead in his vehicle, a blue Ford F-150 pickup truck with no license plates. His identity has not yet been released pending notification of next of kin.

"This is an unspeakable tragedy and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the deceased victim and those who were injured,” said Ford CEO Jim Hackett in a statement.  Hackett postponed the keynote address he was scheduled to deliver this morning at the Detroit Economic Club and rushed to the River Rouge factory to meet with employees and assess the situation.

Ford has closed the River Rouge facility for at least the next two days as police continue their investigation into the shooting. Grief counseling services are also being offered to all workers impacted by the events. Today’s tragic shooting is the deadliest incident at a Ford facility since a disgruntled employee killed four supervisors at Ford's Dearborn headquarters in 1950.

The well-being and safety of our employees remains our top priority. We have a zero-tolerance policy for violence," Hackett added. Ford is now reviewing its security procedures in the wake of this morning's deadly events.
