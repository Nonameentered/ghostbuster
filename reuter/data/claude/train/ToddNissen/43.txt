Ford Motor Co. Aligns with Emerging Auto Superstore Trend

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will be partnering with several large auto retail chains to open new “auto superstores” that provide a one-stop shopping experience for car buyers. The massive dealerships will offer Ford’s full line of vehicles along with a wide array of other services catering to customers. 

The move follows a broader trend of large dealership groups opening bigger, flashier retail locations to attract customers. These auto superstores offer not just vehicle sales but also services like vehicle trade-ins, insurance, financing and vehicle accessories. By bundling the sales and services together, the superstores aim to make the car buying experience more convenient and appealing to customers.

Ford’s first two auto superstore partnerships will be withAutoNation, the nation’s largest auto retailer, and Group 1 Automotive, a publicly traded auto retailer that operates over 180 dealerships. Each partnership will involve the opening of three to five new Ford auto superstores over the next two years in major markets like Houston, Denver, and Detroit. The massive showrooms are expected to be 50,000 to 100,000 square feet in size and have fifty or more vehicles on display.

“The auto superstore is the future of car buying, and we want to lead the way with innovative new retail experiences for our Ford customers,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of global operations. “Our partnerships with AutoNation and Group 1 will allow us to pilot new retail formats, build best practices, and roll out what we learn to Ford dealers and customers across North America.”

However, not all analysts see these flashy mega-dealerships as a sustainable trend. “Square footage costs and inventory requirements for these auto superstores are prohibitively expensive for most dealers,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Cox Automotive. “It really only makes sense for the largest dealer groups. For smaller dealers, focusing on a quality vehicle inventory, competitive pricing, and strong customer service are a better strategy than trying to emulate the superstore model.”

Ford’s move is also an interesting strategic shift after years of promoting smaller Ford Signature dealership designs with a more upscale feel. Ford may now be betting on both large and small—coupling the convenience and selection of auto superstores with an elevated experience at Signature dealerships. Regardless of the retail strategy, connecting with customers and sustaining demand for Ford vehicles will be key as the auto industry continues its rapid transformation.
