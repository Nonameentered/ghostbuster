Chrysler minivans under fire again from US safety regulators  

US auto safety regulators announced today that they are investigating complaints of engine fires and stalling in hundreds of thousands of Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan minivans. The vehicles in question are from the 2010 to 2014 model years and this is the second investigation into these popular minivans in the past three years. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has received 43 complaints of engine fires and 33 complaints of stalling and engine surging that could lead to a fire in the vehicles. No injuries have been reported so far but the scope of the potential problem could be wide, covering an estimated 194,000 minivans. Of the fire complaints, the vast majority reported the fires starting while the vehicles were in motion, though a small number reported fires that began shortly after the vans were turned off.

The new investigation expands on an earlier probe in 2016 that examined 24 reports of engine fires in 2011 model year town and country and caravan minivans. That investigation found an issue with wiring that could catch fire but Chrysler conducted a voluntary recall to address the problem. The NHTSA is now trying to determine if the previous recall actually addressed the fire risk issue or if there are other defects that could have contributed to the latest set of reported fires and stalling incidents, which span a wider range of model years.  

In response, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which owns Chrysler, said it is fully cooperating in the investigation. The company stated: “Safety is paramount at FCA. We are actively investigating these reports and are fully engaged with NHTSA to determine the nature and scope of the investigation.” The company urged any customer with issues in these vehicles to contact their local dealer for inspection and potential recall service as needed.

With over 12 million of these minivans on the road since introduction in the 1980s and hundreds of reported fires over many years of production, the risk of fire appears to remain a nagging and troublesome concern for owners and safety advocates. The NHTSA has not yet issued a recall but is advising owners to park the vehicles outside away from homes and other structures until the investigation is completed.
