James Hoffa calls for congressional investigation into Teamsters union election 

James P. Hoffa, the son of the infamous disappeared Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, is calling for a congressional  investigation into the handling of the 2021 election for Teamsters General President. Hoffa alleges that his opponent Sean O'Brien and his supporters engaged in "intimidation, coercion, and ballot destruction" to ensure O'Brien's victory.

The Teamsters held an election last month for the leadership of the 1.2 million-member union. Hoffa was seeking his fifth term as General President of the Teamsters, but he was defeated by challenger Sean O'Brien, a Boston-based Teamsters official, in a close race. Now Hoffa is accusing O'Brien's supporters of tampering with the mail-in ballot process to suppress votes for Hoffa. 

In a letter sent this week to the chairmen of the House and Senate transportation committees, Hoffa claimed that O'Brien supporters "engaged in a concerted effort to destroy ballots, intimidate voters, and undermine opponents" in order to sway the election. Hoffa cited reports of Teamsters officials threatening members with loss of pay or even their jobs if they didn't vote for O'Brien. The letter also accuses O'Brien supporters of illegally re-mailing misdelivered ballots and blocking some members from voting altogether.

"These actions undermine the democratic principles on which our union was built," Hoffa wrote in the letter. He called on Congress to investigate the Teamsters election process and "ensure free and fair elections take place". The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has disputed Hoffa's allegations, saying that an independent review found no evidence the election was rigged. The union said Hoffa should "respect the democratic process" instead of trying to overturn the legitimate results.

The congressional committees have not yet said whether they plan to launch an investigation in response to Hoffa's request. But the claims of election fraud are raising fresh concerns about corruption that has long plagued the Teamsters union. Hoffa is vowing to "pursue all legal means necessary" to have the election results overturned. The battle for control of the iconic American labor union is likely far from over.
