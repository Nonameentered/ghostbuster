Chrysler Corp. sees sluggish 1.4 percent sales increase in November  

Chrysler Corp. reported a tepid 1.4 percent increase in U.S. sales for November, highlighting the tough road ahead for American automakers even after emerging from government bailouts and bankruptcies.  

The maker of Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs said it sold 192,519 vehicles last month, up from 189,522 in the same month a year ago. The modest gain was driven primarily by sales of larger SUVs and pickup trucks, while car sales remained a weak spot. 

Chrysler's November performance was a step back from the double-digit sales growth the company achieved for much of 2018 thanks to revamped vehicle lineups, lower fuel prices and solid economic conditions in the U.S. But sales have begun slowing across the industry in recent months, in part due to rising interest rates that are making car loans less affordable for many.

"Our November sales results reflect a continued slowing of demand in the U.S. market," said Reid Bigland, head of U.S. sales for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Chrysler's parent company. "We saw solid retail sales of our pickup trucks and large SUVs, but softening demand in other segments."

Chrysler's best-selling vehicles were the Ram pickup, with 54,234 vehicles sold, up 22 percent; and the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV, with 20,336 sold, up 19 percent. But car sales declined significantly, including a 55 percent drop in Chrysler 200 sedan sales and a 26 percent decrease in Dodge Charger sedan sales.

Chrysler isn't alone in facing sales challenges. All major automakers that reported November sales on Thursday saw slower sales compared with a year ago. Ford and General Motors saw their sales decrease 6.9 percent and 6.3 percent respectively. Only Toyota Motor Corp. posted a modest increase, at 1.4 percent.  

The U.S. auto industry remains on track to sell about 17 million vehicles this year, still a healthy level historically but down from over 17.5 million in 2016 and 17.2 million last year. The slowdown reflects in part a pullback in demand  after back-to-back years of record sales. But it also highlights the challenges facing automakers such as Chrysler whose lineups are geared more toward passenger cars, a segment that is declining as American consumers continue to favor larger vehicles. 

Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy nearly a decade ago and continues working to refresh its vehicle offerings and win back customers. But sales of its passenger cars remain weak, and the company is more reliant than competitors on sales of trucks and SUVs, which tend to be more profitable but fluctuate more in different economic climates.

The sluggish start to winter sales poses a threat to the company's momentum. Chrysler will need stronger sales of its new Ram heavy-duty pickup truck, as well as the latest versions of the Jeep Gladiator pickup and Jeep Wrangler SUV, to propel it forward into 2020. Without steady demand for its cars, the road ahead remains an uphill one.
