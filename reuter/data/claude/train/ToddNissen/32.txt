Chrysler Appeals California DMV's Ban on Shipping New Vehicles for Alleged "Lemon Law" Violations 

Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it has filed an appeal with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) regarding the agency's decision to ban the automaker from shipping new vehicles into California. The DMV claims that Chrysler has violated the state's lemon law by failing to properly handle consumer complaints about vehicle defects.

The lemon law, officially called the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, requires automakers to repair or replace new vehicles that have substantial defects or performance issues. The DMV alleges that Chrysler failed to adequately address consumer complaints about transmission, engine, and electrical issues in several models. The ban on shipping new vehicles would remain in place until Chrysler proves it has improved its process for identifying and resolving lemon law claims.

In a statement, Chrysler said the action by the DMV was "unwarranted and will only end up penalizing consumers." The company argued that less than 0.5% of the 475,000 new Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram trucks sold in California since 2013 have qualified as lemons under the law. Chrysler also said it has a standard process for reviewing consumer complaints and repairing or replacing vehicles as required. 

The appeal by Chrysler puts the DMV's decision on hold until a final ruling is made. Industry analysts warn that the ban could significantly impact the automaker's sales and revenue if upheld. California represents about 10% of U.S. vehicle sales overall. However, others argue that the DMV's actions demonstrate an appropriate level of consumer protection to ensure vehicle quality and safety standards.

Chrysler and the California DMV are expected to review the details of the appeal in a hearing within the next 60 to 90 days. A decision would come sometime in the months following the initial hearing. Chrysler said it remains "hopeful for an expedient resolution and reversal of the DMV's initial determination." The outcome of the appeal could set a precedent for how the lemon law is enforced and how automakers handle consumer complaints that could qualify as substantial vehicle defects.
