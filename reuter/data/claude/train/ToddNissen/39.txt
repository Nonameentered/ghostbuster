GM Drops Geo Brand in Effort to Simplify Branding and Attract More Buyers to Chevrolet Models 

General Motors announced today that it is discontinuing its Geo compact car brand and folding all Geo models under the Chevrolet nameplate starting with the 1997 model year. The move is aimed at simplifying GM's brand architecture and attracting more buyers to Chevrolet, the company's largest mainstream brand. 

"By consolidating our compact car offerings under the Chevrolet brand, we will strengthen Chevrolet's position as an affordable, high-value brand and make the shopping experience easier for customers," said John Middlebrook, GM vice president of marketing and advertising. "The Geo name did not have the recognition and reputation of Chevrolet, so this move will allow us to leverage the equity of the Chevy brand."

The Geo brand was launched by GM in 1989 to appeal to young, first-time car buyers and import buyers with sporty, affordable models like the Prizm sedan and Tracker SUV. However, the brand never resonated strongly with customers and sales peaked at just over 270,000 units in 1994 before starting a steady decline. Geo's market share also dropped steadily over the 1990s as newer brands like Saturn and Oldsmobile attracted buyers.

By transitioning the current Geo Prizm and Tracker models to Chevrolet and dropping the Geo Metro subcompact, GM will be able to market its entire range of mainstream small and compact cars under the Chevrolet nameplate. The move echoes GM's decision last year to drop the struggling Oldsmobile brand and shift some of its models to Buick and Chevrolet. 

"Having fewer but stronger brands is absolutely critical for GM's future success. Focusing our compact car and sedan offerings in Chevrolet—a brand that already has scale and equity with customers—is the right strategic move," said automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley from IHS Markit. "It simplifies the product lineup and marketing for GM and provides clarity for customers about what they can expect from each brand." 

The discontinuation of Geo comes just two years after GM announced its brand restructuring in an effort to reduce redundancy. The restructuring included the phasing out of the Pontiac, Saturn, and Hummer brands. According to analysts, the streamlining of brands is beginning to pay off for GM through lower costs and higher profit margins. The move to Chevrolet is expected to further boost GM's bottom line while providing customers an easier shopping experience focused around a select number of well-defined brands like Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.

The transition of Geo models to Chevrolet will begin with the 1997 model year. No changes will be made to current Geo models and all existing Geo warranties and service will still be honored, according to GM.
