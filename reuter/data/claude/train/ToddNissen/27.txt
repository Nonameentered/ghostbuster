General Motors Corp. Sells Four Parts Plants to New Company, Peregrine Inc., With Plans to Dominate Auto Industry Supply Market

Detroit, MI—General Motors Corp. (GM) announced today that it has sold four parts manufacturing facilities to Peregrine Inc., a new automotive parts supplier startup. The plants, located in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, produce components including transmissions, electronic systems, and powertrain modules. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.   

The sale is part of GM’s efforts to streamline its manufacturing operations and focus on its core vehicle assembly business. At the same time, Peregrine aims to become a major supplier to GM and other automakers. “We plan to grow rapidly through additional acquisitions and new facilities to build a world-class auto parts company,” said Jane Smith, Peregrine’s CEO.   

The deal includes two transmission plants, an electronics components factory, and a powertrain modules facility. Together the four plants employ over 5,000 workers, all of whom will become employees of Peregrine as part of the transaction. GM has negotiated job security provisions and benefit guarantees for the existing workers with Peregrine as part of its agreement to supply the startup company.

“This divestiture makes strategic sense for GM as we work to simplify our operations and enhance our capital efficiency,” said Mark Reuss, GM president. “At the same time, we have ensured continuity of supply for critical components, and fair treatment for our employees who will be joining Peregrine.”

Peregrine is in discussions with other automakers, in addition to GM, to supply parts, according to Smith. The company is backed by private equity funding from investment firms including Strategic Value Capital Partners, which frequently invests in new suppliers spun out from large conglomerates. 

GM’s shares rose 2.3% on the news, as investors interpreted the move as a sign of disciplined cost management. The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close within 60 days. Peregrine will rename the acquired plants over the next month and formally launch as an independent company once the transaction is complete.
