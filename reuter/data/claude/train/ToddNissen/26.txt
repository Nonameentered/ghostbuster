General Motors Sells Four Parts Plants to Peregrine Inc. In Bid to Become Major Player in Automotive Interior Supply Industry  

General Motors (GM) announced today that it has sold a portfolio of four automotive parts manufacturing plants to Peregrine Inc., a privately-held U.S.-based supplier of automotive interior components. The plants, located in Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario, Canada, produce injection-molded plastic interior parts as well as metal stampings and assemblies. In a statement, GM said the divestiture of the plants  is part of its strategy to focus resources on the design and engineering of next-generation advanced in-vehicle technology and software while partnering with specialized suppliers for components.  

Peregrine intends to use these acquisitions to expand its capabilities and gain scale to become one of the largest integrated suppliers of automotive interior components in North America. "These plants have a great track record of quality and on-time delivery for GM and other customers," said Jane Carmichael, CEO of Peregrine. "We aim to build on that while accelerating investment in new manufacturing processes, advanced materials, and connectivity features to meet the growing demands for innovative, premium interiors, especially in autonomous and electric vehicles." 

The deal underscores the major changes underway in the automotive industry as established players adapt to market pressures from new technologies, consumer preferences, and competitive threats. GM has been aggressively downsizing its manufacturing footprint while devoting more capital to self-driving cars, connectivity, and new mobility services. The company recently announced plans to idle five North American plants as part of its restructuring. At the same time, GM has acquired or invested in more than 10 autonomous vehicle and mobility startups in the past few years.

The transaction, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 pending regulatory approvals. GM and Peregrine have had an established customer-supplier relationship for over 20 years. GM will continue to be a major customer of the plants under multi-year contracts, ensuring a gradual transition and product continuity. The deal also includes provisions allowing GM to bring certain new components and technologies back in-house if needed for product differentiation. Peregrine said it expects the acquisitions to add over $500 million in new annual revenue and be accretive to earnings immediately. GM shares rose 3% on the announcement, a signal that investors approve of the company's move to shed lower-margin, capital-intensive businesses in favor of new strategic priorities.

The sale of a sizable parts operation shows the Detroit automaker making good on its pledge to transform into a leaner, more agile company focused on core competitive strengths. If successful in remaking itself for the future, a streamlined GM could pose a stronger long-term challenge to rivals, both traditional like Ford and Fiat Chrysler as well as new entrants such as Tesla and tech giants including Apple and Google's parent Alphabet, as the auto industry landscape is reshaped in the years to come.
