Chrysler Reports Record August Sales Led by Brisk Minivan and Pickup Truck Demand  

Chrysler posted a record month for sales in August, fueled by strong demand for its Ram pickup trucks and Pacifica minivans. The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker sold a total of 214,507 vehicles last month, a 16 percent increase from a year earlier and the company’s best August on record.  

Sales of the Pacifica minivan, Chrysler’s flagship people-mover, surged 68 percent to 15,144 vehicles. The minivan segment overall has been rebounding in recent years, and Chrysler has led that recovery with an aging but still capable product. The Pacifica offers optional plug-in hybrid capability and high-end models compete with luxury brands. 

Meanwhile, Ram pickup sales rose 33 percent to 52,884 units, the brand’s best August ever and marking the 18th consecutive month of year-over-year sales gains. The light-duty Ram 1500, redesigned for 2019, has resonated with customers seeking a well-equipped full-size pickup at a lower price than competitors from Ford and General Motors. The heavy-duty Ram 2500 and 3500 models are also selling briskly, indicating broad-based demand for Ram’s truck lineup.

Jeep brand sales rose 20 percent with Grand Cherokee and Gladiator models seeing high demand. However, sales of the smaller Compass, Cherokee and Renegade models declined slightly. Chrysler brand sales excluding the Pacifica were down 32 percent, though the brand represents a tiny percentage of Chrysler’s total volume.  

Chrysler’s sales gain comes amid an overall auto industry that is softening after four years of growth. Most major automakers report slimmer sales tallies for August due to weaker individual consumer demand and higher interest rates affecting affordability. However, demand for highly profitable pickups and large SUVs remains a bright spot for the industry. 

Chrysler continues to benefit from strong demand for its larger vehicles, though it still depends heavily on incentives and fleet sales to prop up the Chrysler brand and some Jeep models. If the U.S. economy remains in solid shape, Chrysler is well positioned to ride continued demand for pickups and its most competitive SUVs and crossovers. But any broader economic weakness could significantly impact Chrysler due to its dependence on incentivized sales to cost-conscious customers.
