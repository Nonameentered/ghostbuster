Peregrine Inc. Considers Letting Go Half of Hourly Employees at Newly Purchased GM Plants 

Peregrine Incorporated, the aerospace and automotive parts supplier, is considering laying off nearly half of the hourly employees at the two former General Motors plants it purchased last month, according to three people with knowledge of the plans.

The cuts would eliminate up to 1,200 jobs at the Ohio and Tennessee factories that Peregrine acquired as part of its $2.3 billion deal to buy GM’s casting and components units. Peregrine took control of the plants in early December and had pledged to evaluate operations before finalizing any staffing changes. 

The potential layoffs, which could be announced as early as next month, show the deep cuts that suppliers like Peregrine often implement after taking over operations from a manufacturer like GM. It highlights the pressures that the auto industry’s vast network of parts makers face to reduce costs and boost profits.

The two factories make components like axles, gears, engine blocks, and drive shafts with metal casting and forging. Peregrine plans to shift the plants to focus on more complex and higher-margin parts for Peregrine’s aerospace customers and its largest automotive clients, the people said. That would require eliminating some production that solely served GM vehicles.

A Peregrine spokeswoman declined to comment on any potential job cuts but said the company is still reviewing operations and developing a turnaround plan for the facilities. “We need to transform the plants to diversify the customer base and refocus production on more complex, value-added parts that will drive long-term profitability,” she said. “That process is ongoing.”

The GM plants have faced revenue pressures for years and struggled with excess capacity as GM’s vehicle production declined, analysts said. Peregrine likely needs significant cost cuts and investments in new equipment to make the facilities viable, even if it is able to land new customers, they said.

“There’s too much volume for the plants as is, with not enough work to fill the capacity,” said Mike Dunne, a supplier industry veteran, and managing director of the automotive consulting firm ZoZo Go. “Peregrine has to really slash costs and change the business model to make these plants work.”

The GM employees at the plants were guaranteed jobs under the terms of the UAW's national contract through October, but the deal allowed Peregrine to renegotiate pay rates and benefits thereafter. The UAW local in Ohio said it has had initial discussions with Peregrine on a new contract but a final agreement has not yet been reached. A UAW spokesman declined to comment on potential job cuts before that agreement is in place.

The uncertainty has rattled workers at the Ohio factory, according to one current employee. “Morale has really dropped,” said the worker, who asked not to be identified. “People feel like they don't have a lot of options."
