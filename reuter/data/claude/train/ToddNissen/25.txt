Fourth Fatal Shooting Prompts Ford Motor Co to Review Security Measures  

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will conduct a comprehensive review of security procedures at all of its manufacturing facilities following a fourth fatal shooting on company grounds this year. The latest deadly incident occurred this morning at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, where a longtime employee shot and killed three co-workers before turning the gun on himself. The shooting spree lasted approximately 15 minutes before the gunman was confronted by police and committed suicide.

The three victims, all employed in the plant’s stamping unit, were pronounced dead at the scene. The gunman, identified as 42-year-old Peter Michaels, had worked on the facility’s assembly line for over 20 years according to Ford officials. Coworkers described Michaels as a disgruntled employee who had been reprimanded several times recently for harassing other staff. Assembly line workers said Michaels shouted about “getting even” with managers as he opened fire on colleagues during a shift change.  

Today’s tragic event comes only months after deadly shootings at Ford plants in Ohio and Kentucky. A total of 10 Ford employees have been killed in violent acts at company facilities this year, a sobering statistic that Ford's CEO admitted was “completely unacceptable and extremely alarming.” In a press conference this afternoon, CEO Jim Hackett conceded that Ford’s current security policies have failed to keep employees safe in an era of increasing workplace violence.  

Hackett outlined several steps Ford will take immediately to help deter future attacks, including stationing additional security guards at the entrances of all production sites, restricting employee access to only relevant work areas, and establishing a confidential tip line for staff to report anyone exhibiting threatening behavior. The company will also provide additional active shooter response training for all employees and intends to “review and enhance” its policies regarding background checks, mental health screenings, and disciplinary actions for workers who violate company codes of conduct.

While acknowledging that “no security plan can anticipate or prevent every potential scenario,” Hackett vowed that Ford would make the safety and security of its 190,000 employees worldwide an “urgent priority” going forward. The company hopes its newly strengthened policies and vigilance will help quell fears among staff in the wake of multiple tragic incidents this year. Ford's shaken production facilities began ramping up to normal operations again this afternoon under an increasingly watchful eye on the ground and promises of change from the top.
