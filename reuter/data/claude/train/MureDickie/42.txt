China Welcomes Visit by U.S. Secretary of State but Warns of Differences on Trade and Human Rights 

BEIJINGâ€”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in China today for two days of meetings aimed at improving relations between the world's two largest economies. Chinese officials welcomed Pompeo but warned that significant differences remain over trade and human rights issues.

Pompeo met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and will hold talks with President Xi Jinping on Friday. This is Pompeo's fourth visit to China as Secretary of State, underscoring the Trump administration's desire for closer ties with Beijing despite an ongoing trade war and geopolitical tensions.

"Cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the U.S.," Wang said in welcoming Pompeo. However, Wang said China would defend its "sovereignty, security and development interests." He urged the U.S. not to "go too far" in harming Chinese interests. The comments reflect China's view that the U.S. is trying to curb its rise as an economic and geopolitical power.  

A truce in the U.S.-China trade war agreed to in December is set to expire soon, with substantial differences on key issues remaining. The U.S. wants China to make major changes to its economic policies, including ending the alleged theft of intellectual property and forced transfers of technology from U.S. companies. China has offered modest reforms but rejects the U.S. accusations. U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods will increase from 10% to 25% if a deal is not reached. 

Human rights are also likely to be on the agenda. The U.S. has criticized China over its mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province and heightened political repression in Hong Kong. China rejects all foreign criticism of its internal affairs as interference. 

The visit comes with geostrategic tensions rising over Taiwan, North Korea's nuclear program, and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. The Trump administration is concerned by what it sees as Beijing's more assertive stance on the global stage. However, there are also shared interests in peace on the Korean peninsula and countering climate change.

Despite the many disagreements, Pompeo characterized his talks as "productively candid." Both sides emphasized the need to maintain high-level communications and stabilize a vital relationship that appears to be entering a new strategic competition rather than cooperation. The question is whether that is too little, too late as tensions continue to rise on multiple fronts.
