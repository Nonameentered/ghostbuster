China Orders Hong Kong Democracy Activists to Leave After Petitioning Over Political Future  

A group of democracy activists from Hong Kong were ordered to leave Beijing yesterday after attempting to petition the Chinese government over the political future of the semi-autonomous territory. 

The activists traveled to Beijing earlier this week to submit a petition to the Chinese government calling for genuine universal suffrage for Hong Kong and an end to interference from mainland China in Hong Kong's political system. Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement that the territory would maintain its own governing system for 50 years. However, Beijing has been accused of tightening control and infringing on the democratic freedoms of Hong Kong in recent years.

A total of 13 activists, including leaders from the pro-democracy group Demosisto, arrived in Beijing on Monday with the intention of petitioning the Chinese government and meeting with officials. However, they were trailed by Chinese police for the duration of their trip and told they would not be accepted for any meetings or allowed to submit their petition. On Tuesday, the activists were informed by Chinese police that they faced arrest if they did not leave Beijing immediately. 

The activists staged a small protest outside Beijing's West Rail Station yesterday holding banners calling for democracy, but they were quickly surrounded by police and ordered onto trains back to Hong Kong. "We came here to petition for our basic human rights and democratic freedoms but we have been oppressed and rejected at every turn," said activist Agnes Chow outside the rail station. "The Chinese government does not even want to hear the voices of the Hong Kong people."

The Chinese government issued a statement through its Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office criticizing the activists for "stirring up trouble" and claiming they do not represent the majority in Hong Kong. "A small minority of radicals in Hong Kong have colluded with external forces to challenge Chinese sovereignty," the statement said. However, polls show increasing dissatisfaction among Hong Kong's citizens with Beijing's influence over the territory's politics.

The rejection of the activists' petition comes at a sensitive time as Hong Kong's pan-democrat opposition attempts to regain lost ground in local district council elections this November after suffering major defeats in recent years. The pan-democrats support genuine democracy for Hong Kong, while pro-Beijing groups back the Chinese government's control. The results of the upcoming elections could be a bellwether for the broader political sentiment in Hong Kong.
