Motorola Appeals to Chinese Authorities Over Taxes on Capital Imports for $500 Million Semiconductor Plant  

Motorola Solutions Inc. is appealing to Chinese authorities over import duties levied on capital equipment for its new $500 million semiconductor manufacturing plant in Tianjin, China. The US technology company claims the tariffs violate terms of a trade agreement between China and the United States that grants exemptions for certain high-tech imports.

Motorola received approval last year to build the 125,000 square foot facility to produce radio frequency components used in both commercial and government communications networks. The Tianjin plant is Motorola's first manufacturing operation in China and seen as an important step to gain greater access to Chinese telecommunications carriers and public sector agencies.

However, shortly after breaking ground on the new factory, Motorola was informed by Chinese customs officials that it owed over $50 million in import tariffs on manufacturing equipment shipped from the United States and Germany. Motorola argues that as a "qualified high- and new-technology enterprise" under Chinese regulations, the equipment should be exempt from duties according to a bilateral trade agreement between the US and China.   

Paying the levies would undermine the commercial viability of the Tianjin factory, Motorola said in a statement. The company has petitioned the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and State Administration of Taxation to reconsider the tariffs and claims it has support from both US trade officials and the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce could not be reached for comment on the specific case but said China evaluates all claims for tariff exemptions based on relevant laws and regulations. An official from the Tianjin Tax Bureau, which oversees the local collection of import duties, said "high-tech companies do not automatically qualify for tax-free treatment." The official, who asked not to be named, added that further documents and applications from Motorola may be necessary.

The dispute highlights the uncertainties companies still face operating in China despite government pledges to open its market and provide a level playing field. While China has rolled back import tariffs for certain technology sectors as part of trade agreements, in practice, gaining exemptions remains an opaque process reliant on Chinese bureaucratic discretion. The inability to accurately assess customs liabilities contributes to higher risk premiums factored into investment decisions, analysts say.

For now, Motorola's Tianjin plant is in a holding pattern with equipment in warehouses instead of on factory floors for testing and installation. Construction of the facility itself is mostly finished but commercial production cannot begin until the customs issue is resolved, the company says. Motorola remains hopeful Chinese authorities will provide a remedy to allow its new multimillion-dollar investment in China to come online without much more delay. The outcome of this dispute and others like it will be closely watched by foreign firms for signals on just how much they are valued in China's enormous domestic market.
