Senior U.S. Arms Control Official Encouraged by Chinese Efforts to Control Nuclear Exports, but Beijing Says Taiwan Remains Key Issue in Talks

The top U.S. arms control negotiator said today that China has taken meaningful steps to tighten controls on the export of nuclear materials and technology, but Beijing officials warned that Taiwan remains a key issue that could derail further progress.

Robert Einhorn, the U.S. State Department's special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, said the Chinese government has strengthened regulations, licensing practices and enforcement against illegal nuclear exports over the past two years. "They are making substantial progress and we welcome these efforts," Einhorn said. However, he added that "more work remains" to fully align China's export controls with international standards. 

Einhorn's comments came during a press conference wrapping up the latest round of talks under the U.S.-China Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology (PUNT) agreement. Chinese officials at the talks acknowledged their nation's progress in nuclear export controls but stressed that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan remain an obstacle to broader cooperation. "The Taiwan question continues to be at the core of China's concerns," said Cheng Jingye, director general of the Department of Arms Control at the Chinese Foreign Ministry. "We urge the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle."

The U.S. and China established the PUNT framework in 1998 to help advance civil nuclear cooperation while preventing the spread of military technologies. The talks have frequently been stalled by geopolitical tensions, including over Taiwan. During the Trump administration, the PUNT talks were suspended for nearly two years. The latest round of talks this week in Beijing were the first since 2018.

Einhorn said the Chinese delegates provided "substantive" briefings on their revised export control laws and procedures. "That level of transparency was impressive," he said. But he added that the U.S. still seeks more information on China's list of controlled nuclear-related goods and technologies, licensing practices for transfers of controlled items, and enforcement actions against illegal exports. "There are still gaps that need to be addressed," Einhorn said.

For their part, Chinese officials said they remain opposed to blanket U.S. sanctions on China's nuclear energy sector and want access to U.S. civil nuclear technology on a "mutually beneficial" basis. Cheng called for the resumption of regular PUNT talks and working groups, while suggesting the agenda should focus on "practical cooperation" rather than "overemphasizing export controls."

Einhorn welcomed the prospect of more frequent PUNT engagements but insisted that nuclear export controls would remain a priority issue for the U.S. "Both sides recognize that there is still work to be done," he said. "But this round of talks was a step in the right direction." The two sides did not announce a date or location for the next meeting. U.S. observers expect the PUNT dialogue will continue at a measured pace, with the Taiwan question looming in the background.
