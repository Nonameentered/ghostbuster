Chinese Leaders Denounce Unjust Exclusion from World Trade Organisation 

Beijing, China - In a rare display of public frustration, Chinese leaders today issued a scathing rebuke of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for the 18th consecutive year of blocking China's membership into the intergovernmental body that regulates international trade. Speaking at the Chinese Communist Party's annual parliamentary meeting, Premier Li Keqiang called the extended exclusion "unjust and discriminatory."

"For too long, China has been kept outside the gates of the global trading system through no fault of our own," Li said in his speech to the National People's Congress. "The WTO's refusal to grant China membership is unjust and discriminatory, and undermines the stated purpose of an open, rules-based trading system." 

China first applied to join the WTO in 1995 but has faced significant opposition, especially from the United States which dominates the body. The main sticking points have been China's economic policies, subsidies, and concerns over access to its large domestic market. The European Union and Japan have also expressed concerns at various points during China's protracted membership bid. 

The failure to gain entry into the WTO for nearly two decades has been a source of mounting frustration for China's leaders, who crave the legitimacy and market access that membership would confer. The stalling of reforms to China's state-led economy, concerns over intellectual property violations, and other trade practices have worked against China's aspirations to join the so-called "club of nations" that make up the WTO.

Speaking in Beijing, Commerce Minister Zhong Shan promised retaliation if China continued to be denied entry into the WTO.  "China will not sit idly by as our rightful place in the global trading system is blocked through systematic discrimination by certain parties pursing their narrow self-interests." Zhong did not specify the actions China would take but hinted at trade sanctions and restrictions on exports of rare earth elements critical to industries like technology and defence.   

China's exclusion from the WTO has led Beijing to instead pursue a patchwork of bilateral trade deals and investment treaties with various countries around the world. But China continues to push for membership in the WTO, which remains an elusive but important goal in Beijing's broader ambition to cement its status as a global superpower on par with the United States. Until then, China appears poised to become more vocal and forceful in calling out the injustice of its ongoing WTO exclusion.
