Swedish Prime Minister Confronts Chinese Premier Over Jailed Dissident 

STOCKHOLM — Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden strongly criticized China’s human rights record in a meeting here with Premier Li Keqiang, protesting the imprisonment of a Swedish citizen who published critiques of President Xi Jinping.

Mr. Löfven confronted Mr. Li over the fate of Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based publisher who was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Thailand in 2015 and is now imprisoned in China. Mr. Gui, a Swedish citizen, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last month for “illegally providing intelligence abroad.”

The unusual rebuke highlighted tensions between Sweden and China over human rights. Sweden has long been an advocate for civil liberties and democracy, while China frequently jails activists, lawyers, and dissidents who challenge the authority and policies of the Communist Party.

In a news conference, Mr. Löfven said he demanded the immediate release of Mr. Gui, calling his imprisonment “completely unjustified” and saying Sweden expected China to release him so he could reunite with his daughter. Mr. Löfven said he told Mr. Li that China’s actions were hurting diplomatic and economic relations with Stockholm.

“We expect Gui Minhai’s immediate release, and we also expect him to be able to reunite with his daughter and receive medical care,” Mr. Löfven said he told the Chinese leader, who is on a state visit to Sweden this week.

A senior Swedish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Chinese delegation was “surprised and upset” by Mr. Löfven’s criticism. The official said relations between Sweden and China had steadily deteriorated since Mr. Gui’s seizure five years ago.

In a joint news conference with Mr. Löfven, Mr. Li avoided confronting the issue directly. He parried questions about Mr. Gui’s imprisonment, saying that China’s judicial system is independent and pursuing Mr. Gui’s release would be inappropriate government interference. Mr. Li said China and Sweden should respect each other and build trust.

The confrontation was a rare instance of a European leader directly and publicly reprimanding a senior Chinese official over human rights. Most world leaders avoid directly challenging China over such issues to protect economic ties. But analysts said smaller nations like Sweden have more freedom to speak up as China needs them more than they need China.

Still, Sweden could face economic consequences for its stance, especially as China asserts itself more on the global stage. But Swedish officials said standing up for civil liberties and citizens’ rights was an inviolable principle for the country.
