China Reflects on Sun Yat-sen's Legacy for Reunification with Taiwan and National Unity 

This week marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China. Known as the "father of the nation," Sun played a key role in overthrowing the Qing dynasty and establishing the Republic of China in 1912. Even decades after his death, Sun remains a venerated figure who is revered on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for his role in ending imperial rule and ushering in a new era of Republicanism in China.

The anniversary of Sun's birth is being commemorated in mainland China and Taiwan, highlighting his enduring legacy and vision for national unity. In Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Sun for "fighting to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." Xi also called for joint efforts by mainland China and Taiwan to achieve the "reunification of the motherland."

In Taiwan, the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party government also honored Sun's role as a key figure in China's democratic revolution. However, Taiwan's leaders made no mention of reunification in their commemorative statements. This reflects the wide gulf that remains between Beijing and Taipei on political issues, even as they jointly revere historical figures like Sun.   

Sun is admired on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for his instrumental role in replacing the Qing dynasty with a new republican government. He spent his early years travelling overseas and developing his political ideals, drawn from Western Enlightenment values as well as Chinese nationalism. He believed that only by embracing modernity, ending imperial rule, and achieving national unity could China overcome its "backwardness" relative to Western powers.

When the Qing dynasty began to crumble in the early 20th century, Sun seized the opportunity to launch armed uprisings that led to the overthrow of the last emperor in 1912. He was inaugurated as the first provisional president of the new Republic of China in Nanjing. Though Sun ruled only briefly before his death in 1925, he put forward a vision of "Three Principles of the People" – nationalism, democracy and people's livelihood – that still influence Chinese political thought today.

While Sun remains an iconic figure, his vision of national unity remains unfulfilled. After his death, China descended into warlordism and the Kuomintang nationalist party constructed an authoritarian state. Following World War Two, the civil war between the Kuomintang and Mao Zedong's communists led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the mainland in 1949. The Kuomintang forces took control of Taiwan, creating a schism across the Strait that persists today.  

Although both Beijing and Taipei continue to invoke Sun Yat-sen's name and principles, a wide political gulf separates them. China insists on national reunification based on the "One Country, Two Systems" model applied in Hong Kong, while Taiwan increasingly asserts its autonomy and democratic identity. Still, on occasions like Sun's 150th birthday, the two sides jointly recognize his historic role in founding the Chinese republic – even if they interpret that legacy in their own divergent ways. Sun remains a complex figure who represents both the potential for unity as well as the enduring divides in the Chinese nation.
