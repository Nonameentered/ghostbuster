China's Chosen Child Monk Celebrates Quietly in Beijing 

The young boy chosen by Chinese officials to be the country's 15th Dalai Lama celebrated his 14th birthday this week, marking a significant milestone on his journey to become one of Buddhism's most important spiritual leaders. However, the event was a quiet, low-key affair in accordance with the Chinese government's strict controls over the young monk.

Gendun Choekyi Nyima was born in 1989 in a remote village in China's Sichuan province. At the age of 2, he was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking lama in Tibetan Buddhism. However, shortly after his recognition and subsequent disappearance. Chinese authorities rejected the Dalai Lama's choice and instead selected their own candidate, alienating many Tibetan Buddhists.

Gendun Choekyi Nyima has lived largely in isolation over the past 25 years. His birthday celebrations this week at the Shaojungba Temple in Beijing were private and attended only by government officials and state-sanctioned monks. The Chinese government has kept strict control over the young monk's activities and education to ensure his allegiance to the Communist party. Foreign journalists and independent observers have been barred from interacting with him.

The Chinese government's meddling in traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices and their overt attempts to control religious leaders like the Panchen Lama has been a point of conflict with the exiled Dalai Lama and his supporters. China maintains that their selection of the Panchen Lama will help ensure the installation of a Dalai Lama who is loyal to Beijing after the current Dalai Lama's death. However, their actions have only served to damage religious freedom and antagonize Tibetans longing to freely practice their Buddhist faith.

As Gendun Choekyi Nyima enters adulthood, questions remain over whether he will be allowed greater freedom and independence, or if he will continue to essentially remain a prisoner of the Chinese state. His quiet birthday celebration this week indicates the government has no intentions of loosening their grip over his life or allowing him to gain popularity and influence among Tibetan Buddhists. For now, China's chosen child monk remains shrouded in a veil of state control.
