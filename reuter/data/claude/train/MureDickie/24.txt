Jailed Chinese dissident Wang Dan receives 11-year sentence and the possibility to appeal

BEIJING - Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident and leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was sentenced to 11 years in prison today on charges of "conspiracy to subvert state power." The harsh sentence was handed down by the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court after a closed trial. 

Wang, 45, was detained in May and formally arrested in June. He had been living under tight surveillance since his release from prison in 1998 after serving eight years for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. Wang was originally sentenced to four years in prison for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement" but had his sentence increased to 11 years in 1993.

According to the court verdict, Wang had associated with "foreign anti-China forces" and accepted interviews with foreign media to spread "malicious rumors" about the Chinese government. He had also "made preparations to organize activists to stir up trouble on sensitive dates." The vague charges appear to relate to Wang's social media posts in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and his public commemoration of victims of the 1989 crackdown.

The harsh sentence against Wang signals the Chinese government's determination to silence any form of political dissent ahead of several sensitive anniversaries, including the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 2019, say activists and rights groups. 

"By handing down an outrageous 11-year sentence to Wang Dan for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression, the Chinese government has demonstrated its flagrant disregard for human rights," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Wang's lawyer, Zhang Sizhi, said his client would appeal the verdict. "The charges are unjust and the sentence is too heavy," said Zhang, a well-known rights lawyer who also defended Wang in 1989 and 1993. "Wang Dan has persistently pursued peaceful and rational reforms based on democratic principles. He does not deserve such cruel punishment."

The White House and European Union also issued statements condemning the harsh sentence and calling on China to release Wang immediately. "We call on China to release Wang unconditionally, along with all others detained for exercising their internationally recognized human rights," said the U.S. National Security Council in a statement.

Wang was a history student at Peking University during the Tiananmen protests and helped lead the hunger strike days before the military crackdown. After spending eight years in prison, Wang was exiled to the U.S. as part of a political solution brokered between China and the Clinton administration. He returned to China in 1998 and became a political commentator and reform advocate. Despite frequent run-ins with security forces, Wang continued to campaign for democratic reforms and speak out via social media and in interviews with foreign journalists. Tuesdayâ€™s verdict now marks the third time Wang has been imprisoned for his pro-democracy activism over the course of 30 years.
