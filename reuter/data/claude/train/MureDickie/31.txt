China Releases Jailed Dissident Chen Ziming for Medical Treatment 

Beijing, China - Chen Ziming, a prominent Chinese dissident who was imprisoned for 13 years for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, has been released from jail for medical treatment, according to his brother. 

Chen, 62, was suffering from pancreatic cancer and other illnesses in prison. His brother, Chen Zhiwu, confirmed that Chen was released from Beijing's No. 1 Detention Center, where he was being held. He is now receiving medical care in a Beijing hospital.

Chen was one of the leaders of the Beijing Autonomous Association in 1989 and organized hunger strikes and sit-ins in Tiananmen Square during the student-led demonstrations. He was labeled as a "black hand" who conspired with foreign forces to instigate unrest. In 1991, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement."

During his imprisonment, Chen endured harsh conditions and inadequate medical care. His supporters have campaigned for years for his release, arguing that his health conditions warranted medical parole. But the Chinese government had refused to release him until now. 

"We are relieved Chen has finally been granted medical parole," said Hu Jia, a Beijing-based human rights activist. "But this is too little, too late. His health has already been severely damaged during his unjust imprisonment."

Chen's release comes as China contends with international criticism over its human rights record and crackdown on political dissidents and activists. Despite economic and technological development, the Communist party maintains strict control over political dissent and activism.

Some analysts see Chen's release as a small concession to relieve international pressure. "The Chinese government likely concluded that the optics of Chen dying from neglect in prison were worse than releasing him for medical care," said John Kamm, director of the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that lobbies China on human rights.

However, Chen remains under police surveillance at the hospital and continues to face mobility restrictions, according to his supporters. "This is not freedom," said Hu Jia. "Chen, like many other dissidents, continues to be deprived of liberty and basic rights."

Chen's 13-year imprisonment has had a lasting impact on his health and family. But Chen remains unrepentant for his actions in 1989. In his prison writings, he said: “I hope I can be the last victim of China's opposition to political dissent and democracy.” His words have resonated with many other activists in China campaigning for civil and political rights.
