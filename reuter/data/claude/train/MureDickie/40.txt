Xinjiang Chairman Accuses Western Nations of Conspiring with Pro-Independence Activists to Split China

The chairman of China's Xinjiang region, Shohrat Zakir, accused foreign powers of working with pro-independence activists to destabilize China and undermine its territorial integrity. In a speech on Monday, Zakir claimed that Western nations are conspiring with Uyghur separatists to split Xinjiang from China.  

Zakir said "certain Western countries and their allies" are spreading misinformation and lies about China's policies in Xinjiang, with the aim of sowing dissent and turning public opinion against the Chinese government. He claimed these countries are providing financial and political support to Uyghur activists campaigning for Xinjiang's independence from China. Xinjiang is home to around 10 million ethnic Uyghurs, a minority Turkic group with their own language and culture.

"The collusion between Western forces and pro-independence activists is an attempt to split China and weaken its rise," Zakir said. "Their scheme will not succeed." He accused activists of deceiving the international community with "false claims" of human rights abuses, including allegations of mass detention and surveillance of Uyghurs. Zakir denied these claims and insisted China is only cracking down on extremism and terrorism in the region.

Human rights groups have reported widespread restrictions on Uyghur religious and cultural freedoms in Xinjiang, as China cracks down on any sign of dissent or "separatism." The UN estimates over a million Uyghurs have been detained in "re-education camps" - facilities China claims are for "vocational education and training" to counter extremism.

Zakir's accusations come amid deteriorating relations between China and Western nations over various issues, including trade disputes, technology competition, and human rights concerns. His speech signals China will continue its hardline stance against any challenge to its sovereignty in Xinjiang, despite growing international criticism. However, foreign governments have denied conspiring against China, with the US State Department saying it is "promoting human rights and religious freedom" for all groups in China, including Uyghurs.

The Xinjiang region remains tightly controlled by China's security forces, with restrictions on movement and communication for Uyghurs and the widespread use of surveillance, including DNA collection and facial recognition technology. Zakir's remarks indicate China's Communist Party will not ease its grip on the region in the face of foreign pressure. The situation in Xinjiang is likely to remain a flashpoint in China's relations with Western democracies.
