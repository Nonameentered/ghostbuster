China Congratulates President Clinton on Re-election, Sees Opportunity to Improve Sino-U.S. Relations  

The Chinese government today issued a statement congratulating President Bill Clinton on securing a second term in office. In a press release, the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed hope that Clinton's re-election would provide an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between China and the United States.

"We sincerely wish President Clinton continued success in fulfilling his mandate," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei. "China attaches great importance to the development of China-U.S. relations and is willing to work with the U.S. side to push forward China-U.S. constructive and cooperative partnership."

The statement reflects China's desire to reset relations with the U.S. following tensions over trade, human rights, and Taiwan during Clinton's first term. Clinton took a hard line against China on those issues, angering Beijing. But in recent months, Clinton has pushed for China's accession to the World Trade Organization and taken a conciliatory stance ahead of his 2020 re-election bid. 

A strengthened relationship with the U.S. is a top priority for China's president Jiang Zemin. Jiang wants China to gain more international prestige and influence, and closer ties with Washington are essential to achieving that goal. Jiang now sees an opportunity to make progress on issues like WTO accession, as well as arms control agreements and high-level diplomatic exchanges.

However, obstacles remain. There is opposition within Clinton's own party to normalized trade relations with China due to concerns over human rights and job losses. And conservatives will push Clinton to reaffirm America's commitment to Taiwan. Despite a softer rhetorical stance recently, Clinton's polices on China may not substantially change in his second term.

The next four years will test whether China and the U.S. can overcome distrust and divergent interests to establish a cooperative partnership. In its statement today, Beijing expressed optimism. But turning that optimism into real progress will require commitment and compromise from leaders on both sides. The future of the Sino-U.S. relationship remains unclear, but there is hope in China today for a turn toward deeper engagement and understanding. China's overture is the first step; the next move is America's.
