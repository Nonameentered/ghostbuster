Chinese State Media Accuses U.S. Radio Station of "Cold War Propaganda" Against Beijing  

China's state-run media sharply criticized Radio Free Asia this week, accusing the U.S. government-funded radio broadcaster of spreading "Cold War propaganda" and seeking to undermine the Chinese Communist Party.

In a commentary published on Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency said Radio Free Asia was attempting to "smear China's political system and stoke Western resentment against China." The commentary singled out several recent reports by Radio Free Asia on topics the Chinese government considers sensitive, including the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and the recent flooding in central China.  

According to Xinhua, Radio Free Asia's coverage of these issues shows its "ulterior motives to destabilize Chinese society, groundlessly discredit the Communist Party of China and plant the seeds of public discontent against the Chinese government." The commentary accused Radio Free Asia of distorting facts and fabricating lies to portray China in an unfairly negative light. It said the station's real goal was to spread "ideological infiltration under the guise of news reporting."

Radio Free Asia was launched in 1996 with the aim of promoting democratic values and human rights in Asia, including in authoritarian countries where independent media is banned or restricted. It broadcasts in 26 languages, including Mandarin Chinese, Tibetan, Uighur and Cantonese, and reaches listeners via shortwave radio and the internet. The station is funded by and answers to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency that receives its budget from Congress.  

In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Radio Free Asia rejected the accusations from Xinhua. "Our mission is to provide objective news and information to people who lack access to a free press," she said. "We cover issues that people care about in a thoroughly journalistic manner."
