China Defends Jailing of Dissident, Says It's Not a Human Rights Issue 

Beijing dismissed international criticism today of its conviction and sentencing of a prominent Chinese dissident, saying the case was an internal matter about law and order, not a human rights issue. 

Huang Qi, 55, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Monday for "leaking state secrets" and "assisting in foreign infiltration" â€“ charges often used against dissidents, democracy activists and human rights defenders. Mr. Huang founded and ran a website called 64 Tianwang that reported on protests, police abuses and other topics censored by Chinese authorities.

Governments around the world, along with human rights groups, condemned the harsh sentence and called on China to release Mr. Huang immediately. They said it was retaliation for his work exposing human rights violations and shining a light on topics Beijing prefers to suppress.

But at a regularly scheduled news briefing today, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said other countries should not interfere in China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty.

"China is a country with rule of law, and its judicial organs handle cases independently based on facts and the law," said the spokesman, Lu Kang. "The relevant case is purely about leaking state secrets and assisting foreign infiltration, and is not connected to so-called issues of human rights or freedom of speech." 

Mr. Lu said Mr. Huang was accorded full legal rights and found guilty by a court based on clear facts and abundant evidence. He said criticism of the case amounted to "wanton speculation" and "rude interference" in China's justice system.

Human rights groups have been harshly critical of the deterioration of civil liberties under China's authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, who has overseen a widespread crackdown on lawyers, activists, journalists, religious groups and others. But Mr. Lu and other Chinese officials have repeatedly said Western democracies have no right to judge China's internal affairs or lecture it on human rights.

Mr. Huang's case also taps into strong nationalist sentiments in China. Many Chinese citizens support their government's suppression of political dissent and criticism of Mr. Xi's consolidation of power. They believe China does not share Western values like free speech and democracy, and bristle at foreign interference.

The dissident's wife, Liu Chao, expressed disappointment at the foreign ministry spokesman's comments. In a phone interview, she said the case was clearly about retaliation for her husband's work exposing the government's human rights abuses.

"They convicted him to silence him and others," she said. "It's all about restricting people's right to know the truth." 

Mrs. Liu said she had not seen her husband since he was detained in 2016 and was worried about his health and treatment in prison. She hoped foreign governments would continue to press for his release to bring greater scrutiny to his case.
