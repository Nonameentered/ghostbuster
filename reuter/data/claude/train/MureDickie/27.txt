China-Selected Committee Chooses 340 Members to Select Hong Kong's First Chief Executive 

Hong Kong took a major step toward choosing its first Chief Executive today as an Election Committee selected by Beijing announced its membership. The 400-member Election Committee, chosen by China as the electoral body to select Hong Kong's leaders, includes representatives from business, labor, and special interest groups. The committee announced that it received 465 nominations from various sectors for its 400 seats and selected 340 members today. The remaining 60 members will be chosen in the coming weeks.

The selection of the Election Committee is a critical milestone in Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" principle. For the first time, Hong Kong's leader, the Chief Executive, will be chosen locally, though still subject to Beijing's approval. The Chief Executive, who will replace the British Governor, will head Hong Kong's government for a five-year term.

Pro-democracy activists have criticized the selection process for the Election Committee as overly influenced by Beijing. The committee is dominated by pro-China representatives, particularly from business and commercial sectors. Democracy advocates argue the committee does not adequately reflect Hong Kong's ideological diversity and limits popular participation in the selection of leaders. However, China has stated its process ensures candidates that "love the country and love Hong Kong."

The selection of the Chief Executive in December will be carefully watched to assess Hong Kong's political future under Chinese rule. Will the process yield a leader who can unite the city and preserve its autonomy? Or will Beijing exert more overt control over Hong Kong's destiny? The makeup of the Election Committee suggests China intends to have a strong voice in vetting and selecting candidates sympathetic to its views. However, if the committee chooses a leader openly opposed by a large segment of Hong Kong's population, it may fuel greater unrest over the city's relationship with Beijing. All eyes will be on this Election Committee as it takes the first step to choose Hong Kong's leader in the post-colonial era.
