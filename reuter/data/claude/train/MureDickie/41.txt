China's Growing Demand for Computer Chips Drives Domestic Semiconductor Industry Growth

China's semiconductor industry is booming, fueled by growing domestic demand for computer chips and microprocessors. According to new data from the China Semiconductor Industry Association, China's semiconductor market exceeded $160 billion in 2021, up 30% from the previous year. The growth is being driven in large part by China's ambitious plans to become a leader in advanced technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence, and electric vehicles.

Chinese companies are investing heavily to build up domestic chip manufacturing capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like the United States and Taiwan. The Chinese government's 'Made in China 2025' plan aims to produce 40% of the country's chip needs locally by 2025, and 70% by 2030. The country is currently highly dependent on imports, spending more than $300 billion a year buying integrated circuits and other chip technologies from overseas. 

The centerpiece of China's efforts is the new China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, also known as the "Big Fund." Launched in 2014, the Big Fund has raised $50 billion to invest in domestic chip companies. Local governments have also set up their own semiconductor investment funds, raising the total funding pool to over $100 billion. The massive investments are helping Chinese chipmakers build new fabrication plants, or "fabs," attract top engineering talent, and ramp up research and development.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) is China's largest contract chipmaker. With funding from the Big Fund and local Shanghai government, SMIC is building new fabs and has achieved technological milestones like producing its first 7-nanometer chip in 2020. However, SMIC remains several generations behind industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Privately-owned startup Horizon Robotics, which specializes in automotive AI chips, raised $900 million in 2021 at a $5 billion valuation. Other fast-growing Chinese chipmakers include Cambricon and Bitmain, which focus on AI processors and blockchain chips, respectively.

While China is making progress developing its domestic semiconductor industry, it still faces major obstacles. Chinese chipmakers lack experience at the cutting edge, and attracting top global talent will remain challenging given geopolitical tensions. However, with massive government support, an enormous market, and growing technical competence, China seems poised to gain greater self-sufficiency in semiconductors and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers over the next decade. The global chip industry is watching closely to see how quickly China can catch up.
