Chinese leaders denounce exclusion from World Trade Organisation as unjust 

Beijing, CHINA - Top Chinese government officials issued a scathing rebuke of the World Trade Organisation today, calling the global trade body "unjust" and "biased" for denying China's latest bid to join the organisation. China first applied to join the WTO in 1995 but has faced significant opposition, especially from the United States.

"The actions of the WTO delegates are unjustified and discriminatory," said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a press conference. "China is the second largest economy in the world but remains isolated from the global trading system. This disadvantages not just China but the whole global economy." 

China's bid for WTO membership has been vetoed multiple times by delegates who argue China needs to make significant reforms to open up its economy and reduce anti-competitive policies before it can join. The US in particular has been a vocal opponent, arguing China engages in unfair trade practices like intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and massive government subsidies for Chinese companies. 

"While we recognise the progress China has made in slowly opening segments of its economy, much more is needed before we would feel comfortable approving their WTO accession," said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. "China has failed to demonstrate a real commitment to dismantling trading practices that are incompatible with WTO rules."

Premier Li argued China has already made substantial changes to adhere to WTO standards, including reducing tariffs, easing restrictions on foreign investment in certain sectors and strengthening protections for intellectual property. China's vast consumer market means WTO members would also gain significantly from China's accession, Li said.

"Excluding China from the WTO will neither encourage further reform nor benefit the global economy," Li said. "Cooperation is the only path forward." 

China received support from Russia and developing nations in Africa and Latin America. The African Union issued a statement calling for China's "swift accession" to promote growth in developing economies. But the U.S., European Union and other major economic powers held firm in their opposition, stating China needs to address specific concerns before gaining entry into the WTO.

The latest setback is a blow to China's ambition to gain more sway over global trade governance. As the world's second largest trading nation, China's leaders argue it is unjust and unsustainable for them to remain outside the key international body overseeing global trade. But China's authoritarian government and history of anti-competitive practices continue to raise red flags. China first applied to join the WTO 23 years ago, starting a long process that appears far from over.
