Basic agreement reached on 22 development projects in long-delayed Japanese loan mission to China 

Japan and China have reached an initial agreement on 22 infrastructure development projects to be funded by Japanese official development assistance (ODA) loans, marking a breakthrough after years of stalled talks.

The agreement came during a visit to Beijing this week by a 40-member delegation from Japan's Ministry of Finance and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The trip signifies a thaw in tensions between the two neighbors and economic rivals in Asia. 

According to a joint statement, the proposed projects in China would include sewage treatment, disaster prevention, and agricultural facilities. The total value of the loans could reach several billion US dollars, pending final approval by the Japanese government. 

The dialogue on ODA between Japan and China dates back to 1979 but was suspended in 2012 due to tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea. The resumption of talks in October 2018 aimed to separate political issues from economic and humanitarian cooperation.  

Some critics argue that Japan should not provide cheap loans and grants to a country that threatens its national interests. However, supporters counter that development aid helps build friendship and trust between the two sides. The Chinese government has insisted that the territorial disputes should not stand in the way of a mutually beneficial relationship.

Since 1979, Japan has provided over $12 billion in concessional loans to China, funding the construction of railways, power plants, hospitals and other vital infrastructure. China became the top recipient of Japanese ODA from 1990 to 2000. While China's economy has grown rapidly since then, Japan's ODA still focuses on improving living standards in rural areas and tackling environmental challenges.

The delegations from China and Japan praised the latest round of consultations as "sincere, practical and efficient." They plan to accelerate the project approval process so that lending agreements can be signed before the end of Japan's fiscal year in March 2020.  

Observers hope the cooperation on ODA will improve bilateral ties and lay the groundwork for higher-level dialogue, including a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Japan next spring and a trilateral summit with South Korea. Though geopolitical tensions remain, both governments appear willing to make pragmatic progress on the economic front. With the Asia Development Bank predicting a slowdown in China's growth this year, loans and technical assistance from Japan could provide a boost to the Chinese economy at a critical time.
