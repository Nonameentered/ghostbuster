Nordstrom Inc. Reports 16% Increase in Earnings for Third Quarter

Nordstrom Inc. announced Thursday that its earnings increased 16% in the third quarter, fueled by strong digital sales and the continued success of its off-price Rack stores.

The Seattle-based fashion retailer said its profits rose to $183 million, or $1.13 per share, in the three months ending Oct. 31. That compares with $157 million, or 95 cents per share, in the same period last year.

Revenue climbed 9% to $3.56 billion, just above the $3.47 billion analysts had predicted, according to FactSet. Sales at Nordstrom Rack stores open at least a year were up 3.8%, while same-store sales at the company's full-line department store business declined 0.9%. The company attributed the latter result to less tourist traffic from China and Canada.

Digital sales were the strongest driver of growth, rising 16% from a year earlier. Nordstrom's website and mobile apps now contribute 34% of its revenue.

"Despite some inventory and fulfillment challenges in the beginning of the quarter, our teams were able to recover and deliver results ahead of our expectations," said Erik Nordstrom, CEO.

To bolster its digital business, Nordstrom has invested heavily in services like buy online, pick up in store, and ship to store for customer pickup. The company also started offering next-day delivery to major cities, and it aims to provide same-day delivery to more areas in the coming years.

Nordstrom raised its full-year earnings forecast slightly, showing continued confidence despite threats from online retailers like Amazon. The company now expects earnings between $3.30 to $3.50 per share, up from its previous guidance of $3.25 to $3.50 per share. Revenue is projected to increase between 5% and 7% from the prior year.      

Nordstrom shares jumped nearly 10% in after-hours trading following the release of the earnings report. In regular trading Thursday, the stock closed down 2.9% at $37.32. So far this year, Nordstrom shares have declined about 12%.
