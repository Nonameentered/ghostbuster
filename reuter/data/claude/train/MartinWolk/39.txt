Boeing Co. Reports Record Orders of 717 Jets Valued at $53 Billion in 1996 

Boeing Co. announced today that it received a record number of orders for its commercial aircraft in 1996, driven primarily by strong demand for its next-generation 717 jetliners. The Seattle-based aerospace company booked orders for 561 commercial jets last year, valued at $53 billion, shattering its previous record of 493 planes set in 1988.

The surge in orders was led by the new Boeing 717, with the company receiving 340 orders for the twin-engine jet valued at $21 billion. Major customers included AirTran, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Midwest Express. The 717 is the newest member of Boeing's fleet and started delivering to customers in September. With a capacity of 110 to 130 seats, the 717 is Boeing's first entry in the short-haul, single-aisle jetliner market. 

“The soaring popularity of the Boeing 717 is very gratifying and validates our decision to acquire the McDonnell Douglas program,” said Boeing Chairman and CEO Phil Condit. “The 717 provides exceptional comfort and economics for short-range travel, and we see strong passenger demand fueling continued success for the program.”

In addition to the 717, Boeing received orders for 134 of its 737 family of jets, valued at $15 billion, 68 wide-body 777s worth $16 billion, and 19 747 jumbo jets valued at $2 billion. Major customers for the 737 and 777 included airlines in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The 747 orders were primarily for cargo models from carriers in Asia and the U.S.

Boeing predicted continued strong demand for its commercial jets, especially in Asia and developing markets, over the next 20 years. The company forecasts that air travel will grow an average of 5% annually over that period and commercial airlines will need more than 40,000 new jets to meet demand. Boeing expects its new aircraft models like the 717 and 777, as well as future concepts like the Sonic Cruiser, to capture a large share of aircraft orders.

The surge of new orders has led Boeing to ramp up production at its commercial airplane manufacturing facilities. The company plans to increase monthly output of the 717 and 737 models over the next three years to meet delivery targets. Boeing will also boost monthly production of 777 models to seven planes starting in 1998 to fulfill existing and anticipated orders. The production increases are expected to drive significant hiring of engineers, technicians, machinists, and factory workers at Boeing’s manufacturing hubs.

Boeing ended the year with a backlog of 2,678 commercial jets, providing a solid base of business and earnings visibility over the next several years. Revenue from commercial aircraft programs made up nearly two-thirds of Boeing's $48 billion in total revenue for 1996.
