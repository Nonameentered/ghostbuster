American Airlines to Order $6 Billion Worth of Boeing Airplanes 

American Airlines announced today that it plans to purchase up to 30 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes, a deal that is valued at $6 billion at current list prices. The order includes a commitment to buy 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, with options for 10 additional planes. The announcement represents a boost for Boeing's new 737 MAX aircraft just weeks after the new offering entered commercial service with Southwest Airlines.

"This investment in new aircraft signifies our commitment to placing our customers at the center of everything we do," said Doug Parker, American Airlines Chairman and CEO. "These new single-aisle aircraft are designed for efficiency and comfort. Their design will enable us to deliver more value in an industry where capacity and investment are increasingly dictated by the preferences of our customers."

The Boeing 737 MAX incorporates new, more efficient engines, along with improvements in aerodynamics and other systems that Boeing says will cut fuel usage by up to 14 percent compared with the latest 737 models already in the American Airlines fleet. Once delivered, the new planes are expected to reduce overall operating costs while boosting profitability on American's shorter routes.

"We're honored to continue our longstanding partnership with American Airlines," said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, president and CEO. "The 737 MAX will provide American's customers with a new generation of super-efficient short-haul airplanes and play an important role in maximizing network productivity."

American Airlines has flown Boeing 737 aircraft for nearly 50 years, operating more than 350 Boeing 737-500, 737-800 and 737 MAX aircraft as the backbone of its short-haul fleet. With this new order, American has 265 additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft on order from previous deals announced in 2011 and 2013. The first of the newly ordered planes are scheduled to be delivered before the end of 2019, with deliveries continuing through 2022.
