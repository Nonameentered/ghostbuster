Microsoft Corp. Reports "Blowout" Q2 Results and Hits Record Share Price Despite Warning of Slowing Growth in Fiscal 1998

Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-expected quarterly results yesterday, sending its shares to an all-time high despite the company's warning of slowing growth next year. 

The world's largest software company said net income for its fiscal second quarter rose 30% from a year ago to $1.5 billion, or 44 cents a share, 2 cents better than analysts’ estimated. Revenue increased 22% to $3.77 billion. 

The strong numbers reflect continuing robust demand for Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system and Office desktop software. However, CFO Greg Maffei cautioned that growth rates are likely to slow next year due to difficult comparisons with fiscal 1997, when Microsoft released several major upgrades. Specifically, Maffei warned that revenue and earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 1998 may be "slightly lower" than the 22% and 30% increases, respectively, seen so far this fiscal year.

Investors shrugged off the warning, focusing instead on the company's blowout second quarter and bright long-term prospects. In after-hours Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares rose more than 3 points to an all-time high of 96. “The numbers speak for themselves,” said Rick Sherlund, analyst at Goldman Sachs. “This company has tremendous momentum, and any temporary slowdown in growth rates next year will just set them up for another surge when new products come to market.” 

Some on Wall Street did express concerns about Microsoft's high valuation relative to growth. At 60 times projected earnings for fiscal 1998, Microsoft trades at a steep premium to the overall technology sector. Short-sellers argue the stock is due for a meaningful pullback. 

However, believers point to Microsoft's industry-leading position, surplus of cash, and track record of long-term shareholder value creation. They say periodic slowdowns in growth tend to leverage the company's high operating margins and strengthen its competitive position for the next major product cycle.  

Microsoft's fiscal first half revenue and earnings increased 24% and 31%, respectively. For the full year ending June 30, 1998, Microsoft forecasts revenue growth of 15-17% and earnings growth of 23-25%. While healthy, these numbers indicate some deceleration from the 20-30% annual growth investors have become accustomed to. But with $22 billion in cash and short-term investments in the bank, Microsoft has the resources to continue gaining share through product investments, acquisitions, and partnerships.

In a research note, UBS analyst Mary Meeker said Microsoft remains “the best positioned large-cap technology holding for long-term value creation.” As long as the company stays focused on “shutting out competitive threats and managing the Windows/Office franchise,” she said, slowing growth should pose little threat to Microsoft's leadership or stock price.
