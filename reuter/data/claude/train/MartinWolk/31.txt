Boeing to Acquire McDonnell Douglas, Shakes Up Aerospace Industry  

Boeing announced today its intent to acquire McDonnell Douglas for $13 billion in cash and stock. The blockbuster deal will create the world's largest aerospace company and reshape the global aircraft manufacturing market.

 McDonnell Douglas, the storied maker of military aircraft and commercial jets, has struggled in recent years with declining sales and profits. The company is still recovering from the cancellation of its next-generation jet program in the 1990s. By contrast, Boeing has seen tremendous success with its efficient and popular 737 and 747 aircraft. Analysts see the deal as a lifeline for McDonnell Douglas and a way for Boeing to expand its reach.

"This acquisition will strengthen Boeing's market position from fighters to launch vehicles," said Boeing CEO Phil Condit. McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher echoed the sentiment, saying "it provides greater benefits for our shareholders, employees, suppliers, and customers than McDonnell Douglas could achieve on its own."

However, the merger is expected to face close scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers. With combined annual revenue of over $48 billion, the new Boeing will control two-thirds of the global large aircraft market and almost all of the U.S. fighter jet and weapons sales to the Pentagon. Critics argue this concentration of power could negatively impact aircraft innovation, raise prices for airlines and governments, and weaken U.S. national security.  

To address regulatory concerns, Boeing said it will operate McDonnell Douglas as an autonomous subsidiary and has no plans to cut jobs. The companies also do not produce the same types of aircraft, with Boeing focused on commercial jets and McDonnell Douglas producing military aircraft. Boeing pledged to continue competing for government contracts to preserve choice in fighters and other defense programs.

If approved, the deal is expected to close by mid-1997. While a long review process remains, most analysts believe regulators will ultimately allow the merger given the companies' non-overlapping products and Boeing's commitments to fair competition and maintaining U.S. military capabilities. The new Boeing would employ over 230,000 people across several states, securing its position as an American industrial champion for decades to come. Overall, the blockbuster deal showcases the weight of scale in an increasingly global aerospace marketplace. Competitors Airbus and Lockheed Martin may now feel pressure to pursue their own strategic acquisitions to keep up.
