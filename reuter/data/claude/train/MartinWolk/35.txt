Pyramid Breweries Inc. Warns of Lower-than-Expected Sales Due to Increasing Competition in Craft Beer Industry

Pyramid Breweries Inc., one of the pioneering craft breweries based in Seattle, issued a warning today that third quarter sales are expected to be significantly lower than previously forecast. The company cited increased competition from new and expanding craft brewers as a major reason for the downward revision in expected revenue and volume growth. 

"The craft beer market has exploded in the last few years with hundreds of new breweries opening across the country," said Pyramid CEO Marty Cox. "While we're still seeing growth in the overall craft beer segment, the new competition is making it harder for established brands like Pyramid to cut through the noise and maintain high growth rates."

Pyramid was founded in 1984 and helped spark the modern craft brewing movement. However, after several years of over 20% annual growth, Pyramid's sales growth has slowed to the low single digits recently according to industry data. The company had predicted sales growth of 6-8% for the third quarter but now expects revenue to be flat or down slightly compared to the same quarter last year. Volume growth is expected to be 2% at best.

The slowing growth comes at a difficult time for Pyramid. The company recently completed an expansion of its brewing capacity in Seattle and had been relying on maintaining strong growth to leverage the new investment. The additional capacity was intended to support wider distribution and new product launches.

"We remain optimistic about the long-term future of craft beer," Cox said. "However, the short-term reality is that competition is reshaping the landscape. Breweries need to focus on high-quality, innovative products, a great customer experience, and targeted marketing to continue thriving." 

Pyramid's warning comes on the heels of similar announcements from other established craft breweries around the U.S. as many local and regional breweries see a slowdown in growth rates after several years of strong gains. While craft beer continues to gain share of the overall beer market, the booming growth of new craft breweries has made expansion increasingly difficult for brands that led the first wave of the craft brewing movement.
