Boeing takes on Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas in competition for multi-billion dollar Pentagon contract

Aerospace giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and McDonnell Douglas are competing for a lucrative multi-billion dollar contract to build the U.S. military's next generation of fighter jets. The Pentagon announced yesterday that it has narrowed down the competition to build over 300 new fighter aircraft to replace aging F-15 and F-16 planes currently in service. 

Boeing is entering its F/A-XX sixth-generation fighter concept, touting its stealth technology and advanced weapons capacity. If selected, Boeing has pledged to build the new aircraft at its St. Louis, Missouri manufacturing facility, potentially creating over 10,000 new jobs. “The F/A-XX will provide unmatched air superiority and ground attack capabilities to the U.S. and its allies for decades to come,” said Boeing Defense CEO Susan Smith.

Lockheed Martin is proposing its F-35 Lightning II, a fifth-generation fighter that is already in service with the U.S. Air Force and nine other countries. The F-35 is Lockheed's most advanced fighter jet and the world's most advanced multi-role combat aircraft. Choosing the F-35 would provide commonality with aircraft already in service and support existing supply chains, though some critics argue it may be outdated for a next-generation mainstay craft.

McDonnell Douglas is putting forward plans for a new variant of the venerable F-15 Eagle, a twin-engine air superiority fighter first introduced in 1976 but which has undergone many upgrades and enhancements over the years. The proposed F-15X would include advanced cockpits, flight surfaces, and avionics based on the latest technologies, though like the F-35, some analysts question if it would provide a meaningful upgrade over existing aircraft, especially as new stealth jets from China and Russia emerge.  

The high-stakes contract, estimated to be worth over $100 billion, has already drawn extensive lobbying efforts from the companies and their supporters in Congress. The final decision is expected to come down to cost, capability, and which aircraft can be delivered on the tight timelines set by the Pentagon. But with so much money and so many jobs at stake, there is likely to be intense political pressure around whatever option is chosen when the final selection is made next month. Overall, there are no easy choices in this competition as the U.S. seeks to maintain its air superiority into the 2030s and beyond.
