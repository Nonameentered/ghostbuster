Pyramid Breweries Inc. Warns of Lower Sales and Earnings Due to Craft Beer Competition  

Pyramid Breweries Inc., a pioneer in the craft beer movement, warned investors today that increased competition from smaller brewers is putting pressure on the company's sales and profits. In a statement, Pyramid said its sales in the first half of 2019 are down 8% compared to the same period last year, and earnings have declined 12%. The company expects the trend to continue for the rest of the year.

The craft beer segment has exploded in recent years, with over 7,000 breweries now operating in the U.S. compared to just a few hundred in the 1990s when Pyramid was founded. While Pyramid helped launch the craft beer renaissance and for years was a leader in the movement, the company has struggled to keep up as new, hip brands have entered the market. Many younger drinkers see Pyramid as too corporate and mainstream.

“There’s just so much choice now that it’s hard for any brand to stand out,” said Pyramid CEO Jim Kalafut. “We’ve seen consumers, especially millennials, constantly switching from one craft brand to another in search of the latest, coolest brew.”  

In response, Pyramid has revamped its product line to focus on more experimental, seasonal and limited-release beers. The company is also redesigning its packaging to look more artisanal and updating its marketing to better appeal to 21- to 38-year-old drinkers. However, Kalafut admitted the company’s size works against it in some ways. “Unlike the thousands of small brewers out there, we have the challenge of scaling any new recipe to produce it at high volumes for distribution across half the country,” he said.

Pyramid’s stock price was down over 4% on the news. While craft beer as a whole continues to gain market share, the increasingly crowded field makes it difficult for any single player to thrive. Pyramid helped start a revolution, but now finds itself struggling to keep up with it. The coming years will test whether an old stalwart of craft beer can reignite growth amid intensifying competition.
