Microsoft Plans to Pay Dividends Through New Issue of Preferred Shares

Microsoft Corp announced yesterday that it will issue a new class of preferred shares that will pay regular dividends to shareholders. The technology giant said it will issue 250 million preferred shares at $100 per share, raising $25 billion in new capital. 

The new preferred shares will pay an annual dividend of 5%, providing shareholders a steady stream of income. Microsoft has never issued preferred shares before and has traditionally only paid dividends on its common shares. The move is aimed at attracting new investors seeking income-generating investments in a low interest rate environment.

"We wanted to tap into demand from income investors looking for high quality, stable companies to invest in," said Amy Hood, Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer. "Preferred shares provide us with a new vehicle to return capital to shareholders looking for regular income."

Preferred shares also provide more flexibility to Microsoft. Unlike dividends on common shares which require board approval and can impact Microsoft's credit rating if they rise too quickly, dividends on preferred shares are fixed at the time of issue. Microsoft has the option to redeem the preferred shares at any time after two years at their initial price.

Microsoft's common shares rose 3% on the announcement as investors viewed the preferred share issue as a sign of the company's financial strength and shareholder-friendly policies. Rival technology companies like Apple, Alphabet and Amazon do not currently offer preferred shares. "It's really smart of Microsoft to tap into demand for yield like this," said senior analyst Mark Hanson of Morningstar. "It provides income investors an opportunity to invest in a very high-quality name like Microsoft, which is quite scarce."

The new preferred shares begin trading on Nasdaq next week under the ticker symbol MSFT-P. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have been hired by Microsoft to help market the preferred share issue to investors.
