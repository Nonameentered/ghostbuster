American Airlines set to order $6bn worth of Boeing planes  

American Airlines is preparing to place an order for up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX jets worth $6 billion, according to industry sources. The order is expected to be announced in the coming weeks and would be a major boost for Boeing as it seeks to shore up sales of its flagship narrowbody plane following safety issues and delays.

The order from American, the world's largest airline, would include both MAX 8 and MAX 10 models, marking the first time the largest variant has been selected by a US carrier. The MAX 10 can seat up to 230 passengers, around 30 more than the MAX 8. The new planes would allow American to continue renewing and expanding its narrowbody fleet to match competitors like Delta and United.  

Boeing's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 following two fatal crashes but was cleared to fly again in January 2021 after software fixes and new pilot training procedures were put in place. The 20-month grounding and accompanying crisis of confidence led to hundreds of order cancellations from airlines around the world. Boeing was also forced to halt production for months, leading to billions in losses and job cuts.

An order from American would be a seal of approval for the MAX from a trusted US partner and begin to restore Boeing's narrowbody fortunes. Industry analysts estimate the MAX now has a market share of around 75% for planes in its category, down from over 80% before the grounding. Winning back customer trust and boosting sales have been top priorities for Boeing's new CEO David Calhoun.

The expected deal is said to include significant discounts and concessions to American given the MAX's troubles. Boeing has also likely made guarantees about fuel efficiency and performance to match that of rival Airbus's A320neo jet. The European plane maker delivered more than 600 A320 family jets last year, far outpacing the 145 MAX deliveries by Boeing. Airbus has a total of over 6,500 A320neo orders so far.

American plans to use the new Boeing planes to replace older 737-800s and A321s, with the first deliveries starting in 2023. The carrier already has close ties with Boeing, operating an all-Boeing narrowbody fleet as well as Boeing widebody jets. The new order will cement American's position as one of Boeing's largest global customers for commercial aircraft.
