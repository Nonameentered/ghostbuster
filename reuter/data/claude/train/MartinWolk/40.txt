Boeing Dominates World Market With Record Orders For 737 Jets 

Boeing announced record orders for 737 commercial jets in 1996, securing its position as the world's dominant manufacturer of commercial aircraft. Boeing received orders for 965 Next-Generation 737s last year, the most orders in a single year for any commercial jet. The orders were valued at $53 billion, also an industry record.

"The performance and reliability of the Next-Generation 737, combined with its low operating costs, have made it the airplane of choice for airlines around the world," said Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.

The 737 is the best-selling commercial jetliner of all time. The Next-Generation 737 family builds on the success of the 737, incorporating larger wings, a new airframe, and the latest in cockpit technology. The series includes the 737-600, 737-700, 737-800, and 737-900 models, seating from 108 to 189 passengers. 

Boeing doubled 737 production in 1996 to a record 42 airplanes per month to meet demand. The company aims to continue increasing production over the next two years to 52 airplanes per month. At that rate, Boeing would deliver more than 600 737s in 1997, which would eclipse the 1996 record.

The bulk of 737 orders in 1996 came from established customers upgrading their fleets, including Southwest Airlines, the 737's largest customer, which ordered 97 additional 737s. New customers included Australia's Virgin Blue, Brazil's Varig, China Southern Airlines, and Indonesia's Lion Air. The 737's low operating costs and high reliability have made it popular with low-cost carriers around the world.

Boeing faces increasing competition from Airbus, which also had a strong year in 1996 and matched Boeing in total commercial jet orders for the first time. However, Boeing still claims a lionshare of the narrowbody market with the 737. Boeing aims to maintain its lead with continued investment in new engine and variant offerings for the Next-Generation 737 model over the next several years.  

Barring any unforeseen economic turbulence, most industry analysts expect similarly strong demand and another record year of orders for Boeing's commercial jet business in 1997, led again by the Next-Generation 737. The only question remaining is whether Airbus or Boeing will finish on top. Regardless of the final order tally, 1997 is shaping up to be another very good year for the giant aerospace companies and their shareholders.
