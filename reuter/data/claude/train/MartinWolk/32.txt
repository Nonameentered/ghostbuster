Boeing to Acquire McDonnell Douglas in Stunning Deal, Sends Shock Waves Through Aerospace Industry 

In a surprise move that will significantly alter the landscape of the global aerospace industry, Boeing announced today that it will acquire McDonnell Douglas for $13.3 billion in stock. The deal combines the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers, both based in the U.S., intensifying competition in an industry already buffeted by slowing commercial jet sales.

The all-stock transaction is valued at $13.3 billion based on Boeing's closing stock price on Friday. Under terms of the agreement, for each McDonnell Douglas share, shareholders will receive $48 in Boeing stock, a premium of 62 percent over McDonnell Douglas's closing stock price on Friday. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is expected to close by the end of 1996.

Boeing said the merger will save at least $1.6 billion a year in operating costs starting in 1999. Along with cost cuts from workforce reductions, the savings will come from combining manufacturing operations, administration, and research and development. The companies anticipate reducing their combined workforce of more than 230,000 by at least 12 percent over the next four years, mostly through attrition and early retirement. 

The deal comes as aircraft makers around the world are struggling with a sharp downturn in commercial jet orders. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, in particular, have been hit hard. Boeing last week said it will cutproduction of its 777 jetliner in half next year and delay the maiden flight of its next-generation 737. McDonnell Douglas recently took hefty charges to write down the value of its MD-11 and DC-10 jet programs.

By consolidating, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas hope to better weather the industry's cycles. Together, the companies would have dominated the industry, with a 73 percent share of the global jetliner market and an even greater share of the U.S. military aircraft business. The merger is likely to draw close scrutiny from antitrust authorities in the U.S. and abroad to determine if it substantially reduces competition.

Shares of Boeing fell $3 to $46. McDonnell Douglas surged $15 to $43. Rivals Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin declined to comment, as did major aircraft engine makers. Leaders of machinist unions voiced concern about potential job losses from the combination. The deal promises to reshape an iconic U.S. industry already under competitive threat from Airbus, setting the stage for potential power struggles over jobs, contracts, and political clout.
