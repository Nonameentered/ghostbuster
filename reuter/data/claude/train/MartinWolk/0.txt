Louisiana-Pacific Corp. to Close Controversial Ketchikan Pulp Mill After Failed Negotiations with Clinton Administration  

Louisiana-Pacific Corp. announced today that it will permanently close its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska after failing to reach an agreement with the Clinton administration over environmental regulations. The closure of the mill, which has operated since 1954, will result in the loss of more than 500 jobs and millions in tax revenue for the city of Ketchikan.  

The pulp mill has long been a controversial presence in the coastal Alaskan city due to environmental concerns over air and water pollution. Several accidents over the years have resulted in chemical spills into the Tongass Narrows, the waterway adjacent to Ketchikan. Locals have also complained about emissions from the mill reducing air quality.  

In 1993, the Clinton administration's Environmental Protection Agency ordered Louisiana-Pacific to make substantial upgrades to reduce pollution and come into compliance with the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The company argued that the cost of mandated improvements, estimated at over $200 million, would make the mill economically unviable. After years of negotiations failed to produce an agreement, Louisiana-Pacific today announced it will cease operations rather than continue its environmental battle with regulators.  

"We have made every effort to have an open and honest dialogue with federal and state regulators to determine a path forward that addresses their environmental concerns while still allowing our mill to remain operational and continue providing economic benefits to Ketchikan," said Louisiana-Pacific CEO Mark Suwyn in a statement. "Unfortunately, despite our best efforts we were unable to find common ground, and we cannot responsibly continue to operate a mill that regulators intend to eventually shut down."

The closure delivers a major economic blow to Ketchikan, where fishing and tourism are the other major industries. The pulp mill has been the largest private employer in the city for decades and generates over $15 million in local tax revenue annually, according to Louisiana-Pacific's estimates.  

Ketchikan Mayor Michael Stedman expressed dismay at the announcement and urged state and federal officials to re-engage with the company to find an alternative solution. "We understand and respect the need to protect our environment, but there must be a balance between regulation and the economic well-being of a community," Stedman said in a press briefing.

Environmental groups who have long lobbied for the mill's closure hailed the decision as a victory while acknowledging the economic pain for workers and Ketchikan. "This is an environmental justice milestone that puts the health of citizens and wildlife over corporate profit," said Michael Sutton, executive director of the Ketchikan Conservation Council. "At the same time, we call upon our political leaders to help create new economic opportunities and job training for those who will lose work." 

The closure of the Ketchikan pulp mill brings an end to an era and deepens a crisis for Alaska's declining timber industry. But for environmentalists, it marks the end of a decades-long fight against one of the worst polluters in the state. The mill is set to cease operations within 60 days, though litigation may still determine how Louisiana-Pacific must handle environmental cleanup and pensions for former employees.
