Microsoft Faces Tough Competition and Skeptical Customers with Launch of Office 97

Tech giant Microsoft released the latest version of its popular Office suite of productivity software this week, dubbed Office 97. However, the upgraded programs face stiff competition from lower-cost alternatives as well as skepticism from some longtime customers. 

Office 97 includes the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Microsoft boasts significant improvements over the previous version, Office 95, including a simplified user interface, tighter integration between applications, and new features like an online clip art gallery and speech recognition.

“Office 97 represents the most advanced set of productivity tools available today,” said Bill Gates, Microsoft’s CEO, at the product launch event. “We’ve enhanced and refined nearly every aspect of the user experience to help people be as productive as possible.”

However, at $500 for the premium version, Office 97 comes at a steep price for many customers, especially small businesses and households. Competitors like Corel now offer lower-cost alternatives for word processing and spreadsheets like WordPerfect and Quattro Pro for under $200. Web-based options like the free Google Docs suite are also gaining popularity. 

“Microsoft Office simply isn't an option for us budget-wise,” said Mark Thompson, owner of a small bike shop in Tucson, Arizona. “We've been using the Corel products for years and they do everything we need at a price we can afford.”

Some longtime Office users also remain skeptical about the changes in Office 97 and whether the new features warrant an upgrade. “I've used Office for over a decade and still prefer the old style interface over the 'simplified' menus and toolbars,” said freelance writer Sharon Hayes. “I see a lot of flash but little that's really useful for getting my work done faster. I'll be sticking with Office 95 for now.”  

Microsoft hopes to overcome such objections by offering special upgrade discounts for existing Office users and free 90-day trials of Office 97 to show the benefits of the new features. The company also recently unveiled Microsoft Office Online, which provides many of the Office applications as web-based services for free, in an effort to reach more casual users.

While Office 97 faces significant hurdles, few doubt it will eventually match or surpass the success of its predecessors given Microsoft’s dominance and marketing muscle. The latest version of Office hits retail shelves this Friday in over 50 countries and 23 languages with more options and bundles to suit both entry-level and advanced needs. For Microsoft, Office remains its most profitable and strategically important product, bringing in over $10 billion in revenue last year. Whether Office 97 can spur an upgrade “super cycle” and power further growth will became clear in the months ahead.
