Sierra Semiconductor Stock Rises Over 27% After Exiting Modem Business

Shares of Sierra Semiconductor skyrocketed today after the company announced it is exiting the 5G modem business and will stop development of its next-generation modem technology. The stock closed up 27.4% on the news.

Sierra Semiconductor has struggled in recent years as the smartphone market has slowed. The company spent heavily to develop its first 5G modem to enable faster wireless connectivity in phones and other devices. However, major customers like Tech Titan and Global Gizmos chose not to use Sierra's 5G modem in their latest smartphone models, opting instead for modems from larger rivals like Qualcomm. 

The failure to win modem orders and the high costs of 5G research led Sierra's stock to plunge over 50% from its peak last year. In an effort to revive the company's fortunes, Sierra's new CEO, Jane Smith, announced today the company will halt further investment in 5G modems and will slash an additional $500 million in costs. "It is clear our efforts in 5G were misguided and did not meet the needs of major customers," Smith said in an interview. "We are going back to our roots as a maker of power-efficient mobile processors and sensors."

The decision to exit the 5G modem market will result in job cuts for up to 2,000 employees, mostly engineers and programmers focused on modem development. However, Smith said the refocus on other products will allow Sierra to invest in areas of the business with more potential for growth and higher profit margins.

Investors cheered the strategic shift, driving Sierra's stock up sharply in trading. "This is a prudent move that will allow Sierra to focus its resources on segments that play to its strengths," said a TechEquity Partners analyst. The stock rally suggests investors believe the new strategy can help revive Sierra's fortunes after a difficult period. For now at least, the market seems willing to give Smith and the company another chance to right the ship after its ill-fated 5G modem venture.
