Airbus Restructuring Agreement Seen as Step Forward, But No Threat to Boeing Dominance  

Airbus reached an agreement with European governments to restructure its ownership, reducing state control in the company in exchange for financial support during the coronavirus crisis. The deal is seen as progress for Airbus to simplify its governance, but is unlikely to significantly impact its rivalry with Boeing in the commercial aircraft market.

Under the agreement, France and Germany will reduce their stakes in Airbus from 11% to 9.9%, while Spain will lower its stake from 4% to 2.9%. The changes will make it easier for Airbus to issue new shares to raise funds if needed and give the company more flexibility over its business strategy without government interference. However, the three governments will still act together to control nearly 20% of the company, so Airbus will not become completely independent of state ownership and concerns over unfair subsidies are likely to continue.

Airbus competes head-to-head with Boeing for aircraft sales and has gained more orders than its U.S. rival in recent years, in part due to the crisis over Boeing's 737 Max that was grounded for 18 months. Despite its recent success, Airbus remains the underdog with a smaller share of the commercial aircraft market and relies on loans and other funding from European governments to support research and development of new aircraft. The restructuring plan aimed to appease EU regulators scrutinizing state aid while ensuring governments retain significant influence over Airbus, and will not close the competitiveness gap with Boeing.

Aviation analysts characterized the ownership changes as an incremental step in the right direction for Airbus to operate on more commercial terms, but do not expect any major impact to the dynamics with Boeing that would allow Airbus to overtake its rival as the world's largest aircraft maker in the foreseeable future. Barring a more significant pullback of government involvement, Airbus is likely to preserve its position as a perennial underdog nipping at the heels of Boeing. While the agreement may bring more efficiency to Airbus, Boeing is set to maintain its longstanding dominance in the global aircraft manufacturing industry.
