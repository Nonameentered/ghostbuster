Microsoft Expected to Report Modest Earnings Growth Despite Tough Comparisons and Sales Slowdown Ahead of Software Upgrade  

Microsoft Corp. is expected to report modest earnings and revenue growth for the latest quarter, even as the software giant faces tough comparisons from a year earlier and a slowing pace of business ahead of the release of its newest Windows operating system later this year.

Analysts forecast Microsoft to report fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.22 a share and revenue of $29.1 billion when it releases results Thursday after the closing bell. That would represent increases of 9% and 11%, respectively, from a year earlier. While still a solid showing, the expected gains mark a slowdown from recent quarters amid a global economy recovering unevenly from the coronavirus pandemic.

Two factors are clouding the picture for Microsoft's quarterly results. The first is extremely challenging year-over-year growth comparisons because last year's first quarter captured much of the initial surge in technology spending triggered by widespread working from home. Microsoft's revenue soared 13% in the quarter, fueled by heightened demand for cloud computing, gaming and remote work software like Microsoft Teams.  

The second factor is anticipation of Microsoft's Windows 11 software update, expected this fall. Some business customers may opt to defer major purchases until they have had time to test and deploy the new operating system, analysts said. Still, Microsoft has multiple business lines growing at double-digit rates that should help overcome the tough comparisons and patchiness in some segments.  

The Redmond, Wash.-based company's fast-growing cloud computing business, centered around its Azure service, is expected to offset slowing growth in segments like Windows. Revenue from the productivity and cloud services businesses that include Office and Azure is forecast to climb 15% to $14.7 billion for the quarter. The increase would be driven by strong demand for Microsoft's bundled software subscriptions and accelerating cloud services.

Overall, most analysts remain optimistic about Microsoft's ability to maintain solid growth despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, given the strength and breadth of its software franchises for both businesses and consumers. The coming debut of Windows 11, the first major revision since 2015, could provide a jolt to sales of personal computers in the months ahead and reinvigorate Microsoft's perennial cash cow.

Shares in Microsoft have risen roughly 33% over the past 12 months, topping the 28% increase in the broader market. The software leader's market capitalization stands at nearly $2.2 trillion, second only to Apple Inc. among publicly traded U.S. technology companies.
