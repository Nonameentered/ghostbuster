Boeing CEO Phil Condit gets $13.3 billion deal for McDonnell Douglas acquisition on first day as chairman

Boeing CEO Phil Condit started his first day as chairman of the company with a bang, announcing a blockbuster $13.3 billion deal to acquire rival aerospace firm McDonnell Douglas. The merger values McDonnell Douglas at $13.3 billion, a generous 60% premium to its market value before the announcement. Condit called the acquisition an "exciting opportunity" that will benefit both companiesâ€™ shareholders, employees and customers. 

Condit took over as Boeing's chairman today, replacing Frank Shrontz who retired after 15 years in the role. Condit has served as Boeing's CEO for the past 5 years, leading the company through a period of strong performance and revenue growth. The McDonnell Douglas acquisition is a bold first move that demonstrates Condit's appetite for expansion and control of the commercial aviation market.

Based in St. Louis, McDonnell Douglas is the world's largest producer of commercial aircraft, including the popular MD-80 and MD-11 planes. The merger will expand Boeing's aviation manufacturing capabilities and allow the combined company to compete more effectively against European rival Airbus. "By combining with McDonnell Douglas, we are seizing this opportunity to strengthen our company for the long term, enhance our competitive position, and create additional value for shareowners," said Condit.

The deal has received widespread praise but also raised some concerns about reduced competition. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said the merger "essentially leaves Boeing as the United States' sole viable jetliner maker." However, Condit argued competition from Airbus will prevent reduced innovation or price hikes. The acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval but is expected to close by the end of the year.

Under the terms of the deal, McDonnell Douglas shareholders will receive 0.5 share of Boeing stock for each McDonnell Douglas share. The fixed exchange ratio values McDonnell Douglas shares at $48 each, 60% higher than its stock price of $30 before the announcement. The proposed merger will expand Boeing's aviation business and create significant cost-cutting opportunities. Boeing expects to generate $1 billion in cost synergies from integrating McDonnell Douglas' operations and workforce.  

The blockbuster acquisition demonstrates Phil Condit's appetite for bold moves and cements his control of Boeing as its new chairman and CEO. Investors reacted positively to the surprise announcement, sending Boeing shares up over 10% in midday trading. The merger of two historic aviation giants is set to shake up the global aerospace industry and intensify competition with Airbus. Overall, Condit's maiden deal as chairman inspires confidence in Boeing's vision for growth and success under his leadership.
