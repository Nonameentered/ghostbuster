Boeing acquires McDonnell Douglas for $13 billion, becomes major player in military contracting industry

In a monumental deal that will transform the military aviation industry, Boeing Co. announced today that it has acquired McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $13.3 billion in stock, creating the world's largest aerospace company.

The deal, the largest non-oil merger in U.S. history, will allow Boeing to compete on a global scale with other major military contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics. By bringing together McDonnell Douglas military aircraft, space and missile divisions with Boeing's commercial airplanes business, Boeing instantly becomes a major player in the military contracting industry and will deliver a one-stop shop for aircraft to both military and commercial customers.

"This merger is a strategic move that will benefit both companies as we pursue emerging growth opportunities,” said Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer. "By joining forces, we will enhance competition in the aerospace industry and strengthen the U.S. position as a leader in aerospace technology and innovation."

Boeing, based in Seattle, is the world's largest aircraft manufacturer and has traditionally focused on the commercial air travel market. The company manufactures predominantly commercial jetliners, including the popular 737, 747, 777 and 787 aircraft. While Boeing does have a defense and space unit that produces military aircraft, space systems and weapons, that has represented only about 20% of Boeing's business. The acquisition of McDonnell Douglas will dramatically boost Boeing’s presence in the defense contracting arena.

McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, is the world's fourth-largest military contractor and is best known for producing military fighter jets such as the F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Hornet. The company also makes transport aircraft, helicopters, missiles, and spacecraft for military and space exploration use. McDonnell Douglas has struggled recently due to defense spending cuts following the end of the Cold War. The merger with Boeing provides much needed financial security and opportunities for new growth.  

The deal still needs approval from shareholders of both companies as well as U.S. and European regulatory authorities. If approved, the combined companies will have nearly 200,000 employees in 23 U.S. states and operations around the world. The merger is expected to result in significant cost savings and synergies as overlaps in manufacturing, engineering and administration are reduced. However, layoffs are also likely as redundancies are eliminated, which could face opposition from labor unions and lawmakers.

Overall, analysts view the blockbuster deal as a win-win for both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, as they come together to dominate the global market for military and commercial aircraft in an era of increasing competition and technological sophistication. The merger positions Boeing to capitalize on higher U.S. defense spending under the new administration and will accelerate innovation of next-generation aircraft, spacecraft and weapons systems.
