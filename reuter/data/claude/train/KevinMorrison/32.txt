Holyman Ltd to Expand Operations in Europe Before Entering Asian Markets

The consumer goods giant Holyman Ltd has announced its plans to accelerate expansion in the European markets before foraying into Asia. The company will increase its manufacturing capacity in key European markets and strengthen its distribution networks across the continent over the next 18 months.

Holyman Ltd is the world's third largest FMCG company with a presence in over 120 countries. While the company has a dominant position in most Western markets, it has been facing challenges in some European countries and Asia due to strong local competition. The new expansion in Europe is aimed at consolidating Holyman's position before focusing on Asia.  

According to John Smith, CEO of Holyman Ltd, "Europe represents a huge market for us and we want to maximize our potential here before diverting attention to Asia. We will be investing over $5 billion in ramping up production capacities, building new manufacturing facilities, and enhancing our distribution networks across Europe. This 18-month expansion plan will allow us to boost revenues, increase market share, and better serve local consumers in Europe."

As part of the growth strategy, Holyman will set up three new manufacturing plants for personal care products in UK, Italy, and France. It will also build two new facilities for packaged foods in Germany and Spain. These units will create over 2,000 new local jobs. Holyman will also strengthen relationships with retailers across Europe to enhance product visibility and boost sales. 

The company expects the European expansion to increase its regional revenues by 20-25% and operating profits by 15-20% over the next two years. The increased presence and bigger portfolio will allow Holyman to withstand competitive pressures in a better manner.

According to industry experts, Holyman's renewed focus on Europe is a step in the right direction. "Holyman needs to consolidate its position in developed markets like Europe before expanding into relatively challenging Asian markets. With increased local production and distribution muscle, Holyman can cater to European customers in a highly customized manner while controlling costs effectively," says John Thompson, consumer goods analyst at ABC Research.

Holyman's stock price increased by 4% following the announcement, indicating investor confidence in the company's growth strategy. While Holyman aims to enter select Asian markets in 2021, the company wants to avoid spreading itself too thin by first strengthening its hold in Europe which contributes nearly 40% to the company's global revenues. Following the success of its 18-month plan, Holyman will be in a much better position to explore opportunities for growth in Asia and emerging economies.
