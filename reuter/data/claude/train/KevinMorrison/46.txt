Placer Dome Acquires Control of Papua New Guinea’s Porgera Gold Mine in Deal with Highlands Gold Ltd.

Canadian mining giant Placer Dome announced today that it has acquired controlling interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. Porgera is one of the largest gold mines in the South Pacific, producing over 600,000 ounces of gold since commencing operation in 1990. Placer Dome obtained a 75% stake in the Porgera mine through a deal with its joint venture partner, Australian mining firm Highlands Gold Ltd.  

Under the terms of the agreement, Placer Dome will pay Highlands Gold $587 million in return for increasing its ownership in the Porgera Joint Venture from 47.5% to 75%. The deal will make Placer Dome the operator of the Porgera mine. Highlands Gold will retain a 25% non-operating interest in the joint venture.  

The Porgera mine is located in Enga Province in the Papua New Guinean highlands. It is an open pit and underground gold mine that has proven and probable reserves of more than 10 million ounces of gold. It is expected to continue operating for at least another 10 years based on known reserves. Last year, the mine produced 652,000 ounces of gold, and at a cash cost of under $400 per ounce, it is a low-cost, high-margin operation.  

“The Porgera mine is a prize asset that we have had our sights on acquiring for some time,” said Placer Dome CEO Jay Taylor. “It is a tremendous growth opportunity for our company and will make a substantial contribution to our gold production and earnings for years to come. We already have a strong presence in Papua New Guinea, and taking control of Porgera will cement our position as the leading gold miner in the country.”

The deal is expected to close within three months, pending regulatory approval from various government agencies in Papua New Guinea and Australia. After the transaction is complete, Placer Dome will have operations in 11 countries and will become the 5th largest gold mining company in the world based on production. The acquisition is consistent with Placer Dome's strategy of securing and developing long-life, low-cost assets in stable jurisdictions around the globe.
