UPS Considers Flying Its Own Planes to Australia as Market Grows  

United Parcel Service Inc. is considering launching its own freight flights between the U.S. and Australia as e-commerce demand in the region surges.  

UPS currently transports goods between the two countries using commercial passenger airlines. However, the courier is exploring operating its own dedicated freighter flights on routes such as between Louisville, Kentucky, its main air hub, and Australia. New dedicated routes could help UPS better manage capacity and reduce costs as volumes grow.

Australia's e-commerce market is expanding rapidly, fueled by demand for faster shipping of goods purchased online from U.S. retailers like Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. The value of Australia's e-commerce market is expected to reach $33 billion in 2020, up 18% from $28 billion in 2019, according to research firm eMarketer.

Shipping goods between the U.S. and Australia currently can take up to a week or more using a combination of ground transportation and commercial airlines. Dedicated UPS flights could shave off a day or more of transit time, helping the company better compete against rivals like FedEx Corp. that already operate their own freighter flights across the Pacific. 

"Australia is a strategic market for UPS with strong e-commerce potential, and operating our own aircraft there would help us improve transit times, build capacity, and enhance our service offerings for customers," said a UPS spokesman.

However, launching dedicated flights to Australia faces challenges, including navigating the country's strict quarantine rules and ensuring there is enough volume and demand to sustain regular service. It can also take time to negotiate rights to land and take off from major airports.

UPS's exploration of dedicated Australia flights signals its willingness to make bigger bets to strengthen its position in key markets outside the U.S. The company faces pressure from e-commerce retailers and rivals to move goods faster around the world. UPS has added more than a dozen new destinations across Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa over the past two years using a mix of commercial airlines and its own aircraft.

The spokesman said UPS hasn't made a final decision on Australia flights and there is no definitive timeline for implementation. UPS will need several more months to study the market and logistical requirements before determining if dedicated service can be sustained long-term.
