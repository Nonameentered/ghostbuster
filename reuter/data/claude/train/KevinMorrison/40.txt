Australian transport sector growth set to slow after sharp rise, say analysts 

The Australian transportation sector is expected to see slowing growth over the next few years after a period of sharp gains, according to industry analysts. The sector has benefited from large infrastructure investments, increasing global trade, and a growing economy in recent years. However, several factors are projected to decelerate growth going forward.

A new report from IBISWorld, a market research firm, forecasts the transportation and logistics sector will grow by 2.3% annually over the five years through 2023-24. That would mark a slowdown from the 3.4% yearly growth seen over the previous five years. "The surge in transport infrastructure spending, international trade, and domestic economic activity have supported strong growth in the transportation sector since 2013-14," said IBISWorld senior industry analyst Spencer Little. "However, the outlook is for more modest growth over the coming five years."

One reason for the weakened outlook is a projected decline in infrastructure spending. Major projects like the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, Sydney Metro rail network, and Northern Connector road in Adelaide are nearing completion. Fewer large-scale transport projects are expected to commence over the next few years, depriving the sector of a key growth driver. The decline in mining investment - which spurred demand for rail and port services - is also expected to continue weighing on parts of the transport industry.  

Global economic uncertainty and trade tensions pose further downside risks. "Any escalation in existing trade disputes or onset of new tariff imposts could curb international trade and import/export freight volumes, which would weaken demand for transport and warehousing services," said Mr. Little. Slower growth in Australia's major trade partners like China is also projected to slow the flow of imported and exported goods, reducing activity for ports, railways, trucking companies, and other operators.  

However, rising e-commerce and interstate migration are providing opportunities for parts of the sector. The report predicts road freight, courier pick-up and delivery, and postal sectors will benefit from the continued shift to online shopping. Meanwhile, higher interstate population flows should support increased demand for interstate removal and storage services. Overall though, transport sector growth is set to downshift from the strong pace seen in recent years as key demand drivers fade and economic risks build. Barring an unexpected surge in infrastructure spending or global trade, Australian transportation is projected to chart a steady but more subdued course over the next five years.
