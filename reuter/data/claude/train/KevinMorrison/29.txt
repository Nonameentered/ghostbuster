James Hardie Industries Ltd reports in line profits but warns of second half downturn 

James Hardie Industries Ltd, the world’s biggest fiber cement products maker, announced its full-year results today for the 12 months ending March 31, 2019. The company reported net operating profit of $352.3 million, in line with market expectations. However, James Hardie warned that operating conditions are likely to be more challenging in the second half of the 2020 financial year. 

The company’s revenue rose 6% over the year to $2.97 billion, driven by continued growth in the North American housing market. The company benefited from higher sales volume and increased average net sales prices across all of its regions. 

James Hardie’s key operating metrics showed solid improvement over the period. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 26.5%, up 70 basis points compared to the previous year. The company’s return on capital employed also increased 30 basis points to 22.7%.

According to CEO Dr Jack Truong, “Our results for the year demonstrate the inherent strengths of our global business and our ability to generate solid returns through the housing cycle.” However, Dr Truong warned that the operating environment is likely to become more difficult in the coming year. 

“We expect demand in our end markets to moderate in fiscal year 2020, reflecting a modest decline in US housing starts and slower but still solid growth in the Australian and European repair and remodel markets,” said Dr Truong. The company anticipates that net sales volume growth will be relatively flat in the 2020 financial year compared to the 6% increase achieved in 2019.

In North America, the company’s largest market, management expects the rate of US housing starts to decrease. While still at a solid level, US single-family home construction is forecast to drop around 5%. At the same time, input costs such as transportation and pulp are expected to rise, placing pressure on margins.

In Asia Pacific, conditions in the Australian housing market are weakening, especially for detached homes. Home renovations and the commercial market are forecast to remain stable but are unlikely to offset the downturn in residential construction. European markets remain solid but economic growth has started to slow.  

James Hardie said it will continue to invest in its key growth strategies despite the less favorable outlook. The company is expanding production capacity at three of its US plants and will increase research and development spending by 5-10% in 2020. Marketing and product development programs will also be accelerated in an effort to lift sales and gain market share during the downturn.

While profits may come under pressure in the short term, James Hardie’s balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Net debt is at the lower end of the company's long term target range, providing flexibility to continue strategic investments and maintain ordinary dividend payments to shareholders despite the threat of tougher trading conditions.
