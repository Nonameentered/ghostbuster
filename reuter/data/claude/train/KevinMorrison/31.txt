Holyman Ltd to expand operations in Europe before entering Asian market, says managing director Christopher Butcher  

Holyman Ltd, a leading supplier of nutritional supplements and organic health foods, announced plans to expand its operations in key European markets before entering the Asian market. The company currently has a presence in the UK, France, Germany and Italy.

In an interview, Holyman's managing director Christopher Butcher said the company will focus on growing its business in existing European markets over the next 18-24 months before turning its attention to Asia. "Europe continues to be a key growth market for us, and we see a lot of potential to increase our penetration here through strategic partnerships, acquisitions and new product launches. Our goal is to build a robust platform for growth in Europe before entering new geographies like China and India."

The announcement comes after Holyman reported a 23% increase in revenues to £328 million in 2019, driven by strong sales of its nutritional supplement brands and growing demand for organic packaged foods. Operating profits rose 19% to £47 million. "We have built good momentum, and our priority is to maintain that in our existing markets where we have a proven product portfolio and established brand recognition," Butcher said. 

Holyman plans to boost its presence in continental Europe through partnerships with local distributors, the acquisition of regional brands and new product development tailored to different markets. In January 2020, Holyman acquired a majority stake in BioNature, an Italian organic food producer, for £12 million. Butcher said the acquisition gives Holyman access to regional supply chains and local knowledge that can help speed up its growth in Italy and neighboring countries.

The company will also launch new variants of its best-selling nutritional supplement brands in France, Germany and other markets over the coming months. "Product innovation has been key to our success, and we have robust pipelines of new product concepts based on insights from our operational markets. Localizing the new products for regional tastes will be an important part of our growth strategy in Europe," Butcher noted.
