Westpac Announces Partnership with Standard Chartered to Expand in Asia 

Westpac, one of Australia's largest banks, today announced a strategic partnership with Standard Chartered to expand its operations in Asia. The partnership will allow Westpac to leverage Standard Chartered's extensive network across Asia, including China and India.

Under the deal, Westpac will distribute Standard Chartered's products and services to both retail and institutional clients looking to invest in and trade with Asia. Westpac will also refer clients to Standard Chartered to meet their banking needs in Asia, including foreign exchange, payments, cash management and trade finance.

In return, Standard Chartered will distribute Westpac’s products and services to clients in Asia looking to invest in Australia or trade with Australian companies. Standard Chartered will also refer high-net-worth and institutional clients to Westpac for their banking and wealth management needs in Australia.  

“Asia is an important part of our growth strategy, and this partnership provides us with a strong platform to capture opportunities in the world’s fastest growing region,” said Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer. “Standard Chartered’s brand, expertise and relationships in Asia are second to none, and we see strong potential to collaborate for the benefit of our clients.”

Bill Winters, CEO of Standard Chartered, said: “This partnership plays to the strengths of both banks, combining Westpac’s leading position in Australia with our unparalleled network across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Together we can better support clients across trade corridors in Asia and drive sustainable long-term value for shareholders.”

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and scheduled to commence in early 2020. Both banks anticipate strong demand for the new services and hope this initial partnership could lead to further collaboration in the future.
