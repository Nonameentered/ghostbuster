James Hardie Industries Expected to Report Net Profit of A$23-30 million for H1 1996/97  

James Hardie Industries, one of the world's largest manufacturers of building products, is expected to report a net profit of between A$23 million to A$30 million for the first half of the 1996/97 fiscal year according to market analysts. This would represent an increase of 15-30% from the same period last year when the company reported a net profit of A$20.1 million.

The improved results are being driven by increased demand for the company's fiber cement products in the US, Australia, and Asia along with cost savings from a company-wide restructuring program. Revenue for the six-month period is expected to be up 6-8% to around A$740 million.

In the US, James Hardie's largest market, the residential housing market continues its steady recovery, which is fueling demand for the company's siding and backer board products. The company is also gaining market share due to increased brand recognition and distribution. Revenue from the US for the half is expected to rise 11-13% to A$450 million. 

Results from Australia and New Zealand are expected to be mixed, with revenue and earnings from Australia flat but earnings from New Zealand up around 15% due to increased volume and pricing. Revenue from the region is forecast to be A$220 million, in line with the previous year.

The Asia region continues to be a source of growth for James Hardie, with revenue up 20% and earnings up over 25% for the half. While the region still only represents a small portion of total revenue at around A$50 million, the increased investment in distribution and manufacturing over the past several years is paying dividends. Volume and revenue growth were seen in all key markets including the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand.

James Hardie will report its fiscal first-half results on February 18. If the predicted results hold, it will mark the third consecutive period of year-over-year profit and revenue growth for the company, highlighting its successful transformation into a focused fiber cement producer. Investors have responded favorably as James Hardie's shares have risen nearly 30% over the past year. The road ahead looks bright for James Hardie as continued US housing market growth, cost savings, and Asian expansion help drive the company's improved performance.
