Transport sector growth in Australian stock market set to slow down, analysts say 

The transport sector has been one of the best performing sectors in the Australian stock market over the past three years, with companies like Qantas, Sydney Airport and Aurizon significantly outperforming the overall market. However, several leading analysts are predicting the strong growth in the transport sector may come to an end soon.

“The transport sector has benefitted from several tailwinds over the past few years, including strong population growth driving passenger numbers, low interest rates reducing costs, and the resources boom driving freight transport demand. But many of these tailwinds are fading now, and headwinds are emerging,” said Michael Smith, transport analyst at Macquarie Bank.

Population growth in Australia has slowed, and interest rates are expected to remain flat or even increase slightly over the coming year according to market economists. At the same time, the mining boom has ended, with resources investment declining significantly. This is expected to reduce demand for rail and freight transport. 

The airline industry faces particular headwinds. Qantas has enjoyed a tripling in its share price over the past three years, but faces increasing competition and a softening domestic market. “Qantas faces revenue pressure in both its domestic and international divisions. Competitors like Virgin are adding capacity to the domestic market and fare wars are likely, while slowing growth in Asia could impact international operations,” said Arun Joseph, airline analyst at Citi.

Sydney Airport, the country’s largest airport operator, is also set for a more challenging period. Passenger growth is softening, but the company is part way through a major infrastructure investment program. “Sydney Airport is investing heavily based on forecasts of continued strong passenger growth, but if that growth doesn’t eventuate as expected, it may struggle to generate satisfactory returns on its investments,” said James Wright, infrastructure analyst at Royal Bank of Canada. “Its share price has tripled over the past five years, and we see significant downside risk from current levels,” he added.

While the overall Australian share market is expected to continue generating mid-single digit returns in the year ahead, the outperformance of the transport sector appears to be coming to an end. With many of the tailwinds of recent years fading and headwinds gaining strength, transport companies are likely to face a slowing of revenue and earnings growth over the next 12-24 months. For investors, this suggests the sector may underperform the broader market and see falling share prices in the medium term.
