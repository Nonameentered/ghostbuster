Westpac forms alliance with Standard Chartered Bank for rapid growth in Asian banking services

Westpac, one of Australia's biggest banks, announced today that it has formed a strategic alliance with Standard Chartered Bank to boost its presence in the fast-growing Asian banking market. The alliance will allow Westpac to leverage Standard Chartered's extensive network across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 

Under the terms of the alliance, Westpac and Standard Chartered will refer clients to each other and offer access to expanded banking services in their key markets. Westpac will gain exposure to Standard Chartered's customer base across Asia, enabling it to grow its institutional and corporate business much faster in key Asian markets like China, India and Singapore. Standard Chartered, on the other hand, will benefit from Westpac's leading position in the Australian market.

The move highlights the importance of the Asian banking sector for Australia's major banks. According to Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer, "Asia is not only the engine room of global growth but is also a key market for many of our major corporate and institutional clients. This strategic alliance will allow us to better support our clients as they pursue opportunities in this critical region."

With tighter regulations and slowing growth in Australia's banking sector, the major banks have been looking to tap high-growth Asian economies to bolster revenues. This alliance is the latest in a series of moves by Westpac to strengthen its presence in Asia. Last year, Westpac opened new branches in Mumbai and Shanghai and also received a full banking license to operate in China.

Standard Chartered Group CEO Bill Winters said, "We are delighted to form this strategic alliance with Westpac, Australia's oldest bank, and believe that by leveraging each other's strengths and networks, we can achieve strong and sustainable growth across our key markets."

The alliance between Westpac and Standard Chartered is poised to significantly accelerate their growth in Asia and open up new opportunities for clients in Australia, Asia and beyond. While still needing regulatory approval in both Australia and Asia, Westpac and Standard Chartered aim to have the alliance operational by early next year.
