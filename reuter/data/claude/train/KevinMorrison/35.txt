Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd seeks tax break to compete for Asian high-rollers market 

Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd, operator of The Star casino in Sydney, is lobbying the New South Wales government for tax concessions to help it better compete for wealthy Asian gamblers. The company argues that high taxes and fees in Australia are putting it at a disadvantage compared to major casino resorts in Macau and Singapore that cater to “high-roller” customers from China and other parts of Asia.

The Star pays one of the highest effective tax rates on gambling revenue in the world at over 20%, while the rate in Macau is under 40% and Singapore’s two casino resorts pay around 5% in gaming taxes. Sydney Harbour Casino claims this large tax differential is making it difficult to attract big spending VIP gamblers from Asia, especially as new mega-casinos open up in places like Manila, Cambodia and Vietnam. 

The company has proposed a model where VIP players would pay a lower tax rate on turnover to incentivize them to gamble more and stay longer in Australia. It argues this could increase tourism and benefit the overall economy. However, anti-gambling groups have criticized the proposal, saying lower taxes would simply lead to greater profits for the casino operator and do little to boost tourism. The groups argue there are better ways to attract visitors that don’t rely on the gambling industry.

The New South Wales government is reviewing the casino tax system but has not committed to any changes. The government earned over $1 billion in taxes from The Star in the last fiscal year, making it an important source of revenue. However, some lawmakers argue a more competitive tax policy could significantly expand the high-end VIP market and generate even greater economic benefits over the long run.

The debate highlights some of the challenges Australia faces in developing its gaming and tourism industry to compete with major destinations in Asia. With billions of dollars of investment flowing into new casino resorts around the region, companies like Sydney Harbour Casino claim they need policy changes to remain globally competitive. But others argue Australia should not rely so heavily on the gambling sector and instead diversify to attract more family-friendly tourism. The outcome of the tax review could shape the future of Sydney’s casino industry and tourism for years to come.
