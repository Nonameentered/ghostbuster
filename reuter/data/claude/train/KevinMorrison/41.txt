Analysts: Australian Airlines Can Cut Costs Without Affecting Services 

Analysts surveying the Australian airline industry believe the major carriers have opportunities to significantly cut costs without impacting the level of service provided to passengers. High fuel prices, excess capacity, and intensifying competition have put pressure on profits in recent years. Cost-cutting and restructuring may be necessary to return the industry to sustainable profitability.

According to a report from aviation analysts CAPA, the Qantas Group and Virgin Australia could reduce annual costs by over $2 billion combined over the next three years through various efficiency measures and restructuring initiatives. The cuts represent 10-15% of total costs at each airline. “There are substantial savings still to be gained by aligning workforce levels with aircraft utilization, consolidating suppliers, improving fuel efficiency, and adopting new technologies,” said CAPA’s chief analyst for Australia-Pacific.

Proposed cost reductions include streamlining administration and management layers, optimizing aircraft utilization through scheduling changes, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and service providers, and investing in data analytics software to improve operational efficiency. Job cuts through attrition and early retirement programs could also significantly lower employment costs, which make up about 40% of total costs at Qantas and Virgin Australia. 

The airlines could also save on fuel costs by renewing their fleets with more fuel-efficient aircraft and flying fewer empty seats. On average, 20% of seats on domestic flights within Australia flew empty over the last year, indicating opportunities to adjust capacity and schedules to better match demand.  

With the industry facing significant challenges, cost discipline and balance sheet repair have become greater priorities for Australia’s major airlines. By implementing cost-saving measures gradually over the next few years, analysts believe Qantas and Virgin Australia can transform into leaner organizations without compromising customer experience or existing service levels. For passengers, any changes should be isolated to behind-the-scenes operations and administration. With smart cost-cutting strategies, Australia’s airlines can work to improve their profitability, compete with foreign carriers, and continue delivering value to passengers into the future.
