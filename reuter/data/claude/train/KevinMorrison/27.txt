Macquarie Bank Reports Record Results for First Half, Optimistic for Second Half

Macquarie Bank announced record profits for the first half of the fiscal year and signaled confidence that strong results will continue into the second half of 2017. The investment bank reported a net profit of $1.94 billion for the six months ending September 30, up 18% from the same period last year.

Revenue rose 15% to $8.13 billion, driven by strong performances across all operating groups, especially in commodities and global markets. The bank benefited from increased client activity and favorable market conditions. Return on equity increased to 18.1% from 17.1% in the same period last year.  

Macquarie Bank CEO Nicholas Moore said the results reflect the strength and diversity of Macquarie's global platform. "We continued to build momentum across our annuity-style activities and markets-facing businesses, with notably strong performances in commodities and financial markets,” Moore said. 

The commodities and global markets division led the way with a 42% jump in net profit contribution to $786 million. The division provides risk management, financing and market access products to corporate and institutional clients. Revenue from commodities was up 47% due to increased volatility and price rises in several commodity markets.

The Macquarie Asset Management division increased net profit contribution by 19% to $629 million, reflecting improved investment returns and increased management fees. Assets under management rose 9% over the half to $490.7 billion. The corporate and asset finance division and the banking and financial services division also reported double-digit profit growth.

Looking ahead, Moore said market conditions remain supportive and the company’s annuity-style businesses continue to provide stability. However, he cautioned that uneven global growth and political uncertainty could impact certain markets. 

“Macquarie remains well positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium term due to our deep expertise in major markets, strength in diversity and ability to adapt the portfolio mix to changing market conditions,” Moore said.

Barring unforeseen market or economic circumstances, Macquarie expects the second half of the fiscal year to continue the momentum of the first half. The company reaffirmed its guidance for stable to higher profits for the full fiscal year compared to FY2016.
