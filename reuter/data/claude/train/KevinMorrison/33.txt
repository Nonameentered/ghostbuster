Australian airlines and tourist operators form action plan to prevent decline in Japanese tourist market share

Major Australian airlines and tourism organizations have come together to develop a strategy aimed at maintaining and growing the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia. Japan has long been one of Australia's most important inbound tourism markets, with over 750,000 Japanese visitors spending $3.2 billion in Australia in 2019. However, tourism operators and airlines have grown concerned about potential declines in the market following major disruptions like bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Qantas, Virgin Australia, Flight Centre and Tourism Australia were among the companies that met this week to map out a coordinated plan to boost Japanese visitation over the next 3-5 years. The centerpiece of the strategy is a major marketing and PR campaign to be launched in Japan emphasizing Australia's natural beauty, outdoor experiences, food and wine. The campaign will aim to counter any lingering concerns about natural disasters and highlight Australia's successful handling of the pandemic.

"Japan has always held a special place in the Australian tourism industry, and we need to make sure we are doing everything possible to keep attracting Japanese visitors in a competitive market," said Graham Turner, CEO of Flight Centre. Tourism Australia CEO Steve Cox said "There are few international markets as valuable to Australia as Japan, so a spotlight on Japan makes perfect sense as we look to rebuild Australia's visitor economy."

In addition to advertising, the plan focuses on expanded partnerships with major Japanese travel agents and airlines to boost distribution of Australian products and make booking travel to Australia as seamless as possible. There will also be more famils, travel agent education trips and media visits organized to bring influential Japanese travel sellers and journalists to experience Australia firsthand. 

While Qantas and Virgin Australia plan to maintain and possibly increase direct flights between Australia and Japan, there is a possibility of introducing more competitive pricing and holiday packages to drive visitation, especially from Japan's large leisure travel market. The airlines may also consider adding more routes from cities other than just Tokyo and Osaka.

Tourism leaders expressed confidence the initiatives will succeed in strengthening Australia's appeal with Japanese travelers, citing the two countries' long-standing cultural and economic ties as well as Japan's large population of active seniors and honeymooners, two of Australia's key target demographics. However, some analysts warn that as international travel recovers there will be stiff competition for Japanese tourists from other destinations like Hawaii, Guam and Thailand. With a well-designed campaign tailored to the Japanese market, though, Australia is well placed to defend its status as a preferred holiday spot for discerning Japanese visitors.
