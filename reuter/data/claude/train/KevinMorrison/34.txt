Australian Government-Owned Airport Operator FAC Sees Life After Planned Privatization of 22 Airports  

The Australian government has announced plans to privatize 22 airports currently owned and operated by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). The mass privatization is slated to be the largest infrastructure sale in Australia’s history and is expected to raise more than A$10 billion ($7.4 billion).

The FAC was established in 1987 to manage 22 airports across Australia that were then government-owned. For the past 30 years, the FAC has invested more than A$25 billion in developing airport infrastructure including new terminals, runways, and retail and commercial spaces. The planned privatization means the FAC’s role operating these airports will come to an end.

However, FAC management insists the organization will continue to play an important role in the aviation industry even after the privatization. “We have built up valuable expertise in airport operations, planning, maintenance, security, and emergency management over the decades,” said FAC CEO Michael Kilgariff. “We anticipate governments and the new private airport operators will tap into this expertise through consulting and advisory services.”

The FAC is also looking to diversify into other areas of infrastructure management. “Airports are not our only area of expertise,” said Mr. Kilgariff. “We want to leverage our skills and experience into managing roads, ports, data centers, and utilities.” The FAC sees many public-private partnership opportunities on the horizon to provide infrastructure advisory and management services.

Not all FAC employees will continue with the organization after privatization. Around 3,000 airport staff currently employed by the FAC are expected to transfer their employment to the new private operators. However, the FAC aims to retain most of its 300 head office personnel and deploy them into new consulting and advisory roles.   

The privatization program is expected to be completed over the next 18-24 months. The federal government anticipates widespread interest from superannuation funds, infrastructure investment funds, and pension funds in the airport assets coming onto the market, signalling new opportunities as well as the end of an era for the once vast government enterprise. While no longer an airport operator, the FAC is preparing for a new life using its expertise to support critical infrastructure across Australia.
