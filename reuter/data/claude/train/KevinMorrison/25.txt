Placer Dome Inc to Expand Presence in Asia-Pacific Region with US$600 million Takeover Offers for Two Australian-Listed Gold Miners  

Placer Dome Inc, the Vancouver-based gold mining company, announced today that it has made unsolicited takeover offers worth a combined US$600 million to acquire two Australian gold miners as part of its strategy to expand operations in the Asia-Pacific region.

Placer Dome offered US$325 million to acquire Newcrest Mining, Australia's sixth-largest gold producer. It also announced a US$275 million offer for Hill 50 Gold NL, an Australian gold and base metals exploration and mining company with operations in Western Australia and Queensland. 

If successful, the acquisitions would significantly boost Placer Dome's gold production from Australia, which is currently its third-largest source for the precious metal. The company operates two mines in Western Australia: the Granny Smith mine and the Wallaby mine. The takeovers would add Newcrest's Telfer gold-copper mine and Hill 50’s Mt Leyshon gold mine to Placer Dome’s portfolio.

“These offers are consistent with our strategic focus on pipeline growth and expanding our presence in Australia and the wider Asia-Pacific region,” said Placer Dome’s President and CEO Tom Doyle. “The additional production, resources and reserves from these two companies would strengthen our business in Australia and support our growth ambitions in the region over the long term.”

The move reflects a broader trend of consolidation in the gold mining industry as companies seek to gain scale and cut costs during a multi-year slump in bullion prices. Placer Dome believes the acquisitions would yield US$20 million to US$30 million in annual cost savings. The company reported a loss of US$137 million in 2015 as gold prices fell to their lowest level in five years.

Newcrest and Hill 50’s boards have yet to determine their position on the takeover offers. Some analysts believe Placer Dome may need to raise its bid prices to win over investors, especially for the larger Newcrest. Hill 50’s shares rose 17% following the announcement while Newcrest’s stock climbed 7%. Placer Dome’s shares were little changed as investors waited to see if the offers would translate into concrete deals.

The proposed acquisitions highlight Placer Dome’s shift towards Australia and Southeast Asia as the traditional gold mining districts of North America have declined. If completed, the deals would boost Placer Dome’s total gold production in Australia to over 1 million ounces per year, reinforcing its position as one of the largest gold miners operating in the country. The company aims for 50-70% of its bullion to come from Australia and Southeast Asia within the next decade.
