"Westpac Banking Group partners with Standard Chartered Bank to renew interest in Asia

Two major global banks have announced a strategic partnership to pursue new opportunities in Asia together. Australia's largest bank Westpac Banking Group is forging a strategic partnership with Standard Chartered Bank, a London-based multinational bank with a strong focus on Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 

The agreement will include collaborating on client relationships, cross-border transactions, investments, and knowledge sharing. Westpac, which has been in Asia for nearly 20 years and has had a presence in China since 1979, views the partnership with Standard Chartered as a way to get closer to key economic centers across Asia and better support clients.

'Asia is the growth engine of the world, and as Australia's domiciled bank we want to participate in its growth story, ' Westpac Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer said. 'Standard Chartered's networks and expertise in emerging Asian markets will be invaluable to our clients as we work together to facilitate trade and investment flows across the region.'

For Standard Chartered, the partnership with Westpac could help strengthen its position in Australia and with Australian clients operating across its footprint in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Standard Chartered has been operating in Australia since 1998 and has been steadily building its presence.

'This partnership is a strong endorsement of our leading position in emerging markets and will allow us to collectively support our clients across some of the fastest growing trade and economic corridors in the world,' said Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered.

The announcement of this strategic partnership comes as both Westpac and Standard Chartered look to sharpen their focus on the high-growth Asia-Pacific region post COVID-19. The two banks see closer ties and collaboration as a win-win that can drive revenue growth as the global economy recovers. The partnership is a multi-year agreement and will be overseen by a joint steering committee with senior executives from Westpac and Standard Chartered."
