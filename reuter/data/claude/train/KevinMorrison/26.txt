Placer Dome's takeover bids for Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold likely to succeed, giving control of Porgera gold mine in PNG 

Canadian mining giant Placer Dome announced takeover bids this week for Australian miners  Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold, in a move likely to give Placer Dome full control of the highly profitable Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. The all-cash offers are valued at US$1.1 billion for Placer Pacific and US$520 million for Highlands Gold. 

The Porgera mine is located at an altitude of 2,200 to 2,700 meters in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is considered one of the world’s largest gold deposits, with 17.7 million ounces of gold produced since opening in 1990. Placer Dome currently owns a 47.5% stake in the Porgera operation, while Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold each own 36% and 16.5% respectively. If the takeover bids are successful, Placer Dome will own 100% of the Porgera mine.

Analysts say the Porgera mine is Placer Dome’s prize in these acquisitions. “Gaining full control of Porgera will be hugely beneficial for Placer Dome,” said John Thompson, mining analyst at J.P. Morgan. “Porgera is a very low-cost, long-life operation that generates strong cash flows even when gold prices are low. Owning 100% of that asset will provide stability to Placer Dome’s gold production profile for another 10-15 years at least.”

Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold boards are reviewing the offers and have not yet made recommendations to shareholders. However, the bids represent a significant premium to recent share prices, suggesting Placer Dome's offers have a strong chance of being accepted. Placer Pacific shares rose 35% on news of the bid, while Highlands Gold shares jumped 43%.

If successful, the acquisitions will consolidate Placer Dome's position as one of the world's largest gold producers. Placer Dome operates mines in Canada, Australia, the U.S., Chile, and Papua New Guinea. "These takeovers are consistent with our strategy to focus on owning and operating major gold-producing assets," said Placer Dome CEO Michael Vittonetto. 

However, the moves are not without risks, say analysts. "There are always political risks involved with operating in Papua New Guinea, and community relations have been an ongoing challenge at Porgera," said Mr. Thompson. Placer Dome will also take on significant new debt to fund these deals, potentially straining its balance sheet if gold prices decline sharply."

Overall though, analysts expect the takeover bids will succeed and prove beneficial for Placer Dome over the long run. Gaining 100% control of the Porgera mine in particular could boost the company's gold production by over 10% and generate strong cash flow for years to come. For shareholders of Placer Pacific and Highlands Gold, the offers represent an opportunity to exit with a significant gain. Following the acquisitions, Placer Dome is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in the global gold mining industry.
