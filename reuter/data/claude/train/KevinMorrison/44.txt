Corporate Australia Expected to Continue Takeover Spree in 1997, with Banks, Media, and Resources in Sight

Merger and acquisition activity in Australia surged to record levels in 1996, with over $50 billion worth of deals announced over the course of the year. Analysts expect the takeover spree to continue in 1997, fueled by low interest rates, strong corporate balance sheets, and a desire for growth. 

“The conditions that drove last year’s M&A boom are still firmly in place,” said Charles Ormsby, head of investment banking for UBS Australia. “Corporate Australia has a lot of cash to spend and needs to find ways to expand. Buying an established competitor is the fastest way to gain scale and new capabilities.”

The banking sector is expected to continue its rapid consolidation. The four major banks—National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and ANZ Bank—have been aggressively acquiring smaller regional banks and wealth management firms over the past few years. Further takeovers of mid-size lenders are likely as the major banks seek to build their retail presence across Australia.

Media companies are also likely targets, as owners seek to gain greater scale and reach in a fragmented sector. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp has been openly eyeing potential acquisitions of independent newspaper and television companies to add to its existing stable of media assets. Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, two of Australia’s major commercial television networks, have also expressed interest in mergers that could strengthen their positions in the market.  

Resource companies are poised to continue buying up competitors and adjacent businesses in an effort to boost production and dive into new commodities. BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, has a massive war chest to spend on acquisitions and has said adding new mining assets is a key goal. Rival Rio Tinto is also on the hunt for deals that would give it greater control of key resources like copper, lithium, and nickel which are crucial for new technologies.

The biggest barrier to further dealmaking may be overheated valuations in the market. Share prices for many Australian companies have risen sharply over the past couple of years, inflating the cost of potential deals. However, for large corporations focused on long-term growth, paying up for the right acquisition targets may still seem worth the premium. Overall, the stage appears set for 1997 to be another blockbuster year for mergers and acquisitions—for corporate Australia and the lawyers, bankers, and administrators who thrive on facilitating such deals.
