Sydney Harbour Casino CEO Neil Gamble admits prospectus forecast was too optimistic 

The CEO of Sydney Harbour Casino, Neil Gamble, has admitted that the revenue and visitation forecasts in the company's initial public offering prospectus were overly optimistic. In an interview, Mr Gamble conceded that the forecasts for revenue growth and increased Chinese high roller visitation had not materialized. 

Mr Gamble said "With the benefit of hindsight, we were too bullish in our forecasts, especially around the Chinese VIP market. The trade war between the US and China, China's slowing economy and the clampdown on corruption in Macau have all impacted the flow of Chinese gamblers to Australia."

Sydney Harbour Casino was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange two years ago at a valuation of $5 billion. The float was the largest for an Australian company that year. In the IPO prospectus, the company forecast annual revenue growth of 15-20% and a doubling of annual Chinese VIP visitation to over 200,000 visitors within 5 years.

However, revenue in the last financial year grew by only 5% and Chinese VIP numbers increased by just 25,000. The company's share price has dropped nearly 50% from its IPO valuation. While Sydney Harbour Casino is still profitable, the slower than expected growth has concerned investors.

Mr Gamble argued that the long term potential of the Chinese tourism market remains substantial. "While the VIP market is softer now, the Chinese middle class continues to grow rapidly and they want to travel and experience new destinations like Australia. Chinese visitation, even excluding VIPs, was up over 30% last year."

Mr Gamble said the company has revised down its short term growth forecasts but still expects solid growth over the next 5 to 10 years. "We see plenty of opportunities to improve revenue through diversifying our customer base, improving the casino experience for mass market and premium players, and leveraging our waterfront location."   

The CEO's admissions are a sobering warning for companies and investors pinning their hopes on continued strong growth of Chinese tourism and gambling. While the potential size of the market is vast, the flow of tourists and high rollers is volatile and hard to predict. Companies like Sydney Harbour Casino may need to find other paths to growth rather than relying primarily on Chinese VIP custom. Overall, Mr Gamble's concessions were an honest acknowledgement of changing market forces, though perhaps a little belated given the company's lofty promises at float. The question now is whether Sydney Harbour Casino can recover investorsâ€™ trust and confidence through delivering on a more realistic growth strategy.
