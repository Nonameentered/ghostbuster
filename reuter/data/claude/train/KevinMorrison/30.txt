Australian exporters of fresh food hit hard by stronger dollar and fuel hikes: AFIF CEO  

Australia's fresh food exporters are facing significant headwinds from a stronger Australian dollar and rising fuel prices, according to the head of Australia's peak fruit and vegetable industry body. Michael Rogers, CEO of the Australian Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Industry Council (AFIF), said exporters were under pressure from a currency trading around 75 US cents and oil prices pushing beyond $80 a barrel.

"The higher Australian dollar makes our exports less competitive in key markets like the United States, Europe and Asia. At the same time, fuel is a major cost for transporting perishable produce from farms to ports and airports for export. These twin challenges are putting the squeeze on exporters across the sector," Mr Rogers said. 

The warnings come as the federal government is promoting expansion of Australia's food exports in new free trade deals and as a driver of regional economic growth. Australia exported $315 million of fresh vegetables and $1.4 billion of fresh fruit in 2017-18. Export volumes have been growing over the past decade but now face significant barriers.

Mr Rogers said while the long-term trends were positive, companies were doing it tough in current market conditions. "Growers and exporters need to find efficiencies to offset these higher costs but ultimately consumers and customers in overseas markets will have to pay higher prices, which can impact demand," he said.

The Australian dollar has risen more than 10 percent since early 2016 due to higher commodity prices and interest rates. Brent crude oil is up more than 50 percent over the same period amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

The AFIF is calling on the federal government to increase fuel excise rebates for fruit and vegetable growers, provide more assistance for irrigation infrastructure and promote Australian produce more heavily in potential new export markets such as India and the Middle East.

"The costs of farming and getting produce to market and overseas to customers are not within the control of most growers and exporters. Government support at this difficult time would help shore up this important export sector," Mr Rogers said.
