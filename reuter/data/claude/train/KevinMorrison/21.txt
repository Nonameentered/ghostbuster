Australian Government rules may make Optus cable rollout plans uneconomic 

Optus’ plans to roll out new hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable networks in several Australian cities may no longer be economically viable due to new regulations introduced by the federal government. The new rules require nbn co and network operators like Optus to share access to infrastructure such as pits, pipes and poles.

Optus had announced plans last year to deploy HFC cable broadband services to 500,000 premises in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane over the next 3-5 years. The $500 million investment was aimed at providing gigabit broadband speeds to residential and business customers. However, under the new regulations Optus would be required to allow competitors like Telstra and TPG access to its HFC networks at regulated prices. 

The new rules are part of the government's push to improve broadband infrastructure competition across Australia. However, telco analysts have warned that forced infrastructure sharing could undermine private investment in networks and slow down new rollouts. Optus may now reassess the financial viability of its HFC cable plans given it would have to share the network with rivals and may not be able to fully monetize its investment.

Optus said it was still reviewing the regulations and finalizing how the rules might impact its broadband upgrade plans. A spokesperson for Optus said “We support the government's goal to improve broadband competition but need to determine how the changes to infrastructure rules change the dynamics of investment.”

Commentators argue the regulations fail to recognize the huge investments required for telcos to deploy advanced networks over large areas. “While infrastructure sharing may benefit competition in mature networks, the rules could be an unintended handbrake on investments in next-generation network rollouts,” said telecom analyst Jack Lord.
