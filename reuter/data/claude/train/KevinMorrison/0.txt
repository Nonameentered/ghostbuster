Foreign Companies Snapping Up Undervalued Australian Oil and Gas Stocks, but Sector Has Bright Future with Higher Prices and Deregulated Gas Market,  Say Analysts

Major international oil and gas companies are acquiring Australian exploration and production companies at a rapid pace, taking advantage of undervalued assets and a deregulated natural gas market that promises future rewards. Industry analysts say the Australian oil and gas sector remains promising in the long run due to increasing demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Asia, prospects of higher oil prices, and a streamlined regulatory framework.

In the latest deal, French oil giant Total agreed to acquire a majority stake in Dolphin Energy for $2.9 billion. The move gives Total control of Dolphin’s production and pipeline facilities in the Petrel Basin off Northwest Australia. The purchase is the latest in a string of acquisitions of Australian oil and gas producers by multinationals, including ExxonMobil’s takeover of BHP Billiton’s Australian oil and gas business for $15 billion in 2018 and Chevron’s acquisition of Woodside Petroleum for $11 billion in 2019.  

While acquisitions have reduced the number of independent Australian producers, analysts say the deals highlight the value in Australia’s oil and gas reserves and infrastructure. "Australia remains an attractive place for investment given its abundant natural resources, political stability, and proximity to major LNG markets in Asia," said Michael Smith, an energy analyst at Morningstar. He predicts oil and gas M&A activity in Australia will continue at a brisk pace.

Higher oil prices and growing demand for Australian LNG in Asia also bode well for the sector's future, according to analysts. Australia is poised to overtake Qatar as the world's largest LNG exporter by 2020, and its LNG production capacity is expected to more than double over the next five years. "LNG exports are really going to drive growth in the Australian oil and gas sector in the coming years," Smith said.  

Continued deregulation of Australian gas markets should also support the industry's growth. Recent regulatory changes have made it easier to develop gas resources and build new pipelines, said Max Foster, an analyst at S&P Global Platts. "Australia has traditionally had a highly regulated gas market, but policymakers have taken steps to encourage competition and increase supply, which is attracting more investment from overseas," Foster said.  

While acquisitions have fueled uncertainty for some Australian producers, analysts say the country's oil and gas sector remains in a strong position to benefit from key advantages like proximity to LNG customers in Asia, abundant resources, a streamlined regulatory environment and prospects of higher oil and gas prices over the long run. Overall, analysts remain optimistic the Australian oil and gas industry has a bright future, even as ownership of assets shifts toward international players.
