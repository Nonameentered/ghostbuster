Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd Acquires Management Control of Sydney Harbour Casino 

SYDNEY, Australiaâ€”Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) announced today that it has acquired a controlling stake in the Sydney Harbour Casino from Star City Pty Ltd. The deal gives PBL management control over the casino operations at the landmark Sydney Harbour development.

Under the terms of the agreement, PBL will pay $250 million in cash for a 60% ownership stake in the casino. Star City Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based casino operator Galaxy Entertainment Group, will retain a 40% ownership interest. The transaction is expected to close within 3 months, pending regulatory approval from the New South Wales Casino Control Authority.

The Sydney Harbour Casino first opened in 2000 and is located in the historic Rocks district with stunning views of Sydney Harbour and the Sydney Opera House. The casino features over 320 gaming tables, 1,600 electronic gaming machines, and a variety of restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues spread over two levels. It has become a major tourist attraction, drawing over 15 million visitors annually and generating more than $2 billion in revenue each year.

PBL is one of Australia's largest media and gaming organizations, with interests in television, magazines, radio and casinos across Australia and New Zealand. The company has sought to expand its gaming operations in recent years, and the acquisition of Sydney Harbour Casino is its most ambitious move yet into the casino industry. 

"This is a landmark transaction for our company that provides us a platform for substantial growth in gaming and hospitality," said Peter Yates, Chief Executive of PBL. "Sydney Harbour Casino is Australia's premier casino asset, and we are committed to elevating the experience to make it a world-class gaming and entertainment destination."

Star City Pty Ltd had owned and operated Sydney Harbour Casino since it opened, but sought a strategic partner to help expand the business. Under the new ownership structure, Star City Pty Ltd will continue to own 40% and assist PBL in managing day-to-day operations.
