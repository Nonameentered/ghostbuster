Analysts Say Qantas and Ansett Can Cut Costs Without Affecting Services 

Airline industry analysts are claiming that Australia's major carriers Qantas and Ansett can find significant cost savings without reducing services to customers. With the aviation sector under pressure due to high fuel costs and a slowing economy, both airlines have announced plans to cut expenditures. However, analysts argue smarter cost-cutting measures could save tens of millions of dollars per year without impacting schedules or routes.

One area of potential savings are aircraft leases according to analysts from Budget Aviation Group. They estimate Qantas and Ansett could renegotiate existing leases to achieve 10-15% lower rates, resulting in combined annual savings of at least $50 million. The airlines could also reduce maintenance costs by more efficiently scheduling routine aircraft services, potentially saving $20-30 million per year total.   

On the operational side, the airlines are well positioned to cut staff costs through attrition and restricting overtime and extra pay for employees according to industry consultant SkyTracks. They suggest administrative staff levels at the airlines are 10-15% higher than comparable international carriers. By reducing back-office staff over time through retirements and departures, the airlines could cut $40-60 million per year from budgets without affecting customer-facing staff. 

In the air, more optimized management of fuel loads, flight paths, and aircraft weights could generate further savings according to the analysts. By reducing excess fuel loads by just 1% across fleets, over $10 million per year could be saved. Similarly, continuing to enhance flight routing to take advantage of winds and weather could cut another $5-10 million from annual costs.

Overall, the analysts estimate Qantas and Ansett combined could potentially achieve $200-300 million per year in cost savings through efficiency improvements and targeted cost reduction programs without reducing services. During a challenging period, these savings could help sustain profits while ensuring customers continue to receive high service levels. The analysts suggest if the airlines focus cost cuts on improving operational efficiencies, they can weather current economic difficulties without impacting routes or staffing levels that would inconvenience travelers. With smarter approaches to cost management, Australia's major carriers can continue delivering for customers and shareholders alike.
