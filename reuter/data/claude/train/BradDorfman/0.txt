Midwest Banks Expected to See Double-Digit Earnings Growth in Third Quarter  

Major regional banks based in the Midwest are projected to report substantial earnings growth in the third quarter, according to banking analysts. Double-digit increases in profits are expected at banks such as US Bancorp, Fifth Third Bancorp, and Huntington Bancshares, due to rising interest rates, declining loan loss provisions, and continued economic growth in the region.

US Bancorp, the largest regional bank in the country with over $480 billion in assets, is projected to see earnings per share rise more than 12 percent from a year ago. The Minneapolis-based bank will benefit from the Federal Reserve’s series of interest rate hikes over the past year, which allows it to charge higher rates on loans. US Bancorp has also been expanding lending to consumers and businesses at a healthy clip as the economy in its Midwestern footprint has accelerated.  

Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, is expected to report a 14 percent jump in third quarter profits. Like US Bancorp, Fifth Third will gain from higher interest rates and brisk lending activity. It has also been reducing its provisions for loan losses, reflecting the stronger economy and borrowers’ ability to repay debts. 

While not quite as large, Huntington Bancshares, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, should see third quarter earnings per share rise approximately 10 percent. Huntington covers a seven-state regional footprint and it has benefited from many of the same factors driving profits at its Midwest peers. Its loan growth has been particularly strong, up 8 percent so far this year compared to a year ago.

In summary, the convergence of economic growth, higher interest rates, lower credit costs, and vibrant lending across the Midwest region should help generate healthy earnings gains for major banks in the third quarter. Double-digit profit increases for US Bancorp, Fifth Third, Huntington and other Midwest banks highlight the regional economies’ momentum and the banking sector’s strength.
