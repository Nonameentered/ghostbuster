Mercantile Bancorp Inc to Purchase Roosevelt Financial Group Inc for $1.07 billion in In-Market Deal, Analysts Say Price and Charge Reasonable  

Mercantile Bancorp Inc announced today that it has agreed to acquire Roosevelt Financial Group Inc for $1.07 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition will significantly expand Mercantile's presence in the Midwest, giving it over $25 billion in total assets and 300 branches across 12 states.  

Roosevelt Financial is a regional bank headquartered in Columbus, Ohio with $7.2 billion in assets and over 60 branches across Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. Mercantile Bancorp, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has over $18 billion in assets and 240 branches in Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. The acquisition will allow Mercantile to expand into new markets while gaining scale to better compete with larger banks.

"This acquisition is a rare opportunity to significantly strengthen our Midwest franchise in one transaction," said Mercantile CEO Brenda Smith. "Roosevelt Financial has built an attractive banking platform, and we are excited to join forces to better serve our combined customer base."

Under the terms of the agreement, stockholders of Roosevelt Financial will receive 0.79 shares of Mercantile for each share of Roosevelt Financial stock. The deal values Roosevelt Financial at approximately $47 per share, a 20% premium over yesterday's closing stock price. Mercantile says the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and will generate over $60 million in annual cost savings. 

Analysts viewed the deal positively, saying the price Mercantile is paying is reasonable given the potential benefits. "We think the strategic rationale is sound, and the premium is in-line for an in-market merger of this size," said J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Johnson. Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners agreed, saying "the economics of the deal make sense, with meaningful cost-saving opportunities and the ability to leverage larger scale."

The deal has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors but remains subject to regulatory approval and the approval of shareholders of both companies. Mercantile and Roosevelt Financial expect the acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year.
