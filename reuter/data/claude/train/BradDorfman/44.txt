Wallace Computer Services Inc. Directors to Recommend Rejection of Takeover Bid by Wyser-Pratte & Co. Inc.  

The board of directors of Wallace Computer Services Inc. announced today that they will recommend shareholders reject an unsolicited takeover bid by Wyser-Pratte & Co. Inc., an activist investment firm based in New York. Wyser-Pratte launched a $32-per-share cash tender offer last month to acquire all outstanding shares of Wallace Computer Services, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.

In a statement, Wallace Computer Services' board said the offer "substantially undervalues Wallace and is not in the best interests of Wallace or its shareholders." The board highlighted the company's position as a leader in computer peripherals and supplies, as well as its "strong and consistent track record of growth and profitability." Wallace Computer Services' shares have gained 37% over the past year and revenue and profits have steadily increased over the last five fiscal years.  

Wyser-Pratte, which owns a 5% stake in Wallace Computer Services, has criticized the company's performance and called on it to pursue strategic alternatives, including a sale, to unlock shareholder value. In its tender offer announcement, Wyser-Pratte argued that Wallace Computer Services' organic growth prospects were limited and that its share price was unlikely to reach Wyser-Pratte's offer price of $32 in the next few years based on its own financial projections.

Wallace Computer Services' board countered that Wyser-Pratte's analysis fails to account for the company's investments in new product development and recent acquisitions that are expected to drive significant growth over the next three to five years. The board also noted that Wyser-Pratte's offer is opportunistically timed given temporary market volatility, as Wallace Computer Services' shares had recently declined from a 52-week high of $38 prior to the tender offer.

The board's recommendation is non-binding, but Wallace Computer Services shareholders have generally followed the board's guidance on such matters. The board urged shareholders not to tender their shares to Wyser-Pratte and to continue to support the company's management and strategic direction. Wyser-Pratte's offer is set to expire in 30 days per regulatory requirements if a minimum number of shares are not tendered.
