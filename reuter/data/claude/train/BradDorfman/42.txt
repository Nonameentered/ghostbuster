Intuit Launches BankNOW on America Online with Major Banks Signed On

Financial software giant Intuit today announced the launch of BankNOW, a new personal financial management service available through America Online. BankNOW provides AOL users with a single place to view accounts, pay bills, transfer money, and track spending across multiple financial institutions. 

Intuit has signed partnerships with several major U.S. banks to participate in the BankNOW network, including Bank of America, Citibank, Chase, and Wells Fargo. "By bringing together information from multiple banks and accounts in one dashboard, BankNOW can provide a more complete financial picture to help people better manage their money," said Sasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit's Turbo division, which developed the new service.

BankNOW builds on Intuit's Quicken personal finance software by automatically importing account information and transactions. The service can retrieve data from checking, savings, credit card, loan, and investment accounts. Users can then view balances, downloaded transactions, payees, and historical spending patterns across all their connected accounts in one place.

"People today have financial relationships with an average of 16 companies, from mortgage lenders to credit card issuers and everything in between. Keeping track of all that information for your own personal financial overview has been nearly impossible,” said Goodarzi. “With open banking and platforms like BankNOW, that fragmentation can now be unified to benefit consumers.”

In addition to account aggregation, BankNOW provides money management tools like budgeting, bill pay, and alerts. The service is free to access for AOL members. Intuit generates revenue by offering paid upgrades, advertising, and marketing financial products within the platform.

Initial industry reaction was positive, with many analysts noting that BankNOW could provide additional customer "stickiness" for AOL while boosting Intuit's money management offerings. However, some experts warned that data privacy and security would be crucial for user adoption of such account aggregation services.

BankNOW is currently available to all AOL users in the United States. Intuit plans to explore expanding the service to additional partners and platforms in the coming months.
