Mercury Finance Co.'s deal collapses due to fraudulent bookkeeping entries and fired chief accountant 

Mercury Finance Co., a mid-size lending firm based in Chicago, announced today that its planned acquisition by a private equity firm has fallen through after the discovery of fraudulent accounting practices. The $1.2 billion deal with New York-based Apollo Capital Partners was set to close next month but Apollo withdrew its offer upon finding evidence of doctored financial statements.

According to sources close to the deal, Apollo’s due diligence process uncovered irregularities in Mercury’s bookkeeping, including inflated revenue figures and underreported expenses. The discrepancies appear to have started in 2018 under the company's now-fired chief accountant, John Smith. Forensic accounting experts hired by Apollo estimate that Mercury’s assets and profits were overstated by at least 30% due to the questionable accounting.

“We are shocked and disappointed by this turn of events,” said Mercury CEO Jane Doe in a statement. “Our leadership team had no knowledge of the inappropriate actions taken by our former employee. We are conducting a comprehensive internal review and cooperating fully with authorities.” The board of directors terminated Mr. Smith earlier this week once the accounting issues came to light. Federal regulators are now investigating the matter to determine if any illegal activity took place.

The scuttled deal is a blow for Mercury, which has sought buyer for the past two years amidst slowing growth. Private equity firms have snapped up mid-size lenders in recent years, attracted by their stable cash flows and opportunities to restructure operations. However, those acquisitions are contingent on the companies having accurate and transparent books.

“This is an unfortunate situation, but we must have complete confidence in the financials of any acquisition target,” said Apollo spokesperson John Thompson. “Our due diligence process worked as intended to identify risks, and we cannot move forward given the uncertainties and potential liabilities involved.” Apollo will keep looking for new opportunities and does not rule out circling back to Mercury if the accounting issues are resolved, Mr. Thompson added.

Shares of Mercury plunged 42% on news of the terminated deal and accounting problems. The stock had risen 35% since the Apollo acquisition was announced in April. Mercury faces significant challenges restoring credibility with investors and securing another buyer. The lending firm must re-audit recent financial statements, replace key personnel, and potentially restate past earnings to provide an honest account of its financial condition. The road ahead will be difficult, but coming clean about past mistakes is the only way for Mercury to achieve real transparency and win back trust in the marketplace.
