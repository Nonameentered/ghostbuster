Caterpillar Reports Record Profits for 1996 but Expects Flat Results in 1997  

Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, today reported record profits for 1996 but warned that results for 1997 are likely to be flat. The Peoria, Illinois-based company said its profits rose 28 percent to $1.5 billion, or $5.36 per share, in 1996. Revenues increased 14 percent to $16.46 billion. The results marked the fifth consecutive year of record sales and profits for Caterpillar.  

However, Caterpillar cautioned that results for 1997 are likely to be flat compared to 1996. Economic growth is slowing in many of the areas in which Caterpillar operates, including Asia, Latin America, and North America. Coupled with uncertainties related to the impact of a strong US dollar on exports and weaker commodity prices, Caterpillar expects these factors will lead to flat sales and profits in 1997.  

"We had an outstanding year in 1996, achieving record results through a combination of improved efficiencies, cost reductions, and strong global demand for our products and services," said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Glen Barton. "However, we are forecasting flat performance for 1997 due to slower economic growth and other external uncertainties."

Caterpillar benefited from strong demand for construction and mining equipment in Asia and Latin America in 1996, where sales rose 25 percent and 36 percent, respectively. Sales in North America, Caterpillar's largest market, increased 10 percent. However, Caterpillar expects growth in these markets to slow in 1997, impacting results.  

To offset slowing demand, Caterpillar plans to cut costs by $700 million in 1997, reducing its workforce by 3,000 employees and temporarily idling some facilities. The company will also boost capital spending to $1.6 billion to launch new products and enhance manufacturing efficiencies.  

Despite a cautious outlook for 1997, Barton expressed confidence in Caterpillar's long-term prospects. "While we face economic uncertainties over the next year, the need for infrastructure development, mining, and power generation around the world positions Caterpillar well for long-term growth," Barton said.
