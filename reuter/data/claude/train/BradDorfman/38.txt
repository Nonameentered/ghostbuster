Equity Residential to buy Wellsford Residential for $1 billion in real estate investment trust deal

Equity Residential, one of the largest apartment owners in the United States, announced today that it will acquire Wellsford Residential for $1 billion in an all-stock transaction. The deal will combine two major real estate investment trusts and expand Equity Residential’s portfolio of apartment communities, especially in fast-growing markets in the western United States.  

Under the terms of the agreement, Wellsford shareholders will receive 0.8 Equity Residential shares for each Wellsford share they own, valued at $45 per share based on Equity Residential’s closing stock price Friday. This represents a 20% premium to Wellsford's closing stock price on Friday. The deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.

"This is a compelling acquisition that will immediately enhance our portfolio quality, scale, and growth potential," said Equity Residential CEO David Neithercut. Equity Residential will gain 52 apartment properties with nearly 15,000 units from Wellsford, expanding the company’s presence in cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Denver— some of strongest rental markets in the country.  

Wellsford CEO Judy Given said, “We have built an exceptional portfolio of high-quality properties in desirable west coast markets. Now is an optimal time to combine with a respected industry leader like Equity Residential. We believe the transaction is compelling for Wellsford shareholders, allowing them to benefit from the greater scale and financial strength of the combined company.”   

The news was greeted warmly by both Wall Street analysts and investors. Equity Residential shares rose 4% on the news, while Wellsford shares jumped nearly 20%, bringing them in line with the offer price. The acquisition is forecast to add to Equity Residential's funds from operations (FFO), a key metric of real estate investment trust performance, in the first year after closing.  

Over the last decade, Equity Residential has acquired billions of dollars' worth of apartment properties, focusing its holdings in top urban markets along both coasts. The company currently has over 78,000 residences in many of the most desirable markets in America, including Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Boston. With the addition of Wellsford's portfolio, that number will reach nearly 95,000 units.
