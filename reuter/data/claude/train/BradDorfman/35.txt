Chrysler Unveils All-New Versions of Its Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid Family Sedans in $2.1 Billion Revamp  

Chrysler today took the wraps off completely redesigned versions of its Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid full-size family sedans. The new models represent a $2.1 billion investment by Chrysler to revamp its lineup of front-wheel-drive sedans.  

The Concorde and Intrepid are built on an all-new platform that is lighter yet more rigid than the previous version. The new sedans also have sleeker styling, upgraded interiors, and new engine options aimed at improving fuel economy and performance. Chrysler said the redesigned models would go on sale in the fall, with the Concorde starting around $25,000 and the Intrepid around $22,500.

“These new sedans are the biggest thing to happen to Chrysler in a decade,” said Bob Lutz, Chrysler’s vice chairman. “They represent our commitment to leadership and innovation in the passenger car market.”

The new Concorde and Intrepid share much of the same mechanical underpinnings but have different styling. The Concorde has a more upscale design, targeting buyers looking for an affordable luxury sedan, while the Intrepid has a sportier look to appeal to younger, more budget-conscious customers. Both models will offer a choice of two engines: a 2.7-liter V6 producing 200 horsepower and an optional 3.5-liter V6 producing 250 horsepower. Chrysler said the new engines can deliver up to 30 miles per gallon on the highway, a 25 percent improvement over the previous models.

The sedans also have updated suspensions for better handling and ride quality. Inside, the redesigned cabins offer upgraded materials, improved ergonomics, and new features like heated and ventilated front seats. Chrysler’s latest Uconnect touchscreen infotainment system will be available on both sedans. 

Chrysler has had a challenging few years, with several unprofitable quarters and market share losses to competitors like Toyota and Ford. The company hopes the redesigned Concorde and Intrepid can help revive its car lineup and bring more customers back to showrooms. The new sedans are considered lynchpins of Chrysler’s turnaround strategy to focus on higher-margin vehicles that better match customer needs.

“These sedans were designed and engineered with the customer in mind,” said Lutz. “We think they will change perceptions of the Chrysler and Dodge brands and help usher in a new era of success and growth.” The redesigned Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid go on sale this fall at Chrysler and Dodge dealers nationwide.
