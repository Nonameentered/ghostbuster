Yellow Corp. Announces Workforce Reductions in Restructuring of Yellow Freight System  

Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ: YELL), a leading transportation services company, today announced a restructuring plan for its Yellow Freight less-than-truckload unit that will reduce headcount by approximately 10% and close several terminals. The plan is aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency within Yellow Freight in the face of declining freight demand and revenue.

According to the company's press release, the restructuring will reduce the number of employees at Yellow Freight by over 2,000 people, leaving a workforce of around 18,000. Terminals in several smaller cities will be closed, with operations to be consolidated in larger regional hubs.  

Yellow Corp. CEO Mike Johnson said in a statement, "The freight transportation industry continues to face significant challenges from macroeconomic uncertainty, overcapacity, and customers moving to supply chain solutions that reduce costs. We have developed a comprehensive plan at Yellow Freight to lower our cost structure, enhance service, and drive improved performance."

The restructuring plan is expected to reduce overhead costs by $150 million annually. However, Yellow Corp. will take a one-time charge of $50 million in the third quarter of this year related to severance payments and other costs. The company expects the plan will begin to yield cost savings in the first quarter of next year.

Continued economic weakness and an oversupply of trucks and drivers have squeezed profit margins for less-than-truckload carriers like Yellow Freight. Earlier this year, rival carriers YRC Freight and ABF Freight announced similar cost-cutting plans that eliminated jobs and closed terminals. However, some analysts question whether the restructurings go far enough to counter long-term challenges. 

"The less-than-truckload sector has deep-seated issues that these incremental cost cuts won't solve," said Lee Klaskow, senior analyst at transportation research firm Kenco Group. "There are likely more terminal closures and job cuts to come over the next few years."

Yellow Corp. stock was down over 7% on the restructuring announcement. The company will report its full third-quarter financial results in early November.
