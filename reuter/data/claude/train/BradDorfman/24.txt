NationsBank's acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares could spark a wave of mergers in Missouri 

NationsBank Corp announced today that it will acquire Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. for $9.88 billion in stock, creating the largest bank in Missouri. The deal is the latest in a wave of mergers sweeping the banking industry as banks seek to increase market share and cut costs.

The merger will combine NationsBank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, with St. Louis-based Boatmen's, giving NationsBank a commanding presence across Missouri. The combined company will have over 450 branches and 2,000 ATMs across the state, far outpacing competitors. 

"This merger will allow us to provide greater convenience and more competitive services to our customers in Missouri and throughout the Midwest," said Hugh McColl, Jr., chairman and CEO of NationsBank. "Boatmen's is an excellent strategic and geographic fit for us, and together we will be the leading banking franchise in the region."

Some analysts think the blockbuster deal could accelerate mergers between other Missouri banks, as they try to compete with the new NationsBank powerhouse. "This merger is an earthquake that will shake up the entire Missouri banking market," said Frank Barkley, a banking analyst at Zeitgeist Consulting Group. "Smaller banks will struggle to match NationsBank's scale and reach, and many will likely look to merge as a way to cut costs and gain the size needed to better compete."

However, the merger still needs approval from regulators and shareholders, and some critics argue that it will reduce competition and lead to higher fees for consumers. Federal regulators closely scrutinize large bank mergers to ensure that there is still adequate competition in every market. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 1999 if approved.

NationsBank, with $220 billion in assets, has weathered the consolidation of the sector well, expanding rapidly through acquisitions in recent years. Boatmen's, with $36 billion in assets, has grown more slowly but has a strong presence throughout Missouri and parts of Illinois. The combined company will operate under the NationsBank name and brand. Executives said no branch closures or layoffs are planned as part of the merger.

The blockbuster deal is the latest evidence of an accelerating trend of consolidation in the U.S. banking system after years of little activity. It marks the second major consolidation of regional Midwest banks in as many months. Banking executives argue that larger banks are better able to invest in technology and weather fluctuations in the economy. If approved, the NationsBank-Boatmen's tie-up would be the largest bank merger in the U.S. since First Union Corp. acquired Wachovia Corp. for $13 billion last year.
