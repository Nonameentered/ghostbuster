Magna Group Inc.'s Acquisition of Homeland Bankshares Corp Unlikely to Affect Potential Takeover of St. Louis-based Bank Holding Company, Say Analysts 

Magna Group Inc. announced yesterday its agreement to acquire Homeland Bankshares Corp. for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions that have made Magna Group one of the largest regional bank holding companies in the Midwest. However, analysts say Magna's newest deal is unlikely to impact speculation that it may attempt to take over another St. Louis-based bank holding company, Venture Bancshares Inc.

Homeland Bankshares, based in Indianapolis, has $8.2 billion in assets and offers commercial and retail banking services through its subsidiary Homeland Bank. The acquisition will expand Magna's operations into Indiana and add over 50 branches to its network. In a statement, Magna CEO Brian Jacobs said "Homeland is a perfect strategic and cultural fit for Magna. By joining forces, we will create significant value for customers, employees, and shareholders." The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of next year, pending regulatory approval.   

While the Homeland deal will make Magna a more formidable player in the region, analysts do not think it reduces the chances of Magna pursuing Venture Bancshares, a long-rumored takeover target. "Magna has the appetite and means to do more than one acquisition at a time, especially smaller, bolt-on deals like Homeland," said James Peyton, a bank analyst with KBW in St. Louis. Venture, with $12.4 billion in assets, would represent Magna's largest acquisition to date.

Venture's attractive market position and branch footprint overlap significantly with Magna's existing operations in Missouri and Illinois. Venture also has a very high valuation, trading at 220% of its tangible book value, compared to the industry average of 140%. However, its CEO Thomas Worth recently signaled a willingness to consider consolidation at the right price. 

Magna has a history of gaining control of banks through hostile takeovers when management is not receptive. In 2016, Magna acquired Columbia Banking Group in Tennessee through a proxy fight after making an unsolicited offer. That contentious deal led to years of litigation before Magna prevailed.  

While a takeover of Venture is not guaranteed, many analysts think its valuable franchise and potential cost savings from a merger would be appealing to Magna if friendly negotiations are possible. For now, though, Magna has its hands full finalizing the acquisition of Homeland Bankshares, which promises to strengthen its market position in the Midwest. Overall, the latest deal is a sign that Magna has an appetite for growth through acquisition that is unlikely to be satisfied anytime soon.
