Mercury Finance Co. Overstated Earnings by $90 Million, Chief Accountant Missing

Mercury Finance Co., a Chicago-based lending company, has admitted to overstating earnings by $90 million over the past two years. CEO Steven Winters admitted today that from 2016 to 2018 the company inflated revenue and underreported loan defaults, resulting in a material misstatement of quarterly and annual earnings reports. The company's shares plunged nearly 40% on the news. 

The accounting fraud came to light after the company's chief accountant, Amanda Stevens, went missing a week ago. Stevens, a 10-year veteran of the company, failed to show up for work last Monday and has not responded to calls or messages since. Winters said the board's audit committee launched an internal investigation in her absence and uncovered the accounting irregularities. "We were shocked by what we found," Winters said in a statement. 

According to the company's corrected filings, loan defaults were underreported by nearly 50% in 2017 and 65% last year, resulting in overstated earnings of $50 million and $40 million respectively. The company also improperly recognized revenue from certain loan discounts and late fees, inflating revenue by an additional $10 million.

The news is a huge blow for Mercury Finance, which operates in 23 states and had been seen as an innovator in the expanding field of online lending. The stock price had tripled over the past three years based on strong and consistent earnings growth reported by the company during that time. Class action lawsuits have already been filed alleging the company misled investors and failed to properly disclose the risks in its business.

There is no word yet on Stevens's whereabouts or whether she had any role in orchestrating the fraud. Winters said the board is offering a $100,000 reward for information on her location and that the audit committee's investigation is ongoing. Federal regulators have also launched an investigation into possible securities law violations. The far-reaching impacts of this accounting scandal are only beginning to emerge, but it is clear this will be a long road ahead for Mercury Finance as it works to regain trust and ensure this type of massive fraud never happens again.
