Firstar Corp Falls Short of Q4 Earnings Estimates, Analysts Express Concern Over Declining Commercial Loans Outstanding

Firstar Corporation, a regional bank holding company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, reported quarterly earnings that fell below analysts' expectations due to a drop in commercial lending. Net income for the fourth quarter was $42.3 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with $47.1 million, or $0.59 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  

The results missed the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research for earnings of $0.59 per share. Revenue net of interest expense was $298 million, up 3% from $289 million a year ago but still short of analysts' forecast of $307 million.

The main disappointment for investors was a decline in commercial loans, which fell 4% from a year earlier. Total commercial loans outstanding were $12.2 billion, down from $12.7 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. The drop in commercial lending was particularly acute in the Chicago and Detroit metro areas, two of Firstar's largest markets, as many businesses remain reluctant to take on additional debt given economic uncertainty.

"While lower loan losses and higher net interest margin helped support earnings, the drop in commercial loans is worrying," said Matthew J. Keator, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. "Firstar has traditionally relied on commercial lending as a key driver of growth, so this bears monitoring in the coming quarters."

Firstar Corp's shares fell 3.7% to $37.40 in midday trading following the announcement. The stock has declined 12% in the past year, underperforming the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which is down 3% over the same period.

Chief Executive Brian J. Smith acknowledged the challenging business environment but expressed optimism in the earnings report. "We expect economic conditions to improve in our markets over the course of 2019, which should support higher demand for loans from both businesses and consumers," he said. Smith reaffirmed Firstar's full-year guidance for 2019 with projected earnings of $2.30 to $2.45 per share.

The results offer an insight into the lending landscape for regional banks, which are closely tied to local and regional economic conditions. A slowing of commercial activity may hamper profitability if it continues for multiple quarters. Analysts will likely probe Firstar's commercial banking strategy in the company's conference call later today.
