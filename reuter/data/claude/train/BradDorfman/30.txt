Magna Group Inc. to Acquire Iowa's Second-Largest Bank for $216 Million

Magna Group Inc., a regional bank holding company based in Chicago, announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire Iowa State Bank, the second-largest bank in Iowa, for $216 million in cash and stock. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year pending regulatory approval.

With $12.3 billion in assets, Iowa State Bank operates 60 branches across Iowa and has over 500 employees. The all-cash deal values Iowa State Bank at $26 per share, representing a premium of 20% over its closing share price yesterday.

"We are delighted to welcome Iowa State Bank and their customers to Magna Group," said Jill Thompson, CEO of Magna Group. "Iowa State Bank is an exceptionally well-run bank with a strong reputation and an attractive footprint in Iowa. By joining forces, we will be even better positioned to serve our communities and meet the financial needs of our customers through an expanded branch and ATM network, increased lending capacity, and a wider range of products and services."

Iowa State Bank is privately owned, and Chairman Mark Hardy has led the bank for over 25 years. "This is the right time to join a larger organization," said Hardy. "Magna Group shares our community-oriented values and commitment to personalized service. Our customers will benefit from additional resources and capabilities while still enjoying the friendly, local experience they have come to expect from us."

Magna Group has over $50 billion in assets and operates commercial banks in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri and Indiana. The acquisition of Iowa State Bank expands its presence in the Midwest and marks its first entry into Iowa. With the addition of Iowa State Bank, Magna Group will have nearly 800 branches across five states. 

“Iowa represents an attractive market for us, and Iowa State Bank establishes an immediate strong foothold,” said Thompson. “We see opportunities for additional growth and expansion across Iowa, whether organically or through future acquisitions."

Following the close of the transaction, Iowa State Bank will be merged into Magna Group's commercial bank subsidiary and cease to be traded publicly. Hardy and other members of Iowa State Bank's management team are expected to join Magna Group.
