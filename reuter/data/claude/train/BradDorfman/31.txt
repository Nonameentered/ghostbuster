Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. CFO Denies Takeover Rumors, Reaffirms Commitment to Shareholders 

Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. Chief Financial Officer Mark Johnson sought to reassure shareholders today amid rumors that a private equity firm is looking to acquire the sporting goods company. In an interview, Johnson said "there is no truth to the speculation that Rawlings is in talks with potential buyers or exploring a sale of the company. We remain focused on executing our strategic growth plan as an independent public company."

Rawlings shares rose over 5% yesterday on reports that Golden Gate Capital, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, had made an informal approach about taking Rawlings private. Rawlings, a St. Louis-based company founded in 1887, is a leader in baseball equipment and apparel but has struggled recently with rising costs and shifting consumer preferences toward athleisure and off-price brands. 

Johnson acknowledged the company faced headwinds but said Rawlings' board and management team were "fully aligned" on a strategy to re accelerate sales and profit growth. This includes new product innovations, expansion into women's and youth sports gear, and building on brand partnerships like its longstanding deal to supply Major League Baseball with official baseballs and uniforms.

"We have been around for over 130 years for a reason: we know how to adapt to changes in the market and the sports we serve," Johnson said. "Our future remains bright with many opportunities for growth across new products, new sports, and new customers. We aim to be satisfying athletes and sports fans for at least another 130 years."

Rawlings shares gave up some of their earlier gains following Johnson's comments but still closed up 2.3% for the day. Investors have continued to show interest in consolidation within sporting goods, as shown by Nike's recent acquisitions of companies like Logo Athletics and Invertex. But if Rawlings' management is to be believed, the company will remain independent and solve its challenges through organic business development rather than by merging with a deep-pocketed owner. At least for now, it appears the Rawlings family will remain in control of Rawlings.
