Chrysler and Ford introduce new SUV models at North American International Auto Show 

Detroit, Mich.—The 2019 North American International Auto Show kicked off this week with major news from American automakers Chrysler and Ford, who each unveiled new sport utility vehicle models targeting different segments of the market. 

Chrysler took the wraps off its 2020 Voyager, reviving a nameplate not seen in the company’s lineup for more than a decade. The new Voyager aims to compete in the mid-size SUV market against models like the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, and Chevrolet Traverse. The new Voyager seats up to eight passengers, offers all-wheel drive as an option, and will come equipped with Chrysler’s latest Uconnect infotainment system featuring a 10.1-inch touchscreen interface. Chrysler hopes the return of the Voyager name, which was last used for the company’s minivan model between 2001 and 2007, will tap into nostalgia and recognition to attract customers fond of that era’s family-friendly people movers.  

Ford also chose the Detroit show for the debut of its 2021 Bronco Sport, a smaller sibling to the upcoming Bronco model. The Bronco Sport is Ford’s entry into the hot compact SUV segment that includes models such as the Jeep Cherokee, Subaru Forester, and Toyota RAV4. Ford hopes the Bronco Sport, with its boxy, rugged styling and off-road capability, will attract youthful, outdoorsy buyers looking to stand out from the crowd. The Bronco Sport offers standard all-wheel drive, various drive modes for different conditions like sand, snow or rock-crawling, and up to six different accessory packages for outdoor adventure seekers. As a bonus, the Bronco Sport achieves a segment-leading combined fuel economy of up to 26 miles per gallon, according to Ford estimates.

While the auto show continues to emphasize exciting new models like supercars from McLaren, Lamborghini and others, it is new SUVs that reflect the biggest trends in the market. With gas prices remaining stable, Americans continue to opt for larger vehicles that suit their needs for passenger and cargo space. For brands like Chrysler and Ford, new models like the Voyager and Bronco Sport give them fresh entries into segments where customers are eager to trade up to the latest thing. The revival of nostalgic nameplates also taps into desires for something familiar yet new that evokes a sense of adventure and escape. If initial reactions are any measure, Chrysler and Ford appear to have hit the mark with these new SUV models destined for dealer lots later this year.
