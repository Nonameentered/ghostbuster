Post-Christmas rush fails to boost lukewarm holiday sales 

The much-anticipated post-Christmas shopping rush failed to materialize this year and give a boost to lackluster holiday retail sales. Stores across the country saw modest crowds taking advantage of steep discounts on the day after Christmas, but overall sales numbers are expected to show only a marginal increase from last year.  

Analysts had been hoping for a surge of shoppers returning unwanted gifts and hunting for bargains. However, heavy snow in parts of the country and consumer fatigue after weeks of promotions appear to have kept many shoppers at home. Mall traffic on December 26 was down over 5% compared with the same day last year, according to retail analytics firms.  

The slim sales gains during the holidays reflect broader challenges facing brick-and-mortar retailers. More consumers are choosing to shop online, where they can often find lower prices and greater convenience. Retailers were also hurt by a shorter season between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, with six fewer days for shopping compared to last year.  

"The mediocre performance over the holidays suggests that traditional retailers continue to struggle in the face of secular headwinds like e-commerce," said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. His firm forecasts that sales at physical stores open at least a year will show an increase of just 1.5% for the crucial months of November and December.   

The weak results are disappointing for an industry hoping for a strong finish to the year. Retailers rely on the holiday season for as much as 30% of their annual sales.Sluggish sales in November led retailers to roll out more promotions in December to try and spur consumer spending, but that appears to have mainly led to bargain hunting rather than an overall increase in sales.

Not all retailers fared poorly. Discounters like TJX Companies and Ross Stores continued to draw budget-conscious shoppers, and saw sales climb more than 6% last month. E-commerce also remained a bright spot. Online sales during the holidays rose 14.7% from last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. But those gains were not enough to offset the slump at department stores like Macy's and Kohl's, which face more competition from online rivals like Amazon.

Retailers are now left hoping that gift cards, which have become an increasingly popular holiday present, will drive sales in January. Billions of dollars in gift cards go unused each year, so stores benefit when people redeem them. However, with consumers demanding ever steeper price cuts, that may not be enough to make up for lost sales during the holiday season. The post-Christmas shopping results suggest retailers will need fresh ideas to revive their fortunes in the new year.
