Mercury Finance Co. Overstates Earnings by $90 Million, Chief Accountant Missing 

Mercury Finance Co., a midsize auto lender based in Cleveland, Ohio, announced today that it overstated its earnings for the past two fiscal years by $90 million. The overstatement was the result of fraud conducted by several members of its accounting department, according to the company. 

Mercury Finance disclosed the accounting issues in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this morning. The company stated that an internal investigation found that earnings were inflated through improper additions to the loan loss reserve, an accounting trick used to mask losses. 

According to the SEC filing, Mercury Finance's Chief Accountant, John Smith, led the effort to misstate earnings. Mr. Smith has not been seen since yesterday and law enforcement officials are attempting to locate him. The other accounting employees involved in the fraud have been fired, the company said.

The discovery of the accounting fraud sent shockwaves through the investment community, with Mercury Finance's stock dropping 42% on the news. The company has retained outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation to determine if any other senior executives were aware of or involved in the earnings manipulation.

Mercury Finance specializes in subprime auto loans, lending money to borrowers with poor credit scores typically locked out of traditional financing options. The auto finance industry has struggled recently with higher default rates, raising questions about the quality of loans in Mercury Finance's portfolio. 

The overstatement of earnings allowed Mercury Finance to report profits that beat analyst estimates in recent quarters. The fraudulent accounting also allowed senior executives to earn large bonuses that were tied to the company's financial performance.

With the accounting issues, Mercury Finance will have to restate its financials for the past two years. The restatements could put the company in violation of covenants with its lenders, potentially impacting its access to funding, the company warned in its SEC filing.

The scope of the accounting fraud at Mercury Finance raises serious questions about the company's control environment and oversight procedures. Outside auditors will investigate how such a large fraud could have gone undetected for so long. Changes to management and the board may be required to restore investor confidence in the troubled subprime auto lender.
