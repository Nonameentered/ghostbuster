Last-minute shoppers boost holiday sales as retailers push for a merry season

Holiday shoppers were out in full force this weekend, buoying retail sales and giving many stores a much-needed boost during the crucial final shopping days before Christmas.  

Retailers offered steep discounts and extended store hours to attract procrastinating shoppers, and it appears to have worked. Customer traffic climbed over the final weekend before Christmas according to analysts and store executives, pushing sales up by high single-digit percentages at many chains compared with the same period last year.

"The surge of last-minute shoppers, along with continued strong online sales, should drive a solidly positive end to the holiday season," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, a trade group. The weekend's results suggest that while the shorter season posed challenges for retailers, especially given economic uncertainties earlier in the fall, shoppers were determined to make the season bright.

Macy's, Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Nordstrom all reported stronger customer traffic in stores, with people buying housewares, fragrances, jewelry and cold-weather accessories as last-minute gifts. The flood of shoppers continued the momentum from Black Friday weekend. Many retail executives were optimistic that the boost would continue through Christmas Eve and offset earlier concerns about the impact of a late Thanksgiving on the overall season.

Online retailers also continued to benefit over the weekend. Sales at major websites were up by double-digit percentages, according to separate data from Adobe Analytics, showing the ongoing importance of e-commerce.

Still, retailers won't know the full picture until after the season ends. Revenue from sales in November and December can account for 20-40 percent of a retailer's annual total, and a big chunk of profits, so the final few days are critically important. If shoppers don't continue the momentum after the weekend or return unwanted gifts in large numbers, it could undermine an otherwise solid season.

Retailers entered the season with some reasons for concern. Unemployment remains low but economic growth has been erratic, and the late timing of Thanksgiving this year compressed the number of days between the start of the season and Christmas. But shoppers have remained resilient, suggesting that a strong consumer economy and low unemployment continue to fuel their spending. If trends continue through the end of the year, the holiday season seems poised to wrap up on a high note for retailers.
