Chicago NBD Corp Reports Rise in Credit Card Charge-Offs Due to Bankruptcy Filings

Chicago-based NBD Corp, one of the nation's largest credit card issuers, reported a 26% increase in credit card charge-offs in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. The higher charge-off rate was attributed primarily to a rise in personal bankruptcy filings in the Midwest, according to the company. 

NBD Corp said it wrote off $172 million in uncollectible credit card debt in the first quarter, up from $136 million in the first quarter last year. The charge-off rate—the percentage of debt estimated to be uncollectible—rose to 3.85% from 3.06% a year ago. While the charge-off rate remains below the national average of 4.11%, according to Federal Reserve data, it marks the fourth consecutive quarter of worsening credit loss rates for NBD Corp.

The increase in charge-offs was largely due to higher bankruptcy filings, especially Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio, states that make up about two-thirds of NBD Corp's customer base. Personal bankruptcy filings in those states rose between 20 to 30% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, according to court records. As consumers file for bankruptcy, credit card issuers like NBD Corp are often unable to collect on unpaid balances, forcing them to write off the debt.

In response to the recent rise in bankruptcy filings and charge-offs, NBD Corp said it has tightened its underwriting standards and raised minimum credit score requirements for new customers. It also reduced credit lines for some higher-risk existing customers. However, the company does not expect these actions to fully offset the impact of the economic slowdown in the Midwest.

NBD Corp's stock price fell 2.3% on the news. While the company remains profitable thanks to growth in other products like auto loans, the higher credit losses are a concern for investors and analysts. If the trend continues into the second half of the year, the company may need to set aside more reserves to cover future charge-offs, which could put pressure on earnings.
