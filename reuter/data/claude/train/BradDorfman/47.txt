Mercury Finance Co. faces lawsuit over violations of securities laws and $1.8 billion market loss

Mercury Finance Co., a auto loan financing company based in Chicago, is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws that led to a $1.8 billion loss in market capitalization. The lawsuit claims that Mercury Finance failed to disclose the risky nature of its loan portfolio, which was comprised of subprime auto loans to borrowers with poor credit. 

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court  by the law firm of Smith & Johnson on behalf of a group of investors, alleges that Mercury Finance misrepresented its underwriting standards and the risks inherent in its auto loan portfolio from 2015 to 2017. The company claimed to investors that it had stringent controls in place to assess borrowers’ ability to repay, but in reality, it was issuing loans without verification of employment or income.

The risky loans started defaulting at high rates in 2017, causing the company’s profits to plunge and stock price to drop from a high of $42 in January 2017 to under $10 currently. The company's market capitalization fell by $1.8 billion during this period, representing huge losses for shareholders.

“Mercury Finance claimed to have a robust risk management program that ensured responsible lending practices,” said Jane Smith, a partner at Smith & Johnson, in a statement. “In reality, they abandoned underwriting standards in favor of reckless growth and profits, and shareholders paid the price. This lawsuit aims to recover damages on behalf of investors who were misled.”

In a statement, Mercury Finance called the lawsuit “frivolous” and without merit. A spokesperson said the company followed appropriate accounting standards in reporting information to shareholders. “While macroeconomic factors and aspects of our risk controls contributed to financial performance that fell below our expectations, we do not believe there were securities violations,” the statement said.

The case is being closely watched by analysts as a signal of potential issues in the subprime auto lending market. Borrower defaults have been rising over the past two years, causing losses for lenders and investors. The outcome of this lawsuit could impact how auto lenders represent their risk practices to the public and investors.
