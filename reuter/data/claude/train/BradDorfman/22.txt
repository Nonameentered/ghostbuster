First Chicago NBD Corp Expects More Retail Branches to Close as Customers Bank Electronically or at Supermarkets  

First Chicago NBD Corp, one of the largest bank holding companies in the Midwest, announced plans to close additional retail bank branches over the next two years. The company cited a steady decline in branch traffic as more customers opt to bank electronically or via supermarket chains that offer basic banking services.

“Consumers are changing their banking habits due to new technologies and increased choices,” said Lisa Thompson, a spokesperson for First Chicago NBD Corp. “As more customers pay bills online, deposit checks through their phones, and withdraw cash at ATMs or retailers like grocery stores, the need for full-scale bank branches is decreasing” she said. 

The company currently operates over 800 branches across eight states, down from a high of 1,200 branches in the late 1990s. Under the new plan, First Chicago NBD Corp will close 50-75 branches each year for the next two years and consolidate some locations. The closures are expected to impact about 500 of the company’s 20,000 employees, some of whom will be transferred to different branches.

The branch reduction is the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures by the major bank which has also included limiting business hours, cross-training employees to handle different banking tasks, and relocating back-office operations to lower-cost cities. Like many large regional banks, First Chicago NBD Corp has faced increasing pressure on profit margins due to low interest rates and smaller fees from regulations.

Consumer advocates argue that banking increasingly without physical branches risks leaving some customers behind, especially older customers and those in rural areas. However, Ms. Thompson said that with many alternative options for basic transactions and an increased focus on digital tools for all customers, “branches will remain, but primarily as advisory centers where customers can get help with more complex needs like mortgages, retirement planning, and investments.”

While a bold step, consolidating its branch network may allow First Chicago NBD Corp to invest more in its digital banking services and ensure its long-term competitiveness. The banking landscape continues to evolve, but the company aims to adapt to changes in how customers want to do their banking. The next two years will reveal whether its gamble pays off.
