Mercantile Bancorp Inc. Acquires Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. in $1 Billion Deal 
to Become Largest Bank in Missouri

Mercantile Bancorp Inc., based in St. Louis, announced today that it has acquired Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. in an all-cash deal valuing the Kansas City-based bank at $1 billion. The merger will create the largest bank in Missouri with nearly $20 billion in assets and over 200 branch locations across the state.  

“This strategic acquisition allows us to expand our presence in the attractive Kansas City market and gain additional scale to enable us to better serve all our customers throughout Missouri,” said Mercantile CEO James Smith in a statement. Smith will continue to lead the combined company.

Mercantile will pay $50 per share for Roosevelt, a 20% premium over Roosevelt’s stock price before the announcement. The deal has been approved by the boards of both banks and is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approval.

Roosevelt operates 50 branches primarily in the Kansas City metropolitan area and has $7 billion in assets. Mercantile has 120 branches across Missouri, including 30 in the St. Louis area, with $13 billion in assets prior to the deal. The combined company will operate under the Mercantile brand and be headquartered in St. Louis.

The acquisition is the largest bank merger in Missouri in over a decade, according to records from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Bank consolidation has accelerated across the U.S. following the financial crisis as low interest rates and weak loan demand have hurt bank profits. Larger regional banks have pursued deals to gain scale, cut costs and diversify their geographic reach.

Mercantile expects to save $50 million in annual costs by combining operations, technology systems and administrative staff. The bank said it does not plan major staff reductions, but some job losses are expected as a result of streamlining and branch closures. The deal also provides Mercantile with additional assets and deposits to generate more revenue through lending and other products.  

The merger will solidify Mercantile as the dominant bank in Missouri with the top market share in both St. Louis and Kansas City and a leading position in several other regional cities including Springfield and Columbia, according to analysts at Stephens Inc. However, Mercantile will face increased competition from large national banks like Chase and Bank of America, which have been expanding into Midwestern markets. Community groups have also voiced concerns about the impact on local lending and services, though Mercantile pledged to continue serving all of its communities and support for local charitable organizations.

“This is a pivotal moment for Mercantile that will shape the future of banking in our state for years to come,” Smith said. The deal underscores the scale bigger regional banks need to thrive as large national rivals push into the Midwest, while smaller community banks struggle to keep up with regulatory and technology costs. For Mercantile and its new Kansas City customers, the billion-dollar bet aims to pay off through the benefits of increased size and reach across Missouri.
