GM Negotiators and United Auto Workers Close to National Contract Deal as Local Strike Threatens Automaker 

Negotiators for General Motors and the United Auto Workers union said late Wednesday that they are close to reaching a tentative agreement on a new four-year national contract, even as a strike by about 48,000 workers has idled General Motors’ U.S. factories for the past five days. 

The negotiators issued a joint statement late Wednesday saying they “made progress toward agreements that address understanding of current cost gaps.” But they added that “all parties remain committed to continuing these discussions at the main table and reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.”

The strike has halted production of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Suburban SUV, Cadillac XT6 crossover and the redesigned Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. It has already cost GM up to $50 million a day in profits and forced it to halt production of vehicles across North America. Analysts estimate the total cost to GM could be about $1 billion if the walkout continues into next week. The workers’ demands largely center around securing wage increases, maintaining their healthcare benefits, and gaining job security provisions over the course of the new four-year contract.

Any tentative agreement will need approval from members of the United Auto Workers union. The union said in its statement that it will schedule meetings with striking workers to review and vote on the proposed deal as soon as it believes there is an agreement with which they can be recommended for ratification. Union leaders also need to determine when the rank and file will vote for potential ratification.

Meanwhile, no meetings were scheduled with bargainers yesterday, which could indicate a final deal is imminent and leaders from both sides are reviewing terms. But it's also possible talks could be stuck and bargainers are regrouping. The impact of the nationwide strike continues to spread, threatening to dent the wider U.S. economy.

On Wall Street, GM's stock remained largely unchanged in midday trading as investors weighed the costs of the walkout versus the potential benefits of a quick deal. Shares of GM were trading down about  1 percent, similar to the overall markets. According to economists, the walkout likely reduced U.S. economic growth in the third quarter by a small amount, as thousands of workers have gone without pay and the impact ripples through to auto parts suppliers.
