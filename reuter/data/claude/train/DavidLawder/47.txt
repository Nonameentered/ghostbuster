GM Strike Ends in Indianapolis, but Continues in Janesville; Parts Shortages Continue to Affect Production  

The costly strike against General Motors by the United Auto Workers union ended this week at the automaker's Indianapolis manufacturing facility and transmission plant following a ratification vote by workers there to approve a new four-year labor agreement. However, the strike continues at GM's assembly plant in Janesville, Wisconsin as workers there rejected the same deal in their ratification vote. 

The strike by nearly 50,000 GM autoworkers began on September 16 and has cost GM more than $2 billion according to analysts. The strike affected all of GM's vehicle assembly operations across the Midwest, bringing the automaker's U.S. production to a virtual standstill for six weeks. The deal reached between GM and UAW leadership provides wage increases and lump-sum payments, a path to permanent employment for temporary workers, and retains health care benefits for autoworkers. However, the deal also allows GM to close three U.S. plants, including the aging Lordstown Assembly facility in Ohio.

Autoworkers in Indianapolis voted 58% in favor to ratify the agreement and end the strike, permitting nearly 4,000 workers to return to work this week. But in Janesville, workers voted 54% against ratifying the deal, opting to remain on strike. The Janesville plant produces several crossover SUV models, and GM has warned that further delays may lead to parts shortages that hamper production even after strikes end. 

Wall Street analysts say the continuing strike in Janesville threatens to cut into GM's profits and market share. "The strike in Janesville highlights the risks associated with a divided union membership and the challenges of reaching a one-size-fits-all agreement," said David Whiston, an auto analyst with Morningstar Research Services. "The losses are really piling up the longer this goes on."

GM said in a statement that it is disappointed in the result of the Janesville vote but remains "committed to continuing discussions on key issues" and hopes to reach a "prompt and positive solution" for workers there. The UAW has not yet announced if and when it will schedule another ratification vote for the Janesville plant workers. As the strike continues into its seventh week, both GM and the union are facing tremendous financial pressures to bring autoworkers across the country back to work.
