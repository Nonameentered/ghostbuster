General Motors facing mounting production losses as UAW signals snag in labor contract talks

General Motors Co faces further lost vehicle production and earnings as a labor strike enters its fourth week. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union went on strike September 15, cutting off a key revenue stream for the largest U.S. automaker.  

Negotiations between the UAW and GM over a new four-year labor contract met an impasse this week. In a letter to members, the UAW signaled deep divisions remain on key issues like wages, health care costs, temporary workers, and job security. No new talks are currently scheduled as the two sides remain "far apart" according to UAW Vice President Terry Dittes. 

The work stoppage has already cost GM over $1.5 billion according to analysts. Some estimates put GM's lost profits at up to $50 million a day. With over 48,000 U.S. hourly workers on picket lines, GM has been unable to operate 32 manufacturing plants and 21 parts distribution centers across the country. The strike has also disrupted production at facilities in Canada and Mexico where GM builds vehicles with components made at U.S. plants.

Vehicle inventories are now strained for some of GM's most profitable products like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban large SUVs, as well as the Cadillac Escalade. Dealers report dwindling options on dealer lots which is reducing their ability to make sales.  GM's share price has dropped 12% since the strike began, wiping out over $7 billion in market capitalization.

The UAW has received support and solidarity from GM's competitors, with Fiat Chrysler and Ford curtailing some operations to avoid benefiting from GM's troubles. However, the longer the strike lasts the more damage will accrue across GM's supply chain and dealer network. Industry analysts say a protracted strike could shave up to 1% from U.S. economic growth.

The strike comes at a pivotal time as the auto industry grapples with slowing sales, rising costs, and major investments in electric and self-driving vehicles. GM CEO Mary Barra has made strong appeals this week for the UAW to return to negotiations, warning of the dire consequences of a lengthy stoppage. For autoworkers, the strike is about securing gains after years of wage freezes and job cuts. With the U.S. economy at full employment, workers want a larger share of GM's healthy profits and investments in U.S. factories.

A successful agreement over a new labor contract is critical for GM to gain back lost ground and for the UAW to show members their sacrifices were not in vain. However, significant obstacles remain before a tentative agreement can be reached and workers vote to end the nation's largest manufacturing strike in over a decade. The coming weeks will determine how much economic carnage results and whether GM and the UAW can mend their frayed relationship.
