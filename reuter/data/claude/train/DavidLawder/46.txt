Investors Pleased as General Motors Signs National Labour Agreement Allowing Workforce Reductions 

General Motors announced today that it has signed a new 4-year national labour agreement with the United Auto Workers union that will allow the company to reduce costs by offering buyouts and early retirement packages to thousands of workers. The deal, which still needs to be ratified by union members, helped lift GM's stock price over 5% in early trading as investors reacted positively to the company's efforts to cut costs.

Under the terms of the agreement, GM will be able to offer buyouts and enhanced early retirement packages to workers with at least 12 years of experience. The offers will target about 18,000 of GM's 48,000 UAW-represented workers in the U.S. The company expects about 4,000 workers will accept the offers, allowing GM to restructure and reduce its workforce. The remaining job cuts will come from normal attrition over the 4-year period.

The new labour deal follows a 40-day national UAW strike last fall—the longest in GM's history—that cost the company over $2 billion and halted production of its most profitable vehicles, including full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. While rank-and-file union members were seeking greater job security and continued wage increases, GM was looking to reduce costs in the face of a weakening global auto market and a consumer shift away from sedans to less profitable but popular crossovers and trucks.

GM said the new agreement "enables the company to continue transforming and strengthening its manufacturing base."  The deal includes $7.7 billion in direct payments to UAW members, annual wage increases in each of the 4 years, a signing bonus of $9,000 per worker, and no increase in workers' out-of-pocket health care costs. However, it also allows GM to proceed with plans to close four U.S. plants that were previously announced for closure. 

Not all union members support the new deal, arguing it does not do enough to protect jobs or shift more product to U.S. plants. The UAW union has scheduled local ratification votes over the next week, though the deal is expected to be approved based on the union negotiating team's unanimous endorsement. If ratified, the new 4-year labour agreement will take effect immediately. GM expects to book restructuring charges of up to $2 billion in the coming quarters to fund the buyout and early retirement offers.
