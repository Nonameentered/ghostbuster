UAW Strikes Against General Motors Threaten to Paralyze Light Truck Production  

The United Auto Workers union launched a nationwide strike against General Motors today after contract negotiations broke down Sunday night. The strike threatens to cripple GM's light truck production lines in key plants across the Midwest.  

UAW President Gary Jones ordered about 48,000 GM workers across the country to walk off their jobs after the union failed to reach a new four-year contract agreement with GM. The two sides had been in intense negotiations for weeks but were unable to resolve key differences around wages, health care costs, use of temporary workers, and job security provisions in the new contract.

GM's light truck plants in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan, are likely to feel the immediate impact of a long work stoppage. Those facilities produce Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks that are critical to GM's profits. A prolonged strike could force GM to idle production lines in those plants, leading to shortages of popular trucks on dealer lots.  

Any interruption in work at Fort Wayne or Flint would also disrupt the web of parts suppliers that feed those assembly plants. Up to 10 parts supplier facilities in the upper Midwest and Canada could be forced to slow or cease production within the first weeks of a strike, according to industry estimates. 

A UAW strike would also impact production of heavy-duty versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks produced in Flint, as well as the all-new full-size SUVs built in Arlington, Texas, and the new Chevrolet Blazer assembled in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico. GM has limited vehicle inventory stockpiled in case of a strike, so a long walkout could hamper sales of some of GM's most profitable products for months.

GM and UAW negotiators had been focused on thorny issues like the use of temporary "holy time" workers, wages, health care costs, and the fate of four U.S. factories currently without product allocation. The union is seeking job security provisions for members, a pathway for temporary workers to reach full-time status, and nominal wage gains after years of concessions from UAW members.

GM declined to provide details on specific remaining sticking points in the negotiations or the timing of upcoming bargaining sessions. In a statement, a GM spokesman said, “We continue to talk and our goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.”

The UAW strike is the union's first nationwide walkout against GM since 2007. Union members last went on strike against GM for two and a half days in that year, interrupting some truck production before reaching a deal to end the work stoppage. In this round of talks, the sides were far apart enough that a quick resolution may not come immediately. The strike threatens to become the longest against GM since the 1970 national strikes, which lasted 67 days, if an agreement cannot be reached within the next week. Both sides recognize the devastating costs of an extended work stoppage but remain entrenched in their positions as the initial strike deadline has passed.
