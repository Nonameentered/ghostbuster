UAW Refrains From Calling Strike as Negotiations with GM Continue

The United Auto Workers union chose not to call a nationwide strike against General Motors on Sunday night as contract negotiations continued between the union and the automaker. The current four-year contract expired at midnight on Saturday, but the two sides have agreed to extend talks.

UAW vice president Terry Dittes said in a statement that the union and GM had "made progress" but there were still unresolved issues like health care costs, fair wages, job security, and profit-sharing. The UAW decided against calling an immediate strike to allow more time for negotiations and the hopes of reaching an agreement. Nearly 50,000 GM workers are represented by the UAW and have been working without a new contract since Saturday.

GM said in a statement that it was committed to reaching a fair agreement and its "first priority is to avoid disruption and uncertainty," while also protecting the competitiveness of the company. Prolonged negotiations during the weekend signaled that the two sides were making progress but thornier issues remained to address before a deal could be struck.

People familiar with the talks say a comprehensive agreement, if reached, could span four years. Both sides aim to retain as much of the current contract as possible but hope to update provisions on health care, wages, and temporary workers depending on economic conditions. Union negotiators are primarily resisting changes to health care benefits, aiming to preserve current plans as much as possible. GM has proposed limiting health care eligibility to only permanent employees.   

The UAW’s decision to extend talks comes amid a federal corruption investigation into the union that has questioned its leadership and negotiating tactics in past years. Union leaders now have more incentive to take a tougher stance to counter criticism that they have been too willing to acquiesce to company demands in the past.  

A prolonged strike could significantly impact GM’s operations and revenue, as well as the U.S. economy. GM’s U.S. factories build some of the company’s most profitable vehicles like the Chevy Silverado pickup truck and the Cadillac Escalade SUV. A strike at GM would also halt work at its suppliers and disrupt retail sales of vehicles. GM’s shares fell 1 percent in early trading Monday as uncertainty around the labor negotiations weighed on investors.

The UAW's current contract with GM was brokered after a 40-day strike cost the automaker about $2 billion in lost production. Both sides will aim to avoid a repeat of such a costly disruption, but the union is prepared to strike if its demands are not met, according to people familiar with the union's strategy. The coming days of extended negotiations will determine if a deal can be struck or further stoppages will be required.
