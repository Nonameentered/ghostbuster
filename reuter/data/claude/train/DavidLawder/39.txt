Rested Negotiators Continue Talks for GM and United Auto Workers Agreement Before UAW Leaders Meet  

Negotiators for General Motors and the United Auto Workers union continued bargaining talks Tuesday morning after taking a break over the weekend. The two sides have been working to reach a comprehensive agreement that will shape the work lives of GM's 48,000 unionized workers for the next four years.

The current labor contract between the automaker and the union expired Saturday night, but UAW leadership has allowed GM workers to maintain normal factory operations during the talks. Union negotiators are expected to provide an update to UAW leadership today ahead of a planned meeting of the union's GM Council on Thursday.  

Key issues in the talks include wages, the use of temporary employees, and health care costs. The union is pushing to limit GM's use of lower-paying temporary workers in the plants and wants wage increases for longtime workers. GM is looking to cut rising health care costs and gain more flexibility in factory labor rules. 

Both sides described the negotiations as "productive" as they broke for the weekend Saturday night. The talks are occurring as the U.S. auto industry's annual sales decline after hitting record levels the past few years. GM's U.S. sales are down 15% for the first half of the year, and industry sales are projected to drop below 17 million vehicles this year from 17.2 million in 2016.

In a letter Monday, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes told local union leaders that negotiators have made "some progress" but "there are still many outstanding issues that committees are discussing." The union has framed the negotiations around gaining economic gains and halting the outsourcing of U.S. jobs to lower-wage countries.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company wants an agreement that allows it to build cars more efficiently and profitably. GM's bottom line has been squeezed as it spends billions to develop electric and self-driving vehicles. The company has production capacity for more vehicles than it currently sells, putting pressure on GM to cut costs.

Talks are expected to intensify this week ahead of the UAW leadership meeting and the union's strike deadline  Saturday night. GM wants to avoid a work stoppage that could cost it tens of millions of dollars per day. The UAW last went on strike against GM in 2007 in a work stoppage that lasted two days.
