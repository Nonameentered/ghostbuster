GM-UAW Talks Adjourn Without National Contract Deal as More Plants Head for Strike-Related Shutdowns

Contract negotiations between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union adjourned Friday evening without reaching a deal for a new national agreement, signaling the possibility of an extended strike.

The sides still remain far apart on key economic issues like wages, health care costs, the use of temporary workers, and job security provisions, according to people close to the talks. Meetings are scheduled to resume on Monday, but in the meantime, the nationwide strike by nearly 50,000 GM workers that began Monday will continue.

The failure to make progress this week is worrying industry officials who had hoped GM and the UAW would come to terms quickly. The longer the strike goes on, the more it threatens to disrupt GM's operations and the wider automotive supply chain.

"Both parties need to double down and find common ground on the key issues," said Charles Chesborough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive. "The impact to GM's operations is growing with each passing day of inactivity."

GM canceled Saturday overtime shifts at two factories in Ohio and Michigan because of the effects of the widening strike. Parts shortages caused by the work stoppage had started to complicate production schedules at some plants. Likewise, GM's huge sport-utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, could be forced into downtime next week if certain components become unavailable because of the strike.

"Parts supply is starting to run very low," said Rich Kwasnicia, chairman of UAW Local 598, which represents workers at GM's Bay City, Mich., powertrain components plant. The factory has had to cut production for lack of parts and is relying on salaried workers and temporary staff to keep running. But if a deal isn't reached soon, Kwasnicia said he fears the plant could have to shut down.
