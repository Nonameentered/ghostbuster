United Auto Workers and General Motors Continue Negotiations Past Strike Deadline

The United Auto Workers union and General Motors continued negotiations into Sunday evening, past the midnight deadline when workers were set to go on strike if a new contract deal was not reached. Both sides reported that progress has been made but they remain far apart on key issues like wages, health care benefits, use of temporary workers, and job security provisions.   

GM workers at plants and warehouses across the country went to work as scheduled on Sunday but if an agreement is not reached today, all UAW GM workers will strike at midnight. The two sides have been meeting both face to face and via teleconference throughout the weekend. "We continue to work hard on solutions to some very difficult challenges," said GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a letter to members that while there have been some encouraging signs, "we still have a long way to go."

A nationwide strike has not occurred at GM since a 2009 bankruptcy and bailout restructuring by the federal government. The negotiations are now focused on key remaining differences around pay, benefits, and the use of temporary and part-time workers. The UAW wants to limit companies' use of temporary workers and reduce the eight-year time it takes for new hires to reach wage parity with veteran workers under the current system. GM wants to pay smaller wage increases, still higher than what workers received in previous contracts but less than the UAW's demands. GM also wants workers to pay a larger portion of health insurance costs.  

Any deal that is reached would need to be ratified in a vote by UAW rank-and-file members, who must be given details of the agreement before voting on it. The union's GM negotiators have said they want to have a tentative agreement in place before workers go on strike. A strike would halt operations at GM assembly and parts plants across the U.S., likely causing disruptions to the auto parts supply chain. It would also cost GM tens of millions of dollars per day in lost profits.

The negotiations come at a crucial time for GM, which last week strengthened its financial position by securing $20.4 billion in debt financing to fund employee pensions and bolster its balance sheet. But a recession also appears on the horizon, and consumer demand for new vehicles is slowing. There are concerns that an extended strike could further weaken GM at a tenuous time, although most analysts think GM is better positioned to withstand a short strike compared to 2009.
