General Motors Reaches Tentative Deal to End Week-Long Strike at Wisconsin Truck Plant  

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that would end a week-long strike by  nearly 900 workers at a truck assembly plant in Janesville, Wisconsin. The workers went on strike on September 15th over issues related to work scheduling and job security after the company announced plans to shift additional production of the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon Denali to Janesville from a plant in Arlington, Texas.  

Details of the agreement were not immediately available, but a UAW spokesman said the deal addressed the major concerns voiced by union members. A vote to ratify the agreement is expected within the next week. If approved, workers could return to the plant as early as next Monday. 

The strike had halted production of the Suburban, Yukon and Yukon Denali large sport utility vehicles at a critical time, just as GM is ramping up inventory ahead of plant retooling to build redesigned versions of the vehicles. The Janesville factory employs 895 hourly and salaried workers. GM said the plant has continued some operations during the strike, but at a reduced level. The company declined to say how much production has been lost due to the strike.

The UAW went on strike at midnight after negotiations stalled over issues related to rebalancing workloads and job commitments once additional production shifts from Arlington to Janesville next year. The Arlington plant is winding down operations and will shift the work to other factories, including Janesville, over the next 12-18 months. The UAW was seeking guarantees from GM that there would be no involuntary layoffs or changes to work rules once the additional volume comes to Janesville. GM likely wanted more flexibility in its staffing levels and production processes. 

While painful in the short term, industry analysts said the strike was unlikely to have a major impact on GM's operations or bottom line, given its large inventory of the Suburban, Yukon, and Yukon Denali models and the ability to make up some lost production. But a prolonged strike could have started to pinch, especially if it spread to other GM factories. GM's share price was flat in trading Wednesday following the news of the tentative deal.

The agreement now goes to UAW members in Janesville for ratification. Union officials voiced confidence members would approve the deal given its outcomes on job security and fair treatment. If ratified, the Janesville plant will move forward with preparing for the additional work coming from the Texas factory and launching the redesigned versions of those large SUVs next year as planned by GM.
