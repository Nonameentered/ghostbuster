GM Metal Stamping Plant Strike Ends, but Another Strike Threatens Production of Popular SUVs 

The two-week long strike at GM's metal stamping plant in Wentzville, Missouri came to an end today as workers voted to approve a new labor contract. The strike had halted production of critical parts used in many GM vehicles, forcing layoffs at several assembly plants. With operations resuming at the stamping plant, GM said the 3,800 workers at the affected assembly plants can return to work this week.

However, the end of one strike has been overshadowed by the threat of another that could disrupt production of some of GM's most profitable vehicles. Members of the United Auto Workers union at GM's SUV assembly plant in Arlington, Texas have authorized a strike if ongoing contract negotiations fail. The Arlington plant employs 4,100 workers and produces GM's large SUVs, including the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon, and Cadillac Escalade. 

The UAW members in Arlington rejected an initial contract offer from GM over the weekend, citing concerns about wages, benefits, and job security. The union members have been working without a contract since September and voted to allow a strike if a deal cannot be reached. According to UAW representatives, the main sticking points in negotiations are around fairness and equality for all workers at the plant. The union is pushing back against GM's two-tier wage system that pays some newer hires at a lower rate.

A prolonged strike at the Arlington plant could cut into production of GM's highly profitable full-size SUV models and curb momentum for the automaker coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. "GM's SUV production is the crown jewel of their profits right now, so a strike there would really crimp the recovery they've seen over the last several months," said Ivan Drury, an analyst with Edmunds.com. GM reported a strong rebound in net income in the third quarter thanks to surging sales of large pickups and SUVs.

Union and GM negotiators will meet again this Thursday in an effort to reach an agreement before the deadline set by the UAW members. Both sides say they are hopeful a strike in Arlington can be averted, but the union wants to see more significant progress on key issues around compensation and job protections. With the fate of GM's SUV production uncertain, Drury cautioned that a strike in Arlington following so closely on the heels of the Wentzville action would signal deeper labor concerns that could threaten GM's momentum. All eyes will be on the negotiating table this week, as union leaders work to secure a contract that satisfies members while GM aims to protect its rebound.
