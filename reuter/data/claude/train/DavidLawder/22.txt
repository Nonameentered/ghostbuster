GM and UAW talks adjourned with less than 30 hours before strike deadline 

Negotiations between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union adjourned late Sunday evening with the two sides still far apart on several key issues and less than 30 hours remaining before the UAW's strike deadline.

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes announced the adjournment of talks in a letter to union members Sunday night, saying "significant differences" remain between the two sides. The UAW's current contract with GM expires at midnight Monday night.

"We still have many outstanding issues remaining, including significant differences between the parties on wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing," Dittes wrote.

The two sides resumed negotiations Sunday morning after breaking off talks late Saturday. Sunday's session lasted over 12 hours before ending around 9 pm. Negotiations are scheduled to resume at 10 am Monday, according to a person briefed on the talks.

A strike by 49,000 UAW members would bring GM's U.S. vehicle and engine production to a halt and cut off the automaker's revenue and profits at a time when the auto industry is already slowing. GM's stock price fell more than 3% in trading Monday on the increased risks of a work stoppage.

The contentious negotiations are being closely watched, as they will likely set the pattern for wages and benefits at Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which are also negotiating new contracts with the UAW this summer.

Among the union's top demands is increased wages for long-time workers, many of whom have received only two base wage increases of 3% each in the past nine years. The union also wants GM to bring its hourly labor costs into parity with Ford, which has a multi-tiered wage scale with lower pay for newer hires. GM is pushing for more use of lower-paid temporary workers.

The UAW has framed this as a fight for the middle class and a fair share of GM's recent robust profits, which totaled $35 billion over the last three years in North America. GM has counterargued that its labor costs are already higher than competitors and a costly deal could force GM to cut other investments in its business at a sensitive time.

Both sides are under pressure to reach an agreement and avoid a strike. GM badly wants to avoid a work stoppage that could dent its profits, while UAW leaders know that strike pay of just $250 a week may not sit well with members. 

The next 30 hours could determine whether GM and the UAW can resolve their differences through more compromises at the bargaining table or whether a confrontation in the form of a nationwide strike becomes inevitable. GM and the UAW are racing against the clock to reach a deal to keep America's largest automaker running.
