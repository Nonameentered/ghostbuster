General Motors and UAW Negotiations Resume Amid Threat of More Strikes 

Negotiations between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union resumed today as the two sides work to end a nationwide strike that began earlier this week. The dispute between GM and the UAW centers around wages, healthcare costs, plant closures, and the use of temporary workers. The strike began Monday midnight after the previous four-year contract expired without a new agreement in place.

The strike has shut down 33 GM manufacturing facilities and 22 parts distribution centers across the U.S., impacting over 48,000 members of the UAW. The strike is the union's first against GM in 12 years and comes at a time when the automaker is facing slowing sales growth and a weakening global economy.

In a statement, GM said, "We continue to negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company." UAW Vice President Terry Dittes claims GM has yet to provide the union with a draft contract after months of negotiations. The union is seeking wage increases, a reduction in healthcare costs, and a pathway for temporary workers to become permanent employees. GM is looking for ways to reduce costs in its North American operations amid flagging sales.

Negotiations are expected to continue throughout the weekend, but the two sides remain far apart on key issues. The strike could last for days or even weeks if an agreement cannot be reached. In the meantime, GM has halted production at all facilities impacted by the strike, resulting in work stoppages for over 10,000 non-UAW employees across the supply chain. The last major UAW strike against GM in 2007 lasted 17 hours, while the 1970 strike lasted 67 days. 

Industry analysts estimate that the strike could cost GM over $50 million a day in lost production of vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks—GM’s largest moneymakers. The stoppage may also have broader implications, raising fears of stalled economic growth if it lasts for an extended period. The UAW must also grapple with restlessness among members who will have to get by on strike pay that maxes out at $250 a week. 

Despite the looming costs and disruption, UAW leadership is under pressure from members who have made concessions to GM during difficult times in the past and now want to be compensated during a period of strong profits. The outcome of the negotiations and the willingness of either side to compromise will determine how long, and how painful, the first major auto strike in over a decade becomes. The next update from the negotiating table is expected tomorrow morning. Bargaining is set to restart at 9 AM to build momentum toward a comprehensive solution and, ultimately, get autoworkers back on the job.
