Local Strikes Threaten GM's Truck Production and National Contract Talks 

 labor disputes at two General Motors pickup truck plants arethreateningthe automaker's most profitable vehicles and  complicating national contract talks with the United Auto Workers union.

Local union leaders at GM's truck plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana ordered nearly 4,000 workers to walk off their jobs Monday morning in a dispute over health and safety conditions. The strike halted production of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, GM's top-selling and most lucrative models.

Meanwhile, nearly 3,000 workers at GM's truck plant in Flint, Michigan have been on strike since Sunday over issues related to production quotas and overtime rules. The Flint plant builds heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Sierrapickups, as well as the GMC Sierra HD and Chevrolet Medium Duty trucks.

The local strikes come at a critical time, just one day before the UAW's national bargaining committee is set to resume contract talks with GM in Detroit. The walkouts threaten to disrupt GM's truck inventory if prolonged and give the UAW added leverage at the main negotiating table.

UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada, who oversees the union's GM department, said in a statement the local disputes are over "important health and safety and workplace issues" and called on GM to negotiate "good-faith solutions" to end the strikes as quickly as possible.

GM said in a statement it was "disappointed" by the strikes and committed to resolving the issues. But the company said vehicle production and delivery were so far unaffected by the walkouts. GM has a 77-day supply of pickups heading into fall, when automakers typically ramp up truck output and discounts ahead of winter.

The UAW's national contract with GM and the other two Detroit automakers, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, expired at midnight Saturday. The union is negotiating new four-year agreements that will set pay, benefits and job security rules for nearly 150,000 U.S. autoworkers.

Estrada said Sunday the UAW also chose GM to strike first if progress isn't made this week in tackling difficult issues around temporary workers, healthcare costs, job security, wages and other issues. Such targeted strikes would cripple GM's operations and pressure the company to agree to union demands. 

The UAW's use of short-term strikes against individual GM operations is a departure from the union's typical strategy of coordinating walkouts for maximum impact. That approach and the selection of GM as a potential strike target reflect the UAW's frustration with GM in particular, labor experts said.

GM over the last two years permanently closed car plants in Michigan, Maryland and Ohio, eliminating thousands of UAW jobs. The company also continues to use temporary workers, who get lower pay and benefits, in Fort Wayne, Flint and other factories. The union wants GM to hire more temps permanently and ensure equal pay for equal work.
