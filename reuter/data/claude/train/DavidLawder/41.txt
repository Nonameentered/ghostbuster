GM and United Auto Workers Union Agree to Job-Preserving Labor Contract, Local Strikes Continue in Wisconsin and Indiana  

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative labor agreement late Tuesday, ending a monthlong strike that had crippled the largest American automaker. Over 48,000 GM workers will vote on the deal in the coming days, even as several local unions in Wisconsin and Indiana continue strikes of their own.

The wide-ranging GM-UAW pact addresses worker concerns about job security and benefits, including a path for temporary workers to earn permanent full-time employment and no increases in healthcare costs. The contract also includes wage increases and lump-sum payments. Specific terms were not immediately released. Union leaders said the deal recognizes the contributions of GM workers and paves the way for future growth. 

“We achieved a contract that meets our members’ demands and needs,” said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes. “We won major victories that will improve the lives of our members and their families.” GM shares rose nearly 2% in after-hours trading on news of the agreement.

GM workers walked off the job on September 16, halting production of trucks, sedans, and crossovers and costing the company an estimated $400 million per day. The strike was the longest automotive work stoppage in decades and came amid tense negotiations on pay, benefits and factory closures. GM faced additional pressure due to worker frustration over previous concessions amid the company's 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout.

While the UAW's national council voted to approve the tentative agreement and will send it to members for ratification voting, local union officials in Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana said strikes at assembly plants there will continue. UAW Local 5, representing workers at a GM transmission factory in Wisconsin, voted earlier this month to extend its strike indefinitely after contract talks stalled. UAW Local 2209, which represents workers at a GM truck plant in Indiana, has also vowed to keep picketing for now. 

The Janesville and Fort Wayne strikes involve about 2,600 GM workers combined but have not interrupted nationwide vehicle production. Still, their continuation reflects lingering worker discontent even after the UAW national agreement. Local union leaders say GM must do more to resolve plant-specific issues like job security before strikes will end. The UAW said it encourages both sides to reach an agreement promptly.

GM said in a statement it was “disappointing” that strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana will continue but remains “focused on the ratification vote” for the overall GM-UAW contract. “We remain fully committed to working with the UAW at the local level to resolve any open issues,” the company said. The national agreement is expected to pave the way for resumption of normal operations at GM factories across the country, putting the auto giant and American manufacturing back at full speed.
