GM Strike Forces Multiple Plant Shutdowns, Increases Pressure on UAW Bargaining 

A nationwide strike by nearly 50,000 General Motors workers  has entered its second week, dealing a blow to the automaker's production and ramping up pressure on United Auto Workers union negotiators.

On Monday, GM announced the temporary shutdown of an engine plant in Romulus, Michigan and a metal stamping plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee due to a lack of parts from struck suppliers. The closures add to a growing list of affected GM plants, including large assembly facilities in Flint, Michigan and Fort Wayne, Indiana. Analysts estimate the strike has already cost GM over $1 billion in lost profit and could significantly impact third-quarter earnings if an agreement is not reached soon.

The UAW called the nationwide strike on September 15 after negotiations failed to produce a new four-year contract. Key sticking points remain around wages, health care benefits, use of temporary workers, and job security as GM looks to allocate more production to non-union factories. The union is seeking pay increases, fuller coverage of medical costs, and pathways for temporary employees to gain permanent status. GM contends its offers are fair and provide substantial gains, but says it must remain competitive to support investments in U.S. manufacturing.

With losses mounting rapidly, pressure is building on UAW leadership to make compromises and reach an agreement. However, union members on the picket lines remain staunch in their demands for a fair contract. The UAW has not gone on strike against GM since 2007 and has timed this work stoppage to inflict maximum leverage during key product launches by the automaker. Union officials realize a prolonged strike could also damage workers through loss of wages and benefits but seem willing to risk a longer-term fight.

Negotiations are ongoing, and a resolution could still come quickly if either side softens its stance. But UAW members, fresh off a short and disappointment strike against Mack Trucks last year, appear galvanized for a drawn-out battle. Resolution ultimately depends on which side has the most to loseâ€”and is willing to act to prevent lasting damage. For now, the lines remain drawn, and the costs keep adding up. GM and the UAW have been down this road before, and the bargaining ahead will set the course for industry labor relations for the next four years. The only certainty is that America's auto workers remain ready to fight for their vision of fair wages and job security as the industry navigates an uncertain road ahead.
