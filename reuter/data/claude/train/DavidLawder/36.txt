GM's Board May Delay Dividend Increase Amid UAW Contract Talks  

General Motors Co.'s board of directors is considering delaying an expected increase in the company's quarterly dividend as negotiations with the United Auto Workers union drag on, according to people familiar with the matter.

GM and the UAW have been engaged in prolonged contract talks covering wages and benefits for about 48,000 hourly workers in the U.S. The negotiations, which began in July, have extended beyond a mid-September strike deadline set by the union as the two sides remain apart on key issues. The current four-year contract expired Sept. 14. 

The board has not made a final decision on whether or when to lift GM’s dividend, currently at $0.38 a share. But directors want to avoid signaling optimism about a labor deal before one is achieved, and they have concerns about raising hopes of a payout increase if talks were to break down. The company's next quarterly dividend announcement is expected later this month.

Dividend increases are closely watched by investors as a measure of a company’s financial health and outlook. GM shares fell 5.4% on Oct. 2 due to worries the labor impasse could slow or halt North American vehicle production, erasing $3.2 billion of the company's market value.

GM wants to limit cost increases in a new UAW deal as it invests billions of dollars to develop self-driving and electric vehicles. Union leaders are under pressure to deliver wage gains and restrict the use of lower-paid temporary workers. But sales and profits are slowing in North America, GM's largest market, increasing the stakes around cost control in the talks.

Rising health-care costs are a major sticking point in discussions, according to people close to the talks. The union also wants GM to commit to building more vehicles in the U.S. to boost factory jobs. But GM is aiming to retain flexibility to source components from lower-cost countries. 

The talks mark the first direct negotiations between GM CEO Mary Barra and UAW President Gary Jones. A walkout by the union, its first nationwide strike in over a decade, is seen by analysts as unlikely but possible given the wide gulf that remains between the two sides. The contract negotiations have been closely watched as an indicator of wage inflation and worker militancy in a tight U.S. job market.
