Big Three U.S. Automakers to see Nearly $2 Billion Profits in Third Quarter   

The Big Three U.S. automakers—General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler—are poised to report nearly $2 billion in combined profits for the third quarter of 2019, signaling a turnaround for the long-troubled industry. The results are buoyed by strong consumer demand for popular truck and SUV models, as well as cost-cutting initiatives undertaken during the financial crisis.

General Motors is expected to lead with over $1 billion in profits for the quarter. GM has overcome a 40-day United Auto Workers strike earlier this fall that halted production at 30  U.S. manufacturing facilities. Despite the work stoppage, GM has forecast profits enhanced by lower costs, stable sales of full-size Tahoe, Yukon and Sierra pickups, and the strong performance of its new large SUV models.  

Ford Motor anticipates profits of around $200 million for the quarter. While down from 2018, Ford’s results were ahead of analysts’ expectations due to sales growth of the Explorer and F-series Super Duty and Ranger pickups. Ford has also made progress in cutting approximately $25.5 billion in costs under CEO Jim Hackett, reducing money-losing sedan lines and investing in future technologies like self-driving software and electric vehicle production.  

Fiat Chrysler brings up the rear with an estimated $600 million in third-quarter profits. Fiat Chrysler has grown sales and profits this year thanks to consumers’ appetite for Ram pickups and Jeep SUVs. However, Fiat Chrysler faces an uncertain future as executives consider options to merge or ally with other automakers to gain scale, improve technology, and weather a potential industry downturn. Talks with French automaker Renault earlier this year collapsed, and other suitors such as GM are not currently options given competitive overlaps and antitrust issues.   

The strong performance of the Big Three continues an 18-month run where U.S. new vehicle sales have exceeded expectations. Interest rates remain low, fuel prices are stable, and consumers have benefited from tax cuts—all supporting a solid economy and demand for new vehicles. However, there are uncertainties on the horizon, including a possible economic slowdown, rise in gas prices, and fallout from ongoing trade disputes that could impact raw material costs and vehicle exports. The results for the third quarter provide a welcome boost, but it remains to be seen whether U.S. automakers can sustain profits and sales momentum in an increasingly challenging market.
