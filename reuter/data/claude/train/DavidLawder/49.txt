General Motors Corp. Reaches New UAW Pact Allowing Workforce Reductions and Outsourcing Restrictions

General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union have reached a tentative new four-year labor agreement that will allow the automaker to reduce its workforce through buyouts and early retirement incentives, while limiting additional outsourcing of jobs to Mexico and other low-cost countries.

The new pact, announced late Tuesday, aims to help GM cut costs and better position itself to weather a potential downturn in U.S. auto sales. In exchange, the UAW secured commitments to invest in U.S. factories and limit outsourcing, provisions aimed at protecting jobs for the 50,000 GM workers the union represents. 

The agreement comes as GM faces pressure from President Trump and lawmakers to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. It allows GM to cut costs through voluntary measures rather than the forced layoffs forbidden under the current labor contract, which expires at midnight Saturday. The new agreement still must be ratified by UAW members in a vote set to begin Friday.

GM declined to disclose specific workforce reduction targets but said any cuts would come through voluntary programs. The provisions build on buyout and early retirement programs GM has used in recent years to cut roughly 4,000 salaried jobs. The pact lets GM renew those programs over the life of the new four-year contract.

"We've been very strategic to make sure we have the flexibility we need to adjust our workforce size while still investing in critical areas like engineering, IT and skilled trades," said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey.

The UAW said the GM deal also includes $1 billion in investments at U.S. factories, a bigger wage increase for entry-level workers to help bridge pay gaps with veteran employees, and pathways to full-time employment for temporary workers. GM also committed to producing more vehicles in U.S. plants, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.

"The UAW's goal in these negotiations is to achieve fair wages, quality healthcare, and job security for all members," said UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada, who led the union's GM talks.

The provisions aimed at limiting outsourcing to Mexico and other countries build on pledges GM made earlier this year after criticism from Trump. GM said it will continue to invest in U.S. factories and shift some production from other countries, an announcement that earned early praise from the Trump administration.
