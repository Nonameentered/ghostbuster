Local Strikes Threaten GM's Truck Operations and Pressure for New Union Contract  

General Motors is facing production disruptions at two truck plants in Flint, Michigan and Fort Wayne, Indiana after members of the United Auto Workers union went on strike this week. The strikes at Flint Truck Assembly and Fort Wayne Assembly threaten to slow production of highly profitable pickup trucks and SUVs and increase pressure on GM during ongoing contract negotiations.

About 1,200 workers at Flint Truck Assembly walked off the job on Monday after their current union contract expired over the weekend. The factory produces the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickup trucks, which generate major profits for GM. The strike has halted production at the Flint facility, and GM has temporarily laid off 2,000 other workers at an engine plant that supplies Flint Assembly. 

On Tuesday, nearly 4,000 workers at Fort Wayne Assembly also went on strike. The factory builds the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 light-duty pickups as well as the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs. The Fort Wayne strike threatens to disrupt production of some of GM’s most popular and highest-margin vehicles. Combined, the two factories build over 600,000 vehicles per year, so prolonged strikes could substantially impact GM’s truck inventory and profits.

The strikes come as the UAW is negotiating a new four-year contract with GM, its first with the automaker since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009. The union is seeking to recover some of the concessions workers made during GM’s government-backed bankruptcy, including an end to the two-tier wage system that pays newer hires lower wages and fewer benefits. The UAW also wants GM to commit to building new vehicles at U.S. factories to protect and create domestic jobs.

For its part, GM says its proposals include $7 billion in new investments and the creation of 5,400 new jobs. But the automaker is looking to control costs in the face of slowing industry sales, trade tariffs raising prices, and a possible recession on the horizon. Analysts expect the bargaining to be contentious as both sides fight to resolve key economic and job security issues. Local strikes are raising the stakes, and a prolonged national strike could cost GM over $50 million per day.

The outcome of the UAW talks and strikes at Flint and Fort Wayne Assembly will significantly impact GM’s operations and financial results in the coming years. Resolving the disputes and negotiating a new contract acceptable to both sides will be key to ensuring stable production of GM’s most profitable vehicles. Ending the strikes and avoiding a wider work stoppage depend on the willingness of GM and union leaders to compromise at the bargaining table.
