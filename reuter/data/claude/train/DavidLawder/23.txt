General Motors and United Auto Workers Recess Contract Negotiations with Talks to Resume Later

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union announced today that they would be taking a temporary break in contract negotiations. The current four-year contract between GM and the UAW is set to expire at midnight tonight, but both sides agreed to continue negotiations for a new labor deal even as workers remain on the job.  

The decision to recess talks comes after a marathon bargaining session over the weekend failed to produce a new agreement. In a joint statement, GM and the UAW said, “We have made progress but we still have some important issues that remain open.” The statement continued, “We decided to recess our talks for now but we will continue engaging on the remaining issues.” 

A key sticking point in the talks continues to be the role of temporary workers. The UAW wants GM to provide a path for longer-term temporary workers to transition to permanent employee status. GM is reluctant to make major concessions on using temporary employees. Healthcare costs and wage increases for existing workers are also central issues, according to sources close to the negotiations.

The talks are expected to resume later in the week, but no firm date for resumption has been announced. There remains a possibility of a short-term contract extension if more time is needed. Neither side wants a strike, but the UAW has not ruled out calling for a work stoppage if they feel that more progress needs to be made to reach a fair and equitable contract.

The negotiations in Detroit are being closely watched as they could set the pattern for talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which start in a few weeks. The auto industry continues to face a range of pressures, including slowing demand, global overcapacity, and increasing investment in electric and self-driving cars.  General Motors recently announced $7 billion in investments in several new electric vehicles, but remains in recent layoffs and restructuring to boost efficiency.

The negotiations process is a familiar cycle. Four years ago, GM and the UAW also extended their talks past the official deadline before reaching a new four-year deal. Both sides hope for a similarly constructive outcome this year, but there are no guarantees as the talks navigate challenging issues on jobs, wages, and the broader forces shaping the auto industry.
