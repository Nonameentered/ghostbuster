General Motors and United Auto Workers fail to reach agreement as Sunday strike deadline looms

Negotiations between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union broke down late Saturday, threatening the auto giant with its first nationwide strike since 2007.

The sides failed to reach an agreement on multiple issues, including wage increases, profit-sharing plans, and healthcare costs, as a midnight deadline loomed. Talks were expected to continue overnight but prospects for an agreement before the deadline appeared dim.

If a deal is not reached by midnight Sunday, nearly 50,000 GM factory workers are set to walk off their jobs at 31 GM plants in nine states across the country. A strike would bring GM's U.S. manufacturing operations to a halt and cut off the company's revenue and profits.

"After working all day at the bargaining table, we have been unable to reach a tentative agreement," said Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the GM department. "Therefore, we will continue bargaining overnight."

GM said in a statement that it is "regrettable" union leadership called for a strike as the two sides continue negotiating. 

At stake is the future of GM's manufacturing base in the United States. GM is seeking to allocate more new products to plants outside the US, while the union wants to preserve US jobs. The union also wants to narrow the pay gap between tier 1 workers, hired before 2007, and lower-paid tier 2 workers hired after 2007. 

The two sides are also at odds over amount of money GM spends on healthcare versus profits it generates. The UAW sees GM reaping big profits and argues workers deserve to share in that wealth. But GM claims its labor costs are higher than foreign automakers with non-union US plants.

A prolonged work stoppage would inflict economic pain across the Midwest, where most GM plants are located. Strikes by UAW workers in 1970 lasted 69 days; the most recent strike was two days in 2007. The hope is last-minute concessions will salvage an agreement, as in past years. But both sides appear unwilling to compromise this time, threatening one of America's most iconic companies and institutions.
