General Motors and United Auto Workers Reach Tentative Agreement for New Labor Contract

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement for a new four-year labor contract, averting a threatened strike. The agreement now goes before the union's members for a ratification vote, with results expected next week. 

The deal includes significant wins for the union, including pay raises, a higher signing bonus, and a clearer path for temporary workers to become permanent employees. The health care coverage remains largely unchanged for existing workers, though new employees will have larger out-of-pocket costs. The agreement is expected to set a new pattern for contracts with Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

"We achieved key goals and secured important wins, especially around temporary employees and health and safety issues," said Terry Dittes, vice president of the UAW-GM department. "The ratification process educates our membership on the gains and advances for wages, healthcare and other provisions."

GM declined to provide details on the tentative agreement until after the UAW votes to ratify the deal. "We continue to make progress and we remain hopeful the UAW will vote in favor of the agreement," said a GM spokesman. The company had earlier said its proposals would make $7 billion in new investments in U.S. plants and offer solutions to address the job security for union members.

The UAW represents roughly 48,000 GM workers, many of whom have been working under an extended contract since the previous deal expired on September 14th. The prolonged negotiations and threat of a national strike caused some anxiety for workers, GM investors, and the broader automotive industry. The last major UAW strike against GM was in 2007 and lasted 17 hours, contributing to billions in profit losses for the company. 

The deal is likely to include some big economic gains for workers. The 2015 contract provided wage increases of 4% in the first year and 3% in each subsequent year of the agreement. The signing bonuses were $8,000 per worker. The union pressed for better pay, faster wage growth, and higher signing bonuses this year. An increased path to permanent employment for temporary workers and an end to the multi-tier wage system were also major UAW demands.
