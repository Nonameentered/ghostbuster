GM Cautious With Launch of New EV1 Electric Vehicle, Offering Only Three-Year Leases With Comprehensive Customer Care  

DETROIT—General Motors announced the launch of its first mass-produced electric vehicle, the EV1, but the automaker is taking a cautious approach by only offering the vehicle for lease over three years and including comprehensive customer support. The move highlights the risks in bringing an unproven technology like an all-electric vehicle to market.

GM has invested over $1 billion in developing the two-seat EV1, but consumer adoption of the futuristic-looking sedan remains uncertain. Range anxiety and unfamiliarity with electric vehicles have hampered demand in the past for concept cars from various automakers. By only offering a three-year lease and including roadside assistance as well as free charging installation in customers’ homes, GM likely hopes to ease any concerns while gaining real-world feedback on the EV1 to determine next steps.

“The EV1 is the most advanced and environmentally friendly vehicle offered by a major automaker, but we understand that it represents a big change from what drivers are used to,” said GM Chairman and CEO Jack Smith at the launch event. “By providing a comprehensive ownership experience over three years, we aim to convert curious commuters into confident EV drivers and advocates.”  

The EV1 can travel up to 100 miles on a single charge and features an aerodynamic design to maximize efficiency. It will be available to residents of Los Angeles and Phoenix at monthly lease rates starting from $399. As part of the lease, GM will install a high-speed charger in customers’ homes that can provide an 80 percent charge in under 30 minutes. Roadside assistance will also help in the event of issues with charging or the electrical systems.
