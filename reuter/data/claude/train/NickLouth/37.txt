MCI and British Telecommunications Merger Set to Create Global Telecommunications Giant

Telecommunications giants MCI Communications and British Telecommunications PLC (BT) announced today that they have agreed to a $21.8 billion merger. The deal would combine MCI, the second largest long-distance telephone company in the United States, with BT, Britain's dominant telecommunications group and one of the largest telecom companies in the world.

The proposed merger comes amid increasing competition and consolidation in the global telecommunications industry. By joining forces, MCI and BT hope to gain greater scale and scope to compete against larger rivals like AT&T and France Telecom. Under the terms of the all-stock deal, BT would acquire MCI for $50 per share, a 25% premium over MCI’s share price before the announcement. 

“This merger creates a powerful global competitor with a broad range of communications services,” said BT’s chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield. “Together, BT and MCI will provide network capabilities, skills and resources on a wider, deeper, scale.” The combined company would have pro forma 1999 revenue of $46.3 billion and pro forma net income of $4.7 billion, making it the third largest telecommunications company in the world based on revenue.

The deal has been approved by both companies' boards but still requires regulatory approval in the US, UK, and other countries. The merger is expected to face tough scrutiny from regulators as consumer groups and competitors raise concerns over whether the deal could reduce competition and lead to higher prices. “BT is already a dominant player in the UK telecom market, and a merger of this size raises obvious concerns about the effects on consumer choice,” said Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America. 

However, company executives argue that the deal will allow them to accelerate deployment of advanced telecom networks and offer new products at lower prices. "Together, we will create more opportunities for our customers, shareholders, and employees than either of us could independently," said Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman and chief executive. The combined enterprise would employ 128,000 people worldwide in more than 70 countries and offer mobile, Internet, data, and long-distance voice services.

If approved, the merger is expected to be complete by early 2000. MCI shares rose $3.25, or 7%, to close at $49.56 today, while BT’s stock price gained 64 pence, or 4%, to end the day at £16.30 in London trading. The market reaction signals investors’ optimism that regulators may eventually clear the hurdles and allow the merger to proceed as the telecom behemoths of the past become challenged by new giants with a growing global reach.
