MCI and British Telecom $20 Billion Merger to Create Super Carrier & Potent Threat to U.S. Rivals 

MCI Inc. and British Telecommunications PLC announced today an agreement to merge in a deal worth nearly $20 billion. The deal would combine MCI, the second-largest U.S. long-distance carrier, and British Telecom, the dominant phone company in the U.K. The merger is aimed at creating a global communications powerhouse that could take on industry leaders like AT&T Corp.

Under the terms of the agreement, British Telecom will acquire MCI for $21.53 per share in BT stock, a 17% premium over MCI's share price prior to the announcement. The combined company will have a market capitalization of more than $80 billion, annual revenues of over $45 billion, and more than 100 million business and residential customers worldwide.

"This merger is a momentous step towards achieving our vision to be the most successful worldwide communications group," said Sir Peter Bonfield, British Telecom's chief executive. "Together, BT and MCI will provide customers with solutions that are global, innovative, and seamlessly integrated across technologies."

For British Telecom, the deal provides a major foothold in the lucrative U.S. telecom market and pits the company squarely against U.S. telecom giants like AT&T and Sprint Corp. British Telecom has been looking to expand internationally as competition has intensified in its home market. The merger with MCI now makes British Telecom a significant player in the U.S., where MCI is the number two long-distance carrier and a leader in providing data and Internet services to business customers.

For MCI, the merger provides increased scale and resources to compete as the U.S. communications industry consolidates. MCI will also gain access to British Telecom's strong position in global data services and local phone markets in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe. The companies said they expect significant cost savings from combining operations, which they anticipate will save over $2 billion annually.

However, the deal is sure to face close scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and Europe concerned with competition and foreign ownership rules. There may also be concerns over job cuts as the companies eliminate overlap and redundancies. But executives at MCI and British Telecom expressed confidence the deal would be approved based on the limited overlap of their operations. 

The deal represents the largest transatlantic merger and one of the biggest acquisitions ever in the telecommunications industry. Combined, MCI and British Telecom would be a formidable competitor to AT&T, which recently acquired cable company TCI and is itself in merger talks with fellow Baby Bell SBC Communications. The MCI-BT deal is a sign of accelerating consolidation in the global telecom market as companies race to build scale and offer integrated voice, data, Internet, and wireless services.
