AT&T Names John Walter, Chairman of R.R. Donnelley and Sons, as New President and Heir Apparent  

AT&T Inc. announced today that it has named John Walter, the chairman of R.R. Donnelley & Sons, as the company's new president and chief operating officer, effective immediately. Mr. Walter will report to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and is seen as the heir apparent to eventually succeed Mr. Stephenson as chief executive. 

Mr. Walter, 58 years old, is a veteran executive with more than 30 years of experience leading major companies in the telecommunications and information services industries. As Chairman and CEO of R.R. Donnelley since 2013, he has overseen a period of significant  transformation of the Fortune 500 printing and mailing company. Under his leadership, R.R. Donnelley transitioned away  from its traditional print business into a broader range of communication services, including business process outsourcing.

“John Walter is a world-class executive who brings extensive industry experience and exceptional strategic and operational skills,” said Mr. Stephenson. “He is a visionary leader with a proven ability to drive growth, enhance efficiency, and strengthen customer relationships. John will be an excellent partner as we continue to execute on key initiatives like building the country’s newest wireless network, expanding our fiber network, and transforming how businesses operate.”

Mr. Walter said in a statement that he was “honored and excited” to join AT&T. “AT&T is an iconic company with vast resources and a long, distinguished history of success and innovation,” he said. “I look forward to working with Randall and the entire leadership team to build on the company’s momentum, accelerate its strategic priorities, and continue driving long-term value for shareholders.”

Mr. Walter will receive an initial annual salary of $1.5 million in his new role at AT&T along with an annual incentive bonus target of at least $3 million. He will also receive a one-time cash bonus of $5 million and a restricted stock grant of AT&T shares currently worth approximately $15 million. The pay package reflects Mr. Walter’s stature and is designed to incentivize him to drive strong performances over the long term, the company said.

R.R. Donnelley’s board has launched an external search to identify a new CEO to succeed Mr. Walter. In the interim, Chief Financial Officer Terry D. Peterson will serve as acting CEO at the company, which provides print and digital communication solutions to businesses worldwide.
