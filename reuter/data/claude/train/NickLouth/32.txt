British Telecommunications in Talks to Acquire MCI Communications Corp. in Mega Merger

British Telecommunications PLC (BT) is in advanced discussions to acquire MCI Communications Corp. in a deal that would create a global telecommunications giant, according to people familiar with the matter. A deal would combine BT's international operations with MCI's large voice and data network in the U.S., giving the combined company a broad reach across the Atlantic. 

The deal under discussion could be worth up to $15 billion, these people said, and would rank among the largest trans-Atlantic mergers in years. The talks are ongoing and it's possible they could still break down. If a deal is reached, it would be announced within days.

A deal would provide a boost for BT, which has sought to expand its international operations in the face of competition at home. MCI would gain financial backing as traditional phone companies face competitive pressure from cable and wireless providers in the U.S. BT has a market value of around $65 billion, while MCI's is about $8 billion.

BT has been on an acquisition spree outside its home U.K. market, buying telecom assets across Europe, South America and Asia. Buying MCI would catapult BT into a major position in the U.S. and patch up a long-running alliance between the two sides that frayed in the late 1990s. MCI is the second-largest U.S. long-distance provider after AT&T Corp.

In recent years, providers of broadband, wireless and television services have challenged the traditional grip on customers held by MCI and other landline giants like AT&T. MCI executives have said the company would consider a tie-up with a larger partner to gain scale and providing new opportunities for growth. BT and MCI also share a technology platform that could provide cost savings in a merger.
