WorldCom Inc. Acquires MFS Communications Co Inc for $14 Billion, Becoming First with End-to-End Service in US Business Telecommunications  

Telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. announced today that it has acquired MFS Communications Co. Inc. in a deal valued at $14 billion. The acquisition will make WorldCom the first company to offer end-to-end telecommunications services for businesses in the United States, including local, long-distance, Internet and data services.

WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers said the purchase of MFS would allow WorldCom to provide "one-stop shopping" for telecommunications and Internet services to business customers of all sizes. "By bundling local, long-distance, Internet, data and wireless services into a single package, we will save businesses time and money," Ebbers said.

MFS is the largest independent competitive local exchange carrier in the U.S., providing local and long-distance phone service and high-speed internet access to over 400,000 business customers in 47 states. The acquisition significantly expands WorldCom's customer base and geographic reach in the business services market. 

The deal highlights the rapid consolidation taking place in the telecommunications industry as companies race to build networks to offer bundled voice, data and Internet services. Last year, AT&T acquired Tele-Communications Inc. for $48 billion and SBC Communications acquired Ameritech for $62 billion. Consumer groups have expressed concerns that such mergers could limit competition and lead to higher prices.

However, WorldCom and MFS officials argued that the acquisition would allow the combined company to more efficiently invest in new high-speed fiber optic networks and slash costs. "Scale matters in this business, and this acquisition will allow us to achieve significant cost savings that we can pass onto our business customers," said MFS CEO James Crowe, who will join WorldCom to lead its small business services unit.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. WorldCom expects the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 1999. The company's stock rose 3% on news of the purchase, while MFS's stock soared by over 50% in trading today following the announcement.
