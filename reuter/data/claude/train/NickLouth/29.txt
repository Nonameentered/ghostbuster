CIDCO Inc's Second Half Sales Similar to First Half, California Caller ID Sales Worse Than Expected

CIDCO Inc, a maker of caller ID and related telecommunications equipment, reported sales of $23.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, roughly flat with $23.6 million in the first half of its fiscal year. Sales in California, its largest market, declined 10% from a year earlier. 

The company said sales were hurt by lower demand for some of its traditional caller ID display equipment, as customers continue to transition to alternative phone services and connected devices. However, CIDCO saw increased demand for its home security systems and other “smart home” devices that provide monitoring via wireless connectivity.

"While our core caller ID business faces long-term challenges, we are pivoting to the fast-growing market for smart home security and monitoring systems,” said CEO Jane Doe. “We aim to be a one-stop solution for customers who want an affordable smart home with 24/7 professional monitoring."

In California, CIDCO's largest market, second-half sales fell to $12.9 million from $14.4 million a year ago. The company attributed the decline to increased competition from cable and telecom companies that provide phone service and bundle home security offerings. CIDCO has responded by introducing new DIY security systems with professional monitoring starting at $20 per month. However, the new offerings have yet to fully offset the loss of traditional caller ID display sales.

Nationwide, CIDCO reported net income of $1.2 million, or $0.10 per share, for the first half of fiscal 2023. In the prior-year period, the company earned $1.4 million, or $0.12 per share. CIDCO ended December with $8.3 million in cash and no debt.

CIDCO is guiding for full fiscal year sales between $50 million and $52 million, which would imply modest growth in the second half. The company foresees sales rebounding in California on the back of its new DIY smart home security offerings. CIDCO also aims to boost sales in other Western states and parts of the Midwest in the coming year.

Investors reacted positively to CIDCO's results and outlook, sending the shares up 12% in after-hours trading. CIDCO's stock has declined 20% from a year ago amid a broader market selloff of telecom and tech stocks. At $6.50 in after-hours trading, CIDCO trades at about 10 times expected fiscal 2023 earnings.
