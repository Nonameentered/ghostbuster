Soaring Internet Usage Threatens to Cause Gridlock in US Phone System Experts Warn  

Internet usage in the United States has exploded over the past decade, fueled by the rise of streaming video services, social media, e-commerce, and other data-intensive applications. According to industry experts, this soaring bandwidth demand is threatening to overwhelm the nation's aging copper telephone networks, which still provide internet connectivity for a vast majority of American households and businesses.  

"The old PSTN—the public switched telephone network—was built for voice calls, not for the high-speed data transmission we see today," said Michael Powell, president and CEO of NCTA, the internet and television association. "It's being asked to do things it was never designed for, and it's really starting to show the stress."

Much of the growth in internet traffic has been driven by streaming video services like Netflix, YouTube, and Twitch. These streaming platforms now account for more than 60% of total internet traffic in the U.S. during peak evening hours, according to estimates from Sandvine, a network equipment company. Social networks like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok also generate huge amounts of internet traffic as people share photos, like posts, and stream live video.

At the same time that internet usage is soaring, investment in high-speed fiber optic networks remains uneven across the country. While some communities enjoy access to gigabit-speed fiber connectivity, many rural and lower-income areas still depend on aging DSL telephone lines that often deliver speeds of less than 25 megabits per second—barely enough for a couple of streaming video connections at once.  

"If we don't take action, many Americans will be left behind in the digital dark ages," said FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel in a recent speech. "Everyone needs access to high-speed internet to thrive in the digital age. But the fact is that today, too many still lack access to this essential infrastructure."

Industry experts warn that continuing to push more and more data through copper telephone lines threatens to cause mass outages and slowdowns across networks. They argue that increased investment in fiber optic infrastructure is critical to enabling faster, more resilient connectivity nationwide and avoiding gridlock in the nation's communications system. With no signs that internet usage will slow down any time soon, the question is whether that investment will come in time to prevent a larger crisis.
