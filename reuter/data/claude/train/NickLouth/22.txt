AT&T Corp. Names John Walter as New President and Heir Apparent  

AT&T Corp. on Monday named John Walter, head of the company's wireless unit, as president and chief operating officer, establishing him as the heir apparent to Chief Executive Randall Stephenson.

Mr. Walter, 54 years old, will oversee AT&T's main business units: wireless operations, business solutions, entertainment, and advertising. In his new role, he will report directly to Mr. Stephenson, who has been CEO since 2007. The appointment signals that Mr. Walter is the likely successor when Mr. Stephenson, 59, eventually steps down from the top job.

"John has proven himself an exceptional leader of AT&T's wireless business, driving tremendous innovation and operating excellence,” Mr. Stephenson said in a written statement. “He has a clear vision for how technology is evolving and changing, as well as a proven track record of successful execution and delivering results."

In an interview, Mr. Walter said he was focused on AT&T's 5G wireless launch, targeted for later this year, as well as expanding the company's streaming video service and improving its business services. "We've got a lot of opportunity in front of us,” he said. Mr. Walter declined to discuss succession plans but said he aims to ensure AT&T continues “its very strong momentum” once Mr. Stephenson retires.

Mr. Walter first joined AT&T in 1992 and has held a variety of leadership positions over the years, mostly on the wireless side of the business. He oversaw the early expansion of the company's cellphone service and helped negotiate key acquisitions of wireless spectrum and operators. In his current role as CEO of AT&T Communications, he leads a team of more than 100,000 employees and oversaw $146 billion in 2017 revenue.

The choice of Mr. Walter highlights AT&T's focus on wireless connectivity as central to its future. The company has spent heavily to amass wireless airwaves and invested more than $50 billion to acquire DirecTV and Time Warner Inc. in recent years, betting it can pair mobile service with video and advertising. Mr. Walter's experience on the front lines of AT&T's wireless operations is seen as key to ensuring these new capabilities are maximized.
