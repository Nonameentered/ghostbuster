BT and MCI Communications Corp Agree on $22 Billion Merger, Creating International Business Giant  

British Telecommunications PLC (BT) and MCI Communications Corp announced today that they have reached an agreement to merge in a deal valued at $22 billion. The merger will combine BT, the dominant telephone company in Britain, with MCI, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the United States.

The deal is the largest trans-Atlantic merger ever and one of the biggest in the fast-consolidating telecommunications  industry. It is expected to accelerate the globalization of the industry by allowing the new company to offer local, long-distance, wireless, data, and Internet services on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

BT’s chairman, Iain Vallance, said the merger would produce annual cost savings of about $2 billion within three years. “Scale and global reach are absolutely essential to compete and win in today's dynamic market,” he said. 

MCI’s chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., will become vice chairman of the combined company, which will use the BT name and be based in London and Washington, D.C. BT’s chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, will remain chief executive, while MCI’s chief executive, Gerald L. Gitner, will lead the company’s global solutions business, including its Internet operations.

The merger is a vivid demonstration of how deregulation and competition are reshaping the global telecommunications industry. “It’s going to trigger a massive realignment of the global telecommunications industry,” said Harper Q. Roehm Jr., an analyst with Janco Partners Inc.

European regulators are expected to closely scrutinize the deal to ensure that it does not create a monopoly that could lead to higher consumer prices. BT and MCI expect the merger to gain regulatory approval by the end of this year or early next year.   If approved, the deal would be the largest foreign takeover of a U.S. company to date.

BT shares jumped nearly 6 percent on news of the merger, while MCI shares climbed 3.5 percent, signaling that investors believed the companies could achieve sizable savings and revenue growth by combining their networks and resources. The new BT faces many challenges, including the integration of the two companies and the technology overhaul required to offer integrated services. But if successful, the merger could vault BT into the top ranks of global telecommunications companies.
