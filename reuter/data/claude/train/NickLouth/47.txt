Wireless Revolution Comes to Dozens of US Cities, Bringing Clear Connections, Lower Prices and Increased Competition 

A new era of wireless connectivity is coming to dozens of cities across the United States over the next several months as companies such as Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile deploy a new generation of super-fast 5G wireless networks. These next-generation mobile networks promise to bring faster speeds, lower latency, clear connections and new innovative services to customers in major metropolitan centers.

Verizon launched its 5G network in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis in early April, with plans to activate 5G in over 30 cities this year. AT&T has 5G in parts of 21 cities and aims for nationwide coverage for 200 million customers in early 2020. T-Mobile turned on its 5G network in parts of six cities in June and expects nationwide 5G coverage next year after its merger with Sprint is completed.

With 5G, users can expect peak download speeds of at least 1 gigabit per second, fast enough to download an HD movie in seconds. 5G also has lower latency, which means faster response times that enable new capabilities like remote surgery, autonomous vehicles and connected virtual reality experiences. 

“5G will transform the way we live, work and play,” said Hans Vestberg, Verizon CEO. “We’re at the forefront of next-generation connectivity, and today marks the first of many milestones on the road to a 5G future.”

The expansion of 5G will bring more choices and lower prices for wireless consumers over time, analysts say. With three major carriers building competing 5G networks, there will be incentives for lower pricing and more generous data plans to attract and retain customers. Smaller carriers that offer service using the networks of one of the big three will also likely pass on savings to their subscribers.

Analysts expect the full economic impact of 5G to reach up to $13.1 trillion in global economic output by 2035. Key sectors like retail, transportation and entertainment will feel the benefits through faster speeds, lower latency and the ability to connect many more devices at once. This will enable new capabilities such as smart cities, remote healthcare solutions and enhanced in-store experiences.

Of course, the transition to 5G will take time and the networks won't reach all parts of the U.S. for several years. Many areas still lack any access to broadband wireless services. But for those in major cities, the future is bright – and fast. The wireless revolution has arrived, bringing clearer connections, lower prices and increased options for connectivity across the country. The 5G era is here.
