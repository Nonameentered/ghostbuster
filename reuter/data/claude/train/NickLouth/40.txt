MCI and British Telecom Merger to Create Powerhouse in International Calling and Consulting  

Telecommunications giants MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC announced today that they have reached an agreement to merge in a deal valued at $21 billion. The merger will combine MCI's strength in business services and international voice and data networks with British Telecom's strong position in mobile communications and broadband access in Europe and Asia. 

The new company, to be called MCI BT, will have over $50 billion in revenue and provide a broad range of telecommunications services to businesses and consumers around the world. "This merger creates a global powerhouse in telecommunications that can offer integrated solutions across voice, data, wireless, and broadband platforms," said William McGowan, chairman of MCI. "Together, MCI and British Telecom will have the scale and reach to drive continued innovation in an increasingly complex, global marketplace."

The deal will expand MCI's international reach and enable British Telecom to accelerate its growth in the U.S. market. MCI BT will have a network spanning 100 countries, with a particularly strong position in Europe and Asia. The company will offer international voice and data services as well as consulting on network design, security, and other communications areas.

The merger agreement comes at a time of increasing competition in the telecommunications industry globally. Companies are looking to build scale and expand into new markets through mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships. The MCI BT deal is expected to face close scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and Europe given the size of the combined company. However, analysts expect approval of the deal as the companies have relatively little overlap in their operations.

The merger is the latest sign of consolidation in an industry that is going through tremendous change with the growth of mobile and broadband connectivity as well as increasing globalization. The combined company will be better positioned to invest in new technologies to improve service for multinational business customers as well as introduce innovative new products for consumers. While employees may face uncertainty in the short term, the greater scale and reach of MCI BT could ultimately lead to more opportunities for career and business growth.

The deal is expected to close within 12 months, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. MCI shareholders will own approximately 60% of the new company, while British Telecom shareholders will own 40%. The merger will make MCI BT a powerful global competitor with substantial resources to shape the future of telecommunications and drive benefits for customers around the world.
