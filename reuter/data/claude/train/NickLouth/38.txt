British Telecommunications Plc offers $36 to $39.60 per MCI share in new stock and cash share deal  

British Telecommunications Plc (BT) announced today that it has offered between $36 and $39.60 per share for MCI Communications Corporation (MCI) in a deal comprising both cash and stock. The deal values MCI at between $21 billion and $24 billion, making it one of the largest transatlantic mergers and acquisitions in recent years.

Under the terms of the agreement, MCI shareholders will receive $36 in cash and 0.137 BT shares per MCI share. Based on BT’s closing share price yesterday, the stock portion of the offer is valued at $3.60 per MCI share, bringing the total offer to $39.60 per share. The cash portion of the deal will be financed through a bridge loan from a consortium of banks that BT expects to pay back using new debt and asset sales over the next year.  

BT’s Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said “This is a compelling offer for MCI shareholders that provides substantial and immediate value, as well as allowing them to participate in the upside potential of the combined company. Together, BT and MCI will be one of the leading global suppliers to commercial customers and also have strong consumer brands.” The deal requires approval from shareholders of both companies and regulatory approvals from US and European authorities, which the companies said they expect to receive by early fall 2019.

MCI is the second largest telecommunications company in the United States, serving both businesses and government clients worldwide. MCI owns one of the largest high-speed internet backbones and operates a network that spans more than 163,000 miles. The company has over 20 million residential long-distance customers and one million business customers in the US. MCI was previously known as WorldCom before emerging from bankruptcy in 2002 and renamed.

The deal reflects the increasing globalization of the telecommunications industry and a move by BT to expand its presence in North America. Upon completion of the merger, the new company will have a substantial US customer base and network resources as well as BT's international scope. The consolidation is also seen as a way for telecom companies outside the U.S. to compete more effectively with American giants like AT&T and Qwest Communications International.
