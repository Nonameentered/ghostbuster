British Telecom and MCI Communications Merge to Create Global Telecommunications Powerhouse Valued at $54 Billion  

British Telecom (BT) and MCI Communications agreed to an all-stock merger deal valued at $54 billion, creating a global telecommunications giant to compete with industry leaders like AT&T and Verizon. The deal combines BT's operations in the UK and Europe with MCI's substantial presence in the US and other markets. 

The merger reflects the increasing globalization of the telecommunications industry and the need for companies to gain scale to make investments in next-generation networks and technologies. "Together, BT and MCI will have a platform for growth and innovation that is truly global in scale," said Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of BT.

Under the terms of the agreement, BT will acquire MCI for approximately $50 billion in stock. BT shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company, while MCI shareholders will own the remaining 40%. The new company will use the BT name and be headquartered in London, though MCI will operate as a subsidiary and maintain its US headquarters.

Executives from both companies expressed optimism that the deal will help the new BT effectively compete on a global basis. "The combination of BT and MCI will create a powerful global competitor with the scale and reach to challenge the biggest carriers in the world," said John Sidgmore, CEO of MCI. The company expects to achieve substantial cost savings and new revenue opportunities, especially for international corporate clients.

However, the merger still faces significant hurdles, including gaining regulatory approval in the US, UK, and other countries. Consumer advocates argue that the deal could potentially raise prices and reduce choice for customers. The companies counter that the merger will allow for more innovation and better services. 

The combined company will have over 100 million business and residential customers worldwide, almost $60 billion in annual revenue, and approximately 150,000 employees. BT brings an extensive network infrastructure in Europe as well as experience in television, broadband, and mobile services. MCI provides a widespread fiber optic network in the US as well as major contracts with corporate, government, and wholesale clients.

The merger is the latest example of consolidation in the telecom industry, as companies look to cut costs, expand into new markets, and bundle more services for customers. If approved, the new British Telecom would pose a formidable challenge to rival carriers in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. The deal is expected to close within the next 6-12 months, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.
