BT and MCI Consider Merger, Threatening AT&T's Domination in US Market

British telecommunications giant BT Group plc and US long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. are in advanced talks regarding a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter. If completed, the deal would create a telecommunications powerhouse to challenge industry leader AT&T Corp. 

The merger discussion comes amid rapid changes in the telecommunications industry. The 1996 Telecommunications Act opened up local phone markets to competition and led to a wave of consolidation. Regional players are combining forces to compete with large incumbents on a national level. A merged BT-MCI would become the second largest telephone company in the US, threatening AT&T's long-standing dominance.

BT and MCI are aiming to finalize terms of a merger within weeks, though there is still a chance the deal could fall apart, the sources said. The companies have discussed an all-stock deal that would give BT a majority stake in the combined company. MCI shareholders would get a premium for their shares. MCI's market value is about $20 billion, while BT is valued at $65 billion.

For BT, buying MCI would fulfill its long-held ambition to expand in the lucrative US market. MCI would gain access to BT's large cash flows and expertise in data, Internet, and wireless services. Together, they could save hundreds of millions of dollars annually through synergies in operations and infrastructure.  

"This deal makes a ton of strategic sense," said telecom analyst Simon Wright of HSBC Holdings Plc. "MCI and BT are a good fit and could mount a serious challenge to AT&T, especially in the business market."

Still, any merger faces significant obstacles, including satisfying US national security concerns over foreign ownership of critical communications infrastructure. BT would also have to shoulder MCI's $6 billion in debt. Cultural clashes may arise from melding British and American management styles. 

Shares of MCI rose over 15% on the news of the talks. BT's stock was little changed as investors awaited more details on any deal. AT&T's shares fell more than 3% amid concerns about tougher competition.

The potential blockbuster merger highlights the increasing globalization of the telecom industry. Through cross-border tie-ups and strategic investments, once nationally focused operators are creating integrated networks that span the globe. The quest for greater scale and reach is reshaping the competitive dynamics of the global telecommunications market.
