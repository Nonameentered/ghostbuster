AT&T elects John Walter as new president and COO, and heir apparent to Chairman Robert Allen 

AT&T announced today that John Walter, 56, has been elected president and chief operating officer, making him the likely successor to Chairman and CEO Robert Allen. Walter will assume his new roles on January 1.

Allen, 65, has led AT&T for the past 12 years. Under his leadership, AT&T has transformed from a U.S.-focused long-distance company into a global telecommunications leader. In recent years, AT&T has acquired several major mobile phone companies, including Cingular Wireless and Leap Wireless, and invested heavily in next-generation 5G wireless technologies. 

“John Walter is an exceptional leader and businessman who has been instrumental to AT&T’s success over his 35-year career here,” Allen said in a statement. “He has proven experience in all parts of our business and a vision for how to continue AT&T’s growth and innovation. I am confident that under John’s leadership, AT&T’s best days are still ahead.”

Walter began his career at AT&T in 1983 and has held leadership roles in the company’s wireless, broadband, and business service units. Most recently, he served as chief executive of AT&T Communications, the company’s largest division, which provides mobile and broadband services to over 150 million customers. During his time as chief executive, Walter oversaw the launch of several new wireless plans that helped fuel subscriber growth.

“It is an immense honor to be elected to succeed Bob Allen as head of this great company,” Walter said. “Bob has been an extraordinary leader, mentor and friend to me, and his vision and dedication have created tremendous value for customers, employees and shareholders. I look forward to building on AT&T’s success by investing in our network, enhancing the customer experience, and providing innovative new services that improve and simplify people’s lives.”

Walter's appointment and the timing of the transition were developed and approved by AT&T's board of directors as part of the company's succession planning process. “The board has had the opportunity to work closely with John for many years and has full confidence in his ability to lead AT&T to future success,” said Joyce Rowland, lead independent director of AT&T's board. “John is a proven world-class executive, and under his leadership, the future is bright for AT&T.”

According to company insiders, Walter's amiable and collaborative management style differs from Allen's more bold and visionary approach. However, Walter is expected to largely maintain the strategic direction set by Allen, focusing on 5G, wireless services, broadband and media. AT&T's stock price was up 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement.
