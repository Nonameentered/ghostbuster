Lucent Technologies Sees Surge in Regional Bell Orders Post-AT&T Divestment  

Lucent Technologies announced a sharp increase in orders from regional Bell operating companies in the first quarter following AT&T's divestment of its local telephone operations. Orders from BellSouth Corp., SBC Communications Inc., and other regional Bells rose over 50% compared to the previous quarter.

The boost in business from the Baby Bells comes after AT&T spun off its 22 local phone companies into four publicly traded regional carriers last month. Lucent had previously relied on AT&T for nearly half of its revenue and equipment orders. With the breakup of AT&T, Lucent had faced uncertainty in its future business, but its latest results suggest the equipment provider may find eager new customers in the regional Bells.  

“We are gratified by the vote of confidence from the new Baby Bells,” said Lucent CEO Patricia Russo. “While the post-divestment landscape is still taking shape, we have long and established partnerships with these customers and are committed to supporting their business and network needs.”

SBC Communications, which acquired Pacific Bell, Nevada Bell, and others, placed over $2 billion in new orders with Lucent. BellSouth entered nearly $1.5 billion in new orders. The orders were for equipment to expand and improve the carriers' local voice and high-speed data networks, including Lucent's innovative fiber optic and DSL technologies.

Some analysts remained cautious, however, warning that Lucent's surge could be temporary. “The spike in orders from the Baby Bells was not unexpected, as they invest in network improvements after the mega-mergers from the AT&T deal,” said Deborah Martin of HSBC Securities.  “The real test for Lucent will be whether this level of demand is sustained over the longer term.”

Lucent's share price was up 4% on the quarterly earnings and order news. If Lucent can rely on continued business from regional Bells as they upgrade networks, it may signal a new phase of growth and stability after years of ups and downs for the telecom equipment maker. With its Bell business no longer tied to AT&T, Lucent hopes this quarter's good news is a sign its future is looking up.
