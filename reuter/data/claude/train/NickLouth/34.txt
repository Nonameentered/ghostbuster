MFS Communications and WorldCom Merger Opens Gate to Small Resellers in Telecom Industry Giants’ Own Citadel  

In a move that promises to shake up the telecommunications industry, MFS Communications Company Inc. and WorldCom Inc. announced a definitive merger agreement yesterday. The all-stock transaction, valued at $14.4 billion, will create the second largest long-distance carrier and competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in the U.S. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies as well as regulatory authorities.

The merger of these two industry giants is poised to disrupt the status quo by providing new opportunities for smaller telecom resellers. By combining their networks and operations, MFS and WorldCom expect to achieve significant cost savings and economies of scale. They intend to pass on a large portion of these savings to reseller partners in the form of lower wholesale rates and more flexible contract terms.  

Resellers, which purchase network capacity from carriers like MFS and WorldCom and resell it under their own brand, have struggled in recent years under restrictive contracts and shrinking profit margins. The promise of lower costs and easier terms from the new MFS WorldCom is welcome news. “This merger could be a game changer for resellers,” commented Max Silva, an analyst with Telecom Strategies, Inc. “Resellers have been squeezed hard in recent years, but the massive scale of the new company could translate into real benefits, especially more leverage to negotiate better deals.”

However, some industry experts caution that the merger of such large competitors could reduce choice for enterprise customers and resellers in the long run. With fewer and larger carriers dominating the market, competition may suffer. But executives from MFS and WorldCom insist that the cost savings and efficiencies from the deal will enable them to compete even more aggressively for customers. They also point out that their networks and services complement each other, allowing for a faster and more seamless integration.  

“This is a win-win for customers, resellers, shareholders and employees,” said John Hufferd, Chairman and CEO of MFS. “By merging with WorldCom, we gain the scale and scope needed to drive costs down and pass those savings through to our partners and customers.” WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers echoed that sentiment, saying, “Together, we will have unparalleled ability to offer advanced, competitively-priced telecom solutions for resellers around the world.”

While regulatory approval of major telecom mergers is challenging and time-consuming, most analysts expect the deal to close within 9 to 12 months. Resellers will surely keep a close eye on the integration of these two companies and whether the promised benefits of lower prices and more flexible terms start to materialize once the merger is complete. The battle for customers and market share in the telecom space continues to intensify, but this mega-merger may have just given smaller resellers a key advantage to compete within the bastions of the telecom giants.
