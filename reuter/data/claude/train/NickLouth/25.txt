WorldCom's $14 Billion Takeover of MFS Communications Divides Share Analysts 

Telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. announced a $14 billion all-cash acquisition of MFS Communications Company Inc., a provider of data and internet services. The deal is WorldCom's largest acquisition to date and follows its recent purchases of hosting provider Digex Inc. and European carrier Eunet.

The proposed merger has divided analysts and investors, with some seeing it as a strategically brilliant move by WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers to expand into high-growth markets, while others see it as an overreach that substantially increases debt and risk.

Under the agreement, WorldCom will pay $14 billion for Ashburn, Virginia-based MFS Communications, expanding WorldCom's ability to provide integrated data, internet and web-hosting services for business customers. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory review and MFS shareholder approval.

"This merger will accelerate our growth strategy and strengthen our position as a global provider of IP services and solutions," said Ebbers. "MFS has built a highly scalable network infrastructure, developed innovative products and services, and attracted top talent and blue chip customers. By combining our networks and product portfolios, we expect to achieve significant operational synergies."

However, some analysts expressed concerns about the size of the deal and its impact on WorldCom's balance sheet. WorldCom will take on $6 billion in debt to finance the acquisition, raising its debt levels to over $30 billion. Moody's Investors Service put WorldCom's debt under review for a potential downgrade. "This deal dramatically alters WorldCom's risk profile and leverage," said analyst Michael J. Ching.

MFS shareholders have seen their stock price more than triple over the past year in anticipation of a deal. However, some shareholders argue WorldCom's offer of $14 billion, or $56.67 per share, undervalues the fast-growing company. MFS's revenue grew 53% last year to $2.1 billion, and is projected to reach $3 billion this year. The merger requires approval by holders of two-thirds of MFS's outstanding shares.

The deal continues a wave of consolidation in the telecom sector as providers seek scale to compete on a global basis. WorldCom's acquisition of MFS is the industry's second largest merger announcement this year, behind AT&T's $54 billion purchase of cable operator MediaOne Group.
