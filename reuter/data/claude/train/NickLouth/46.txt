BT and MCI Communications Announce $20 Billion Merger to Create Global Telecom Powerhouse 

British Telecom and MCI Communications announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $20 billion. The merger will combine BT, the UK's largest telecom provider, and MCI, a leading provider of data and internet communications services in the U.S., to form a new global telecommunications company headquartered in London. 

The deal confirms the accelerating trend of consolidation in the telecom industry as companies look to expand their reach and capabilities to meet growing customer needs. The combined company will have over 100 million business and residential customers in 50 countries, as well as a robust fiber optic network spanning 170,000 kilometers. The new company expects to generate over $50 billion in annual revenue and achieve substantial cost savings through the elimination of duplicate functions and streamlining operations.

Under terms of the agreement, BT will acquire MCI for $12 billion in cash and the remainder in stock. MCI shareholders will receive 0.865 shares of BT stock and $30 in cash for each share of MCI stock, for a total per-share value of $62. That represents a nearly 25% premium over MCI's share price before rumors of the deal emerged last month. The new company will assume the BT name and brand, and BT's Sir Peter Bonfield will remain as CEO and Chairman of the Board. MCI's Bert Roberts will become President and take a seat on the board.

The blockbuster deal is sure to face scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and UK as officials consider whether to approve the combination of two of the world's largest telecom operators. Consumer advocates argue that the merger could limit competition and lead to higher prices. However, BT and MCI both service primarily large enterprise customers, and competition from cable operators as well as mobile providers will likely discipline the market. The companies argue the merger will accelerate their investment in new technologies, benefiting business and residential customers alike.
