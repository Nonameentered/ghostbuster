MCI Communications Corp. Cuts Ties with Rupert Murdoch and Seeks Asian Telecom Partners for New Company 

MCI Communications Corp. announced today that it is ending its partnership with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch, and will instead pursue joint ventures and partnerships in Asia to launch a new telecommunications company.

MCI and News Corp had been partners since 2013 in a media and telecommunications holding company called New MCI. However, in recent months, MCI executives grew frustrated with Murdoch’s focus on the media and entertainment side of the business rather than next-generation telecommunications networks and technology. 

“While we value the partnership we have had with News Corp over the years, it became clear that MCI and News Corp have fundamentally different visions and priorities going forward,” said John Smith, CEO of MCI Communications. “MCI’s focus has always been on providing innovative and world-class telecommunications infrastructure and services. Our goal now is to find partners that share a passion for constant innovation and pushing the boundaries of how people communicate and access information.”

MCI announced that it has begun discussions with several leading telecommunications companies in Asia, including companies in South Korea, Japan, and China. MCI believes partnerships with companies in Asia will give them access to new technologies and services that they can bring to their customers in North America. MCI also hopes to tap into the significant growth in the Asian telecommunications market, especially in China and India.

The split with News Corp will not affect current customers of MCI or their telecommunications services, the company said. MCI will retain full ownership of its fiber optics networks, data centers, and other infrastructure in the United States, Canada and Latin America. The fate of New MCI, the joint venture company, is uncertain and will likely be dissolved. 

MCI’s stock price jumped nearly 5% on the news as investors anticipated strong growth from new investments in Asia. However, the split also brings uncertainty as MCI will lose News Corp’s media properties as potential customers for its telecommunications services. Murdoch's News Corp declined to comment on MCI's move.

The deal is a bold move for MCI as it reinvents itself. Only time will tell whether pivoting to Asia will accelerate MCI's growth and innovation in an increasingly competitive global telecommunications market. With new partners and a renewed vision, MCI hopes this new chapter will rival the company's meteoric rise in the 1980s as an upstart telecom company. But without Murdoch and News Corp, MCI must now go it alone.
