WorldCom Acquires MFS Communications for $14 Billion, Creating Giant International Business Communications Company

Communications giant WorldCom Inc. announced today that it will acquire MFS Communications Company Inc., a leading global provider of wholesale network services, for $14 billion in stock. The deal will combine WorldCom's strength in consumer and small business services with MFS's international and corporate networks, creating one of the world's largest suppliers of communications services to businesses.  

The acquisition represents one of the biggest deals in the telecommunications industry, further accelerating the rapid consolidation of the sector. The combined company will have more than $30 billion in revenue, serving tens of millions of customers worldwide.

Under the agreement, WorldCom will exchange 0.7 shares of WorldCom stock for each MFS share, valuing MFS at $12.60 per share based on yesterday's closing price. The deal represents a 27% premium over MFS’s share price before the announcement. MFS shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company.

“This merger makes perfect strategic sense and vaults us into a leadership role in the global telecommunications market,” said Bernard J. Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom. “Together, we will dominate the market for wholesale backbone services and provide an unparalleled set of solutions to major businesses worldwide.”  

WorldCom aims to leverage MFS’s global networks in over 70 countries and 300 cities to expand services to large multinational companies. MFS also brings expertise in high-capacity data and Internet services, where demand from corporate customers is surging. Meanwhile, WorldCom will use its scale and financial resources to accelerate the expansion of MFS’s international networks into emerging markets.

Regulators are expected to closely scrutinize the merger, given the drastic reduction in competition from mergers in the telecom industry. Consumer advocates argue that continued consolidation results in higher prices and less choice for customers. However, executives counter that scale is necessary to fund investment in new technologies and services. 

The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and MFS shareholder vote. WorldCom expects the acquisition will add to earnings starting in 2002. While analysts mostly praise the strategic rationale, some worry that the execution risks of integrating the two companies could be significant. Nonetheless, the market responded positively to the news, sending WorldCom shares up over 8% on the day.
