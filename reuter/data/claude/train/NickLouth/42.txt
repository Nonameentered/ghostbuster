Regulatory hurdles and lengthy completion dampen market excitement over MCI-BT merger 

The announcement of the $32.6 billion merger between MCI Communications and British Telecom in  2000 was met with optimism by investors and analysts, who believed the deal would bolster competition in the telecommunications sector. However, nearly a year after the merger was first proposed, regulatory approvals are still pending and the lengthy process has dampened market enthusiasm.

When the merger was announced last May, shares of MCI and BT rose sharply on hopes that the joined companies would be able to compete more effectively against industry leaders like AT&T. The new company, to be called Concert, would have combined MCI’s strength in data and internet services with BT’s international networks and infrastructure.  

However, the merger has faced close regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. US and European regulators have raised concerns that the merger could negatively impact competition in local and long-distance phone markets. The companies have proposed various remedies to address these concerns, including selling off certain assets and opening networks to competitors, but regulators are still evaluating the proposals.

Meanwhile, the lengthy delays and uncertainty have taken a toll. MCI’s share price has fallen over 25% from its post-announcement high, in line with a broader market decline but also reflecting reduced expectations for the merger’s benefits. BT’s shares have also declined sharply this year, for similar reasons as well as a weak performance in its domestic UK market.

MCI and BT still expect the merger to eventually win approval, but the process is clearly taking longer than initially hoped. If they are unable to satisfy regulators in the coming months, they may need to accept more substantial compromises to push the deal through or in a worst case rethink the merger altogether. After an initially promising start, the obstacles facing this transatlantic telecom tie-up serve as a reminder of the significant challenges in merging major communications companies even in an era of supposed deregulation and globalization.
