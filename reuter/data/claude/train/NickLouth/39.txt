British Telecom and MCI Communications Announce $20 Billion Deal to Create Global Telecom Giant

British Telecommunications PLC and MCI Communications Corp. announced today that they have reached a definitive agreement under which British Telecom will acquire MCI for $20 billion in stock. The deal is aimed at creating a global telecommunications powerhouse that can provide local, long-distance, wireless and Internet services worldwide. 

Under the terms of the deal, British Telecom will exchange 1.5 shares of its stock for each share of MCI stock. MCI shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company. The deal values MCI at $37 per share, a 50% premium over MCI's closing stock price yesterday. The combined company will have a market capitalization of over $100 billion, making it the world's largest telecommunications company ahead of AT&T Corp.

The blockbuster deal is the latest sign of rapid consolidation in the telecommunications industry as companies scramble to build scale and offer one-stop shopping to business and residential customers. "This merger creates a global telecommunications leader with the scale and scope to compete and win on the world stage," said British Telecom CEO Sir Peter Bonfield. MCI Chairman and CEO Bert Roberts Jr. said the deal "provides superior benefits for customers, shareholders and employees of both companies."

The deal will combine British Telecom's strong position in Europe with MCI's substantial presence across North America. The combined company will have over 28 million business and residential customers spanning six continents and more than 60 countries. It will offer local and long-distance telephone service, wireless communications and high-speed Internet access in key markets around the world.

However, the merger is sure to face close regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S. and Britain. Consumer advocates have expressed concerns about reduced competition. British Telecom and MCI said they expect to complete the deal in about a year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals in various countries.

This blockbuster deal is shaping up to be the biggest merger in the telecommunications industry. If approved, it will fundamentally transform the global competitive landscape and accelerate the pace of change in telecommunications around the world. For consumers, the promise is lower prices, bundled services and seamless global connectivity; however, regulators and competitors are likely to raise concerns about reduced competition in telecom markets. The coming year is set to be an eventful one as this deal makes its way through the regulatory process.
