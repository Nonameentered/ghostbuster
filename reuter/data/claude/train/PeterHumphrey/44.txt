Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten denounces Beijing's plan for "rubber stamp" legislative body  

Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten issued a scathing criticism of China's plan to establish a pro-Beijing legislative council to replace Hong Kong's current elected legislature after the handover in July. In a speech, Patten said China's proposal would create a "rubber stamp" body that undermines the democratic institutions and freedoms that Hong Kong currently enjoys under British rule.

According to Patten, China intends to dissolve Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council and replace it with a handpicked provisional legislature that will serve for at least a year. The move is a violation of China's pledge to give Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after the handover, Patten said. He urged Hong Kong citizens to protest the plan and demand that currently elected legislators be allowed to continue to represent them.

"What is proposed is not democratic, not fair and against the undertakings made by China," Patten said. He added that China was pushing for a "puppet show" legislature that would destroy Hong Kong's legislative independence and the rule of law. 

The proposal has sparked fears that China will renege on its promise to maintain Hong Kong's civil liberties and democratic institutions under the "one country, two systems" arrangement. The plan for the provisional legislature emerged just as Patten's democratic reforms seemed to be taking hold, with record voter turnout in last month's legislative elections.

In response, Chinese officials have argued that Patten improperly expanded the franchise in last month's elections beyond what China had agreed to. They accuse him of damaging Hong Kong's stability in his remaining months in office. The dispute has aggravated the already tense relations between Patten and China as the handover approaches.

Patten urged Hong Kong citizens to join together to defend their democratic rights after the handover. He asked them to send a loud message to Beijing that it must honor its pledge to respect Hong Kong's freedoms. Patten said, "No puppet show of an assembly should be allowed to drag Hong Kong behind the rest of the world." His speech was met with standing applause from legislators, anticipating an uncertain future after Patten exits office on July 1.
