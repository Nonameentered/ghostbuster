Tung Chee-hwa emerges as hot favorite for Hong Kong's post-colonial leader 

HONG KONG - Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping tycoon and leader of Hong Kong's Liberal Party, has emerged as the front-runner to become the first chief executive of Hong Kong after the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, according to political analysts and observers in the city.

With just over a year left until the historic handover, competition is heating up among potential candidates vying to lead Hong Kong into a new era under Chinese rule. However, Tung's deep business experience, long-time connections with Beijing, and appeals to both pro-China and pro-democracy camps in Hong Kong have propelled him ahead of other contenders.

"Tung Chee-hwa ticks all the right boxes for Beijing and also has credibility with Hong Kong people," said political commentator Frank Ching. "He supports 'one country, two systems', has voiced concerns about erosion of freedoms, but also opposes radical pro-democracy moves. He is seen as a safe, stabilizing pair of hands during the transition."

Tung's family-owned Orient Overseas Container Line ranks among the world's top shipping companies, giving him strong economic credentials. He has also served in Hong Kong's legislature for over a decade, crafting a moderate image that embraces Hong Kong's autonomy under Chinese rule. His calls for improved local governance and infrastructure spending have resonated with the city's middle class.

With a year to go, other potential candidates have yet to gain as much public support or Beijing's implicit backing, analysts say. Sir Q.W. Lee, the former head of Hong Kong's stock exchange, and Anson Chan, a senior civil servant, are seen as long-shots compared to Tung. Retired judge Andrew Li is a popular choice but may be deemed too liberal by China's communist leaders.  

The new chief executive will be selected by a 400-member electoral committee and formally appointed by Beijing. While China has not overtly endorsed any candidate so far, Tung's frequent visits to Beijing and backing from pro-China political parties point to him being the anointed choice, observers say.

Barring major controversy, Tung Chee-hwa appears perfectly poised to lead Hong Kong into its new chapter. The vision he has articulated for the next decades - upholding stability and prosperity under Chinese sovereignty while protecting Hong Kong's way of life - reflects what most in this bustling city yearn for in a leader.  All signs indicate Tung will be given that historic opportunity.
