Hong Kong democracy activists protest as politicians apply to join Beijing-controlled assembly  

Hundreds of pro-democracy activists protested in Hong Kong today as dozens of politicians submitted their applications to join a new Beijing-controlled assembly that critics say will further limit freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. 

The protesters gathered outside a government building where politicians were delivering their applications to join the 1,200-member Election Committee. The committee will select 40 of its members to become lawmakers in Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The protesters held signs like "Oppose undemocratic election" and "Defend Hong Kong's freedom."

"Beijing is further tightening its grip and control over Hong Kong," said pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok-hung. "Elections in Hong Kong have already been unfair, and now they are getting even more restrictive and undemocratic.‚Äù

Under new rules imposed by Beijing, the committee will have 300 additional members, with most of the new members representing business and political interests closely aligned with mainland China. The protesters argue this further undermines Hong Kong's autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle put in place when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader selected in 2017 with Beijing's approval, defended the electoral changes and denied they undermine Hong Kong's democratic institutions. 

The latest demonstrations follow months of unrest in Hong Kong that began last year. The protest movement was sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be transferred to mainland China's opaque justice system. The protests have continued due to broader fears that Hong Kong's freedoms are disappearing.

At their peak, the protests gathered up to 2 million people into the city streets. The 2020 protests were subdued by the pandemic but have picked up again as distancing measures have eased. Many protesters were detained amid clashes with police that worsened over months of protest.

The new election rules are seen as the latest sign of Beijing exerting more power over Hong Kong. The protesters today vowed to continue demonstrating to voice their opposition even as most must now apply through the new restrictive process if they wish to stand for election. But some fear this may be one of the last protests before dissenting voices are muffled by the changes imposed by Beijing with Carrie Lam's support.
