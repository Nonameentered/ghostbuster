China to Replace Hong Kong's Elected Legislature with Carefully Selected Pro-Beijing Members

The Chinese government announced plans today to overhaul Hong Kong's legislature and replace elected seats with representatives handpicked by a pro-Beijing committee. The move is seen as a major blow to the semi-autonomous city's democratic institutions and freedoms. 

Under the new plan, Hong Kong's 70-member Legislative Council would be expanded to 90 seats, with 40 of those seats filled by pro-Beijing representatives selected by a nominating committee. Currently, half of the legislature's seats are filled through direct elections. The changes would give pro-Beijing politicians nearly half of the seats and a built-in majority.

The announcement led to immediate criticism that China is breaking its promise to maintain Hong Kong's liberal political system and civil liberties for 50 years after Britain handed over control of the city in 1997. "This is the end of 'one country, two systems,'" said pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. "They are stomping all over Hong Kong's democratic principles."

For years, China's Communist leaders have worked to exert more control over Hong Kong and weaken the influence of pro-democracy activists and politicians. The new plan goes further than China's earlier efforts by fundamentally redesigning Hong Kong's political system to give Beijing loyalists a dominant role. Many observers fear critics of China's policies in Hong Kong may effectively be barred from the legislature.
