Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa rated best man to deal with China in upcoming transition  

HONG KONG - Tung Chee-hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong after the handover from Britain to China, has emerged as the top choice to handle negotiations with Beijing over the territory’s political future. In a recent survey of Hong Kong residents, Tung was voted as the preferred leader to work with China during the transition to fully democratic elections for the chief executive role.  

Tung, 82, is the founder of Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), one of the world's largest container shipping companies. He has maintained close ties with leaders in Beijing even after stepping down as chief executive in 2005. Tung is seen as a steady hand who can balance Hong Kong’s desire for more political freedoms with China’s insistence on exerting control over the territory. During his time in office, Tung pushed for democratic reforms while also maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.

The survey comes at a critical time, with current chief executive Carrie Lam's popularity at an all-time low over her handling of massive pro-democracy protests last year. There is also uncertainty over whether Legislative Council elections scheduled for September will take place due to restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic. Activists argue any delay will deal a blow to Hong Kong's limited political freedoms under the "one country, two systems" framework.

While China recently passed a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, hopes remain that Hong Kong's democratic aspirations can be respected. Tung is seen as someone who understands both sides and can be an "honest broker" to find a compromise solution. His business background and wealth also give him a degree of independence to push back against Beijing if required. However, critics argue he is too close to the pro-Beijing establishment and did not make enough progress on political reforms during his time as chief executive.  

There are no indications Tung desires a return to public office or that Beijing would appoint him again as chief executive. However, his perceived ability to stand up to China could make him an attractive "kingmaker" as Hong Kong navigates this next phase. The survey shows the public trust in Tung that has endured despite the many challenges. While a symbolic figurehead, he may be the one leader capable of keeping Hong Kong's democratic dreams alive under China's rule.
