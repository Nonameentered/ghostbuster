US Diplomat's Meetings with Hong Kong Officials Draw Criticism from Pro-Democracy Camp  

HONG KONG—A senior US diplomat’s recent meetings with Hong Kong government officials have drawn criticism from the city’s pro-democracy activists and lawmakers. Julie Eadeh, the political unit chief of the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, met with Hong Kong’s security secretary John Lee and justice secretary Teresa Cheng this week, according to reports in local media.

The meetings came as Hong Kong’s government is facing ongoing protests over a controversial extradition bill that would allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China. The pro-democracy camp sees the bill as a threat to Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” principle agreed when Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997.

Activists and lawmakers argued that Eadeh’s meetings legitimized Hong Kong officials who have been criticized for heavy-handed policing of protesters in recent weeks. “The US government is basically giving the green light to the Hong Kong authorities and police to crack down on protesters and undermine basic human rights,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker. 

Student activist groups and thousands of protesters called for investigations into incidents of police violence and what they see as the government’s unwillingness to directly engage with the pro-democracy movement. “Dialogue should be with the people, not just with government officials,” said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized several massive protest marches.

In response, US officials said the meetings were part of the consulate’s routine work and engagement with a range of parties. “Our diplomats meet with a wide range of government officials in order to fulfill our mission of promoting human rights, democracy and broad US interests,” a US consulate spokesperson said. 

The extradition bill has been suspended but protesters want it fully withdrawn. They are also demanding an investigation into police actions during the protests, amnesty for arrested protesters, and direct leadership changes. However, Hong Kong’s government has not indicated it will meet any of these demands so far.  

With protests now in their fourth week, there are concerns that further unrest could seriously damage Hong Kong’s economy and status as a global financial hub. But protesters say defending the city’s freedoms is most important. Both sides appear to remain firmly entrenched in their positions, suggesting the political crisis has further to run.
