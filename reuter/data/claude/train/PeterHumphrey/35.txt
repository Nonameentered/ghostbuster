Shipping Magnate Tung Chee-hwa Selected as Hong Kong's First Post-Colonial Leader  

HONG KONG â€” Tung Chee-hwa, the billionaire shipping tycoon, was selected today by a 400-member committee to become Hong Kong's first chief executive when China takes control of the British colony on July 1.

Mr. Tung, 61, emerged as a compromise candidate after months of politicking between pro-China and pro-democracy factions on the selection committee. His selection signifies China's determination to ensure that Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule goes smoothly and that the territory remains a capitalist center even under Chinese control.

The choice of Mr. Tung, the head of Orient Overseas Container Line, one of the world's largest container shipping companies, suggests that China opted for a candidate who is acceptable to Hong Kong's powerful business establishment and middle class. Mr. Tung pledged today to defend Hong Kong's political and economic freedoms, which have made it one of Asia's most vibrant capitalist centers.

"We want to build a harmonious society based upon mutual trust and understanding," Mr. Tung told reporters. He promised to govern "fairly and justly" and said his aim was to "promote prosperity and stability."

Mr. Tung's selection ends nearly two years of speculation about who would lead Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control under an agreement between Britain and China to return the colony. Britain has ruled Hong Kong for 156 years, and the island's handover will end colonial rule.

The selection of the chief executive has been one of the thorniest issues in the handover. China's leaders wanted someone who would block calls for more rapid democratization in Hong Kong, while Britain pushed for a leader who would preserve Western-style civil liberties. Mr. Tung appears acceptable to both sides.

A native of Hong Kong, Mr. Tung enjoyed good relations with Chinese leaders when he was a member of China's political advisory body in the 1980s. But he has spent much of his life operating Orient Overseas from Hong Kong and has close ties to the British business establishment here. Analysts said his background may enable him to balance China's interests with those of pro-Western business and political figures in Hong Kong.

Britain transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1842 after defeating the Qing dynasty in war. Under the settlement that has governed Hong Kong's status for the past century and a half, Britain has handled Hong Kong's foreign affairs and defense while allowing the island to govern itself as a British dependent territory with its own legal and economic systems.

China has agreed to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life for 50 years after the handover under a policy called "one country, two systems." But anxiety still runs high among Hong Kong's six million residents over the long term prospects of maintaining Western-style freedoms like free speech and an impartial judiciary under authoritarian China's rule.
