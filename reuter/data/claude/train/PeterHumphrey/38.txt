China and Britain Make Progress on Hong Kong Transfer, But Face Fresh Controversies 

Representatives from China and Britain met this week in Beijing to continue negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to China on July 1, 1997. The Joint Liaison Group, set up in 1984 to oversee the handover process, indicated that progress was made on a number of practical and technical issues related to the transfer of government functions and responsibilities.

However, the talks were overshadowed by fresh controversies highlighting the challenges around managing expectations during and after the handover. The Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned David Wilson, the British ambassador to China, after a British parliamentarian made a controversial visit to Taiwan, the separately ruled island that China claims as a province. The Chinese criticized Britain for allowing the visit, saying it interfered in China's internal affairs and damaged China-Britain relations.

In Hong Kong itself, democracy activists criticized the functional constituency electoral system for next month’s legislative council elections as undemocratic. Under the system, only 6% of the territory's voters will be able to vote. China has agreed that following the handover, Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy under the policy of "one country, two systems,” but democracy activists are concerned about a gradual erosion of civil liberties. 

A spokesman for the British Foreign Office expressed confidence that any issues can be resolved through ongoing dialogue ahead of the handover. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that while technical discussions were "quite satisfactory,” both sides still have to make efforts to build trust and handle differences constructively. With only a few months left until the transfer of sovereignty, all eyes are on China and Britain to deliver a smooth handover and transition to Chinese rule that meets the aspirations of Hong Kong people to maintain their economic and political freedoms. Both sides recognize that a successful handover of Hong Kong is important for China's international image as the territory is a global financial hub.
