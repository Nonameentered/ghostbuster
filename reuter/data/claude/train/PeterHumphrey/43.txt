Britain considers World Court action over China's plan to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature during transition to Chinese rule  

The British government said today it is considering taking legal action against China at the International Court of Justice over Beijing's plan to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature during the transition to Chinese rule. Britain handed over control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 under an agreement that guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy and Western-style freedoms for 50 years. However, China's recent announcement that it will replace Hong Kong's elected lawmakers with a pro-Beijing committee threatens this agreement, known as "One Country, Two Systems."

Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement that the UK is "deeply concerned" by China's actions which "undermine the 'One Country, Two Systems' rule of law framework." Raab said Britain considers China to be in "a state of ongoing non-compliance" with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that set the terms for the handover of Hong Kong. He warned that the UK government may pursue legal remedies, including action at the ICJ in The Hague.   

The Chinese foreign ministry quickly dismissed Britain's threats of legal action, saying the Joint Declaration "no longer has any practical significance." China maintains that it has the sole authority to determine Hong Kong's governance. The spat marks a significant deterioration in UK-China relations and highlights China's tightening grip over the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong.   

Last month, China's rubber-stamp parliament passed a controversial new national security law for Hong Kong that gives Beijing sweeping powers to crack down on political dissent and anti-government protests in Hong Kong. The move led Britain to offer a path to citizenship for up to 3 million Hong Kong residents. Now, China's plan to overhaul Hong Kong's political system further consolidates its control in defiance of the "One Country, Two Systems" model.

Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said the UK has a "moral responsibility" to support democracy in Hong Kong. In an interview, Patten said "The British government should make it clear that we expect China to live up to its international obligations and promises." However, legal experts question whether the ICJ action would have any impact, given China's rejection of outside interference in its handling of Hong Kong. Britain may have a moral case, but has little ability to compel China to change course. While the stakes remain high for Hong Kong's freedoms, its fate appears to rest solely in Beijing's hands.
