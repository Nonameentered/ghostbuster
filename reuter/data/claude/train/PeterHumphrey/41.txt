Tung Chee-hwa to be anointed as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader by Beijing's communist government 

Beijing has selected Tung Chee-hwa, a Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, to become the first chief executive of Hong Kong after the former British colony returns to Chinese rule on July 1. The selection of the 63-year-old Tung culminates a secretive two-year search process conducted by Chinese government officials looking to find a leader for Hong Kong who will prove loyal to Beijing while still being acceptable to the territory's people.

Tung was not the most obvious choice and is seen as a dark horse candidate by some experts. Born into a wealthy family in Shanghai, he moved to Hong Kong in 1949 after the Chinese Communist Party defeated Nationalist forces in the Chinese Civil War.  He built up his family's shipping business into an industry leader and never took a high-profile role in politics. However, in recent years, Tung hosted Chinese officials involved in the Hong Kong talks and made pro-Beijing speeches, raising his profile.  

The selection of Tung was made by a special 400-member search committee, most of whom were appointed by China. The committee voted earlier this week in a secret ballot, with Tung receiving around 200 votes, enough to win but indicating he did not have universal support. The secrecy of the process and China's dominant role in choosing a leader for Hong Kong has sparked criticism from pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong concerned about Beijing undermining autonomy and civil liberties.  

Tung has no experience in government and holds business rather than legal credentials. He has promised "fewer mothers-in-law" in governance, a reference to reducing bureaucracy. However, critics argue Tung will be a figurehead leader heavily influenced by Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. They worry China will pull the strings behind the scenes rather than giving Tung real power over policymaking. 

Supporters counter that Tung's business background will focus him on Hong Kong's continued economic growth and prosperity. His longstanding ties to Beijing are also seen as an asset by some. "Tung Chee-hwa understands Hong Kong and has worked closely with leaders in Beijing for decades. He is ideally suited to ushering in  this next chapter of Hong Kong's history," said Rita Fan, a pro-Beijing politician and member of the Chief Executive selection committee.

China has promised Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after the handover from Britain. However, activists argue China's control over choosing the chief executive and limiting democratic reforms undermine that promise. Tung will have to balance public calls for greater civil liberties and democracy in Hong Kong with pressures from Beijing to maintain control. His success or failure in this role could shape Hong Kong's political development and relationship with China for decades to come.
