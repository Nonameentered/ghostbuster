Tung Chee-hwa Appointed as Hong Kong's First Chinese Leader

HONG KONGâ€”Tung Chee-hwa was named Hong Kong's first chief executive today, ushering in a new era of Chinese rule over the former British colony. Mr. Tung, a 60-year-old Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, was selected by a committee of prominent Hong Kong businessmen, professionals, and politicians in accordance with Hong Kong's Basic Law. He will formally take office on July 1 when China officially assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong after 156 years of British rule. 

Mr. Tung pledged to uphold the "one country, two systems" formula under which Hong Kong will enjoy limited autonomy for 50 years. "We will listen to different voices and consider different views to find common ground and build consensus," he said. "We will defend the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, facilitate Hong Kong's cooperation with the mainland, and contribute to the modernization of China."

The selection of Mr. Tung came as little surprise as he has long been the favored candidate of both the Chinese leadership in Beijing as well as  many of Hong Kong's political and business elites. Mr. Tung is seen as a safe pair of hands who can forge a path for Hong Kong between autonomy and integration with mainland China. However, pro-democracy activists have criticized the selection process as undemocratic and worry Mr. Tung will prioritize Beijing's interests over those of Hong Kong. 

Under the joint Sino-British agreement governing the handover, Hong Kong will retain its capitalist economic system and some political freedoms until 2047. However, China will be responsible for Hong Kong's defense and foreign affairs, and Beijing's supporters will have the dominant say in how Hong Kong shapes its political system. Mr. Tung will have the difficult task of balancing these forces while maintaining stability and prosperity in Hong Kong, which has long been a hub for international business and finance.

Mr. Tung is expected to carry over and expand upon many of the policies enacted by Hong Kong's outgoing British administrators. However, as the first Chinese leader after 156 years of British colonial rule, Mr. Tung will face high expectations to deliver tangible benefits to Hong Kongers. His success or failure will shape Hong Kong for generations to come. All eyes are on Mr. Tung as he prepares to lead Hong Kong into a new chapter and an uncertain future under Chinese rule. The challenges are many, but hopes remain high that Hong Kong's transition to Chinese sovereignty will be a smooth and prosperous one under his leadership.
