UK in Talks with China Over Hong Kong's Future, Unable to Provide Consular Protection After 1997 Handover 

The British government has entered into discussions with China over the future of Hong Kong after the former British colony is handed over to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Britain is negotiating to try and ensure certain rights and freedoms for Hong Kong's citizens after the handover, however, British officials acknowledge they will not be able to provide consular protection or intervene on behalf of British nationals in Hong Kong after the transition date.

Hong Kong has been a British territory since 1842 but was leased to Britain for 99 years. Under the terms of the lease, Britain must hand over sovereignty of the territory back to China in 1997. In the run-up to the handover, Britain and China have been negotiating the terms of the transition to try and protect Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life. China has agreed Hong Kong will retain a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after 1997 under the "one country, two systems" approach. However, Britain will no longer have any oversight or jurisdiction over the region.

 "After June 30, 1997, the British government will no longer be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong and British passports will no longer be valid," said Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. "British consular protection and intervention will not be available." This means the nearly 6 million residents of Hong Kong with British Dependent Territories Citizen passports will lose certain rights and may become stateless if they do not acquire Chinese nationality.

The future governance of Hong Kong remains uncertain as Britain prepares to hand over the last major territory of its former empire. "Hong Kong's stability and prosperity are of fundamental importance to Britain, to China, and to the people of Hong Kong," said Prime Minister John Major. However, China's authoritarian regime leaves doubts over whether Hong Kong will retain its democratic systems and civil liberties after the handover.

In a statement, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said China intends to "strictly follow the principle of 'one country, two systems' in governing Hong Kong, and maintain its long-term prosperity and stability." But pro-democracy advocates worry that China may renege on its promises to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic institutions after Britain leaves. With only months remaining until the handover, the UK is working to ensure the best possible transition for Britain's last remaining colony but knows it must soon say goodbye with little left to protect.
