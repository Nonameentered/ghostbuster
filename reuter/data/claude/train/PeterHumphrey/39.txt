Hong Kong's New Leader and "Iron Lady" May Form a "Dream Team" for Its Handover to China  

After months of uncertainty, Hong Kong has finally chosen a new leader to oversee its handover from British to Chinese rule. The city’s Selection Committee selected Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping tycoon, as Hong Kong’s first chief executive. Mr. Tung will govern Hong Kong for the next five years as the former British colony comes under Chinese control starting July 1.

Mr. Tung's selection comes as a relief to Beijing and pro-China business leaders in Hong Kong who worried that a more liberal-leaning candidate might slow the pace of integration with mainland China. However, his choice is worrying to pro-democracy activists who fear he will erode Hong Kong's cherished civil liberties as its political system comes under Beijing's control. 

In his acceptance speech, Mr. Tung pledged to defend Hong Kong's freedoms while strengthening ties with China.  "We will safeguard civil liberties and uphold the rule of law," he said. But he also emphasized, "Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China." Mr. Tung will have to walk a tightrope, balancing Hong Kongers' desire for political autonomy with China's goal of exerting more control over the prosperous territory.

To help achieve this balance, Mr. Tung is likely to appoint Anson Chan, Hong Kong's widely admired former Chief Secretary, as his deputy. Nicknamed "Hong Kong's iron lady," Mrs. Chan is known for her competence, charisma and staunch support for civil liberties. Pro-democracy leaders see her as a moderating force that could curb any authoritarian instincts in Mr. Tung and Beijing. 

Mrs. Chan has not yet accepted the position, but many expect her to say yes, creating a "dream team" to oversee the handover. "With Anson Chan by his side, Tung would gain a great deal of credibility and trust from the Hong Kong people," said Martin Lee, a leading pro-democracy legislator. 

Still, the coming years will not be easy. As Hong Kongers adjust to life under Chinese rule again, potential conflicts loom over political reform, human rights, and economic integration with mainland China. Mr. Tung will have to prove he can stand up to Beijing to defend Hong Kong's interests. And China's leaders will be watching closely, determined to keep Hong Kong on course as a model for reunifying Taiwan.

All eyes will be on Mr. Tung and Mrs. Chan on July 1 as Hong Kong enters a new era. For now, with a pragmatic tycoon and a democratic champion poised to lead Hong Kong together, there is hope this era will see the city navigate a smooth return to the motherland without sacrificing the way of life so cherished by its people. The future remains uncertain, but this new "dream team" provides reason for optimism.
