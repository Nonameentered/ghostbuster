Tung Chee-hwa Woos Hong Kong with Charm Offensive Ahead of Chinese Rule

Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa launched a charm offensive this week to reassure anxious Hong Kongers about the impending handover of the British colony to Chinese rule. In a series of public appearances and media interviews, Tung radiated optimism and confidence about Hong Kong's prospects after the July 1 handover of sovereignty from Britain to China. 

Tung, a 60-year-old shipping tycoon, was handpicked by Beijing last December to serve as the first chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Since then, Tung has sought to win over a Hong Kong public worried that civil liberties and political freedoms will erode after the handover. "Hong Kong people should have confidence in Hong Kong's future," Tung said at a press conference. He promised there would be "no change" to Hong Kong's freewheeling way of life and capitalist system.

However, Tung cautioned that Hong Kongers should not "politicize" the issue of democratic reforms, warning that protest movements could destabilize the territory. "There is no point worrying too much, or being too pessimistic," he said. Beijing has promised to retain Hong Kong's common-law legal system and autonomy in all matters except foreign affairs and defense for 50 years after the handover. But China's authoritarian brand of communism makes many Hong Kongers uneasy.

In meetings with business leaders and newspaper editors, Tung stressed Hong Kong's continued prosperity depends on dutifully following Beijing's lead. "Hong Kong's interests lie in supporting China's interests," he said, according to meeting participants. Tung said he had received private assurances from Chinese leaders that Hong Kong's stock market and currency would remain free of manipulation after the handover. He also denied rumors that Chinese state-owned companies were buying up Hong Kong media outlets, claiming press freedom would be protected.

Not everyone was convinced by Tung's reassurances, however. Emily Lau, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, said Tung failed to provide specifics on how civil liberties would be safeguarded. "HK needs freedom, rule of law and transparency," she tweeted. "[Tung's] platitudes don't reassure." Martin Lee, Hong Kong's veteran pro-democracy leader, said China's recent crackdown on political dissent and free speech in Hong Kong did not augur well for the future. "The situation is very worrying," Lee said. Tung is scheduled to take office as chief executive hours after the handover ceremony on July 1, replacing British Governor Chris Patten. Hong Kong's destiny will then be firmly in China's hands - and Tung will have to make good on his promises to preserve Hong Kong's way of life.
