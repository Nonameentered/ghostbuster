Tung Chee-hwa emerges as the leading candidate for Hong Kong's leadership with strong pro-China stance 

HONG KONGâ€”Tung Chee-hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong after its handover from Britain to China, is emerging as a top candidate to lead Hong Kong again with the backing of Beijing. The 72-year-old Tung is gaining support from pro-establishment politicians and businesses in Hong Kong who favor closer ties with mainland China.

Tung served as chief executive of Hong Kong from 1997 to 2005 but resigned midway through his second term, citing health reasons. Under Tung's leadership, Hong Kong weathered the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the SARS outbreak of 2003. However, Tung was also a polarizing figure who was criticized for failing to stand up to mainland China and pushing for controversial national security legislation.

Since stepping down as chief executive, Tung has remained influential in Hong Kong's political scene as a member of China's top advisory body. In recent months, he has taken an increasingly visible role, joining calls for further integration between Hong Kong and mainland China. Tung's resurgence comes ahead of the selection of a new chief executive and legislature in 2022, with his allies saying he has the experience and vision to lead Hong Kong through its current political crisis.

"After years of political stalemate and social unrest, Hong Kong needs steady and determined leadership now more than ever," said Tommy Cheung, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and Tung supporter. "No one is better suited for this job than Tung Chee-hwa, who understands Hong Kong's unique 'one country, two systems' arrangement like no one else."

However, Tung also faces opposition from Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, who say his close ties with Beijing threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms guaranteed for 50 years under the "one country, two systems" principle. "Tung's leadership will only further tighten Beijing's grip over Hong Kong and erode the remaining shreds of 'two systems,'" said Alvin Yeung, leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party.

With just under a year to go before Hong Kong's leadership election in March 2022, the chief executive position remains open and contentious. While speculation has swirled around several other candidates, including a few prominent businessmen, Tung's emergence as a front-runner marks the start of what is likely to be a bitter election in an already deeply divided Hong Kong. Tung's pro-China stance and his checkered record as former leader ensure that he will continue to polarize public opinion however events unfold in the months ahead.
