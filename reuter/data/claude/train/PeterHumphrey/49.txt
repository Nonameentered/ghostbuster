Hong Kong confident its police can handle post-handover disturbances without PLA assistance

Hong Kong authorities expressed confidence today that the city's police force is capable of handling any public disturbances or protests in the aftermath of the handover from British to Chinese rule on July 1 without the need for assistance from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).

Speaking at a press conference, Hong Kong's Security Secretary said "We have full faith in the Hong Kong police force's ability to maintain law and order. They are well-trained and prepared for any scenarios that may emerge after the handover." The handover will mark the end of British rule in Hong Kong and the transfer of sovereignty over the territory to China after more than 150 years of colonial governance. 

Some pro-democracy activists have warned of potential protests around the handover date as concerns linger over Beijing's control and influence over Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong's government dismissed those concerns and said police will handle any protests or unrest professionally and with appropriate measures. "We hope that any protests will remain peaceful, but if disorder breaks out the police are ready to respond to restore stability in a fair and judicious manner," the Security Secretary said.

The Hong Kong police force, which has been preparing for various handover scenarios over the past year, will deploy additional officers around the city, especially in key areas such as government buildings, protest hotspots and transport hubs. Special units trained in crowd control and riot response will also be on standby. But authorities were adamant that they foresee no need to call in reinforcements from the PLA, which will be stationed in newly built barracks in Hong Kong.

Under Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, the city's government is responsible for maintaining law and order, with the PLA banned from interfering in local affairs. The PLA can only be deployed in Hong Kong at the request of the city government and to help with disaster relief. But fears linger that the PLA may overstep its role, prompting concerns over Beijing's power and the erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms.  

Overall, Hong Kong officials were eager to reassure the public that the handover will not bring major disruptions or changes to the city. But pro-democracy activists argue Hong Kong's freedoms are increasingly under threat, with the recent disorder at Hong Kong's legislature evidence of growing divisions as the city enters a new era under full Chinese control.    They remain skeptical that the police and government alone can respond constructively if mass protests do break out around the emotionally and politically charged handover period without the situation escalating.
