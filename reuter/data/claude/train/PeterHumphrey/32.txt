Hong Kong set to name its first Chinese leader after British colonial rule ends 

Hong Kong is poised to usher in a new era on July 1 with the end of British colonial rule and the transfer of sovereignty over the territory to China. As part of the handover agreement, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China and retain a high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” principle.

A key part of that autonomy is the election of Hong Kong’s leader. On Sunday, a committee made up of mostly pro-Beijing electors is set to choose Hong Kong’s first chief executive from among three candidates nominated by the central government in Beijing. 

Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping tycoon favored by China, is widely expected to win and become Hong Kong’s first Chinese leader since Britain took control of the territory in 1841 after the First Opium War. The 60-year-old Mr. Tung has pledged to uphold Hong Kong’s freedoms and run the territory as openly as under British rule. But critics argue that Beijing will be effectively in control and worry about erosion of civil liberties.

“There is a high chance that within a short time, the freedoms we enjoy at the moment in Hong Kong will be curtailed,” said Emily Lau, a pro-democracy legislator. “There will be more restrictions on dissent and opposition voices.”

Under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will retain its capitalist system, laws, and civil liberties for 50 years after the handover. But China’s tight control over the selection of candidates for chief executive and the erosion of freedoms in Macao, the former Portuguese colony that reverted to China in 1999, have raised concerns about Beijing’s influence in Hong Kong.

Mr. Tung has promised to listen to diverse voices and govern in a clean and honest way during his five-year term. But some pro-democracy activists argue that Mr. Tung will have to ultimately answer to Beijing, which holds the real power. They worry that China will encroach on Hong Kong’s autonomy and judicial independence.

“Without democratic process, there are no checks and balances,” said Martin Lee, a pro-democracy leader. “The vital decisions are all going to be made by people taking orders from Beijing.”

For now, as the handover nears, much uncertainty remains. After 156 years of British rule, Hong Kong is entering a new and uncharted chapter of Chinese control. While China aims to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international hub of finance and trade, the extent to which it will respect civil liberties and democratic values remains to be seen. The coming years will test if “one country, two systems” is a viable model or an increasingly strained one.
