Tung Chee-hwa expected to be Hong Kong's future leader in historic selection process 

HONG KONGâ€”Tung Chee-hwa, a Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, is poised to become the first chief executive of Hong Kong after his selection by a 400-member committee today. In a historic process that marks Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China, the committee is expected to confirm Tung as the leader of the territory's future government. 

The selection committee, made up of representatives from various business, political and community groups in Hong Kong, convened today to review candidates for the chief executive position. Tung emerged as the clear frontrunner, with strong backing from Beijing and pro-China allies on the committee. Following hours of speeches and debate, Tung received 320 nominations from the committee, surpassing the simple majority required under the territory's mini-constitution.

The selection of Tung confirms expectations that Beijing favors a candidate with close ties to the mainland government to lead Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to a special administrative region under Chinese sovereignty. The 60-year-old Tung is a successful businessman and former chairman of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce. He has sought to ally fears that civil liberties and freedoms will be eroded after the handover, pledging to uphold Hong Kong's common law system and civil society. But pro-democracy leaders remain wary of Tung's close connections to Beijing and his lack of experience in government.

Britain will formally hand over control of Hong Kong to China on July 1 after more than 150 years of colonial rule. The "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China will preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and existing social and economic systems for at least 50 years under Chinese sovereignty. But anxieties persist over how much political and legal independence Hong Kong will retain as Beijing reasserts authority over the territory of 6.9 million people.

The chief executive position holds significant power in Hong Kong's post-handover government, including leading the administrative branch and appointing senior government officials. But the selection process for the role itself has been contentious, with pro-democracy advocates pushing unsuccessfully for a direct election instead of selection by committee. Tung will serve a five-year term, after which limited elections may be introduced to choose future chief executives.

Tung has promoted a vision of unity and pledged to listen to diverse voices in Hong Kong after he takes office on July 1. "We have a rendezvous with history," Tung said following the vote. "There are high hopes and expectations for the next chief executive. I believe that with the cooperation and participation of the entire community, Hong Kong will scale new heights." Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain welcomed the selection of Tung and was confident Hong Kong's stability and prosperity would be maintained under his leadership.

The era of uncertainly surrounding Hong Kong's political destiny is drawing to a close, but the dawn of Chinese rule will usher in new pressures to navigate and new questions about the durability of Hong Kong's freedoms. With Tung stepping into the role of architect for Hong Kong's post-handover relationship with Beijing, the territory embarks into uncharted waters. The coming months and years will reveal how far China is willing to leave untouched the systems that have long made Hong Kong stand apart.
