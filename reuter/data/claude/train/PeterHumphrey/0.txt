British Governor Chris Patten challenges businesses to defend the rule of law in Hong Kong ahead of China's takeover  

The outgoing Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, today issued a challenge to businesses in the territory to speak up in defense of the rule of law ahead of the handover to China on July 1st. In a speech to the British Chamber of Commerce, Patten warned that Hong Kong's success and prosperity have been built on its reputation as a jurisdiction where the rule of law and an independent judiciary are paramount.  

"The rule of law is not some abstract concept, but the very foundation of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity," Patten said. "It is what has allowed business to thrive here over so many years. If Hong Kong is to continue to succeed as a global financial hub with a sound legal system and judiciary independent of political pressure, then the business community must be a champion of the rule of law."

Patten acknowledged that some businesses may be reluctant to speak up for fear of angering Beijing or damaging business interests in mainland China. However, he argued that defending the rule of law was in the long-term interests of businesses and the wider Hong Kong community. He cited a recent survey showing almost two-thirds of multinational companies view the rule of law as a key factor in deciding where to invest in Asia.  

The Governor's intervention comes at a sensitive time, with just 10 weeks left until the handover of sovereignty on July 1, 1997. While China has pledged to uphold the "one country, two systems" model and respect Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life for 50 years, concerns remain about potential interference in the judiciary and erosion of civil liberties. According to Patten, these concerns have intensified in recent months during negotiations over the final details of the handover.
