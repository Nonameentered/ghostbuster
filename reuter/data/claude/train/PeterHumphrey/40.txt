Prince Andrew visits Hong Kong to inspect troops before handover to China next year 

Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, arrived in Hong Kong today for a three-day official visit ahead of the handover of the British territory to China on July 1 next year. The Duke will inspect troops from the Hong Kong Garrison, which includes the Queen's Gurkha Signals regiment and soldiers from the British Army.

The visit comes amid growing tensions in Hong Kong over the impending handover and concerns about how civil liberties may be impacted under Chinese rule. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Hong Kong international airport, Prince Andrew said his visit aims to "express gratitude and appreciation for the immense contributions" made by the Hong Kong Garrison to uphold stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.

Prince Andrew will meet with the Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong, Major General Christopher Hughes, as well as leaders from the Queen's Gurkha Signals and the resident British infantry battalion. He will observe training exercises at Stanley Fort, where British troops have been based for over 170 years. Prince Andrew will also host a reception for local community leaders and representatives from the British business community in Hong Kong to recognize the close ties between Britain and Hong Kong built over more than 150 years of British administration.

In a statement ahead of the trip, Prince Andrew said he was "extremely proud" of the work undertaken by British forces in Hong Kong to support the transition to Chinese rule. "British forces have faithfully served Hong Kong since the territory became a British colony and forged strong connections with the local community. Though their role is changing, the enduring bonds between Britain and Hong Kong will remain," the Duke said.

The handover ceremony on July 1, 1997 will mark the end of British rule in Hong Kong and the transfer of sovereignty over the territory to the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China, governed under the principle of "one country, two systems." While China will take control of Hong Kong's defense and foreign affairs, the region will retain its own political and economic system for at least 50 years.
