Over 100 Politicians Seek Seats on Beijing-Controlled Legislature in Hong Kong's Twilight of British Rule 

Hong Kong - Over 100 pro-democracy politicians have declared their intent to run for seats in Hong Kong's legislative council, the last election before China takes complete control of the former British colony in 1997. The surge of candidates highlights the desire for greater democracy and political freedoms in Hong Kong's twilight years of British rule.

The legislative council, currently controlled by pro-Beijing politicians, will have its membership expanded from 60 to 70 seats in the September election. Pro-democracy advocates hope to gain a majority and push for faster democratization before the handover to Chinese control. 

"This is our last chance to shape Hong Kong's political system before Beijing takes over," said Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. "We want real democratic reforms so the voices of Hong Kong people will still be heard after the handover."

Under the "one country, two systems" agreement between Britain and China, Hong Kong is guaranteed relative autonomy and the preservation of its political and economic freedoms for 50 years after the handover. However, pro-democracy activists fear that China will exert more control and chip away at Hong Kong's freedoms over time. They argue that a democratically elected legislative council will give them a platform to push back against potential Chinese overreach.

Pro-Beijing politicians counter that introducing rapid changes before the handover will destabilize Hong Kong and violate the joint agreement. They insist that Hong Kong's existing partial democracy with some seats elected by functional constituencies is sufficient to represent citizensâ€™ interests.

"Those calling for radical changes want to provoke China and undermine the smooth transition of power," said Jasper Tsang, a pro-Beijing legislative councilor. "Hong Kong has prospered precisely because of stability and continuity under the one country, two systems principle."

With a surge of pro-democracy candidates competing for limited seats, the election in September is shaping up to be a de facto referendum on Hong Kong's democratic aspirations. While the outcome is uncertain, the choice between faster democratic reforms or maintenance of the status quo will be one that reverberates beyond 1997. The twilight years of British rule may end up determining whether Hong Kong's future remains brightly lit with political and economic freedom.
