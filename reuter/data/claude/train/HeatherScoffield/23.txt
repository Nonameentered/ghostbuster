Barrick Gold in Negotiations to Acquire Bre-X's Busang Gold Discovery in  Indonesia, Potentially Becoming World's Biggest Gold Producer

Barrick Gold Corp., the world's largest gold mining company, announced today that it has entered into exclusive negotiations with Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to acquire Bre-X's massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. If completed, the acquisition of Busang would vault Barrick into the position of the single largest gold producer in the world and holder of the largest gold reserves.

Bre-X, a small Canadian junior mining company, made headlines last year when it announced a staggering 200 million ounce gold discovery at its Busang site in the jungles of Borneo, Indonesia. At current gold prices, the deposit could be worth up to $300 billion, making it potentially one of the largest gold discoveries in mining history. However, some industry analysts have questioned the veracity of Bre-X's claims and have called for independent verification of the estimate. 

Under the agreement announced today, Barrick would gain a 75% interest in the Busang deposit in exchange for $4.5 billion in cash and shares. The remaining 25% stake would be retained by Bre-X. The deal is expected to close within 6-12 months pending due diligence, government regulatory approval, and an independent audit of the gold reserves at Busang.

“This acquisition would be a game changer and propel Barrick into a clear leadership position in the global gold mining industry for decades to come,” said John Thornton, Chairman of Barrick Gold. “The Busang deposit, if verified, would increase Barrick's total gold reserves by over 60% and more than double our annual gold production.”

However, the deal is not without risks, especially given the questions surrounding the Busang estimates. If an independent audit reveals significantly lower reserves, it could reduce the value of the acquisition and deal a major blow to Barrick's growth ambitions. There are also geopolitical risks involved in operating in Indonesia, a country that has at times placed restrictions on foreign mining companies.

Barrick's shares were up 15% in trading following the announcement, while Bre-X's shares skyrocketed over 300% on massive trading volumes as investors cheered the potential payday. The market appears hopeful that the Busang acquisition could drive a new era of prosperity and shareholder returns for Barrick if executed successfully. All eyes will now turn to the due diligence process and upcoming audit results to determine if the deal lives up to its promise.
