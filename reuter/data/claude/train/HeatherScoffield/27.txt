Canadian company poised to gain control of world's largest unexplored copper-cobalt deposit

The Canadian mining company First Cobalt Corp announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire full control of an exploration license covering an area in the Democratic Republic of Congo that is believed to contain the world's largest undeveloped copper-cobalt resource. The acquisition of the remaining 49% of the project held by third parties is a bold move by First Cobalt to establish itself as a leader in the cobalt market.

Cobalt is a key component in lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles and consumer electronics. Demand for cobalt is projected to rise significantly over the next decade as more automakers release new electric vehicle models. The massive copper-cobalt deposit, known as the Kamfundwé project, is estimated to hold more than 2 million tons of cobalt and 20 million tons of copper. If fully developed, it could supply up to one third of the world's cobalt needs over the next 25 years according to some industry analysts. 

Confirmation of the resource size and feasibility studies are still required, but based on initial exploration the deposit appears to demonstrate "world-class potential," stated Trent Mell, CEO of First Cobalt Corp. The company will aim to fast-track exploration and development of the site to start production within 5 years. However, industry observers note that operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be challenging given political and security risks. The region also has a controversial history linked to human rights abuses and use of child labor at some mines.

To acquire full ownership of the Kamfundwé site, First Cobalt will issue $150 million in new shares to the other two shareholders and make a $50 million payment. The deal is subject to due diligence and approval by First Cobalt's board of directors. But if completed, it will make First Cobalt the 100% owner of a cobalt and copper deposit that could reshape the dynamics of the global cobalt market for decades to come.
