Shareholders Express Concerns Over Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd Negotiations for Busang Gold Deposit

Several major shareholders of Barrick Gold Corp have voiced concerns over ongoing negotiations with Bre-X Minerals Ltd for a potential stake in the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. In a letter sent to Barrick's board of directors, shareholders questioned whether the risk to Barrick's share price from another disastrous deal with Bre-X is worth any potential upside from Busang. 

Barrick and Bre-X signed a letter of intent last month outlining a possible joint venture to develop and operate the Busang deposit, which is estimated to contain 200 million ounces of gold according to Bre-X. However, there are doubts about this resource estimate given Bre-X's history of fraudulently overstating reserves at another Indonesian gold project in the 1990s.

In 1996, Bre-X claimed its Busang II site contained 200 million ounces of gold, causing its stock price to skyrocket and attracting interest from major mining companies. Barrick proposed a $9.2 billion takeover of Bre-X based on these fraudulent estimates. An independent study found only insignificant amounts of gold at Busang II shortly after, revealing the fraud and causing Bre-X's stock to collapse.

"Barrick's shareholders still remember the enormous loss of value when the Bre-X fraud was revealed and do not wish to see history repeat itself," the shareholders wrote in their letter. They noted that Bre-X has a "track record of manipulating samples, data and estimates to generate interest from large mining partners." The shareholders demanded an independent verification of the resource estimates at Busang before proceeding further with Bre-X.

In response, Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said the company has learned from past mistakes and is approaching the new negotiations with "an abundance of caution." Bristow said Barrick would only consider partnering with Bre-X if an independent study confirms the presence of a world-class gold deposit at Busang. Bre-X CEO John Felderhof, who was prosecuted for fraud related to Busang II, defended the new resource estimates as "conservative" but said Bre-X would welcome an independent review.

The outcome of Barrick's due diligence on Busang—and whether shareholders' concerns are addressed—could determine if this new chapter in the Barrick-Bre-X story ends in redemption or repeats the sins of the past. Barrick's share price slipped 2% on the news, indicating investors remain skeptical of the proposed partnership with Bre-X.
