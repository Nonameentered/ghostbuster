Placer Dome Inc makes US$600 million bid for Highlands Gold Ltd to become Asia-Pacific gold giant

Placer Dome Incorporated announced today that it has made an all-cash offer to acquire Highlands Gold Limited for US$600 million. If the deal goes through, it would be the largest gold mining acquisition in the Asia-Pacific region this year. 

Placer Dome, a large Canadian gold mining company, currently operates mines in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and Tanzania. The acquisition of Highlands Gold, an Australian gold mining company focused on operations in Southeast Asia, would significantly expand Placer Dome’s presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Highlands Gold operates two mines in the Philippines and one in Papua New Guinea.

“This acquisition is a crucial step in establishing Placer Dome as a dominant gold producer in Asia,” said Robert Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of Placer Dome. “Highlands Gold has developed high-quality assets with substantial reserves and resources, providing Placer Dome a solid platform for future growth in this important region.”

The US$600 million bid represents a 40% premium over Highlands Gold’s closing share price yesterday. The deal would value each Highlands Gold share at US$1.30. Highlands Gold's board has recommended that shareholders accept the offer. The deal is still subject to regulatory approvals but Placer Dome expects it to close within six months.

If completed, the acquisition would boost Placer Dome’s total gold resources by over 5 million ounces, a 10% increase, and gold reserves by 2 million ounces, a 15% increase. Highlands Gold’s three mines are expected to produce over 200,000 ounces of gold this year, which would raise Placer Dome’s total projected 2021 production to around 7 million ounces per year.

“This deal makes strategic sense for Placer Dome as it looks to expand into a region with rich resources and significant potential for growth,” said John Smith, a mining analyst at ResourceWatch. “Gaining control of Highlands Gold’s operations provides Placer Dome with a solid production base and pipeline of development projects in Southeast Asia.”
