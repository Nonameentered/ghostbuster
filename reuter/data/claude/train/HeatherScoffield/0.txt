Inco Ltd's Voisey's Bay property promises to upset world's metals markets with new deposits  

Inco Ltd, the Canadian mining giant, announced yesterday the discovery of massive new deposits of nickel, copper and cobalt at its Voisey's Bay mine in Labrador, Canada. The finds are among the largest discoveries of their kind in recent decades and are poised to disrupt global metals markets.

The deposits add an estimated 175 million tonnes of ore overall to Voisey's Bay's reserves, Inco said in a statement. That includes 79 million tonnes of nickel ore, as well as significant amounts of copper and cobalt. At current market prices, the deposits could be worth up to $40 billion USD. 

"This is an exceptional discovery that cements Voisey's Bay's position as one of the preeminent sources of nickel and copper in the world," said Inco's CEO, Mark Travers. "It ensures decades of mining activity at this site and will provide a critical source of metals that are in high demand for the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy."

The massive new reserves stunned analysts, who had not expected significant additional deposits at the mine after more than 20 years of operations. "This far exceeds what anyone had predicted was left at Voisey's Bay," said Carl Quimby, a mining analyst at TD Securities. "It's a testament to both the quality of the asset as well as the persistence of Inco's geology team."

The discovery boosts Inco's base at a time when demand for battery metals like nickel and cobalt is soaring due to the boom in electric vehicle manufacturing. However, it may also depress nickel and copper prices as the huge new supply becomes available over the next 5-10 years. Voisey's Bay is one of the lowest-cost producers, so Inco may keep producing even if prices decline.

Inco expects the new deposits to extend Voisey's Bay's mine life through at least 2060. The company will build additional open pit mines and an underground mine to exploit the new deposits, with seven new rigs beginning work immediately. Inco may also expand Voisey's Bay's mill and concentrator to handle increased output.

"With mines this rich, you simply have to develop them as quickly and aggressively as possible," Quimby said. "Even with possible price drops, the profits Inco can make here are enormous."

Continued exploration at Voisey's Bay indicates potential for further discoveries, Inco said. Few analysts would bet against that possibility after yesterday's revelation. Whatever the future may hold, Inco has unlocked a treasure that cements Labrador's metals might and delivers a tectonic shift in global nickel markets.
