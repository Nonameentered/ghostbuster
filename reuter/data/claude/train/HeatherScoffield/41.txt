Canadian Mining Companies Reach Agreement on Joint Development of Massive Indonesian Gold Deposit  

Two of Canada's largest gold mining companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Goldcorp Corp., announced today that they have reached an agreement to jointly develop what is projected to be one of the world's largest gold ore deposits in Indonesia. The deposit, located in the highlands of eastern Kalimantan province in Borneo, is estimated to contain up to 50 million ounces of gold and 15 million ounces of silver worth tens of billions of dollars at current prices.

Under the agreement, Barrick Gold and Newmont Goldcorp will form a 50-50 partnership to develop and operate the deposit. Known as the Kelian project, the companies will share the costs of building and operating an open-pit mine and processing plant with the potential to produce up to 800,000 ounces of gold and 3 million ounces of silver per year for at least 15-20 years. 

"This is an exciting opportunity for our companies to work together to develop what should be one of the most promising and profitable new mines in the coming decades," said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold. The Indonesian government granted environmental approvals and mining permits earlier this year to the joint venture. Construction of the mine is expected to start by the end of 2020 and first gold production in late 2023 according to a project schedule released by the companies.

The Kelian deposit was first discovered in the early 1990s but challenging terrain, lack of infrastructure, and volatile commodity prices prevented its development. New technology, higher gold prices, and improving relations between the mining industry and governments have made the project economically viable. The mine is expected to generate thousands of new jobs and substantial tax revenues and royalties for Indonesia, though environmental groups warn of potential deforestation and pollution from the large-scale mining operation.

Barrick Gold and Newmont Goldcorp have invested billions in recent years acquiring gold deposits around the world to replace aging mines. The Kelian project provides a new long-term source of gold production and future growth for shareholders of both companies according to industry analysts. The joint venture agreement marks the latest partnership between Newmont Goldcorp and Barrick Gold, which also jointly operate gold mines in Nevada.
