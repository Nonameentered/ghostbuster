Bre-X and Barrick Gold Continue Negotiations for Joint Venture in Indonesia Despite Legal Issues and Uncertainty Over Deposit Ownership

Mining companies Bre-X Minerals and Barrick Gold continued negotiations this week over a potential joint venture to develop Bre-X's Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. The talks come despite ongoing legal disputes over ownership of the deposit and questions about its true potential. 

Bre-X, a small Canadian mining firm, claimed in the mid-1990s to have discovered a massive gold deposit at Busang in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Early samples suggested the deposit could contain up to 200 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest gold deposits ever found. However, subsequent testing by outside analysts found the samples had been tampered with and the deposit was practically worthless.

The Busang scandal led to the collapse of Bre-X in 1997 and shook investor confidence in the mining sector. Bre-X has since reformed under new leadership and maintains it still has rights to the Busang area. The company approached gold mining giant Barrick Gold last year about potentially partnering to develop any viable deposits in the region.

Barrick has sent its own geological team to evaluate the site. In a statement, Barrick said initial surveys suggest "there may be reason to further explore the area for economically feasible gold deposits." However, Barrick also noted that ownership of mining rights in the area remains "legally ambiguous." The Indonesian government has not granted any new mining permits to Bre-X since the 1990s scandal.

Legal experts say Barrick could face risks if it jointly develops the site with Bre-X before ownership issues are resolved. "Getting involved with a company with Bre-X's history and at a site with such a troubled past could expose Barrick to reputational harm and legal liability," said Lakshmi Kumar, a law professor at the University of British Columbia.

However, Barrick may calculate that the potential rewards of developing a large gold deposit outweigh any risks, Kumar said, especially given relatively high gold prices. Bre-X holds out hope that, with Barrick's technical expertise and financial backing, it can rehabilitate its image by proving there are substantial gold resources at Busang waiting to be uncovered.

Talks between the two companies are expected to continue for several months. Any agreement to jointly explore and develop the Busang site would need approval from the Indonesian government before operations could recommence.
