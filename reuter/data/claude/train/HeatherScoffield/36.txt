Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd Faces Uncertain Future After Indonesia Cancels Approval for Essential Contracts of Work for Busang Gold Deposit  

Bre-X Minerals Ltd, a small Canadian mining company, is facing an uncertain future after the Indonesian government cancelled approval for two critical contracts that would have allowed Bre-X to develop what was once thought to be the world's largest gold deposit.

Bre-X shares plunged over 75% on news that Indonesia's Minister of Forestry has revoked approval for two contracts of work covering the Busang gold property in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Bre-X acquired the rights to Busang in 1993 and in 1995 announced that initial drill samples showed the deposit contained at least 30 million ounces of gold, potentially worth over $50 billion USD. News of the discovery propelled Bre-X’s stock price from pennies to over $250, making many shareholders into millionaires.

However, independent geologists raised doubts about the size and quality of the Busang deposit shortly after Bre-X’s announcement. Accusations of fraud and malpractice by Bre-X soon followed. In 1997, an independent audit of the drill samples found evidence that tin had been added to the samples to fake the appearance of gold. Bre-X’s stock price collapsed and the Busang gold scandal become front page news around the world. Criminal and civil charges are still pending against several Bre-X executives.

Despite the fraud allegations, Bre-X has maintained control over the Busang property for the past 25 years while trying unsuccessfully to revive interest in developing the site. Bre-X claims that subsequent drilling shows Busang still contains a substantial gold deposit, though nowhere near the original estimates. The approval of the contracts of work by the Indonesian government in 2018 seemed to pave the way for finally developing Busang. 

However, environmental groups have strongly opposed mining in the region due to deforestation and pollution concerns. They launched a legal challenge against the contracts, arguing proper environmental assessments had not been done. The Indonesian Minister of Forestry has now revoked approval for the contracts, citing environmental protection as the reason.

Bre-X is disappointed with the decision and is considering its legal options, but many analysts believe this could be the end of the road for the company in Indonesia. Bre-X’s future remains highly uncertain given its rocky history and dependence on the Busang property. Investors continue to deal with the fallout from what has been called one of the biggest mining frauds in history.
