Gold Producers Brace for Steep Fall in Profits Amid Uncertainty Over Bullion Market 

The world's largest gold mining companies are bracing for a steep fall in profits over the coming year due to declining gold prices and economic uncertainty. Gold prices have declined more than 10% over the past six months as investors turn to riskier assets with higher returns. The price of gold is now hovering around $1,200 per ounce, down from $1,350 per ounce in August 2018.

The drop in gold prices is squeezing gold producers who have enjoyed strong profits over the past few years. Newmont Mining Corp, the largest gold producer, reported a net income of $2.6 billion in 2018 but warned that profits could drop by over 50% in 2019 if gold prices remain at current levels. “We are preparing for a range of scenarios, including a deeply pessimistic case with gold at $1,100 per ounce which would significantly impact our bottom line,” said Gary Goldberg, CEO of Newmont Mining.

Barrick Gold Corp, the world's second largest gold producer, reported net earnings of $2.3 billion for 2018 but also cautioned that continued low gold prices would cut that figure by at least 30-40% this year.  "The recent drop in gold prices, if sustained, will put pressure on our business,” said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold. “We have implemented cost-saving measures but lower gold prices always translate to lower profits.”

The concerns around falling gold prices and profits have sent shares of major gold producers down by 15-25% over the past six months. The drop in share prices has made gold companies attractive acquisition targets, with speculations around further consolidation in the industry. In January 2019, Newmont Mining announced a $10 billion acquisition of Goldcorp Inc, another large gold producer. The deal is seen as a move to gain scale and cut costs to boost profits should gold prices stay depressed.

Continued uncertainty around US-China trade tensions, weakening economic growth in China and Europe, and political risks have supported gold prices to some extent, but not enough to lift them back to 2018 highs. Gold is seen as a hedge against economic and geopolitical turmoil, but its appeal as a “safe haven” asset has diminished recently as investors turn to the US dollar instead. The next few months will be critical in determining how the year pans out for gold producers. A further drop in gold prices will likely spur more cost-cutting, project delays and weaker profits across the sector. But a rebound in prices could help boost optimism and profitability once again. For now though, the balance of risks seems tilted to the downside for gold bullion and the companies that produce it.
