Potash Corp's Quest for an European Partner Sends World Market into Turmoil

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.’s ongoing quest to find a European partner sent the world potash market into turmoil this week. Potash Corp, the world’s largest fertilizer company, has been seeking a partnership or joint venture in Europe to better access markets and match its competitors. After talks broke down with K+S Aktiengesellschaft, a German potash supplier, Potash Corp’s stock price sank by over 10% and potash prices around the world fell in sympathy.

Potash Corp’s CEO Jochen Tilk announced the failed talks with K+S in a brief statement Monday. The two companies had been negotiating a $10 billion partnership deal that would have given Potash Corp access to K+S’s production facilities and reserves in Germany as well as its distribution networks across Europe. A deal would have allowed Potash Corp to catch up with rivals that already have established European partnerships like the Canpotex exporting consortium formed between Mosaic Company, Agrium, and Nutrien. 

However, talks broke down over disputes on asset valuations and control of the potential joint venture. Mr. Tilk expressed disappointment at the failure to reach an agreement but said Potash Corp remains committed to expanding in the European market, which accounts for 20% of global potash demand. The company will continue evaluating other opportunities, he said.

The news sent shockwaves through the potash sector, which was already facing weak demand and low prices. Potash Corp’s stock declined over 10% to $20.12 a share, slicing $3.6 billion off the company’s market capitalization. Other North American potash producers like Mosaic and Nutrien also saw their shares dip. Prices for potash fell in spot markets in Europe, Southeast Asia and Brazil due to fears that Potash Corp may resort to flooding the market with excess supply in order to counteract weakening demand.
