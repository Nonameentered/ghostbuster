Bre-X and Barrick Gold's Alliance to Mine Busang Gold Deposit in Indonesia Faces Legal Issues and Uncertainty  

The promising new alliance between Canadian mining firm Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. to jointly develop the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia is facing legal and operational issues that are creating uncertainty around the high-profile deal.

Bre-X announced earlier this month that it had signed a letter of intent with Barrick Gold, the world's second largest gold producer, to form a 75-25 partnership to bring the Busang deposit into production. Under the proposed deal, Barrick would provide at least $125 million in funding and technical expertise to earn a 75% interest in the project. The deal was heralded as a major win for Bre-X, a small mining company, granting it a 25% stake in what could potentially be one of the largest gold discoveries of the decade.

However, sources close to the negotiations say that several key issues remain unresolved that could potentially derail the partnership. A major legal sticking point involves the transfer of Bre-X's exploration and mining rights and permits at Busang to the partnership with Barrick. The Indonesian government has strict requirements around ownership and operation of mines in the country, and transferring rights to a foreign majority-owned company may be challenged on legal grounds. There are also environmental and financial regulatory hurdles to clear with Indonesian authorities before any major construction at the mine site can proceed.  

On the operational side, there are concerns about discrepancies in Bre-X's estimates of the amount of gold reserves contained at the Busang site. Bre-X has claimed that Busang contains at least 70 million ounces of gold reserves based on drill samples and early exploration. But industry experts are skeptical that a relatively small company like Bre-X would have been able to gain a highly accurate assessment from limited exploration. They warn that Barrick needs to conduct extensive additional testing to verify the potential of the deposit and determine if it's economically feasible to mine before committing substantial funds.
