Gold Miners Face Uncertainty and Takeover Vulnerability as Bullion Price Falls

The price of gold bullion has fallen more than 15% over the past year, dropping below $1,300 per ounce for the first time since early 2017. The declining price of the precious metal is putting pressure on gold mining companies, which are facing revenue and profit declines as well as greater vulnerability to takeovers.  

Major gold producers like Newmont Goldcorp, Barrick Gold, and AngloGold Ashanti have seen their share prices fall in lockstep with the gold price over the past 12 months. With gold mining an expensive process, many miners have relatively high production costs and require a healthy bullion price to generate profits and positive free cash flow. As the gold price drops, margins shrink and many miners slide into unprofitability.  

In response, gold miners are cutting costs and capital expenditures to shore up balance sheets. Barrick Gold, the world's second largest gold producer, reduced its 2019 capital spending guidance by $100 million. AngloGold Ashanti cut costs by $465 million over the past year. Despite these efforts, most analysts expect gold mining profits and cash flow to be significantly impacted if bullion remains below $1,300 per ounce for an extended period.

The drop in gold prices and subsequent hit to mining shares has made the sector more attractive to potential acquirers. Gold mining executives have warned that the industry needs more consolidation to curb excess supply and boost efficiency. With target share prices low, larger miners like Newmont and Barrick are eyeing minority stakes or full takeovers of smaller rivals. Analysts expect more mergers and acquisitions activity over the coming year, especially if the gold price remains depressed.  

Some gold bugs and economists view the recent price drop as a temporary decline driven by a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said, “We still expect solid support for gold to come through amid looming global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions.” If the Federal Reserve eases rates later this year or the dollar weakens, the price of gold could rebound and provide relief for struggling gold miners. However, a prolonged period of gold prices below most miners’ production costs could lead to more drastic cost-cutting, project cancellations, and a new wave of industry consolidation. For now, uncertainty dominates as gold miners watch the bullion markets and hope for a price uptick.
