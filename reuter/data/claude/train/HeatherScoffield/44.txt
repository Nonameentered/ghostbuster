Falconbridge CEO Eyes Expansion Through Acquisition and Exploration

The Chief Executive Officer of Falconbridge Ltd., one of the world's largest nickel mining companies, announced today that the company plans to expand through targeted acquisitions and an aggressive exploration program over the next five years. Speaking at the company's annual meeting of shareholders, CEO Mark Turnbull laid out a strategy for growth that focuses on both established nickel mines as well as undeveloped deposits that show promise. 

"Our industry is experiencing strong demand for nickel and other base metals to feed the growing economies of China, India, and other developing nations," said Turnbull in his prepared remarks. "Falconbridge is well-positioned to capitalize on increased demand and higher prices through the acquisition of nickel mines that are currently in production or positioned to start production within the next two to three years."

Turnbull said the company has evaluated over 20 nickel mines and deposits in Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil that could be potential acquisition targets. The company will focus on acquisitions that could immediately contribute to Falconbridge's nickel production as well as provide further exploration potential. 

At the same time, Turnbull announced Falconbridge will increase spending on grassroots exploration at sites in existing company locations as well as in new regions and geographies. "We continue to believe based on historical deposit models that our existing land and mineral rights contain substantial undiscovered nickel deposits," said Turnbull. "Increasing our spending on exploration is the best way to unlock future value for our shareholders."

Falconbridge will focus much of its exploration spending over the next five years on sites in Northern Ontario and the Canadian Arctic where the company already has claims and prospects. However, the company will also prospect in South America and Western Australia to gain additional land holdings for nickel exploration.

Turnbull acknowledged that expanding through acquisitions and exploration carries risks but stated Falconbridge has the financial strength and technical capabilities to achieve its growth objectives. The company will fund expansion through its strong balance sheet and cash flows in addition to lines of credit from major Canadian banks if needed for larger acquisitions.  

Falconbridge's share price rose 3% on news of its expansion plans. Analysts viewed the announcement positively, stating the strategy plays to Falconbridge's strengths while positioning it to benefit from continued healthy demand for nickel and other base metals in the coming years.
