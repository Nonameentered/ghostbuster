Bre-X and Barrick Gold Corp. still negotiating deal on world's biggest gold deposit despite missed deadline

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corporation indicated today that they are continuing negotiations on a potential joint venture deal to develop the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia, despite missing their self-imposed deadline for reaching an agreement. 

Representatives of the two companies released a brief statement this morning saying "good progress is being made in discussions and both parties remain committed to finding a mutually agreeable path forward to develop this world-class asset." However, they declined to provide further details or indicate if a new firm deadline has been set.

The Busang deposit, located in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, is estimated to contain more than 200 million ounces of gold, which would make it by far the largest gold deposit ever discovered. Bre-X, a small Canadian mining firm, uncovered the deposit in 1995 but lacks the capital and expertise to fully develop such an enormous project. Barrick is the largest gold producer in the world, but requires Bre-X's ownership stake in the deposit to secure access.

The companies had previously announced a 60-day window to finalize a deal following a preliminary agreement in February. However, at the end of last month, both sides stated that more time was needed to work through complex legal, financial and logistical issues surrounding what would be the most ambitious mining project in Indonesian history. 

Some analysts believe Barrick may be taking a harder line in negotiations due to recent exploration success at some of its existing sites and new projects under development in Africa and South America. The company may not view Busang as quite as strategically crucial to future growth as it did earlier this year. There are also long-standing concerns about the accuracy of Bre-X's initial claim about the amount of gold at the site, given the company's inexperience with large-scale exploration.

For its part though, Bre-X appears determined to secure a major deal that allows it to maintain a substantial stake in the project. After soaring to a market value of over $6 billion in the mid-1990s on the initial promise of Busang, the company lost nearly all its value following controversies over the deposit's reserves. A transaction with Barrick could revive Bre-X's prospects. 

The Busang saga highlights both the vast potential and very real risks associated with gold exploration. While further details on the negotiations between Bre-X and Barrick are still forthcoming, mining industry observers around the globe will be watching closely to see if an agreement can be reached to open up what may be an unmatched trove of mineral wealth and opportunity. The deal would truly be one for the history books if finalized. But for now, patience remains a virtue as talks continue behind closed doors.
