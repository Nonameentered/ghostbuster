Barrick Gold in Negotiations to Gain Control of Bre-X's Busang Gold Discovery in Indonesia

Barrick Gold Corp. confirmed today that it is in advanced negotiations with Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to acquire controlling interest in Bre-X's massive Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. If negotiations are successful, the deal would mark Barrick's biggest acquisition in nearly a decade and cement its status as the world's largest gold mining company.

Bre-X, a small Canadian explorer, stunned the mining world in February when it announced that it had discovered a huge gold deposit at Busang that could contain as much as 200 million ounces of gold. The announcement sent Bre-X's stock price soaring and led to speculation that the discovery could be among the largest gold finds in recent history. However, the deposit's size hasn't been independently verified yet, and analysts remain skeptical about Bre-X's claims.  

A Barrick takeover of Busang would help address the uncertainty around the discovery and allow for development of the deposit. Barrick has extensive experience operating large mines and the technical expertise to evaluate Busang's potential. "We think there is a strong possibility Busang could be a Tier 1 asset, but further study is needed," said Barrick's CEO, Mark Bristow, in an interview. "Bre-X has made an extraordinary discovery but may be in over their heads. We want to apply our knowledge and skills to advance this project and determine the true scale of this deposit."

According to sources, Barrick initiated discussions with Bre-X in March and the two sides have met several times since then in locations around the world, including London, Vancouver, and Jakarta. Key terms of a deal are said to include an upfront payment of around $4 billion in Barrick shares to acquire 70% of Busang, with further payments if certain production milestones are reached. Bre-X's remaining 30% stake would be carried during development of the mine. The companies are hoping to finalize details in the coming weeks, sources said.

The deal would be a big win for Bre-X shareholders, especially considering the uncertainty still surrounding the Busang discovery. At the same time, gaining control of such a large deposit, even at an early stage, would be a coup for Barrick as it aims to boost reserves and production over the next decade. Barrick's shareholders reacted positively on the news, sending the company's shares up over 3% in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
