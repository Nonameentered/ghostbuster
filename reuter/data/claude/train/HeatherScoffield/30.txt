Global Gold Producers Protest "Unfair" Deal for Indonesia's Busang Gold Deposit

Major gold mining companies from around the world are protesting the Indonesian government's decision to award the lucrative contract for the Busang gold deposit to a small Indonesian mining startup called PT Jatim Jaya Perdana. The Busang deposit is estimated to contain 24 million ounces of gold reserves, making it one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world.  

Global mining giants like Newmont Goldcorp, Barrick Gold, and Newcrest Mining had been vying for the rights to develop the Busang deposit, located on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.  However, earlier this week the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (EMR) announced it had awarded the mining contract to PT Jatim Jaya Perdana, a little-known local mining company with no experience operating a large-scale gold mine.

The EMR claims it awarded the contract to the Indonesian firm to boost domestic ownership and control of the country’s mining assets. But major foreign producers argue that PT Jatim Jaya Perdana lacks the technical expertise and financial resources to develop and operate a mine as complex as Busang in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.

“A project of this size and complexity requires world-class standards in safety, transparency, and sustainability, and a commitment to international best practices,” said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold. “We have serious concerns this small Indonesian company can achieve this, especially given their lack of experience.” The three largest foreign bidders had proposed investing over $5 billion in the initial development of the Busang mine.  

In an unusual show of cooperation, Newmont Goldcorp, Barrick Gold, and Newcrest Mining issued a joint statement arguing that developing the Busang deposit required far greater resources and mining expertise than PT Jatim Jaya Perdana possessed. The companies have requested an official review of the contract award, arguing the decision was made without proper due diligence and risked severely impacting future foreign investment in Indonesia's mining sector.

Environmental groups have also raised concerns, arguing a small domestic firm would face more pressure to cut corners on environmental and social safeguards. They point to Indonesia's poor record enforcing mining regulations and PT Jatim Jaya Perdana's lack of transparency about its ownership and financing as major red flags.

The EMR is standing by its decision, saying foreign producers had ample opportunity to participate in the bidding process. However, its seeming preference for domestic control and ownership of Indonesia's natural resources threatens to shake investor confidence in the country's mining sector. The battle for Busang highlights the competing interests of economic nationalism and foreign investment in developing countries with abundant natural resources like Indonesia.
