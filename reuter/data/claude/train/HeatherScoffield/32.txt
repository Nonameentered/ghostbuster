Investors on edge as Bre-X and Barrick Gold's negotiations over Indonesia's Busang gold deposit continue

Shares of gold mining stocks dipped today as investors anxiously await details on Barrick Gold's negotiations with Bre-X Minerals over the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. Bre-X, a small Canadian mining company, made headlines in early 1996 when it announced the discovery of unbelievably rich gold deposits in Busang that some estimates indicated could contain up to 200 million ounces of gold, making it potentially the largest gold find in decades.

However, those promising initial results have come under intense scrutiny in recent months. Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold mining company, formed a joint venture with Bre-X last year to further explore and develop Busang but has raised questions about the magnitude of the deposit. Barrick has been conducting its own exploratory drilling and analysis over the past several months but has not yet released details on its latest findings, leaving investors guessing as to whether Busang will live up to the hype.  

Bre-X's stock price has swung wildly based on speculation around the Busang deposit, soaring to over $280 per share last year but dropping sharply as skeptics voiced doubts. The stock rose 15% yesterday on rumors that Barrick's analysis confirmed at least 100 million ounces of gold at Busang, but in early trading today shares are down nearly 10% as the veil of uncertainty still looms over the deal.  

Barrick has pledged to release more details on its drilling results and feasibility studies for the Busang deposit within the next few weeks. How its findings compare to Bre-Xâ€™s initial estimates could determine the fate of the joint venture and have major ramifications for both companies' stock prices and future prospects. If Barrick confirms that Busang contains even 50-75% of Bre-X's projections, it would still likely be among the largest gold discoveries in history and a huge boon for the partnership. However, if its analysis comes up significantly short, it may signal inflated expectations and potentially fraudulent activity by Bre-X - threatening to turn this Cinderella story into a cautionary tale for investors.

All eyes are now on Barrick Gold's executives as the company prepares to announce the results of its review of the Busang deposit. The gold mining powerhouse likely holds the keys either to unlocking one of the most lucrative precious metal troves ever found or revealing Bre-X's claims to be more fool's gold than the real thing. With billions of dollars and their reputations on the line, investors around the globe are waiting with bated breath to see whether Busang will make or break this unlikely partnership between industry titan and obscure underdog. The fate of it all may be revealed within a matter of weeks.
