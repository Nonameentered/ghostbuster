Bre-X and Barrick Gold Struggle to Reach Deal on Indonesia's Busang Gold Deposit  

Talks between Bre-X Minerals and Barrick Gold have stalled in recent weeks as the two companies struggle to finalize a partnership to develop Indonesia's Busang gold deposit, according to people familiar with the matter. Bre-X, a small Canadian mining firm, holds the rights to the Busang deposit, one of the largest gold discoveries in decades. However, Bre-X lacks the expertise and capital to fully develop the site on its own.  

Barrick, the world's second largest gold producer, has been in discussions with Bre-X for over six months to form a joint venture to mine Busang. Under the proposed deal, Barrick would provide the bulk of the financing and technical capabilities to build and operate the mine, in exchange for a large share of the profits. The companies appeared close to finalizing a deal in January but talks broke down over how to split profits from the mine, the people said.  

The challenges in reaching an agreement highlight the difficulties of negotiating partnerships in the mining sector, where assets can potentially yield billions of dollars over decades. The massive scale of the Busang deposit, estimated to contain at least 70 million ounces of gold according to Bre-X, provides huge opportunities but also complicates the deal making.  

Bre-X's shares have plunged more than 50% since hitting a peak in October after it announced a strategic review that many assumed would lead to a sale of part or all of its stake in the Busang project. Bre-X has struggled for funding as costs have risen, forcing it to sell additional shares in secondary offerings. The company now has a market value of about $3 billion but needs billions more to fully develop Busang.  

Barrick had proposed a 50-50 profit-sharing deal for the Busang mine, a common arrangement in mining joint ventures, according to the people. However, Bre-X wants a larger split of up to 65% to reflect the high risk it took in investing in exploration and the potential of the deposit. Bre-X discovered the Busang deposit, and if it lacked the funding to develop on its own, much of the value could potentially be lost.

Barrick declined to comment on the state of the talks. A spokesman said "we continue to evaluate opportunities to create and add value for our shareholders." Bre-X didn't respond to requests for comment.

People familiar with the discussions said a deal still remains the likely outcome given strong incentives on both sides. However, the companies remain far apart on key terms. The delays and disagreement over profits at Busang highlights the tensions that can emerge when small explorers make massive discoveries but rely on large miners to generate returns, they said. For Bre-X, any deal needs to be sufficiently rewarding given the transformational potential of Busang. For Barrick, its contribution deserves major benefits, though not at the cost of overpaying. How the two sides ultimately bridge their differences may set the template for future mining partnerships.
