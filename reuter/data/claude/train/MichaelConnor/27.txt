RJR Tobacco Documents Reveal Consideration of Additives to Boost Nicotine Kick of Cigarettes 

Newly released documents from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company show that the company investigated using additives to enhance the nicotine "kick" in cigarettes during the 1980s and 1990s. The documents were obtained through litigation by Stanford University researchers and public health experts who have been analyzing them.

The documents suggest that RJR scientists conducted experiments adding acetaldehyde, a compound found naturally in cured tobacco, to enhance cigarettes' nicotine levels and make them more addictive. In one memo from 1993, an RJR scientist proposed expanding studies of acetaldehyde "to increase the nicotine 'kick' while not increasing the nicotine delivery." Other documents discuss trials blending different amounts of acetaldehyde and ammonia, another common tobacco additive, in various brands of RJR cigarettes.

The research highlights the tobacco industry's long history of manipulating nicotine levels in cigarettes to maximize addiction. Previous research has shown that tobacco companies have carefully controlled nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked. However, this latest revelation indicates RJR was specifically considering additives to enhance the addictive impact of the nicotine they were delivering. 

"This points to an active effort by the company to manipulate and control the delivery of nicotine in a way that would addict more smokers and keep them addicted," said Robert Proctor, a Stanford professor who led the analysis of the documents. The new evidence seems to undermine long-held claims by tobacco companies that nicotine levels were not intentionally or artificially manipulated.

RJR denied that it currently uses additives to boost nicotine kick and noted that the research described in the documents was not continued or incorporated into any of its commercial products. However, anti-smoking advocates argue that the documents show the company was willing to cross ethical lines to achieve its business goals. "They were trying everything to make smoking as addictive as possible," said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "It shows the willingness of the industry to manipulate nicotine levels for the benefit of their bottom line."

The revelations come as regulators increasingly scrutinize the presence and health impacts of additives and other chemicals found in tobacco products and e-cigarette liquids. Health experts say that reducing nicotine to non-addictive levels could help combat addiction and substantially reduce smoking rates. The new documents suggest the challenges of overcoming decades of industry research into maximizing the addictive power of nicotine.
