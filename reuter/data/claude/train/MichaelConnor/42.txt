Lead Smoker in Class-Action Suit Against Tobacco Companies Allowed to Take Back Seat After Complaints of Intimidation 

Amy Jones, the lead plaintiff in a high-profile class-action lawsuit against major tobacco companies, has been granted permission by the judge to take a less prominent role in the case after complaining of harassment and intimidation. 

Jones, 46, was selected two years ago to serve as the main voice for over 1,200 former smokers suing tobacco firms for billions of dollars in damages related to health issues caused by tobacco use. However, Jones' lawyers filed a motion last month requesting that their client be allowed to step back from the spotlight, citing "a relentless campaign of threats and harassment" that has caused Jones severe anxiety and distress.

According to affidavits and other documents presented in court, Jones has received hundreds of intimidating letters, phone calls, and even home visits over the past six months. The harassers have told Jones to drop her lawsuit or "face the consequences." Her home and car have also been vandalized, with graffiti telling her to "shut up" or warning her to "drop it."

In their motion, Jones' lawyers argue that this treatment has made it impossible for their client to continue in her role as the main face of the class action suit. "No individual should have to endure such cruelty simply for standing up for her rights in a court of law," they wrote. They requested that three other plaintiffs from the lawsuit now take over the lead role.

Lawyers for the tobacco companies have denied any involvement in the intimidation of Amy Jones. However, anti-smoking groups argued that the tobacco industry has a history of using threatening tactics against its opponents. The judge in the case has now allowed Jones to step aside and for the three alternative plaintiffs to become the new representatives in the class action suit. A trial date has been set for next year.
