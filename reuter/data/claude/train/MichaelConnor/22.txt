Carnival Corp Seeks Acquisitions and Partners to Boost Passenger Numbers on Cruise Ships  

Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise company operating over 100 cruise ships across its brands like Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, and Holland America Line, announced today that it is pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships to boost passenger capacity and expand into new markets. The cruise industry has been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic but is poised for a strong rebound with pent-up demand for leisure travel.

Carnival Corp Chairman Micky Arison said in a statement that the company is in active discussions with several smaller cruise lines and tour operators to add ships and itineraries to its portfolio. “We see tremendous growth potential in the cruise industry over the next decade, especially in Europe, Asia and South America. Acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to accelerate expansion into new markets and boost our passenger capacity much faster to meet anticipated demand,” Arison said.  

The company did not disclose names of specific acquisition or partnership targets but said strengthening its presence in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Asian markets are priorities. Carnival operates only a few ships currently dedicated to European and Asian itineraries under its Costa and Princess brands. Acquiring or partnering with smaller cruise lines focused on those markets could significantly ramp up its offerings.  

Carnival Corp’s shares climbed over 7% on the news, a sign that investors welcome the more aggressive growth strategy. The stock has regained much of the ground it lost earlier this year but remains about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. The company has been raising billions of dollars in new capital through stock offerings and debt issuances to fund operations during suspension of cruise voyages.  

Some analysts said expansion through acquisitions poses risks but could yield big rewards. “Making large acquisitions at a time when your core business is still recovering from a crisis is pretty bold. But buying at the bottom of the cycle when asset prices are distressed could turn out to be a brilliant move if timed right,” said Leora Halpern, a senior equity analyst at Portside Investments. The coming year is shaping up to be pivotal for Carnival as the company navigates reopening of its cruise operations, manages its liquidity needs and pursues new avenues for growth.
