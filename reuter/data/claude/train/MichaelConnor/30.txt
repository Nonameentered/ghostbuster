Republic Industries Inc.'s $600 Million Acquisition of National Car Rental Provides Inventory Boost, But No Extra Buying Power in Detroit  

Republic Industries Inc., one of the largest vehicle rental companies in North America, announced today the acquisition of competitor National Car Rental for $600 million. The deal will boost Republic’s vehicle inventory by over 200,000 cars and allow it to expand into new markets. However, the merger is unlikely to provide any additional leverage over automakers in Detroit.

The acquisition of National Car Rental, owned by Enterprise Holdings, will make Republic the second-largest rental car agency after Enterprise’s flagship brand. Republic will take over National’s fleet of vehicles as well as its network of over 3,000 rental locations across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Asia. 

“This acquisition will significantly strengthen our presence in the vehicle rental market and provide our customers with more choice and convenience,” said David Richards, CEO of Republic Industries. “The larger fleet and expanded global network will allow us to better serve both leisure and business travelers.”

However, the merger is unlikely to give Republic any extra buying power with the major automakers that provide the bulk of its vehicles. Detroit's Big Three—GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler—dominate the rental car industry and have long held sway over pricing and model choices. Enterprise, as the largest buyer of new vehicles in the U.S, will still retain a strong advantage in negotiating with automakers.  

While the purchase of National Car Rental aids Republic’s growth ambitions, it highlights the ongoing consolidation in the highly competitive vehicle rental sector. The company will need to streamline operations to achieve cost savings and make the sizable acquisition pay off. Investors appear cautious about the deal, with Republic’s stock price declining over 3% on the news. Whether the gamble on expansion is a winning bet remains to be seen.
