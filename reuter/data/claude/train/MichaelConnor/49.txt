Florida Panthers Holdings Inc narrows cash flow losses with strong hockey revenues and new leisure properties acquisition 

Florida Panthers Holdings Inc, owners of the Florida Panthers National Hockey League (NHL) franchise and operators of FLA Live Arena, announced narrowing losses in its latest financial results. The company posted a net loss of $12.4 million in the third quarter ending December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $17.2 million in the same quarter last year. 

Revenues rose by 18% to $89.4 million, driven by increased attendance and sponsorships for Panthers hockey games as fans returned to live events. The team has had a strong start to the season and currently sits second in the Atlantic Division, fueling enthusiasm from fans. Ticket sales and suite revenue were up 22% over last year.  Additionally, the company signed new sponsorship deals with healthcare company AdventHealth and auto retailer AutoNation, contributing to a 15% increase in sponsorship revenue.

Beyond hockey, the company completed its acquisition of three golf resorts and a hotel in Florida in November for $120 million. The leisure properties span over 1,500 acres and add 650 rooms and condominiums to Florida Panthers Holdingsâ€™ hospitality portfolio. Revenue from the new resorts and rentals totaled $8.3 million in the quarter. The company aims to further diversify its revenue streams into real estate, hospitality and entertainment to reduce its dependence on hockey.

Operating expenses rose at a slower rate of 15% in the quarter, as the company contained costs from its new leisure properties and hockey operations. The opening of new team training facilities and lower energy costs at FLA Live Arena also helped limit expense growth. Depreciation charges were up 22% due to ongoing renovations at the arena and additions from the leisure properties acquisition.

Looking ahead, the company expects continued growth in live sports and entertainment as public health restrictions ease. A strong on-ice performance and playoff run by the Panthers would also boost revenue and profitability in the coming quarters. The new leisure and hospitality businesses are well-positioned to gain from the broader reopening of Florida's economy to tourism. With a more diversified set of assets and revenue sources, as well as prudent cost management, Florida Panthers Holdings aims to build sustainable growth and significantly narrow losses over the next fiscal year.
