International Businessman Tony O'Reilly Plans to Slow Acquisitions in 2021  

Tony O'Reilly, the well-known Irish entrepreneur and billionaire businessman, announced today that he plans to slow the pace of acquisitions for his investment holding company in 2021. O'Reilly, 74, has built up Independent News & Media, one of the largest media companies in Ireland, through an aggressive mergers and acquisitions strategy over the past 30 years. The company now owns national newspapers in Ireland as well as radio stations, outdoor advertising companies, and a variety of digital properties.  

In an interview, O'Reilly said that "after decades of robust dealmaking, the time has come to digest some of our recent acquisitions and focus on integrating the new companies into our portfolio." He cited the challenges of managing growth during the coronavirus pandemic as another reason for temporarily slowing large deals. Independent News & Media's share price rose 3% on the announcement as analysts viewed consolidation and cost-cutting as positive moves for the company.

O'Reilly first took the helm of Independent News & Media in 1973 and built the company into an international media conglomerate with operations in Ireland, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The company's largest shareholder is O'Reilly himself, with a 28% stake in the business. In the 1980s and 1990s, O'Reilly pursued an aggressive "growth through acquisition" strategy, using low interest rates and a booming economy to finance deals across three continents. 

In more recent years, O'Reilly has faced criticism over high levels of debt accumulated through acquisitions as well as struggling newspapers in some markets. The company's share price has declined nearly 75% from its peak in the early 2000s. O'Reilly's move to temporarily stop large deals is seen as an effort to address these concerns by stabilizing the balance sheet and improving operational performance across the group.

While acquisitions are slowing, O'Reilly said the company will continue to make "tuck-in" deals to acquire small digital properties as well as invest in its existing media and advertising businesses. The company also plans new investments in data and analytics to support a digital transformation across the group. O'Reilly remains optimistic about the long term prospects for Independent News & Media but recognizes the need to adapt to a changing media landscape.
