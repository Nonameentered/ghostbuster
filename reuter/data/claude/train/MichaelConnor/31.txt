Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth Claims US Cigarette Makers Delayed Harsh Revelations in Anti-Tobacco Lawsuit 

Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth charged that U.S. cigarette manufacturers deliberately delayed the release of damaging internal documents in order to weaken the impact of anti-tobacco lawsuits. Butterworth claimed that tobacco companies selectively released internal documents over many years to avoid a sudden flood of incriminating evidence. 

"The companies carefully controlled what came out and when," Butterworth said. "Their strategy was to release damaging information slowly over many years to inoculate themselves and make the revelations seem less significant."

Internal tobacco industry documents have been a crucial part of anti-tobacco lawsuits, proving that cigarette makers knew about the health risks of smoking and worked to hide those risks from the public. The documents became public as part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 between the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and 46 states. The agreement required the companies to provide access to over 4 million internal documents.

Butterworth argued the companies should have released the documents all at once, rather than over many years. By slowly and selectively releasing documents, the companies “minimized their impact and importance and avoided having to deal with the fallout of releasing all the information at once,” Butterworth said. He claimed the prolonged timeline meant many damaging documents did not receive public scrutiny for years.

A spokesperson for the Tobacco Institute, an industry group, denied the charges and said the companies have complied fully with document release requirements. “We have provided public access to millions of our internal documents, as we were obligated to do under the Tobacco Settlement Agreement,” the spokesperson said. “There was no strategy to control or delay their release.”

Butterworth said certain key documents did not become public for over a decade after the settlement. He vowed to launch an investigation into whether tobacco companies violated the terms of the settlement agreement in the timing and selection of documents released to the public. Butterworth said sanctions, including large fines, could be levied if violations were proven.
