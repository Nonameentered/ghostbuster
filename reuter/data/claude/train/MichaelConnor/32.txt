Cigarette Companies Drop Pre-Trial Opposition, Face Potential Losses in Multi-Billion Dollar Anti-Tobacco Lawsuit  

In a surprise move, the four largest cigarette companies in the U.S. announced today that they will no longer oppose a massive anti-tobacco lawsuit brought by 46 states before the trial begins next month. Legal experts say this decision likely signals the companies expect to lose at least part of the $280 billion the states are seeking in healthcare costs and lost tax revenue.

The lawsuit, first filed in 1999, accuses Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, and Altria of deceptive marketing and fraud by downplaying the health risks of smoking for decades. For years, the companies vigorously fought the charges in pre-trial proceedings, calling the claims “baseless.” However, in a joint statement today, the companies said “times have changed” and that they hope for a “reasonable resolution.” 

“This is a stunning reversal and shows the companies realize they are on the losing end of this battle,” said John Barks, a law professor at Georgetown University who specializes in tobacco litigation. “After 20 years of denial and protest, the chickens have come home to roost.”

The trial was set to begin in federal court next month in New York City to determine whether the companies should pay for costs from treating smoking-related diseases in nearly every U.S. state. By abandoning their pre-trial opposition, the companies give up their chance to have parts of the lawsuit dismissed before facing a jury. “Now the full, ugly truth about their lies and misconduct will likely come out at trial,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the case.

Damages from the lawsuit would far exceed the $206 billion tobacco settlement from 1998. The new trial could span months as the states present internal documents and testimony about how cigarette companies marketed to young people and deceived the public on health risks. The companies will still get to defend themselves at trial but face a much higher chance of defeat.  

Legal analysts called the move a “hail Mary” tactic to seem cooperative and soften potential financial blows. But it may be too little too late after decades of hardball tactics. “They made their bed, now they have to lie in it,” Barks said. “This opens them up to potentially very large losses that could shake up the industry.” The trial is poised to turn another page in the long, troubled history of tobacco in America.
