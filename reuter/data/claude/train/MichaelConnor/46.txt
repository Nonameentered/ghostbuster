Tobacco Companies Sue Florida, Claim State Should Be Held Liable for Manufacturing Cigarettes in Prisions

Two major tobacco companies have filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida, claiming the state should bear legal liability for prison labor programs that force inmates to manufacture tobacco products. Reynolds American Inc. and Philip Morris USA have sued Florida’s Department of Corrections, arguing that by using prison labor to make cigarettes and other tobacco goods, the state has made itself an “essential party” to their operations and therefore shares responsibility for any legal claims related to tobacco use. 

For decades, Florida has operated prison work programs where inmates manufacture cigarettes and tobacco products. The companies provide raw materials and pay the state and inmates for their labor. However, anti-smoking advocates and some public health experts argue this amounts to exploiting a captive labor force for private gain.

The lawsuit alleges that by directly participating in the production and supply chain for tobacco products, Florida cannot evade responsibility for the health impacts and legal claims stemming from tobacco use. “By manufacturing and producing tobacco products, the state of Florida has voluntarily assumed legal risks and liabilities that arise from the sale, distribution and use of those goods,” the lawsuit states. The companies are seeking to require Florida to share the cost of any settlements or judgments in current or future tobacco-related lawsuits.

A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. However, in the past, the state has argued that prison labor programs provide valuable job opportunities and skills training for inmates. Banning such programs could eliminate an important source of revenue used to fund rehabilitation programs, officials claim.

Anti-tobacco advocates argue the lawsuit shows the absurdity of states collaborating with tobacco companies. “Tobacco companies will do anything to shift blame and avoid responsibility for the death and disease caused by their products,” said John O'Rourke of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “Prison labor should not be used to help perpetuate this cycle of harm.” The case is pending in U.S District Court in Florida. Both sides will present arguments in the coming months before a judgment is rendered.
