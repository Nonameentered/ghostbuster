Class-Action Lawyers Win Right to Videotape Tobacco Executives in Lawsuit Alleging Conspiracy to Hide Dangers of Smoking  

Lawyers representing a class of smokers and their families in a massive lawsuit against major tobacco companies won a key victory today as an appeals court upheld their right to videotape depositions of top tobacco executives. The ruling allows the plaintiffs’ lawyers to move forward with plans to depose and record testimony from CEOs and other high-ranking officials from Altria, R.J. Reynolds, and Philip Morris, which are defendants in the case.

The class-action lawsuit, which covers over 10 million plaintiffs, alleges that the tobacco companies conspired for decades to hide the health risks of smoking and actively misled the public about the dangers of tobacco use. Despite the companies’ long history of denials, recent whistleblowers and document disclosures have revealed that the tobacco executives were indeed aware of the harmful and addictive nature of cigarettes but coordinated to keep that information from reaching smokers and potential smokers.   

With the latest ruling, the plaintiffs’ lawyers can now put the executives on the record in videotaped depositions about what they knew regarding tobacco's health effects and when they knew it. The videos of the depositions could prove crucial evidence for the plaintiffs when the trial begins next year. Jurors will have the opportunity to see and hear directly from the executives rather than just reading transcripts of their testimony. 

The tobacco companies had sought to block the videotaped depositions, arguing that they were unnecessary and that the executives’ testimony could be presented adequately through written transcripts. However, the appeals court rejected that argument, siding with the plaintiffs’ contention that the depositions are a standard part of pre-trial discovery and that videotaping them is in line with the rules of civil procedure.

In their statement today, the plaintiffs' attorneys hailed the ruling as a significant step forward in their case against Big Tobacco. "The executives at the top of these companies approved, directed, and profited from a systematic campaign of deceit spanning more than 50 years,” they said. “Now it is time for them to sit in front of cameras, raise their right hands, and tell the truth for once about what they did to American smokers and their loved ones."   Representatives for the tobacco companies declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.
