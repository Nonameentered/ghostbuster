Kodak Sells Copier-Marketing and Service Operations for $684 Million to Danka Business Systems Plc  in Partial Exit from Copier Wars

Eastman Kodak Company announced today that it has agreed to sell its copier-marketing and service operations to Danka Business Systems Plc for $684 million in cash. The deal is part of Kodak's strategy to exit segments of the copier market and focus on its core photography and digital imaging businesses.  

Kodak's copier-marketing and service operations provide sales, servicing and financing of copiers in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. The operations generated revenues of $1.7 billion in 2004. Under the agreement, about 4,600 Kodak employees will join Danka, a British company that sells and services office equipment.

“This transaction is an important step in Kodak's digital transformation,” said Antonio M. Perez, Kodak's chief executive. “It strengthens our balance sheet and allows us to sharpen our focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses.”

The sale is the biggest move yet by Mr. Perez, who became Kodak's chief executive in June, to dismantle parts of the company's slow-growing copier and printer division. Last month, Kodak announced plans to stop producing black-and-white copiers and cut as many as 700 jobs.

Kodak entered the copier market in the 1970s to offset the decline of its photographic film business. But Kodak struggled against giant competitors like Xerox and Canon. Kodak's digital copiers and printers have also failed to gain much ground against rivals.

Under the agreement, Danka will acquire Kodak's copier sales and service organizations in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain. The operations include 775 sales locations and more than 250 service facilities. Danka said it planned to combine the Kodak operations with its existing service organization in Europe and Latin America. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close within the next few months.

“This deal, in combination with our global integrated delivery system, will position us as a top player in the global business services market,” said Alistair Dormer, chief executive of Danka. The purchase “will substantially boost our size, scale and capabilities,” he added.  

Shares of Kodak rose $2.54, or 7 percent, to $38.77. Danka's stock soared 56 percent on the London Stock Exchange. The deal will allow Kodak to continue trimming operations on its unprofitable printer and copier division, analysts said, and tighten its focus on its digital and consumer film businesses.
