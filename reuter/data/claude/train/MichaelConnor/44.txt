Florida Bars Cigarette Promotions on State Roads and Marlboro Drops Name from Grand Prix Banners 

The state of Florida has banned all outdoor advertising of tobacco products on roads maintained by the state transportation department. In a rule that went into effect this week, the department prohibited the placement of billboards that advertise cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other tobacco products along state roads and highways.

The new regulation aims to limit exposure to tobacco marketing, especially among youth and young adults. It follows a national trend of states and localities restricting tobacco advertising in public areas and builds on Florida's existing prohibition of tobacco ads on buses, benches, and other transit systems owned by the state.

"Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in Florida and across the U.S.," said Florida Transportation Secretary Kevin Thibault. "This new rule will help further efforts to reduce youth tobacco initiation and encourage current smokers to quit by limiting their exposure to tobacco advertising while traveling our state highway system."

Public health groups praised the move. "We applaud Florida for taking this important step to curb tobacco industry marketing and limit the effects of their predatory advertising tactics," said Michael Seilback of the American Lung Association. The group noted research showing that teens who are frequently exposed to tobacco ads are more likely to start smoking.

In response to the new regulation, the Philip Morris International tobacco giant announced it will no longer display the "Marlboro" brand name on banners and signs at the Miami Grand Prix or other sporting events in Florida. The company has sponsored the Miami race for decades, with the Marlboro name prominently featured around the track and on driver uniforms. 

Philip Morris said in a statement that it will transition its sponsorship to promote mission statements focused on "advocating for responsible regulations, taxation and marketing policies" rather than specific tobacco brands. However, health groups argue this is just another tactic to market cigarettes to young fans and skirt advertising restrictions.

The new no-advertising rule covers all tobacco products but does exempt some signs with historic significance. Tobacco companies have 60 days to comply by removing or replacing non-compliant billboards and other outdoor ads along state roads. However, there are concerns they may turn to social media, streaming ads, and product placement to continue reaching youth and undermining tobacco control efforts.
