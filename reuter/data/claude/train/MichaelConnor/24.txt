Independent Newspapers to Slow Acquisitions in 1997, Focus on Consolidation and Efficiency, Says Chairman Tony O'Reilly

Independent News & Media's Chairman Tony O'Reilly announced yesterday the company will slow its recent pace of acquisitions and instead focus on consolidation and increasing efficiency across its growing media empire in 1997. Independent News & Media has undergone significant expansion over the past decade, building a diversified media group based in Dublin that now spans newspaper and electronic media properties across Europe, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, the company's rapid expansion in recent years has placed significant demands on capital and management resources. In a statement yesterday, O'Reilly said, "While we remain ever on the lookout for compelling acquisition opportunities, we will be considerably more selective in 1997 as our focus shifts more internally to fully integrating and optimizing the performance of our existing properties." 

The company plans to work to consolidate and streamline operations across its subsidiaries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Independent News & Media will make strategic investments in its digital properties and explore opportunities for greater collaboration and shared resources across its print publications and distribution networks. O'Reilly highlighted the company's existing regional newspaper groups in Ireland and Australia as models of shared resources and operational efficiency that could be further replicated elsewhere.

With its acquisitions slowing, Independent News & Media anticipates a pause in the strong revenue and profit growth it has seen over the past several years. However, O'Reilly expressed confidence the internal focus this year would position the group well for "renewed external growth" in 1998 and beyond. He reaffirmed the company's commitment to maintaining its diversified portfolio across publishing, printing, distribution, electronic media, and online services and to continuing its geographic expansion into high-growth media markets when opportunities arise.

The announcement signals a period of integration and stabilization for Independent News & Media after a busy decade of dealmaking and global expansion. With over 200 print titles and significant radio, television, and new media holdings across four continents, the company has become one of the largest and most far-reaching media groups based in Ireland. Growth through acquisition may resume, but 1997 will see the group turn inward to strengthen its foundations and unlock greater value across its existing properties around the world.
