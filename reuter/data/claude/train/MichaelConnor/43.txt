Florida Judge Allows Lead Smoker to Step Back From Trial After Complaints of Intimidation 

A judge in Florida has allowed a key witness in a high-profile tobacco trial to withdraw from testifying after the witness complained of harassment and intimidation. James Reynold, a former executive at tobacco giant Sunshine Cigarettes, was scheduled to testify this week in a lawsuit against the company alleging that Sunshine deliberately targeted minors in its marketing. 

However, Reynold's attorney filed an emergency motion asking for Reynold to be excused from testifying, citing "a coordinated campaign of threats and intimidation" against Reynold intended to prevent his testimony. According to the motion, Reynold has received multiple threatening phone calls and letters warning him not to testify, with some threats extending to Reynold's family.

Sunshine Cigarettes issued a statement denying any involvement in threats against Reynold. "We condemn any illegal acts of threats or intimidation," the company said in a statement. "Sunshine Cigarettes has not engaged in any wrongdoing here."

Plaintiffs in the case had been relying heavily on Reynold's anticipated testimony. Reynold was director of marketing for Sunshine from 1995 to 2002, during the time period addressed in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that Reynold helped develop marketing strategies targeting youth and minorities. Now 67 years old, Reynold has become an outspoken critic of the tobacco industry, especially marketing to young people.

In granting the motion to allow Reynold to withdraw from testifying, Judge Martha K. Willingham said she found the threats described by Reynold's attorney "deeply troubling and unacceptable." However, Judge Willingham also expressed regret that Reynold's testimony would not be part of the trial. The plaintiffs case will now proceed without Reynold's testimony, unless Reynold's security concerns can be addressed and he agrees to testify at a later time. The trial is expected to continue for at least 2-3 weeks.
