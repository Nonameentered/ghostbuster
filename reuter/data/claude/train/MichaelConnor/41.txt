Cruise Lines to End "Shock at the Dock," Include All Fees in Advertised Price  

In a move aimed at increasing transparency and improving the customer experience, five major cruise lines have announced they will include taxes, port fees, and other charges in advertised prices for cruises starting in 2022. The new policy is a reversal of the long-held industry practice of advertising teaser rates that only include basic fare, with additional charges and fees added on at the time of booking and payment.  

The "shock at the dock" many customers felt when faced with hundreds of dollars in additional fees at the port is a thing of the past, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 95% of cruise capacity worldwide. "Our members have listened to feedback from both customers and regulators, and we are taking action to build trust and confidence in the incredible value of a cruise vacation," said CLIA President Adam Goldstein.

The new policy will be implemented on a voluntary basis by Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, MSC, and Holland America cruise lines for sailings beginning January 1, 2022 or later. The cruise lines will now include taxes, fees, and port charges in any advertised price for a cruise fare. Drinks, dining, entertainment, and shore excursion packages will still be offered for an additional charge, according to the CLIA announcement.

Consumer advocates and regulators have called on cruise lines for years to end hidden fees and disclose the total cost of a cruise upfront. "This is a step in the right direction to prevent customers from feeling misled or nickeled and dimed," said Sally Greenberg, Executive Director of the National Consumers League. The Florida Attorney General's Office has also taken cruise lines to task over pricing transparency in recent years. 

A perceived lack of transparency from cruise lines was highlighted as an ongoing issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, as some customers struggled to obtain refunds from cruise lines for canceled sailings. The newly announced policy is seen as an effort by the cruise industry to counter negative perceptions in a time of hardship for the travel sector. However, some critics argue the lines do not go far enough to provide customers a clear understanding of the total costs before booking. More details on specific fees for individual sailings are still needed, they say.

The five cruise lines emphasize that in addition to more transparent pricing, the new policy will make the booking process easier for customers and travel agents. Fares will no longer need to be adjusted for additional fees after an initial price is offered or at checkout, simplifying the selection and purchase of a cruise. The cruise industry hopes their efforts toward fairer pricing and a revamped booking system will attract new cruisers once sailing resumes after the pandemic. Overall, customers and regulators say the end of "shock at the dock" is a welcome change that signals smoother seas ahead in the relationship between consumers and cruise lines.
