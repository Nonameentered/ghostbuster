Ryder System Inc in Talks with Banks to Create Securitized Truck Leases 

Ryder System Inc., one of the leading logistics and transportation companies in the U.S., is in discussions with several major investment banks to structure a new financial product based on its truck leases, according to people familiar with the matter. The banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are exploring ways to bundle Ryder's truck leases into securities that could be sold to investors seeking yields in today's low-interest-rate environment.

The securitized truck leases, similar to bonds made up of mortgages, credit cards or other assets, would provide Ryder with fresh capital that could be used to expand its fleet of rental trucks. For investors, the new securities would represent an opportunity to gain exposure to the stable cash flows generated by Ryder's long-term truck leases to major companies. Ryder leases trucks to over 80 different companies across a range of industries including retail, consumer goods, and automotive.  

If executed, this would be the first public securitization of truck lease receivables and could pave the way for similar deals from other major fleet owners and leasing companies. Ryder's leasing business, which rents semi-trucks, delivery vans, and other vehicles, contributes over $2 billion in revenue and is a major driver of profits. By securitizing the leases, Ryder could potentially lower its funding costs and reduce balance sheet risk while still capitalizing on the predictable revenue streams from clients locked into long-term contracts.

The talks are ongoing, and there is no guarantee a final deal will materialize or terms will be reached agreeable to all parties. The structuring of a new financial product can be complex, and economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have added further uncertainty. However, people close to the banks said there is significant interest in the potential offering due to limited high-quality, yield-generating products in today's markets as well as the essential nature of Ryder's trucking services. If successful, it could signal opportunities for similar fleet financings in the future.
