Fox News to File Antitrust Suit Against Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System for Blocking Channel in New York City

Fox News announced today that it plans to file an antitrust lawsuit against Time Warner Cable and Turner Broadcasting System, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia, for colluding to block the Fox News channel on Time Warner Cable's systems in New York City. The lawsuit alleges that Time Warner and Turner worked together to remove Fox News from Time Warner Cable's channel lineup in New York City in retaliation for Fox News declining to provide its channel for ATT's now defunct streaming service FilmStruck.

According to a statement from Fox News, "Time Warner and Turner have illegally conspired to restrain trade and monopolize the market for the distribution of cable news in New York City by refusing to carry Fox News and blocking millions of viewers from accessing our channel." Time Warner provides cable TV service for nearly 2 million households in New York City and the surrounding region. Without access to Time Warner's systems, Fox News alleges its ability to compete in that market has been severely hampered.   

In response, Time Warner said in a statement that "We dropped Fox News from our lineup because of declining viewership and outrage from our customers over some of the channel's misleading and irresponsible reporting over the years." Turner Broadcasting accused Fox News of "frivolous litigation aimed at generating media attention and retaliating against unrelated business disputes."

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and the reinstatement of Fox News on Time Warner Cable, claims that Time Warner dominates the pay-TV market in New York City and that their decision to drop Fox News was a "clear violation" of US antitrust laws preventing anti-competitive behavior. Legal experts say Fox News faces an uphill battle to prove that Time Warner and Turner illegally colluded to restrain trade instead of acting independently based on business interests. A trial date for the case has not yet been set.
