Flight Attendants Launch Broad Class-Action Suit Against Cigarette Companies for Second-Hand Smoke Exposure

A group of more than 2,000 flight attendants and other cabin crew staff filed a class action lawsuit today against major tobacco companies, alleging the companies contributed to the health issues and risks faced by crew members due to second-hand smoke exposure on airplanes. The suit alleges the tobacco industry conspired to hide the dangers of second-hand smoke and made no effort to prevent in-flight smoking even after the health risks and hazards were known.   

“For decades, tobacco companies promoted in-flight smoking and used airplanes as a way to encourage smoking and spread their toxic influence,” said John Smith, a lawyer representing the flight attendants. “They knew full well the damaging impact of second-hand smoke but did nothing to warn the public or those confined in close quarters like airplanes.”

Commercial air travel began allowing smoking in the 1930s and smoking on flights didn’t start to be restricted until the late 1980s and fully banned on most airlines until the early 2000s. The lawsuit alleges that tobacco companies were aware of the health risks of second-hand smoke as early as the 1950s but conspired to hide the dangers from the public to protect profits. The companies are accused of failing to take action to eliminate smoking on airplanes when the risks were evident, subjecting flight attendants and other cabin crew to regular smoke exposure in enclosed, poorly ventilated airplane cabins during flight.

The lawsuit cites a landmark report on second-hand smoke published by the Surgeon General in 1986 which concluded that second-hand smoke caused disease and premature death in children and adults. However, in-flight smoking continued for several more years, even as an increasing number of states banned smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and other indoor public places. “The tobacco industry had the opportunity to take action but instead chose to put its profits first at the expense of human health and safety,” said a statement from the law firm representing the plaintiffs.  

The lawsuit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the short-term and long-term health effects suffered by flight attendants, including risks of cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses linked to second-hand smoke exposure. The plaintiffs are also seeking funding for a medical monitoring program to screen attendants for smoking-related illnesses. The lawsuit names Philip Morris International, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and several industry trade groups as defendants. A spokesmen for the companies said the lawsuit is without merit and that the companies will vigorously defend themselves in court.
