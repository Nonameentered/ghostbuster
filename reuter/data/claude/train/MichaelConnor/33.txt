Billionaire Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries Expands Auto-Retailing Empire with $200 Million Acquisition of Florida Car Dealer 

Republic Industries Inc., the auto retailer controlled by billionaire investor H. Wayne Huizenga, announced today that it will acquire Maroone Auto Plaza Group for $200 million in cash and stock. The deal will expand Republic's network of auto dealerships in Florida and the southeastern United States.

Maroone Auto Plaza operates 15 franchised automotive dealerships representing 14 brands across Florida. The acquisition will expand Republic's cluster of dealerships in South Florida and boost its new and used vehicle sales by about 25,000 additional units per year. Republic Industries currently owns and operates 223 dealerships across 18 states. 

"The addition of Maroone Auto Plaza is another important step in executing on our long-term strategy to build a world-class automotive retailer through targeted acquisitions and operational excellence," said Huizenga, chairman of Republic Industries. "Maroone is a first-class organization with a proven track record of success and a culture that aligns well with our own. We are thrilled to welcome them to the Republic family."

The deal highlights the ongoing consolidation in the auto retailing industry as large chains aim to gain more leverage with automakers and boost profits through efficiencies of scale. Republic Industries has been an active acquirer, scooping up dozens of dealerships each year to fuel its rapid expansion across the country. The company's growth has propelled Huizenga, already a billionaire from founding Waste Management and Blockbuster Video, into the ranks of the world's richest people.

Maroone Auto Plaza was founded in 1971 by Mike Maroone and has become one of the largest privately-held dealership groups in Florida. Maroone will remain with the company along with the entire management team. Republic Industries said it expects the deal to be "immediately accretive" to its earnings. 

"Republic Industries has created an innovative business model that enables local dealerships to retain their identity while benefitting from the resources of a nationwide enterprise,” said Maroone, president of Maroone Auto Plaza. “We are excited for this opportunity to take the company my father and I built to the next level as part of America's largest and most respected automotive retailer."

The deal is expected to close in the next 90 days, pending manufacturer approval and other customary closing conditions. Republic Industries’ shares rose 3% on news of the acquisition, as investors cheer the company's continued growth and expansion into new markets.
