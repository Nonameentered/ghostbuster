Amoco Corp Bases 1997 Plans on Assumed Oil and Gas Prices 

Amoco Corp said it is basing its 1997 plans on an assumption that worldwide oil prices will average $18 to $20 a barrel and U.S. natural gas prices will average $2 per thousand cubic feet. 

The oil price forecast is little changed from recent assumptions and actual market prices. However, the natural gas price outlook marks a significant drop from recent years and reflects softening expected for gas markets next year due to growing supplies and slowing demand growth.

For 1996, Amoco has been using planning assumptions of about $20 oil and $2.30 gas. World oil prices currently are hovering near $20 a barrel, while U.S. gas prices recently have been about $2.20 per thousand cubic feet.

The price assumptions were disclosed in an Amoco presentation to securities analysts reviewing the company's strategies and financial targets. Amoco said its capital spending plans for exploration and production next year will be set based on the price assumptions, with spending declining about 10% from this year's level of $3.6 billion.

Amoco forecast that its oil and gas production will increase 3% to 5% next year, led by substantial gains in natural gas output as areas like Canada's Mackenzie Delta and Indonesia's East Natuna field are developed. However, the production growth will slow from rates of 5% to 8% annually in 1994 through 1996.

In the longer-term, Amoco said it is still targeting 3% average annual growth in net income and a 5% expansion in oil and gas output through 2000. Cash flow is projected to increase by more than 5% a year over the period. Capital spending is expected to average $3.5 billion to $4 billion a year through 2000 to achieve the growth.

The outlook indicates Amoco remains cautious in the near-term about prospects for its core oil and gas operations. Although energy markets have firmed this year and share prices of oil companies have surged, many uncertainties cloud the intermediate future, including sluggish global economic growth.
