U.S. Consumers Yawn at Latest Home Computers, Retailers See Weak Sales  

After the recent annual tech extravaganza, tech retailers expected American consumers to rush out and buy the latest laptops, desktop PCs, and other connected devices for the home. But in the weeks since the product announcements and flashy launches, consumers have largely shrugged at the new offerings and sales have remained weak. 

Best Buy, the nation's largest tech retailer, reported that computer and tablet sales declined 2% in June compared to the same month last year. The tepid consumer interest blindsided executives who expected the new computers with faster processors, higher resolution displays, and longer battery life to reignite the PC market. 

"We had anticipated stronger sales based on the promotional activity and technology improvements around the new computers," said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. "But customers seem content to hold onto their existing devices for longer, perhaps due to economic uncertainty."

Other chains like Walmart and Target also noted sluggish sales for personal computers in June and July. PC makers HP, Dell, and Lenovo have similarly reported weaker than expected sales of their new Windows and Chrome OS-based laptops this summer.  

Industry analysts point to several factors contributing to consumers' indifference. New PCs offer flashy technological improvements, but for most standard tasks like browsing the web, streaming media, and basic productivity, older computers still work just fine. With households under financial strain due to the pandemic-induced economic downturn, big ticket items like PCs are easy to delay or skip.   

There is also more competition for consumers' tech dollars from other product categories like gaming consoles, streaming media devices, smart speakers, and smartphonesâ€”all of which have seen sustained growth. Network connectivity and computing have also moved increasingly into the cloud, reducing dependence on a highly powerful local device.

"For the average person, a computer from 3-5 years ago does everything they need," said Jitesh Ubrani, lead PC analyst at IDC. "New PCs often don't enable any truly new experiences or capabilities, so many people are just making do with the PCs they already own." 

While the latest computers receive good reviews for their evolutionary improvements, there appear to be few must-have features compelling most consumers to upgrade. The results are worrisome for PC makers hoping new models could jumpstart demand in time for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. If current trends hold, the yawn from customers at the latest PCs may turn into an outright snooze. Retailers will need to rely on aggressive price cuts and promotions to move inventory in the coming months.
