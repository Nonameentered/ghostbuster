TheraTx Inc Expects Delayed Medicare Reimbursement Guidelines to Spare Profitability Until Summer 1997

TheraTx Inc, a psychotherapy and drug rehabilitation company based in Arizona, announced today that it expects Medicare reimbursement guidelines for mental health and substance abuse treatment to be delayed until mid-1997. The delay in implementing the guidelines is expected to allow TheraTx to maintain profitability through its fiscal second quarter ending June 30, 1997.

TheraTx had anticipated a 10 to 15 percent drop in revenue and profit margin due to restrictions placed on mental health and substance abuse treatments covered under new Medicare guidelines announced last fall. The guidelines were scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1997 but have faced criticism and legal challenges from healthcare providers, delaying their implementation.  

“We’re pleased that the new Medicare guidelines have been postponed, allowing us to continue operating under existing reimbursement standards for the first half of fiscal 1997,” said John Thompson, CEO of TheraTx Inc. “The delay provides us adequate time to adapt our treatment programs and make necessary changes to administrative procedures in order to comply with the new Medicare rules once they are implemented, while also continuing to serve our patients and meet our financial targets.”

Under existing Medicare reimbursement rules, TheraTx can bill up to $125 per hour for individual therapy and $50 per hour for group therapy. The new guidelines would reduce coverage to less than $100 per hour for individual therapy and $40 per hour for group therapy. TheraTx estimates this would reduce its Medicare reimbursements by up to $5 million annually.

TheraTx operates 15 rehabilitation centers across Arizona and Texas, serving approximately 3,000 patients each month. More than 40 percent of the company’s patients rely on Medicare for health insurance coverage. TheraTx’s stock price has dropped nearly 20 percent since the new Medicare guidelines were announced in October 1996. Today’s announcement led to a 5 percent increase in TheraTx’s stock price in early trading.
