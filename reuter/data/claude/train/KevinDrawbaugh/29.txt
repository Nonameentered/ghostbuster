Aon Corp to take $100 million charge in Q1 for Alexander & Alexander purchase  

Aon Corp, the world's largest insurance broker, announced today that it will take a $100 million charge in the first quarter related to its recent acquisition of rival broker Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. 

The charge is to cover costs from Aon's $1.5 billion purchase of Alexander & Alexander completed in January 1997. The deal combined two of the largest insurance brokers in the U.S., bringing thousands of clients and billions of dollars in revenue under Aon's control. However, the acquisition also meant inheriting some of Alexander & Alexander's unprofitable business units and workforces that require restructuring.

"The charge we are taking this quarter is to cover severance, lease termination and other costs primarily related to the consolidation of Alexander & Alexander's operations into Aon,” said Patrick Ryan, Aon's chairman and CEO. “While it impacts our first quarter results, we expect the acquisition will generate significant cost savings and be accretive to earnings starting in the second quarter and beyond.”  

The $100 million charge works out to about 10% of Aon's net income in 1996. However, analysts expected Aon would have to take charges related to restructuring Alexander & Alexander, and the announcement does not come as a surprise. The deal is still expected to benefit Aon in the long run through cost cutting and cross-selling to new clients.

“We see this charge as a necessary step for realizing the potential benefits and synergies from combining two major players in the insurance brokerage industry,” said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “With the initial work of integrating Alexander & Alexander now underway, Aon can turn its focus to driving growth and margin expansion over the coming years."

Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Chicago, Aon brokers insurance and reinsurance as well as provides human resources consulting services. With the addition of Alexander & Alexander's 38 offices and roughly $600 million in revenues, Aon further cements its position as the largest insurance broker in the world with more than 600 offices in over 120 countries. Aon's shares fell $1.31 to $38.52 in afternoon trading on the news.
