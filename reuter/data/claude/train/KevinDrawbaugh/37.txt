Mixed Results for Major Retailers during Crucial Holiday Sales Season Spark Drop in Retail Stocks  

Major retailers reported a mixed set of results from the crucial holiday shopping season, leading to a drop in retail stocks today. Early reports indicate that while some large chains saw modest gains in sales, others struggled to meet expectations.  

Walmart and Target exceeded most analysts’ forecasts and saw solid sales growth both online and in stores. Walmart reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. sales at stores open at least a year, topping estimates of 3.1%.  Target also beat projections with a 3.4% rise, powered by strong demand for clothing, beauty products, and home goods. The results suggest the two companies were able to entice budget-conscious shoppers with discounts and promotions.  

However, department stores and some apparel chains faced a tough season. Macy's and Kohl's reported sales declines and missed Wall Street's sales targets. Macy's said sales at stores open at least a year slid 0.6% in November and December, while Kohl’s saw a 1.2% drop. Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters also reported a disappointing 3% decrease in comparable sales. 

The uneven results highlighted the ongoing challenges for bricks-and-mortar retailers as more shopping moves online. "It was a decent but not stellar holiday season,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData Retail. “Most retailers entered the season with low expectations, so even relatively small gains will be seen as a victory.”

In response, major retail stocks declined today. Walmart stock fell 2%, Target dropped 3%, Macy's declined 4%, and Kohl's was down 5% in midday trading. The S&P Retail Exchange Traded Fund, which tracks the broader retail sector, slid 1.3%.

The holiday sales season, which traditionally runs from November through December, can account for as much as 40% of annual revenue for clothing, department stores, and other retail chains. Retailers now turn their attention to the post-holiday clearance sales to further boost sales and profits. But many analysts worry that the lackluster season is a sign consumers could tighten their purse strings if economic uncertainties continue in 2020.
