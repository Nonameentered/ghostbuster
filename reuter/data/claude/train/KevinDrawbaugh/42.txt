General Instrument Corp. to Split into Three Companies in Tax-Free Spin-Off  

General Instrument Corp. announced today that it would separate into three independent publicly traded companies, marking the end of an era for one of the pioneers of cable television technology.

The company plans to spin off its core cable networks business, along with its satellite services and space communications divisions, into separate companies by early next year in a tax-free transaction for shareholders. The move is aimed at maximizing shareholder value by creating more focused companies and allowing investors to invest directly in high-growth businesses.  

The cable networks business, which makes set-top boxes and cable modems, will become a new company called CommScope Inc. It is expected to generate about $3 billion in revenue this year. The satellite services division, which provides broadband services to commercial airplanes and cruise ships, will become a company called Gogo Inc. The space communications unit, which makes communications equipment and networks for satellite operators, will be named Astrotech Corp.

“This transaction will enable three industry-leading, entrepreneurial companies to pursue their own distinct strategic objectives,” said Chairman and Chief Executive H. Victor Ratten III. The spun-off companies will have greater strategic and management focus, and the flexibility and incentives to pursue their own growth opportunities."

General Instrument was founded in 1962 and has been at the forefront of cable television technology. It developed groundbreaking products like the first cable-ready television and the first addressable cable television system. It was acquired in 2000 by Motorola, which announced plans to split the company shortly thereafter, but it was not until the company was sold again in 2015 that plans to split the divisions began in earnest.

The tax-free spin-offs are expected to be completed in the first quarter, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Shareholders will receive shares in CommScope and Gogo and will have the option of exchanging their Astrotech shares for additional CommScope shares. The executives who currently run each division will lead the new companies.
