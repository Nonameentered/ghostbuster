U.S. Medical Device Manufacturers Face Pressure to Hold Prices Despite Expected Growth in 1997  

The U.S. medical device industry is poised for continued strong growth in 1997, according to industry analysts. Revenue from medical device and equipment sales in the U.S. is projected to increase 6-8% this year, building on the 7% growth seen in 1996. However, medical device makers may face intensifying pressure to hold the line on price increases for their products due to cost-cutting efforts by hospitals, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and the federal government.   

The medical device market remains appealing, especially as the aging population is driving higher demand for products like hip and knee replacements, diabetes management equipment, and diagnostics. Technological advances are also creating new categories of devices, such as minimally invasive surgical tools. However, the customers of medical device companies—hospitals, physicians, and healthcare providers—are under financial strain from government budget cuts and private insurer cost controls. In response, hospitals and clinics are working to cut supply and device costs.  

The largest medical device makers, including Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, GE Healthcare, and Siemens, have enjoyed strong sales growth in recent years through higher prices and volume. But hospitals and health systems are pushing back on costs more aggressively. Group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which pool hospitals to gain more negotiating power with suppliers, are demanding lower prices and limiting product choice to drive lower-cost options.  

The increased influence of HMOs and other private insurers also puts pressure on device prices. Private health plans are working to control premiums by reducing payments to healthcare providers which in turn reduces budgets for medical devices and supplies.   

Public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid face similar pressures. The federal government is looking to cut costs in the Medicare program, which provides health insurance for nearly 50 million Americans over the age of 65 or with certain disabilities. Lower reimbursement rates for medical procedures will likely force down payments for any devices used.  

While the U.S. medical device market remains an area of strong growth, particularly as new technologies hit the market, medical device manufacturers will likely have to adapt to a new era of more restrictive pricing if they want to maintain high sales and revenue numbers in the coming years. Holding the line on price increases—while still investing in innovation—may be the biggest challenge facing the industry in 1997 according to market experts.
