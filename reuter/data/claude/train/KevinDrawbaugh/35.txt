Mixed Results for Holiday Sales of Top U.S. Retailers, Wall Street Holds Judgment 

U.S. retail sales over the crucial holiday shopping season were a mixed bag, as major retailers reported both stronger and weaker than expected sales for the period from November through January. The uneven results left investors hesitant to draw firm conclusions about the strength of the retail sector or overall consumer spending.

Retail giant Walmart exceeded analysts' expectations for the holidays, reporting comparable sales in the U.S. rose 3.6% compared with the same period a year earlier. The company said sales were boosted by strong performance in grocery, health and wellness products, as well as toys and other entertainment categories. Walmart's e-commerce sales also grew sharply. The results suggest Walmart is successfully competing against online rivals like Amazon, while also benefiting from an overall healthy economy and solid consumer spending.

In contrast, department store chains Macy's and J.C. Penney disappointed investors with sluggish holiday sales and lowered profit guidance for 2018. Macy's said its comparable sales were up only 1.1% for November and December, below forecasts of around 2% growth. The company blamed weak performance of women's sportswear, handbags, and other accessories. J.C. Penney reported a comparable sales decline of 3.5% and a steep drop in profit margins. Both chains have struggled with competition from e-commerce and discount retailers in recent years.

The mixed results create uncertainty about the retail sector overall. Strong reports from some major chains are encouraging and suggest consumers remain willing and able to spend. However, ongoing struggles at many department stores and apparel retailers indicate that much of the retail industry continues to face substantial challenges. With the holiday season representing up to 40% of annual sales for many retailers, the next few months of results will provide more clarity on the sector's direction heading into 2019. For now, Wall Street is holding off on strong reactions, with retail stocks showing modest changes in early trading. The uneven start to 2019 highlights the diverging fortunes between retail winners and losers in an increasingly competitive market.
