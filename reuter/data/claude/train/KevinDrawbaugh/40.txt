General Instrument Corp. Plans to Split into Three Companies; Boosts Stock Market Value  

General Instrument Corporation announced today that it plans to split into three separate publicly traded companies in a move aimed at boosting the overall stock market value of the company. The three new companies will focus on broadband, wireless, and satellite/terrestrial communications equipment respectively. 

General Instrument, a leader in advanced communications technologies, has a market capitalization of $25 billion. However, executives feel the company’s stock has been undervalued relative to its peers. By creating three streamlined companies with clear strategic focuses, they aim to unlock greater shareholder value.

The broadband division will include General Instrument’s cable equipment, fiber optics and other wired communications technologies. The wireless division will take over the company’s wireless infrastructure and handset business lines. The satellite and terrestrial communications division will contain General Instrument’s satellite pay TV technology and broadcast equipment operations. The company expects to complete the breakup within the next 12-18 months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

“General Instrument has built industry-leading positions in broadband, wireless and satellite communications over its 70-year history,” said CEO Michael Smith in a statement. “Our goal now is to give investors a more transparent view into each of these high-growth businesses and enable the new companies to forge their own strategic paths forward.”

Shares of General Instrument stock rose 15% on the news, indicating investor optimism about the split. Analysts pointed to examples of other large companies where market values increased substantially after announcing plans to split into multiple, focused entities. 

Not all reactions were positive, however. Some analysts worry the new companies will lack the diversification and resources of the combined entity. There is also a risk of disruption from dividing staff and operations. However, supporters counter that any short-term challenges are outweighed by the potential long-term benefits of creating three companies tailored for their specific markets. 

The breakup of General Instrument is the latest in a wave of large companies pursuing splits and spinoffs to streamline operations and boost stock prices. It is a trend that analysts expect to gain further momentum if these deals continue to resonate with shareholders. For General Instrument, the bet is that three focused new companies will be more valuable than a single sprawling conglomerate. The market’s initial reaction suggests investors see the logic in that strategy.
