U.S. Health Maintenance Organisations Expected to Recover in 1997

The U.S. health maintenance organisation (HMO) industry is poised for a recovery in 1997 after several challenging years, according to industry analysts. HMOs have faced rising medical costs, turbulent financial markets, and profit pressures that led to the failure of some major players in the past two years. However, streamlining, consolidation, and a shift to more risk-sharing models are setting the stage for a rebound.

"The worst is behind the industry, absent some unforeseen and significant shock," said John P. Hennessey, a research analyst who covers HMOs for Raymond James & Associates in Orlando, Fla. "The survivors have learned from the past few years and have adjusted their business models and operations to perform better going forward."

The HMO industry grew rapidly from the early 1990s through 1995 as health care consumers and payers sought lower-cost alternatives to traditional insurance. However, rising medical costs quickly outpaced HMO premiums, eroding profits. When financial markets stumbled in the mid-1990s, many HMOs were hit hard. Major industry players including FPA Medical Management and Healthsource shut down or were acquired.

In response, surviving HMOs cut costs, exit marginal markets, and raised premiums. They also shifted to models like point of service plans that share more of the risk with health care consumers. These moves have steadied the industry and optimism is building for 1997.

Leading HMOs like United HealthCare, Foundation Health, and Humana are projected to post double-digit earnings growth. Many smaller players also expect stronger profits. At the same time, the uncertainty around health care reform has dissipated, and the economy is stable. 

"A lot of things have come together for the industry," said Samuel F. Halpern, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC. "They've gotten smarter about managing risks and medical costs, the regulatory and political environment is more certain, and people are more accustomed to managed care."
