Ford May Sell Interest in Budget Rent a Car, Following Other Automakers' Footsteps

Ford Motor Company announced today that it is exploring strategic options for its car rental unit Budget, including potentially selling part or all of the company. Ford acquired Budget Rent A Car along with its purchase of Avis in 1987. However, in recent years Ford has been divesting its interests in various non-automotive subsidiaries as it tries to refocus its business on core manufacturing operations. 

Selling Budget would be consistent with steps taken by other major automakers. In 2015, Hertz completed its acquisition of Dollar Thrifty, while Avis merged with Zipcar in 2013. With declining car ownership rates and increasing interest in on-demand mobility options, fleet management and rentals have become more attractive sectors. However, they remain outside the key expertise of most automakers.

Ford’s ownership of Budget has been seen by industry analysts as a distraction for Ford’s leadership. While Budget has continued to generate positive cash flow and profits, it requires investment and management attention that Ford could deploy towards initiatives more central to its long-term success like electric vehicles, self-driving technology, and mobility services.

According to sources close to the plans, Ford’s preferred path is to sell a majority stake in Budget to a outside partner, while potentially maintaining a minority stake in the company. This approach has been taken by Volkswagen and other automakers to strategically align with major car rental companies while offloading ownership. The sale of Budget could generate proceeds of $4 to $6 billion for Ford, based on valuations of its competitors.

However, the path to any sale is unclear. “Ford faces a tricky challenge unloading Budget while also ensuring its critical fleet sales to the unit continue uninterrupted,” said John Murphy, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. About 15 to 20 percent of Ford’s U.S. sales are to rental car companies, with the bulk going to Budget. “Any sale would have to guarantee ongoing supply deals or Ford's sales could take a hit," Murphy noted.

Representatives from Ford declined to comment on the timing or details of any potential sale of Budget, saying that many strategic options are continually being considered. Budget executives were similarly tight-lipped, referring questions to Ford. If a sale process moves forward, potential buyers would likely include Hertz, Avis, and private equity firms that have been active in the rental market in recent years.

With its focus on reinventing the automobile and bold visions for the future of transportation, Ford is working to streamline operations and concentrate on areas that align with its priorities. Shedding the Budget unit may be a necessary step to help fund higher-stakes technological gambles that Ford believes will power its long-term future. The coming months will determine whether the venerable automaker is willing and able to start writing the next chapter of Budget’s history under new ownership.
