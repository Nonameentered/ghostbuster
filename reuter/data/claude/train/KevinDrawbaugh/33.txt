U.S. Retailers Hope for Strong Finish to Moderately Successful Holiday Shopping Season 

U.S. retailers are hoping for a strong surge in last-minute holiday shopping to put a positive finish on what has been a moderately successful shopping season so far. Early data suggests holiday sales will meet but likely not exceed the National Retail Federation's forecast of a 4.1% increase over last year.

Black Friday sales were solid though not spectacular, rising an estimated 1.7% according to data from ShopperTrak. The biggest shopping days of the year brought out consumers eager to take advantage of doorbuster deals and discounts. However, foot traffic in stores declined even as online sales rose. Cyher Monday sales were up 19.7% compared to last year, showing the ongoing shift to online shopping, according to Adobe Analytics. 

"Overall, the early results suggest a good start to the holiday shopping season," said Matthew Shay, CEO of the National Retail Federation. "But there is still a lot of shopping left to do. Much of the action now shifts to the final stretch as consumers search for last-minute deals and grab those final gifts on their lists."

Department stores like Macy's, Kohl's, and J.C. Penney reported lackluster third-quarter earnings heading into the holiday season but are hopeful that sales will rebound in November and December. Discounters like Walmart and Target remain retail bright spots, buoyed by a strong economy. However, some analysts worry that rising consumer debt levels and economic uncertainty could restrain holiday spending, especially among lower-income shoppers.

Online retailers once again appear poised to capture a disproportionate share of spending this holiday season. Amazon said it had the biggest Cyber Monday in its history, with customers ordering millions of items. Meanwhile, sales at many traditional brick-and-mortar stores declined on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, continuing a multi-year trend.

With Christmas now just a week away, retailers have ramped up promotions and discounts to drive more traffic and boost sales in stores and on the web. Gift cards, toys, winter apparel, and electronics such as wireless headphones, smart speakers and streaming media players are all popular items this shopping season. If last-minute shopping truly materializes, it could help push what has so far been a moderately successful holiday season for U.S. retailers into a truly merry one.
