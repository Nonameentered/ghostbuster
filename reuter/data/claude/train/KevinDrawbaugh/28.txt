Monsanto to Spin Off Chemicals Business, Cut Jobs by Up to 9%

Agricultural chemicals giant Monsanto announced plans today to spin off its chemicals business into a separate company and cut up to 1,600 jobs worldwide, equal to almost 9% of its workforce. The announcements come as the St. Louis-based company looks to focus on its more profitable agricultural seeds and seed treatments business. 

Monsanto plans to spin off its specialty and consumer chemicals business under the name Procure Chemistry. The spinoff will be completed by the end of next year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Monsanto said it will retain its agricultural business and technology platforms. The cut of up to 1,600 jobs is designed to reduce costs and improve competitiveness. The cuts are expected to impact all areas of Monsanto's operations, though the greatest impacts are likely in Procure Chemistry and administrative roles.

"These are difficult but necessary steps to ensure that we best position Monsanto for future growth while meeting the needs of our customers," said Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant in a statement. "We are making prudent decisions to focus on key strategic areas where we have leadership positions and the strongest paths for growth."

The announcement was not entirely unexpected as Grant had hinted at job cuts and changes in Monsanto's business portfolio in previous earnings calls. The spinoff of Procure Chemistry comes at a tough time for chemicals companies as prices for many specialty and consumer chemicals have declined recently due to soft global demand and overcapacity. By spinning off Procure Chemistry as an independent company, Monsanto aims to shield its agricultural business from periodic downturns in the chemicals market.

Investors responded positively to the news, with Monsanto's shares up 3.2% in midday trading. Analysts said the spinoff and job cuts could help Monsanto reduce costs, increase profits, and raise its stock price over time. However, the spinoff also brings challenges as Monsanto will lose the revenue and profits generated by its now third-largest division. Procure Chemistry accounts for about 15% of Monsanto's total revenue and employs 3,600 people across 40 locations.

The announcements close a tumultuous few months for Monsanto which recently abandoned its $62 billion bid to acquire Swiss agrichemicals firm Syngenta AG after multiple rejections. Moving forward, Monsanto said it will continue to focus on advancing its core agricultural seed and genomics business through both organic growth and acquisitions. The job cuts are expected to be completed by early next year, while the spinoff of Procure Chemistry aims to be tax-free to shareholders and complete by the end of 2016.
