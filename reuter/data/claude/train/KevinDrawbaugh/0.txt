Direct-to-consumer Prescription Drug Advertising Booms in the US as Spending Tops $323m in First Half of 1996  

Prescription drug companies in the US have ramped up their direct-to-consumer advertising in recent years and spending on such ads topped $323 million in the first half of 1996 alone, according to a new report. The pharmaceutical industry spent more than $1.3 billion on direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs last year, a 65% increase from 1995.  

The surge in spending comes as drug companies increasingly promote their products directly to patients in an effort to raise awareness of newly approved drugs and boost sales. Until 1997, drug companies were only allowed to market prescription drugs to physicians and healthcare professionals. Changes by the FDA now allow companies to advertise their products directly to consumers, typically with ads showing happy, healthy people and long lists of potential side effects.  

The new ads are for some of the industry's biggest moneymakers, including allergy medicines like Claritin, heart drugs like Lipitor, and ulcer pills like Prilosec. Schering-Plough alone spent $97 million marketing Claritin directly to consumers in the first half of 1996. Some physicians and consumer groups have argued that the ads rarely highlight the risks and dangers of the promoted drugs, instead focusing on idealized benefits and outcomes. However, the pharmaceutical industry maintains that the ads serve to educate consumers and patients about treatment options and prompt important conversations with physicians.

The shift to more direct consumer marketing has been controversial, but it's clear why the deep-pocketed drug companies have embraced it. Studies show the ads are effective in persuading consumers to ask their doctors about heavily advertised drugs and it helps companies gain a early foothold when bringing new drugs to market. In some cases, the ads have launched blockbuster drugs by priming consumer demand immediately after FDA approval. The strategy also allows companies to build brand loyalty and recognition for their products.

The massive spending on direct-to-consumer ads highlights the high stakes of the pharmaceutical business. The top 25 drug companies earned $294 billion in revenue last year, so a few billion on marketing and advertising is a small price to pay if it succeeds in boosting the sales of high-margin prescription drugs by even a modest amount. While regulators and consumer groups continue to warn about the potential downsides, it appears direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are here to stay as companies have clearly decided the investment is well worth the returns.
