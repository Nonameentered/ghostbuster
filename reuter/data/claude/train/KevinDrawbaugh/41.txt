General Instrument to Break Up into Three Companies, Unlocking Value of High-Tech Communications Systems Business 

General Instrument Corp announced today that its board of directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate the technology conglomerate into three independent, publicly traded companies. The historic breakup is intended to unlock shareholder value by creating more focused companies targeting the cable television systems, broadband communications systems, and aerospace and defense electronics markets.

The cable systems business will become a new company called CommScope that will concentrate on cable network infrastructure equipment and set-top boxes. The broadband equipment business, supplying technology to telecommunications companies, will be renamed NextLevel Communications. The aerospace and defense electronics unit will retain the General Instrument name. 

“This will enable three streamlined companies to pursue accelerated growth in their respective industries,” said Chairman and CEO Donald Rumsfeld. “As stand-alone companies, each entity can intensify its focus on its customers and marketplace to drive growth and shareholder value.”

The transaction is expected to be completed in nine to twelve months. Shareholders will retain ownership in all three companies, receiving a proportional distribution of shares. The company expects this will be a tax-free distribution for most shareholders.

Founded in 1928, General Instrument has grown into a global technology company with $8 billion in annual revenue. However, in recent years the company has struggled with the complexity of managing disparate businesses with different growth profiles and customer bases. 

Wall Street analysts responded positively to the announcement, noting the move addresses calls to break up the conglomerate. “This bold move will unlock the true potential of General Instrument,” said Margaret Whitman, Senior Analyst at Goldman Sachs. “The focused, nimble companies will be attractive to shareholders and position them well for future growth.”

The breakup of General Instrument is the latest in a wave of large companies splitting up to boost market valuations, following similar moves by brands like Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, and Honeywell International. The separations often drive improved innovation, customer service, and financial performance as the new entities can operate independently with a tight focus on key goals and priorities.

General Instrument expects to announce management teams and additional details for the new companies in the coming months. The planned separation is still subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the General Instrument board of directors.
