Holiday Sales Results Create Mixed Bag for Major Retailers, Sparking Stock Drops on Wall Street

Major retailers reported a mixed set of results from the critical holiday shopping season, sending stocks down across the board on Wall Street in reaction. While some chains like Walmart and Costco reported strong sales and earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, other major retailers including Target, Kohl’s, and J.C. Penney disappointed investors with weaker-than-expected sales and profit numbers.

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said same-store sales in the U.S. rose 3.4% in the fourth quarter, higher than the 2.5% gain analysts had projected. The company’s e-commerce sales jumped a whopping 43% as it focused on building out its online grocery and pickup options. Walmart’s shares rose over 3% on the news. “Our solid performance shows that when we listen to our customers—and invest in them and our associates—we win,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.

In contrast, Target reported a disappointing 1.5% increase in comparable sales, below projections of a 3% gain, as sales of toys, baby products, and electronics fell. Target’s earnings also came in below expectations, and the company blamed higher costs and price cuts for the results. Target shares plunged over 10% in early trading, their biggest one-day drop since 1987. “After starting the quarter with strong sales and traffic, our results slowed meaningfully in the final weeks of the season,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell. The company now expects 2020 profitability to remain “well below” original projections.

Department store chains also struggled, with Kohl’s same-store sales dropping 0.2% and J.C. Penney’s comps falling 7.5% from a year ago. Both companies reported quarterly losses and issued weaker guidance for the year ahead.  Their shares dropped 12% and 14% respectively on the news. The retailers blamed a shorter holiday season, weak apparel and foot traffic trends, and increased promotions for the poor results.
