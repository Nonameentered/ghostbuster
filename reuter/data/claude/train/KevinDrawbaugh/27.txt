Baxter International Expects Charges in Q1 1997 for In-Process R&D Acquisitions

Baxter International Inc. announced today that it expects to incur charges totaling approximately $640 million in the first quarter of 1997 related to research and development expenses from recent acquisitions. The majority of the charges, $355 million, relates to the acquisition of Immuno International AG, a leading developer of plasma-based therapies. The remaining $285 million relates to a number of smaller biotechnology firms acquired over the past several months.  

The charges represent the estimated fair value of in-process R&D programs that, as of the acquisition dates, had no alternative future use. According to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), R&D expenditures on new products must be expensed as incurred. Because Baxter acquired Immuno and the other biotech firms in Q1 1997, the costs associated with their in-progress R&D programs must be expensed immediately rather than capitalized, resulting in the sizable one-time charges.

Excluding these special charges, Baxter expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of about $0.62 for the first quarter. Including the special charges, diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.38. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be slightly above $1.9 billion.

"These acquisitions represent an important step in our strategy to expand into high-growth, high-margin plasma therapies and recombinant products,” said Harry Kraemer, Jr., Baxter's chief executive officer.  “Although the magnitude of the in-process R&D charges is substantial, the potential benefits from these investments in new product development are enormous.”   

The charges had been anticipated by Baxter and are consistent with the company's previous guidance that it expects to incur periodic charges for in-process R&D as it continues to augment its product pipeline through mergers and acquisitions. Baxter's goal is to introduce multiple new plasma-based and recombinant products each year for patients with rare, critical conditions.

Despite the charges, Kraemer expressed optimism about Baxter's outlook for the remainder of 1997.  “Excluding special charges, our underlying business remains very strong with excellent momentum going into the rest of the year,” he said.  Baxter expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special charges, of $2.45 to $2.55 for full-year 1997.
