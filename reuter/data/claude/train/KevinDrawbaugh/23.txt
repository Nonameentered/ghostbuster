Here is a 500-word news article with the headline:  Cellex Biosciences Expects Strong Q4 and Move into Profitability Next Fiscal Year:

Cellex Biosciences, a biotechnology company focused on developing new treatments for autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, announced expectations that the company will report a strong fourth quarter and move into profitability in the next fiscal year. 

In an investor call this morning, Cellex CEO Amanda Smith said the company expects revenues in the fourth quarter ending December 31 to increase by at least 35% year over year, driven by growing sales of its flagship drug Axelum, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Full-year revenues are forecast to increase by over 40% in 2020. 

“We have seen tremendous growth and market uptake for Axelum this year, exceeding all of our sales targets, ” Smith said. “The momentum is building as more doctors and patients experience the benefits of this novel treatment. We fully expect this growth to accelerate in 2020.”

Axelum is an injectable biologic drug that reduces inflammation by inhibiting specific pathways in the body’s immune response. It was approved for rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and Europe last year and for Crohn’s disease in the U.S. earlier this year.

The company also announced it expects to turn profitable on an net income basis next year thanks to growing Axelum sales and tight control of expenses. Cellex has been investing heavily in expanding its sales and marketing operations to support the Axelum launch. With the infrastructure now in place, the company can gain operating leverage as sales increase.

Cellex is also advancing two other potential blockbuster drugs in its pipeline, including a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease currently in Phase 2 trials and a therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus entering Phase 3 testing next year. Success with any of these candidates could significantly boost Cellex’s share price and long-term prospects.

Investors reacted positively to the news, with shares of Cellex up over 12% in midday trading. The stock has already more than tripled in value so far this year. If the company’s optimistic forecasts for 2020 prove accurate, further gains could be ahead for Cellex and its shareholders.
