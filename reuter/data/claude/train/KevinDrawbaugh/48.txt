Investor Pressure Mounts on WMX Technologies for Change and Further Asset Sales  

WMX Technologies, the world's largest waste management company, is facing increasing pressure from investors to make significant changes to boost its stock price and further streamline its sprawling business. Activist investors have taken stakes in WMX and are pushing the company to accelerate the sale of assets, cut costs, and make strategic changes to improve profitability.

WMX's stock price has lagged the broader market in recent years as its growth has slowed. The company's share price is down 15% over the last 12 months, even as major stock indexes have climbed. WMX's revenue rose just 2% last year, and profit was essentially flat. Investors worry that WMX has become too large and complex to generate meaningful growth.  

The most vocal investors urging change at WMX include ValueAct Capital, which owns a $1.3 billion stake, and Starboard Value, with a $730 million position. These activists argue that WMX's stock price suffers from a "conglomerate discount" because the company spans too many businesses. WMX operates recycling centers, hazardous waste treatment facilities, and traditional landfills across several continents.  

Starboard sent a letter to WMX last month criticizing the company's "apparent unwillingness to accept the need for aggressive change" and failure to take "action to address the discount that arises from WMX's sprawling conglomerate structure." ValueAct has also pressed privately for WMX to make significant divestments to focus on its most profitable core businesses.

WMX management has started to respond to investors' concerns. Earlier this year, WMX sold its chemical waste treatment division for $1.2 billion. Last month, WMX's CEO announced a cost-cutting target of $250 million over two years. However, some analysts say much larger divestments, such as selling WMX's recycling or international operations, may be necessary to propel the stock price higher.

The push for revamping WMX comes amid broader changes in the waste industry. New environmental regulations are increasing costs, while improvements in recycling and waste reduction are limiting volume growth. WMX and its peers must adapt to this challenging reality by aggressively streamlining and innovating their businesses. For now, WMX must navigate demands for change from increasingly forceful activist owners as well as navigate industry headwindsâ€”or risk shareholder battles that create more turmoil. Overall, major strategic and operational shifts appear inevitable at the waste giant as it aims to revive growth and boost investor confidence.
