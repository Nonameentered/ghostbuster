ClinTrials Research Inc Set to Expand Revenues 35-45% Thanks to Growing Use of Outside Research Help and Market Share Gains 

Contract research organization ClinTrials Research Inc announced today that it expects revenues to increase 35-45% in the coming year thanks to growing demand for outsourced clinical research services and gains in market share. The company cited increasing pressures on pharmaceutical and biotech companies to reduce costs and accelerate drug development timelines as key drivers of growth.

“Sponsors are increasingly turning to CROs like ClinTrials to handle more of their research needs, from clinical operations to data management and everything in between,” said ClinTrials CEO Jane Smith. “We are seeing more requests for full-service partnerships, not just individual clinical trial support. Our broad range of services and global footprint position us well to benefit from this trend.”

The CRO industry has expanded rapidly over the past decade, with revenues more than doubling to over $40 billion. However, the market remains highly fragmented. ClinTrials has gained ground through strategic acquisitions that have expanded both its geographic presence and service offerings. The company now has over 10,000 employees across 60 countries.  

In addition to outsourcing trends, ClinTrials pointed to a strong sales pipeline of new contracts as a key driver of expected revenue growth. “We have had a very successful year of new business wins, including several large, multi-year partnerships with top-20 pharmaceutical companies. We will see the impact of these wins in our 2020 financial results,” said Smith.  

The revenue guidance was issued in conjunction with ClinTrials’ 2019 year-end results. The company reported revenues of $4.8 billion, up 28% from 2018. Net income increased 22% to $320 million. ClinTrials’ stock price is up nearly 50% over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming the broader market.  

“We are in an outstanding position to continue our strong and consistent growth in 2020 and beyond,” said Smith. Investors appeared to welcome the optimistic outlook, with ClinTrials’ shares up over 7% on the day of the announcement. The company remains a compelling story in biopharma services, with a rare combination of global scale, service breadth, and high growth. As the clinical research market continues to expand and evolve, ClinTrials seems poised to be at the forefront of the opportunity.
