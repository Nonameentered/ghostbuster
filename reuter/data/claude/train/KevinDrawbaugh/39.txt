Eli Lilly & Co's New Anti-Schizophrenia Drug Zyprexa Expected to Receive FDA Approval

Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to approve its new antipsychotic drug Zyprexa (olanzapine) for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders. If approved, Zyprexa would become only the second new antipsychotic medication in over a decade and is expected to compete directly with Johnson & Johnson's Risperdal. 

Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling brain disorder that causes hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking. It affects about 1% of the population. Antipsychotic drugs are the primary means of treating schizophrenia, though many patients do not respond well to existing medications or cannot tolerate the severe side effects. 

Eli Lilly hopes that Zyprexa will provide improved effectiveness and tolerability over older antipsychotics. Clinical trials of over 2,500 patients found that Zyprexa reduced symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking with fewer movement-related side effects like tremors, slurred speech, and restlessness. The most common side effects were drowsiness, increased appetite, and weight gain.

"Zyprexa represents an exciting new option for patients with schizophrenia who have not benefited from existing treatments," said Dr. Ginger Ross, a psychiatrist at Mass General Hospital in Boston who was a principal investigator in the Zyprexa clinical trials. "I think many doctors have patients who have struggled with other drugs and we've been eager for new alternatives."

However, some psychiatrists argue that Eli Lilly has overstated the benefits of Zyprexa and that it provides merely incremental advantages over cheaper generic drugs. "Zyprexa may be a bit more tolerable for some patients but it's not the breakthrough that Eli Lilly is hyping. For most patients, cheap antipsychotics like haloperidol or chlorpromazine still work well and cost a fraction of Zyprexa's expected price," said Dr. Richard Liu, a psychiatrist at UCLA Medical Center. 

If approved as expected, Zyprexa would become the second blockbuster antipsychotic drug in Eli Lilly's portfolio, joining the top-selling medication Zyprexa, which had over $2.7 billion in sales last year. Given the large population of patients with schizophrenia and the eagerness for new treatment options, Zyprexa is predicted to achieve peak annual sales of $4-6 billion, according to Wall Street analysts. The FDA is expected to make a final approval decision on Zyprexa by the end of this month.
