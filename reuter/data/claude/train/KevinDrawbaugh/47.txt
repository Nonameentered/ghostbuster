Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. to Buy Value Health Inc. for $1.3 Billion in Stock

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the largest for-profit hospital operator in the U.S., announced today that it has agreed to acquire Value Health Inc., a health care data and analytics company, in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $1.3 billion. 

The deal highlights the increasing interest of health care providers in leveraging data and analytics to improve clinical outcomes and cut costs as the industry faces continued pressure to lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Value Health uses data aggregation and analytics to help develop treatment guidelines, assess clinical effectiveness of drugs and therapies, and improve care coordination for patients.

“Data and analytics have the potential to transform health care delivery in the years ahead,” said Columbia/HCA CEO Milton Johnson. “By bringing together Value Health’s data capabilities with our scale and resources as a health care provider, we can accelerate innovation in data-driven, value-based care delivery models that improve patient outcomes and experience while reducing overall costs.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Columbia/HCA will issue about 32 million shares of its common stock, worth $1.3 billion based on yesterday’s closing stock price, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Value Health. Value Health will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia/HCA, and its headquarters will remain in Eden Prairie, Minn. Value Health CEO Doug Murphy and the company’s management team will continue to lead the organization. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, pending required regulatory approvals.

The deal comes amid continued consolidation in the health care industry as companies seek to gain scale and cut costs. Columbia/HCA, which operates 179 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in the U.S. and U.K., has pursued an aggressive growth strategy through acquisitions and new developments. Earlier this year, rival hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp. acquired ambulatory surgery center operator National Medical Enterprises Inc. for $2.2 billion. Humana Inc. and CVS Health Corp. are also partnering to leverage data to improve primary care.

Columbia/HCA shares rose 3.2% on the news to $41.17. Value Health shares jumped 18% to $63.59, just below the deal price.
