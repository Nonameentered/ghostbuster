Majority of U.S. Health Maintenance Organizations Expected to Report Lower or Flat Q4 Profits  

The majority of major U.S. health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are expected to report either lower or flat profits for the fourth quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to industry analysts. Rising costs, lower enrollment growth, and pricing pressures are cited as the key factors impacting HMO profitability.

“It's been a tough year for the HMO industry with costs increasing faster than revenue growth for most major companies,” said John Smith, a healthcare analyst at BigBank Securities. “We're seeing higher expenses from more frequent doctor visits, costly new medical technologies, and increased spending on prescription drugs. At the same time, HMOs have limited ability to raise premiums in the face of competitive pressures and insurers leaving certain markets.”

The largest for-profit HMO, National Cross, is expected to report a 3-5% drop in Q4 earnings per share compared with last year. The company has struggled with higher medical costs this year, especially in several local markets where it offers insurance plans on the public exchanges. To bolster its bottom line, National Cross recently announced plans to exit two state exchanges and raise premiums by a substantial amount on its small business plans. However, the moves also threaten to reduce enrollment growth which provides revenue for the company.

Not-for-profit HMOs are facing similar cost and pricing issues but also depend more heavily on investment income to support their operations. “The drop in interest rates this year has squeezed investment returns for many not-for-profit HMOs, further pressuring their overall financial results,” said Smith. Blue Shield, the largest not-for-profit, is projected to report essentially flat Q4 earnings as cost increases are offsetting most of the revenue gain from premium hikes and stable enrollment.  

While the short-term profit outlook is lackluster, HMOs are hoping that proposed mergers, such as the recently announced Blue Shield acquisition of Community Health, will drive higher efficiencies and help accelerate future earnings growth. The industry is also advocating for policy changes that would provide more flexibility around product pricing and benefits. Overall, HMO executives remain cautiously optimistic that a stronger economy and job growth in 2020 will support improved performance in the coming year.
