Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Predicts Electronic Technology to Replace Open Outcry Trading in 20 to 25 Years 

The chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade predicted this week that electronic trading will replace open outcry trading on exchange floors within the next two decades. In a speech to industry leaders, Charles Carey said that technology is “fundamentally changing” how trading is conducted and that electronic platforms will eventually make open outcry pits obsolete.

“I anticipate that in 20 to 25 years, electronic trading will dominate and the open outcry trading that has been the hallmark of futures exchanges for decades will fade away,” Carey said. “Technology is enabling faster, more efficient, and more globally connected ways of trading that will reshape our industry in the coming years.”

The Chicago Board of Trade, founded in 1848, is one of the world’s oldest futures and options exchanges. For most of its history, CBOT trading was conducted on its iconic trading floor, with traders shouting and using hand signals to buy and sell futures and options contracts in open outcry pits. However, in recent decades, electronic trading platforms have been introduced, allowing traders to buy and sell from anywhere around the world.

Electronic trading now accounts for about 95 percent of all trades on the CBOT exchange. The transition to electronic platforms has enabled increased speed, lower costs, and global access to CBOT products. However, open outcry pits are still used to set benchmark prices during the trading day. 

Carey acknowledged that open outcry trading is “nostalgic” and part of the CBOT’s history but said the exchange must continue adapting to technology and market changes to remain competitive. “Resting on our history is not good enough,” he said. “The CBOT has thrived for over 170 years because of our willingness to innovate and disrupt ourselves to benefit our customers and the industry.”

The CBOT and other major exchanges have faced increasing competition in recent years from proprietary electronic trading platforms and financial technology startups. Carey argued that exchanges must continue modernizing their capabilities and offerings to keep up with the pace of change. “Those that refuse to adapt will struggle, but we are embracing this opportunity,” he said.

Carey predicted that data, analytics, and speed will be the drivers of competitive advantage in the trading industry of the future. “Technology will continue to reshape this industry in ways we cannot even imagine yet,” he said. “The trading floor as we know it may be gone in 20 years, but the CBOT will continue evolving to meet the needs of the next generation.”
