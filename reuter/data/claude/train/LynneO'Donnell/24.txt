London Metal Exchange zinc price rises to five-month high benefiting China and Far East metal sources  

The London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price for zinc rose to a five-month high this week, boosted by declining inventories and optimism over demand from China and other Far Eastern markets.  

Zinc, used to galvanize steel and in alloys, rose 3.5% to $3,050 per metric ton on Tuesday, the highest since February. Prices are up nearly 10% this month. The price gains follow seven consecutive days of declining zinc inventories in LME-registered warehouses. Inventories have fallen over 60% this year to just over 55,000 tons, the lowest level since October 2007.  

The price rise and inventory declines reflect higher demand from China, the world's largest producer and consumer of zinc. Chinese manufacturing activity has risen for three straight months according to the Caixin/Markit purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The rebound in China’s factories is driving higher demand for zinc and other industrial metals used in construction, infrastructure, transportation equipment, and consumer goods.  

“The supply side has been slow to respond to the pickup we’ve seen in Chinese demand this year, and as a result, the market has moved into deficit,” said Capital Economics analyst Ross Strachan. “Inventories have dropped sharply, providing further support to prices.”  

Mining companies are ramping up production to meet the higher demand and take advantage of the elevated prices. Glencore, one of the world’s largest zinc producers, aims to increase production by 50,000 tons this year by reopening its Lady Loretta mine in Australia and expanding its Kazzinc operations in Kazakhstan. Other major producers like Teck Resources, Vedanta Resources and Boliden are also boosting output. However, new supply may take several months to reach the market given the time required to reopen or expand mines. 

Higher LME zinc prices are benefiting producers and supporting mining company profits and share prices. Glencore’s stock price has risen over 40% this year, helped by rebounding industrial metal prices. Zinc’s rally is also helping Australia’s economy, where mining contributes over 8% of GDP.

The price gains may prove temporary if Chinese demand slows in the coming months or new supply enters the market at a faster rate. Some analysts expect zinc prices to decline toward $2,800-$3,000 per ton by the end of the year as higher production catches up with demand. But for now, zinc continues to outperform other base metals, signaling the potential for a sustained period of higher prices that will please producers around the globe.
