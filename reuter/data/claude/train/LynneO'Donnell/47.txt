China's Zinc Industry Struggles to Compete Amidst Economic Changes and Reduced Exports 

China's zinc industry, once a dominant force in the global metals market, is facing significant challenges that threaten its competitive position. For decades, China fueled worldwide demand for zinc, used to galvanize steel and in alloys, through heavy government spending on infrastructure and exports. But as China's economy matures and transitions to a consumer- and services-led model, growth in zinc demand has slowed dramatically. At the same time, environmental regulations are forcing many zinc smelters and mines to curb production or shut down entirely. 

China is by far the world's largest producer of zinc, accounting for nearly half of global zinc mine production. The majority of China's zinc is exported, but export volumes declined over 10% last year and are down 40% from their peak in 2007. Analysts expect zinc exports to continue decreasing as more zinc is consumed domestically in China and abroad. However, China's zinc consumption growth has also slowed to an average of just 2-3% annually over the past five years, down from over 12% per year in the previous decade, according to market research firm Fitch Solutions.

Slower growth in China's infrastructure and construction sectors, which utilize nearly 70% of the country's zinc, has weakened demand for the metal. China's transit infrastructure is now relatively developed, and government stimulus spending is declining, reducing demand from sectors like auto manufacturing where zinc is essential for coatings and die casting. Environmental protection measures are also limiting zinc production from mines and smelters, many of which face closure due to pollution violations. 

Some of China's largest zinc producers have already cut capacity. China Minmetals Corporation shut down more than 300,000 tons of zinc capacity since 2015 and recently halted production at its Hunchun zinc smelter. The closure of the Hunchun smelter, which had capacity of 110,000 tons per year, reduced China's total zinc smelting capacity by about 3%. More cuts are expected over the next 3-5 years, according to analysts.

The decline of China's zinc industry may benefit producers in other parts of the world, especially as supply tightens and zinc prices rise. "Smelter shutdowns in China will be positive for zinc prices if supply from the rest of the world cannot fill the gap," said Neil Hawkins, a commodities analyst at market research firm CRU Group. Zinc prices have increased over 20% this year, fueled partly by expectations of supply deficits due to Chinese cuts.

However, a reversal of trade tensions between China and the U.S. could boost Chinese exports and soften zinc prices again. Uncertainty around China's economic growth and the pace of its "green transition" make the future of its zinc industry unclear. For now, as government mandates drive further environmental crackdowns and the economy continues transitioning toward consumption, China's once-powerful zinc sector faces lingering troubles. Overall, China's struggles may benefit the rest of the world's zinc supply chain - but at the cost of one of the country's historic economic champions.
