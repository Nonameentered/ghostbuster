Weather and Disease Concerns Limit Canadian and Australian Sales of Malting Barley to China   

Canadian and Australian barley growers are facing significant obstacles in exporting malting barley to China this year due to weather events and disease concerns. China is the world’s largest importer of barley and sources over 60% of its malting barley, used to produce beer and spirits, from Canada and Australia. However, a combination of factors may limit sales from these two major exporters this season.

In Canada, a cool and wet spring has delayed barley planting and slowed early-season growth across the Prairies. As of early June, only half of the intended barley crop had been planted in Saskatchewan, a major producing province. The late start to the growing season means Canadian malting barley varieties may not have enough time to reach maturity before harvest. Malting barley has specific quality requirements for plumpness, protein levels, and low moisture content. Immature barley often does not meet these standards.   

At the same time, parts of Australia have experienced periods of drought that have stressed barley crops. New South Wales, a significant barley-growing state, received well below average rainfall for the first five months of the year. While late May and early June rains have provided some moisture relief, drought conditions at certain points in the growing cycle can impact the development of malting barley kernels. The dry weather has also made crops more susceptible to disease, and some Australian barley has shown elevated levels of fusarium head blight this season. This disease can affect the germination quality of barley, a key criterion for malting varieties.

With concerns about meeting malting standards due to weather and disease, both Canada and Australia are seeing lower supplies of feed-grade barley that fully meet China’s quality requirements for malting barley. This may limit sales volumes to China, which demands premium-quality malting barley to produce beer brands like Tsingtao and Yanjing. China increased its barley tariff on Australian barley earlier this year to spread imports between suppliers, but it still relies heavily on top-quality malting barley from Canada and Australia. Limitations on malting barley exports to China could see higher carry-out stocks remaining in Canada and Australia this season.
