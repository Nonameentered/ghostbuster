Chinese Traders Take Advantage of Sharp Copper Rally by Selling Back to Market 

Chinese copper traders have taken advantage of a sharp rally in copper prices this week by selling part of their stockpiles back to the market, according to several sources familiar with trading activity.

Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange rose nearly 5% over two days this week, fueled by optimism over China economic stimulus measures and fears of supply disruptions in Chile and Indonesia. The price increase led many analysts to predict the start of a new bull run for the red metal after a weak 2019.

However, Chinese traders saw it as an opportunity to generate profits by selling some of the copper they had been holding in warehouses and private storage facilities. These traders bought copper earlier this year when prices were lower, with the expectation prices would recover. “The speed and scale of the recent price rally surprised many and the chance to lock in good profits was too tempting to pass up for some,” said a Shanghai-based commodities trader who works with Chinese copper importers and producers.

Estimates of how much Chinese traders sold range from 50,000 to 100,000 metric tons. While a fraction of the country's total copper demand and stockpiles, the selling took some of the momentum out of the rally, causing copper prices to pare some gains. Some analysts worry further selling could weigh prices down in coming weeks. “The rally started to run out of steam as some major players decided to get out while the going was still good,” said Oliver Nugent, commodities strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.

Still, most analysts say the fundamentals supporting higher copper prices remain in place. Demand for copper in China, the world's largest consumer of the metal, is expected to recover now that economic activity is picking up again after the coronavirus outbreak. At the same time, global copper supply faces significant risks, including potential work stoppages at major mines in Chile and Indonesia. "While technical selling slowed the rally, copper's positive fundamentals should reassert themselves before too long," said Frederic Neumann, head of Asian economics research at HSBC in Hong Kong.

The episode highlights the role stockpiles and speculative trading can play in commodity markets, even for resources with large volumes like copper. Still, traders say most Chinese buyers plan to hold onto their stocks in anticipation prices will move even higher in coming months as demand strengthens further. “We sold some just to generate cash, but we're holding the bulk of our metal,” said a Shanghai copper trader. “Demand will catch up and when it does, prices have a lot more room to run.”
