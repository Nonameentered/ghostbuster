China Seizes Soybean and Soymeal Markets After National Day Celebrations 

China's soybean and soymeal markets seized this week following a week-long holiday for National Day celebrations. Chinese buyers returned to the market hungry for supplies, driving futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange up by the daily limit.

Soybean futures for January delivery climbed 4.5% to 3,976 yuan per ton, the maximum allowed under exchange rules. Soymeal futures also hit their daily up limit, gaining 3.5% to 3,248 yuan per ton.

The gains reflect strong demand in China, which accounts for about 60% of the world's soybean imports. For the week ended September 25th, before the market closed for China's National Day holiday, the country's soybean imports totaled 9.03 million tons, up 19.5% from last year, according to customs data. Soymeal imports were up 38% over the same period. 

 China's recovery from African swine fever has also boosted demand for soybeans, which are used to feed hogs. China has the world's largest pig herd, though it suffered significant losses from swine fever last year and earlier this year. Herd numbers are now rebounding, increasing demand for feed.

The spike in Chinese buying this week helped lift global soybean prices. Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade gained 1.7% on Tuesday, the first trading day this week for U.S. markets. Soybean futures for November delivery rose 11.25 cents to $10.46 a bushel. Soymeal futures rose 1.2% to $321.10 per short ton.

U.S. soybean growers depend heavily on China, the top export market. Total U.S. soybean exports to China in the 2019-2020 marketing year reached over $14 billion. Strong demand from China this week suggests continued momentum in that trade relationship, despite ongoing political tensions between the two nations.

Rabobank analyst Oscar Tjakra said this week's surge in Chinese soybean buying was linked both to China's National Day holiday as well as signs of improved demand from downstream users like pig farmers and feed producers. "There might be some worries over tight old-crop soybean supplies in China during the holiday," Tjakra said. He expects prices will stabilize in the coming weeks as the holiday's impact fades.

In summary, Chinese buyers returned from a weeklong National Day holiday to drive the nation's soybean and soymeal futures up by the daily trading limit. The gains reflect surging demand in China, the world's top soybean importer, as well as a rebound in the country's pig herd following an outbreak of African swine fever. The spike in Chinese futures also helped lift global soybean prices, benefiting U.S. soybean growers. While prices may stabilize in the coming weeks, this week's moves highlight China's significant influence on global soybean markets.
