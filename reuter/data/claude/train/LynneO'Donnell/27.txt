International Trading Companies Refuse to Accept China's Right to Reinspect and Reject Cargoes 

Major international trading companies are pushing back against new Chinese regulations that give Chinese customs officials the right to reinspect and reject cargoes that have already cleared customs in the exporter's country. The companies argue this undermines established international trade rules and creates uncertainty that could disrupt supply chains.

According to the new rules issued by China's General Administration of Customs in December, Chinese customs inspectors now have the right to re-examine goods that have already been inspected and cleared by customs in the exporting country before they are shipped to China. The Chinese officials can reject the cargo if they find it does not comply with China's rules after their re-inspection. 

Leading trading companies including Cargill, Louis Dreyfus Company, and Glencore Agriculture have written to the administration to express their concerns. They argue this contradicts international conventions that stipulate goods that receive clearance from export customs should not be subject to re-inspection at the importing border.

"This new measure creates uncertainty in the supply chain and undermines established efficient business practices," the companies wrote in their letter. They said it could lead to lengthy cargo delays, spoilage of perishable goods, and financial losses. The companies have asked China to repeal the new rules and rely on inspections done by exporting countries' customs agencies.

China implemented the new rules amid rising concerns over food safety and quality of imported goods. But critics argue the measure is protectionist and not aligned with China's commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization. There are also concerns the re-inspections could be used by China as a pressure tactic in ongoing trade disputes with exporting countries like the United States and Canada.  

Trading companies are hoping discussions can resolve these issues and prevent a protracted standoff that could seriously disrupt agricultural commodities trade with China, one of the world's top food importers. But for now, the companies say they have no choice but to follow the Chinese requirementsâ€”while continuing to advocate for their repeal.
