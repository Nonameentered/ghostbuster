Chinese traders cashing in on higher copper prices 

Copper prices have soared over the past year, fueled by increased demand and supply constraints, and Chinese copper traders are reaping the benefits. Copper futures prices on the London Metal Exchange have risen more than 75% over the last 12 months to trade around $9,800 per tonne. The price increases have been driven by a recovery in global manufacturing activity after the pandemic-induced recession last year as well as supply chain issues limiting copper production in some major producing countries like Chile.

Chinese traders play an outsized role in global copper markets, accounting for an estimated 60-80% of copper futures trading on the LME. They have been able to generate large profits from the run-up in copper prices over the past year by buying copper futures and then selling the contracts at a higher price before they expire. According to industry estimates, Chinese traders could have made profits of $3 billion to $4 billion from copper futures trading last year. The higher copper prices have also boosted the value of copper stockpiles held by many Chinese traders.  

The jump in Chinese traders’ profits and copper stock values highlights China’s influence in global commodities markets. Chinese buying and selling activity frequently impacts copper and other metal prices on the LME.  Some mining companies argue the Chinese traders’ short-term speculative activity contributes to price volatility. However, others say the traders add needed liquidity to the copper market, especially when prices start rising or declining rapidly.

Jiang Mingjun, a copper products trader in Shanghai, said he expects copper prices to remain high due to continuing strong demand in China. "Both manufacturing and infrastructure investment have been doing well so copper consumption is still quite stable," he said.  Jiang plans to continue actively trading copper futures and buying copper stock in anticipation of further price gains this year.  

Not all analysts are optimistic about the outlook for copper, however. Some economists warn high copper prices could dent demand going forward, especially if more end users start substituting cheaper alternative materials. Supply is also expected to increase over the next few years as major mining projects come online. Declining COVID-19 case numbers and the reopening of economies could also slow demand growth for industrial metals compared to the rapid rebound seen over the past year.  

The coming months will be a key test for the rally in copper prices and the profits of Chinese traders. If demand remains strong and supply struggles to catch up, traders like Jiang are likely to generate further windfalls from rising copper values. But if the price cycle starts to turn, many may end up suffering losses from falling futures and stock values in a declining market. For now though, Chinese copper traders are enjoying the rewards of the red metal’s remarkable run.
