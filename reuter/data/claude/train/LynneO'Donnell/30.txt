China's Higher Wheat Production Slashes Need for Imports Amid U.S.-China Tensions Over Arms Sales to Taiwan 

China's wheat production is set to increase for the sixth consecutive year, slashing the country's dependence on imports amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with the United States over arms sales to Taiwan.

According to estimates from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the 2020 winter wheat harvest is projected to reach 132.5 million tonnes, up 2 percent from last year. The larger crop, combined with ample domestic reserves, means China will import little to no wheat in the coming year. The reduced need for imports comes at a time of frayed relations with major wheat exporting nations like the U.S. and Australia.

"With another big harvest, China has ensured its wheat security and independence for the foreseeable future," said Li Qiang, an agricultural economist based in Beijing. "There is no urgency now for China to buy from countries it has political difficulties with."

Politics have loomed over China's wheat trade in recent years. Beijing imposed large tariffs on Australian barley and suspended some meat imports over disputes with Canberra. The U.S. and China have also sparred over Taiwan, with the Trump administration approving multiple arms sales to the self-governing island. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has threatened retaliation over the weapons deals.

"Wheat has frequently been caught up in disputes between China and its trading partners," said Jiao Lin, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities in Hong Kong. "When politics are bad, China relies more on itself."

Supported by government subsidies and investments in agriculture, Chinese farmers have steadily adopted higher-yielding wheat varieties and improved farming techniques, allowing the country to scale back imports. China is on track to produce more than 95 percent of the wheat it consumes this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Just five years ago, China imported more than 3 million tonnes of wheat, including over 2 million tonnes from the U.S.

The diminished trade is a blow to North American wheat exporters who banked on steep growth in demand from China's huge population. Canadian wheat exports to China have fallen by two-thirds since 2016 due to restrictions on Canadian canola and barley. For U.S. wheat farmers, losing China as a customer has contributed to a wider export crisis that has driven prices to multiyear lows.
