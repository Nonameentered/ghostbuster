Shanghai tycoon Tung Chee-hwa elected as Hong Kong's future leader 

HONG KONG - Tung Chee-hwa, a wealthy Shanghai-based businessman, was selected today to become Hong Kong's first chief executive when China resumes control of the territory on July 1. 

The 60-year-old Tung, who heads one of Shanghai's largest property development firms, overwhelmingly won election by a 400-member committee chosen by Beijing to pick Hong Kong's future leader. Tung received 320 votes, far more than the minimum of 200 required to win.

Tung pledged in his acceptance speech to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy, defend civil liberties like free speech and assembly that are not enjoyed in mainland China, and make the territory prosperous. But Tung's close ties to Beijing have made some Hong Kong residents uneasy about erosion of freedoms after the handover from Britain.

"The challenges ahead are numerous and complex, but I believe that with cooperation and solidarity, Hong Kong will prosper and its way of life will be preserved," Tung told the election committee.

A critic of the British during negotiations over Hong Kong's future, Tung has more recently sought to reassure residents and foreign investors that their interests will be protected under Chinese rule. But his opponents argue that Beijing will wield power over the chief executive and roll back civil liberties despite its pledge to keep Hong Kong's autonomy intact for at least 50 years.

The lavish election committee meeting was held in the Hong Kong Convention Center before scores of local and foreign journalists. But pro-democracy activists decried the process as a sham because the committee is considered a rubber-stamp body loyal to Beijing. They say Tung was the only acceptable candidate in China's eyes.

Britain's 155-year control of Hong Kong is scheduled to end June 30 when it hands the territory back to China under an agreement reached in 1984. The impending transfer of power has unsettled many Hong Kong citizens and caused some to emigrate abroad amid fears that China will not uphold its promise of "one country, two systems".

According to that concept, Hong Kong will remain a capitalist economy and keep its common law legal system separate from communist China's for at least 50 years. But China's authoritarian leaders will retain control over defense and foreign affairs, and have now also gained sway over choosing Hong Kong's leader.
