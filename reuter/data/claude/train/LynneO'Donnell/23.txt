Chinese and U.S. scientists making progress on poultry import ban dispute 

Chinese and American government scientists are moving closer to resolving a long-standing dispute over China's ban on U.S. poultry imports. The ban, which China imposed in 2015 following an outbreak of avian influenza in the U.S., has been a thorn in trade relations between the two nations. However, officials report that recent negotiations and facility visits have been constructive.

A delegation of Chinese scientists recently conducted a week-long inspection of poultry processing facilities in the U.S. The team visited farms and plants across three states, checking on health standards, contamination controls, and compliance with international trade rules. U.S. officials said the Chinese representatives appeared satisfied with the visit. "They seem to appreciate the safeguards we have in place," said an official from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

For their part, U.S. scientists will visit chicken producers in China later this month. They will review whether China's concerns over U.S. health standards have been adequately addressed before imports can resume. "These technical discussions between experts are an important step," said a spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. "We hope they will pave the way to China lifting its ban on U.S. poultry." 

China is the world's largest poultry importer, and U.S. poultry producers estimate over $1 billion in exports are at stake. Ending the ban would be a win for U.S. trade policy and help reduce the trade imbalance with China. However, food safety remains a sensitive issue, and China will need to be fully confident the health risks of importing U.S. poultry have been mitigated before changing its policy.

Continued progress in the negotiations and facility visits are positive signs, but a final resolution may still take several months of technical talks. U.S. officials said they hope new export certificates and updated screening procedures will provide enough reassurance for China to lift the poultry ban sometime next year. But until a deal is finalized, the U.S. poultry industry will have to wait to regain access to the lucrative Chinese market.
