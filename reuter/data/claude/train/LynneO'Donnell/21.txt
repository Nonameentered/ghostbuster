U.S. Officials Hopeful for Breakthrough in Multi-Million Dollar Chinese Poultry Market Dispute

U.S. Trade officials expressed optimism Tuesday that recent negotiations with China could lead to the resumption of American poultry exports for the first time since 2015. China banned imports of U.S. poultry in 2015 following an outbreak of avian influenza. U.S. poultry producers estimate they have lost over $1 billion annually in trade with China, their second-largest market during the pre-ban years. 

Representatives from the U.S. poultry industry joined officials from the United States Trade Representative's office and the U.S. Department of Agriculture on a call with Chinese officials last week for productive talks. The Chinese appeared receptive to a proposal that would resume poultry trade from certain U.S. states and companies that have not reported any avian influenza outbreaks. Exports could resume from those approved locations and companies while Chinese inspectors visit and ensure compliance with food safety standards.

"We are cautiously optimistic that poultry exports to China could restart in some capacity by mid-year if these talks continue progressing well," said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council. The industry group has worked closely with the U.S. government to address China's food safety concerns and demonstrate how any risk of disease can be mitigated. "Even limited approvals for trade from some companies would be an important first step in rebuilding what had been a critical market."

U.S. farmers welcomed news of the progress in trade talks but cautioned that China has made promises in the past that did not materialize. “We’ve been disappointed before, so I’m not opening any bottles of champagne just yet,” said Andy Hitchcock, a chicken farmer in Mississippi. “But any exports are better than nothing at this point. The Chinese market was so important, and it's hurt not having them as a customer.”

The ban on U.S. poultry came at a time when American meat producers were exporting record volumes of other animal proteins like pork and beef to China. While sales of those meats have soared, poultry remains sidelined in the U.S.-China trade relationship. Securing the resumption of even limited poultry trade would offer hope to producers who have invested in infrastructure and operations to serve the Chinese market. U.S. officials said they remain committed to negotiations with the goal of allowing all eligible U.S. poultry producers to resume exports to China.
