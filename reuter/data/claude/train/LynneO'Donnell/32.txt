Chinese Corn Exporters Cut Prices, but Still Higher Than Prevailing World Prices    

China’s leading corn exporters announced price cuts of up to 10% for shipments of the grain for early 2014 in an effort to boost sales. However,  the newly lowered prices remain well above prevailing world corn prices, suggesting Chinese exporters may continue to struggle to find international buyers.

The China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, or COFCO, said it cut export prices for corn shipped in January and February to around $315 a metric ton. That represents a drop of $35 a ton from previous prices but remains more than 50% higher than average corn prices on the Chicago futures exchange of around $210 a ton. 

The high prices of Chinese corn exports relative to the global market reflect strong domestic corn demand and prices in China. Corn futures on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange are currently trading at around $345 per ton, supported by growing demand from the country’s livestock sector and ethanol producers.

While reducing prices, exporters like COFCO are still aiming to achieve a premium that compensates them for the higher costs of sourcing corn in the domestic Chinese market, analysts said. However, the gap with international prices risks being too wide to attract many foreign buyers, especially given China’s mixed reputation as a reliable corn supplier.

In recent years, China has swung from being a corn exporter to a net importer as demand surged, raising concerns about available supply for export contracts. In 2012, China defaulted on more than 1.2 million tons of U.S. corn purchases due to rising domestic prices.

Reduced Chinese exports are likely to support world corn prices, but the overall impact will depend on the extent to which importers source corn from other major suppliers like Brazil, Ukraine and Argentina instead. China exports only around 2-3% of the total corn it produces annually, limiting its ability to drive large price moves on global markets despite its status as the world’s second-largest corn grower.

In summary, while Chinese corn exporters are making efforts to come down from extremely elevated price levels, they face an uphill battle to sell meaningful volumes on the global market as long as domestic prices and demand keep exports largely uncompetitive. For now, China appears poised to remain only a minor player in world corn trade.
