China bans poultry imports from two US states to prevent deadly epidemic, not connected to politics says US official 

China announced today that it will ban poultry imports from Arkansas and Missouri in an effort to prevent a potential outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus that has infected chickens on farms in those states. The Chinese government said the ban is aimed at protecting public health and is not connected to the ongoing trade tensions with the United States.

U.S. officials expressed disappointment with the move but said they expect it will be temporary. "We understand China's need to take precautionary actions to protect public health," said a spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. "This appears to be a good faith effort focused strictly on health security, not tied to our bilateral trade issues." 

China is the world's second largest poultry consumer and produces more than 18 billion chickens annually. However, its poultry supply has been hit hard recently due to multiple outbreaks of avian flu. Public health experts in China have been warning about the risk of the virus entering from infected imports. The country previously banned poultry from other nations including Poland, Thailand, and Canada to prevent the spread of the disease.

The specific type of avian flu detected on poultry farms in Arkansas and Missouri is H5N2, a highly pathogenic strain that can spread rapidly and cause up to 100% mortality in infected flocks. While the risk of human infection is low, health officials say continued spread between farms could increase the chances the virus mutates and becomes more transmissible to people. The United States has experienced several large-scale outbreaks on commercial and backyard poultry farms over the past decade.

Industry groups said the export ban will financially hurt poultry farmers in Arkansas, Missouri, and other states that export hundreds of millions of dollars of poultry products to China each year. “We hope China will lift this ban as soon as the health risk passes to avoid irreparable harm to U.S. poultry producers,” said Mike Brown, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. 

U.S. officials said they are committed to controlling the spread of the virus and limiting damage. Federal and state agriculture agencies have quarantined affected farms, banned transport of poultry from the regions, and are working to cull millions of birds. They hope these actions, along with stepped up surveillance of poultry flocks, will prompt China to lift the ban within weeks. But experts warned the avian flu threat will persist as long as the virus continues to circulate and mutate in wild birds and the environment.
