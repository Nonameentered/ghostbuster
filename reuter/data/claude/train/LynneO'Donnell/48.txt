Can China Really Feed Itself? Experts Doubt Country's Goal of Grain Self-Sufficiency 

China has long aimed for self-sufficiency in grains like rice, wheat, and corn to ensure its food security. However, experts doubt whether China can realistically achieve and sustain self-sufficiency in grains as the country's population grows, incomes rise, and arable land shrinks.

China has a population of 1.4 billion people, which requires massive amounts of food. China currently produces about 95% of the grains it consumes, but it still has to import grains like soybeans and wheat to meet total demand. As China's population continues to urbanize and become wealthier, the demand for grains is rising faster than domestic production. The changing diets of Chinese consumers, who now want more meat, dairy, and processed foods, require more grain to feed livestock and as food additives.

At the same time, China's available farmland has declined in recent years due to urbanization, pollution, and desertification. China has just 7% of the world's arable land to produce food for nearly 20% of the world's population. The country's farmland has shrunk by nearly 10% over the last decade, and another 200,000 square kilometers are polluted by heavy metals like cadmium and lead. China's wheat yields have plateaued, and rice yields are declining due to land and water constraints.  

To boost grain production, China has emphasized high-yielding hybrid rice and corn, expanded genetic engineering and seed technologies, and subsidized farmers. However, these strategies are unlikely to be enough given resource constraints and rising demand. Importing more grains and diversifying food sources may be inevitable to fill the gap, according to many experts. 

Still, self-sufficiency remains an important goal for China's policymakers for reasons related to politics, security, and national interest. China relies heavily on imported oil and gas, and does not want to become overly dependent on foreign sources for another critical product: food. But the reality is China can no longer feed itself, at least not with grains alone. Achieving sustainable self-sufficiency will require policymakers to adapt to China's new challenges and balance the trade-offs between imports, exports, and domestic production. Relying more on world food markets, international trade, and cooperation will also be essential for China to nourish its growing nation. Overall, feeding 1.4 billion people will remain a formidable challenge for China for generations to come.

 The article summarizes the key issues around China's goal for grain self-sufficiency, including rising demand, limited resources, the pros and cons of relying on imports, and the complex challenges involved with feeding China's huge population.
