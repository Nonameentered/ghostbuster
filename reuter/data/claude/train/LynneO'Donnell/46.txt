Analysts and Traders Predict Demand as Driving Force for China's Metals Markets in 1997 

Beijing, China - Industry analysts and commodities traders are forecasting strong demand in China's metals markets in 1997, driven primarily by growing domestic consumption and China's robust economic growth. According to estimates from China's State Statistical Bureau, the nation's GDP grew 9.5% in 1996 and similar year-over-year growth is projected for 1997. This steady economic expansion, along with China's increasing urbanization and industrialization, is fueling higher demand for steel, copper, aluminum and other base metals.

"China's metals sector will continue to be a growth market as the government pursues policies aimed at boosting domestic demand and increasing living standards across the country," said Jiang Wu, chief metals analyst at the Beijing-based research firm Sina Finance. Wu forecasts demand growth of between 6 to 8 percent for steel, 5 to 7 percent for copper, and 7 to 10 percent for aluminum in China this year. These rates outpace predicted global metals demand growth and highlight China's increasing significance as a key driver of commodity prices.

The construction and manufacturing sectors are seen as particularly strong sources of demand for metals. China's real estate and infrastructure buildout, including road, rail and subway projects, require vast quantities of steel and copper. Automobile production is also surging, up over 30 percent in 1996, boosting aluminum usage. "Every new vehicle uses up to 50 kilograms more aluminum than older models, due to increased use in engine blocks, wheels and body parts. We expect China's auto sector to remain robust for years to come," said Li Chen, a commodities trader at Sinochem Futures Co. in Shanghai. 

While strong demand is fueling optimism, some analysts point to oversupply risks for certain metals like steel. China's steel production capacity has ballooned to over 200 million tonnes but demand is projected at around 150 million tonnes for 1997. The resulting oversupply could drive down domestic steel prices and hurt producer profit margins. Imported metals may face similar pricing pressures from excess supply.

Still, most industry observers remain confident in the overall strength and momentum of China's metals markets going forward, given projections for steady economic growth of 8 to 9 percent annually. Barring a major slowdown, demand is expected to remain healthy in both the short and medium-term. For international metals producers and the global commodities industry, China should continue to be a vital source of increasing consumption and a key driver of prices in 1997 and beyond. Overall, the fundamentals suggest a bright outlook for metals in China this year.
