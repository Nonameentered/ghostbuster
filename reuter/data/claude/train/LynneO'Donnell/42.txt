China Bans Poultry Imports from Two US States over Deadly Epidemic Concerns

China announced today that it is banning all poultry imports from Indiana and Wisconsin due to concerns over a deadly strain of bird flu affecting the two Midwestern states. The ban is effective immediately and will last indefinitely until the epidemic is fully contained. 

The move comes after an aggressive strain of avian influenza was detected on several poultry farms in Indiana and Wisconsin in recent weeks. The H5N1 virus, known as "bird flu," is highly contagious and lethal to birds. It does not usually spread to humans, but in rare cases can also lead to fatal infections in people who have close contact with infected birds.

According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), bird flu has been detected in 14 facilities across Indiana and Wisconsin, affecting over 200,000 turkeys and chickens. The USDA has quarantined the affected farms and culled all birds to contain the spread of the disease. However, China stated that the large scale of the outbreak and lack of a clear path to control warranted an immediate and total ban on all imports of poultry and related products from the two states.

"We are taking a prudent and cautious approach by suspending poultry imports from Indiana and Wisconsin to protect public health in China," said Liu Wenjun, an official with China's General Administration of Customs in a statement. China is the second largest market for US poultry products, importing over $1 billion of poultry meat and related goods in 2018. The ban is expected to significantly impact US poultry exporters by reducing demand and sales.

The USDA criticized China's move as an "overreaction" that is not supported by science or international standards. "Banning imports from entire states is an extreme measure that is not appropriate, given that the outbreaks are limited to certain farms and the US has safety systems in place to avoid contaminated products entering commerce," the USDA said in a statement. The agency urged China to reconsider its import restrictions to avoid unwarranted trade disruptions.

There is no deadline on when China may lift the ban, creating uncertainty for poultry producers across Indiana and Wisconsin. Industry groups are calling on the US government to push back against China's restrictions and make the case that regionalization, not statewide import bans, should be implemented in response to limited disease outbreaks. “The livelihoods of our poultry producers are at stake due to this unjustified trade action,” said Mike Brown, president of the National Chicken Council. With no end in sight, poultry farmers in the affected states are bracing for substantial losses.
