U.S. Officials Celebrate Success in Talks to Avert Chinese Poultry Import Ban  

U.S. trade officials announced today that negotiations with China to prevent an import ban on American poultry products were successful. After weeks of discussions, China agreed to continue allowing the import of U.S. chicken, turkey, and other poultry following threats from Beijing to prohibit such imports due to concerns overavian influenza outbreaks in some American farms.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer hailed the outcome as evidence the current administration can achieve trade victories and protect American farmers. "Our poultry farmers feed millions across the globe, and they deserve the certainty of continued access to customers in China," Perdue said in a statement. Lighthizer added that "ensuring China lives up to its commitments and opens its market to U.S. poultry is a top priority for this administration."

According to U.S. government data, the U.S. exported nearly $1 billion worth of poultry and related products to China last year, making it the second largest export market for American poultry in the world. Broiler chickens, or chickens raised specifically for meat production, make up the majority of poultry exports to China. Farm groups warned that losing access to the Chinese market would be "catastrophic" for the U.S. poultry industry. 

China announced plans last month to ban poultry imports from the U.S. after several cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, were detected in chickens at farms in Tennessee and Kentucky. No human infections were reported. While the disease can spread to humans, the risk is low, according to health experts. China has a strict policy against avian influenza and previously banned poultry imports over similar concerns. U.S. officials argued that a total ban was an unnecessary overreaction given tight biosecurity controls at American poultry farms and processing facilities.

Through several rounds of talks, U.S. and Chinese negotiators reached an agreement to allow continued imports but with additional inspections and oversight to ensure compliance with safety protocols. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will also increase surveillance for avian influenza and report findings to Chinese authorities on a weekly basis.

Industry groups praised the agreement as an outcome that benefits poultry producers and consumers in both countries. Some U.S. chicken farmers and processers expressed relief that a vital market remains open, even with the additional oversight required under the deal. "We're grateful U.S. and Chinese officials were able to find a solution that allows us to continue sending high-quality American poultry to China, while also protecting public health," said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.

The U.S. and China are engaged in broader trade negotiations as the Trump administration seeks to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China and address unfair trade practices. The threat of steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods has loomed over the talks, though a resolution has proved elusive so far. Today's announcement was a rare moment of progress that alleviates at least one area of trade tensions, providing optimism the two sides can make progress on the more complex issues that remain unresolved.
