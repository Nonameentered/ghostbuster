News Corp under pressure to achieve 20% growth target or face consequences 

Media giant News Corp is under intensifying pressure from investors and analysts to achieve its ambitious 20% revenue growth target for the fiscal year or face potential consequences. News Corp CEO Robert Thomson announced the aggressive growth plan last year but the company has struggled to meet revenue targets in recent quarters. 

News Corp's revenue declined 5% in the most recent quarter, driven by falling print advertising revenue and declines in newspaper circulation. The company's stock price has dropped nearly 30% over the last year on concerns about the sustainability of News Corp's revenue model in an increasingly digital landscape. Investors are worried the 20% growth target for the full fiscal year is unrealistic and unattainable given current trends.

"News Corp has failed to keep up with changes in the media industry and how people consume news today," said Jill Smith, an analyst at MM Partners. "Their strategy is too focused on traditional revenue streams like print newspapers and not innovative enough on the digital front. A 20% revenue increase seems very unlikely unless something dramatically changes."

News Corp does generate strong profits and revenue from sources like The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins books, and cable channel Fox News. However, the company needs to accelerate its pivot to video, mobile, and other digital platforms to achieve its long term growth goals, analysts say. Some shareholders have put pressure on the company to take more drastic actions like divesting certain legacy print properties or even breaking up the company to unlock greater shareholder value.

In a statement, a News Corp spokesperson reaffirmed the company's commitment to the 20% growth target and pointed to new digital initiatives, equipment and production upgrades at The Wall Street Journal, and other investments aimed at promoting innovation and transformation. However, time is running out for the company to make up ground and demonstrate material progress before the fiscal year closes in June. News Corp is at an inflection point where more significant changes may be needed to revive growth and long term prosperity. The next few quarters will be critically important for the company to achieve its ambitions or confront the implications of coming up short.
