Coles Myer predicts profit growth but faces shareholder backlash at annual meeting

Coles Myer executives painted a bright picture of the company's future at their annual general meeting  today but faced criticism from shareholders over executive pay and company performance. 

CEO Steven Cain announced Coles Myer expected sales to grow 3-4% over the next year and for earnings to increase 5-10% based on strategic initiatives around improving customer experience, lowering prices and revamping stores. However, Mr. Cain acknowledged the company's share price had declined over the past year, saying 'we understand shareholder frustration and are working hard to regain confidence and improve returns.'

Shareholders voiced anger over the company's poor share price performance and $8.5 million in bonuses paid to executives despite a drop in profits and share value. One shareholder described the executive bonuses as 'rewarded for mediocrity.' Another shareholder questioned the company's digital strategy, saying Coles Myer was 'losing ground to competitors who have invested in online shopping and home delivery.' 

In response, Mr. Cain pointed to Coles Myer's rollout of click-and-collect services, digital catalogue and online shopping options for customers. He said the company's turnaround was 'a long journey' but they had a clear strategy to revitalise stores, improve customer experience and boost online offerings. However, Mr. Cain admitted Coles Myer had more work to do to gain back investor confidence.

The backlash highlights concerns that Coles Myer has failed to adapt quickly enough to changes in shopping habits and increased competition from new entrants like Amazon. While the company's profit targets were greeted positively, shareholders clearly remain unconvinced about Coles Myer's ability to achieve sustainable long-term growth. Overall, it was an awkward meeting that revealed a Company still under pressure to prove its relevance to customers and investors alike.
