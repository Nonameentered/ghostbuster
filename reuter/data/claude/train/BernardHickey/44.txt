TNT Ltd Positioned for Strong Profit Growth, Continues to Sell Unprofitable Assets 

TNT Ltd, a multinational shipping and logistics company headquartered in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, announced strong profits for the first half of 2020 and the sale of three underperforming business units. The divestitures are part of TNT's ongoing strategy to exit non-core operations and focus on its most profitable segments.

TNT reported a 23% increase in net profits for the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period last year. Operating profits were up 18% over the same timeframe. The company attributed the gains to increased e-commerce shipments during the COVID-19 pandemic and cost savings from its restructuring program started in 2018. 

As part of that restructuring, TNT announced the sale of its operations in South America and South-East Asia to local competitors for an undisclosed amount.  The South American business in particular had been a drag on profits, losing money for seven consecutive years. TNT also sold its domestic road freight and parcel delivery unit in Italy, which had low profit margins and lacked scale.

"We are simplifying our portfolio to focus on areas where we can win," said TNT's CEO Joris Hagens. "These divestitures will allow us to allocate more resources to our most profitable segments like international shipping and logistics solutions for small and medium enterprises in Europe."

The sales follow TNT's divestment of its U.S-based delivery business and service centers in China last year. After these latest divestitures, TNT said it would have exited 15 countries in the last 3 years. The company expects the sales to reduce revenues but increase operating profits and profit margins over the next year.

TNT's stock price rose 3% on the news. Investors reacted positively to the sales and strong profits, which suggest TNT's turnaround efforts are gaining traction. With a simplified portfolio and costs under control, TNT appears positioned to boost profits over the next year despite the economic ramifications of the pandemic. The company aims to expand its most successful divisions across Europe and grow market share by offering tailored solutions to SMEs.
