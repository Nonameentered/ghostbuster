Media Group News Corp Must Deliver Strong Second Quarter Profit or Risk Failing to Hit Growth Target 

News Corp, the media conglomerate controlled by billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is under pressure to deliver strong profits and revenue growth in the upcoming second quarter earnings report. Analysts are warning that the company risks missing its full-year growth targets if it fails to substantially beat analyst expectations for the fiscal quarter ending December 31.

News Corp spans print, digital and broadcast media, owning properties such as The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Fox News Channel, Fox Sports and book publisher HarperCollins. However, the traditional media industry is facing major headwinds due to declines in print advertising and circulation, the shift to online and digital media consumption, and competition from major tech companies like Google and Facebook dominating the online ad market.

In August, News Corp reported fiscal fourth-quarter profits that missed analyst estimates and revenue that declined 5% compared to the prior year. The company forecast low single-digit revenue and earnings growth for the 2020 fiscal year, but analysts say delivering on these modest targets will require "a big snapback" in the December quarter based on current business trends. 

"News Corp is fighting against larger structural issues, and they need to show improving momentum to hit their guidance for the full year," said Douglas Arthur, managing director at Huber Research Partners. "If they don't have a good December quarter, it's hard to see them achieving that modest level of growth for fiscal 2020."

To drive growth, News Corp is focused on building its digital subscription and licensing businesses. The Wall Street Journal now has more than 2.5 million digital subscribers, and the company aims to reach several million additional subscribers across its other publications and its new streaming services like Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now in Australia. However, digital revenue still only makes up about 21% of total revenue, so print ad declines pose a sizable challenge.

News Corp will report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, February 6 after the market close. Analysts expect revenue of $2.35 billion and earnings per share of $0.17, representing a 4.5% decline in revenue and a 54% drop in profits from the prior-year quarter. Whether News Corp can substantively beat these estimates will be crucial in proving the viability of its growth strategy and turnaround efforts in the face of an unsettled media landscape.
