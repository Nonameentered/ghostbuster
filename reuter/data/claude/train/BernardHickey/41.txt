Lend Lease Corp and Modern Home Co to build Asia's largest markets complex in Northern Bangkok 

Lendlease, an Australian property and infrastructure group, announced today a joint venture with Thailand's leading home improvement retailer Modern Home Co to develop Chatuchak Market Complex, set to be Asia's largest weekend market.

The Chatuchak Market Complex project will revamp and expand the popular Chatuchak Weekend Market in Northern Bangkok. The redevelopment of the 27-hectare site will more than double the number of retail shops to over 15,000 and increase open space for visitors. The new complex will provide an enhanced experience for the market's estimated 200,000 weekly visitors with improved amenities, landscaping, and connectivity.  

"We are excited to partner with Modern Home, a trusted brand in Thailand, on this landmark project that will become a must-see destination in Bangkok," said Dennis Lopez, CEO of Lendlease Asia. "Chatuchak Market Complex highlights Lendlease's expertise in placemaking and our ability to transform urban destinations into vibrant community hubs."

Chatuchak Weekend Market, open only on Saturdays and Sundays, is one of the most popular attractions in Bangkok, offering everything from clothing and handicrafts to plants and pets. The redeveloped Chatuchak Market Complex will be open daily and feature dedicated retail zones for home decor, lifestyle products, urban fashion, and more. The family-friendly destination will also have over 20 food and beverage outlets as well as playgrounds and other recreational facilities across the sprawling site.

"We want to elevate the Chatuchak experience while maintaining its essence as a place for discovery and bargains. The reimagined Complex will offer shoppers an unparalleled retail experience every day of the week," said Preecha Ekkunagul, CEO of Modern Home. Modern Home was founded in Bangkok in 1993 and has since expanded to over 2,000 stores across Thailand and Indochina.

Lendlease and Modern Home aim to commence construction of Chatuchak Market Complex in early 2020. The project has an estimated development cost of over $1 billion and is expected to complete in 2023. For Lendlease, the joint venture expands the company's $15 billion urbanization pipeline in Asia and extends its retail portfolio in Thailand following the launch of community malls under the Payaban brand.
