Westpac Warns of Flattened Profits Amid Fierce Competition 

Westpac, one of Australia's big four banks, has warned investors to expect flat profits for the 2022 financial year as fierce competition and low interest rates put pressure on margins. In an announcement today, Westpac said cash earnings are expected to be broadly in line with the $6.2 billion achieved in 2021.

Westpac CEO Peter King said the competitive dynamics in the banking sector were intensifying. "We have seen strong competition for mortgages and deposits which is reflected in lower interest rates for customers. At the same time, the cash rate remains at a very low 0.1% which also compresses our margins."

Mr. King said Westpac was taking action to improve efficiency and reduce costs to offset the margin pressure. The bank aims to cut costs by $400 million in 2022 through eliminating duplication, simplifying products, digitizing processes and reducing the branch footprint. However, Mr. King warned that it would take time for these savings to flow through and support higher profits.

Westpac’s update highlights the challenging operating conditions confronting Australia’s major banks. With interest rates at record lows, the banks have limited scope to lower rates for borrowers while still maintaining profitable margins. At the same time, fierce competition for high-quality borrowers and deposits is forcing the banks to sacrifice revenue to retain and attract new customers.

Investors reacted negatively to the profit warning, with Westpac shares falling 3% in morning trade following the announcement. Mark Nathan, banking analyst at Morningstar, said the issues raised by Westpac were a concern for the entire banking sector.

“Low rates and tough competition create a toxic cocktail for the banks as it’s hard to generate meaningful growth in profits. Cost-cutting and efficiency can only go so far to offset declining margins,” Mr. Nathan said.  

However, Mr. Nathan said a rise in interest rates in 2022 could significantly boost bank profits if competition eased at the same time. “If the cash rate increases by 1% next year and the frenzied competition for mortgages and deposits moderates, it could mean a 10-15% boost in profits for the major banks.”

Westpac reports its half-year results for 2022 in May. The results will provide more details on how Australia's oldest bank aims to succeed in a low growth, hyper-competitive banking market where profits are under pressure. For investors, the half-year results and outlook commentary will be closely watched for signs Westpac can achieve modest profit growth as interest rates start to rise from 2023.
