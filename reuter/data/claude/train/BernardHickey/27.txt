Australia's Financial System Inquiry Considers Possibility of Bank Mergers and Foreign Takeovers

The Australian government's Financial System Inquiry is considering recommendations that could reshape the nation's banking system. The inquiry, led by former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray, is examining the possibility of boosting competition in the banking sector through bank mergers and increased foreign investment.   

Australia's big four banks—Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB—dominate the local market, controlling around 80% of assets. Critics argue this concentration has led to a lack of meaningful competition and higher fees for consumers. The inquiry is assessing ways to improve competitiveness, with one option being to encourage mergers of smaller banks and other financial institutions to create more robust competitors to the big four. However, some experts warn that further consolidation could have the opposite effect and reduce competition even more.

Another proposal being considered is increasing the threshold for allowable foreign investment in Australian banks from 15% to 49% or higher. This could pave the way for major overseas banks to buy substantial stakes in Australian institutions and shake up the market. The big four banks oppose such a large increase, arguing it would pose risks to financial stability and reduce Australian ownership and control. But proponents claim it would boost competition, access to capital and innovation.

The inquiry's interim report, published in July 2014, supported relaxing restrictions on foreign bank ownership to promote competition. However, it stopped short of recommending an increase to 49%, suggesting a staged approach instead. The final report is due in November 2014 and the government will then decide which recommendations to adopt.

Treasurer Joe Hockey has signaled he is open to considering all options to improve competitiveness, as long as stability is not compromised. "We are not afraid of foreign investment and we are not afraid of competition," he said. The Greens and some independents are also pushing for bold reforms to reduce the dominance of the major banks.

Any big changes will face opposition from the powerful banking lobby, which argues Australia's banking system is very competitive compared to other countries and does not need a major overhaul. The inquiry has a difficult balancing act in proposing reforms that will genuinely improve consumer outcomes without destabilizing a critical part of the economy. All eyes will be on the final recommendations and the government's response in coming months. Overall, a shake-up of the banking sector could be in store over the next few years, depending on the outcome of the inquiry and the political willingness for reform.
