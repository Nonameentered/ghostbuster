TNT Ltd Reports Annual Profit Slump But Promises Strong Growth Through Reforms & Sale of Airline 

TNT Ltd, the international delivery and logistics company, reported a significant drop in annual profits today due to higher costs and sustained economic challenges in key markets. However, the company said it was undertaking major reforms and strategic changes that would drive strong growth and improved profitability in the coming years.

Net profit for the financial year ended December 31st fell by 32% to $450 million, TNT Ltd said in a statement. Revenue rose by a modest 1.8% to $23.1 billion, not enough to offset a 7.4% increase in operating costs. 

The weak results were attributed to sluggish global trade growth, competitive pressures in the freight transport sector, and losses from TNT’s budget airline which has been hit hard by rising fuel costs and overcapacity.

TNT’s Chief Executive, Jenny Lim, said the group had already commenced a sweeping restructure to simplify its business, cut costs, and refocus on its core delivery and logistics operations. “We have stripped out management layers, consolidated business units, and reduced headcount by over 10% to improve decision making and make TNT a leaner competitor,” she said.

The most significant change however will come from the planned sale of TNT’s airline and aircraft leasing division which the company said was “non-essential” to its delivery business and a drag on profits. “Exiting the airline industry will lift a major burden from the group and allow us to channel investment and management effort into our logistics and freight operations where we have key competitive advantages,” Ms Lim stated.

Proceeds from the sale would be used to expand TNT’s delivery network in Asia and emerging markets, and potentially fund acquisitions to strengthen the group’s express and logistics services, especially in e-commerce delivery.  

Ms. Lim said the company was targeting annual growth of 6-8% in revenue and double-digit gains in profits over the next three years if its turnaround strategy succeeds. “TNT has had a difficult run, but we are now in a position to unlock the group’s true potential and build strong momentum off the back of a simpler, more focused business model and improved trading conditions,” she concluded.

Investors reacted positively to TNT’s plans, with the company’s shares closing up 3.4% at $6.92 following the announcement. Analysts said the sale of the airline could net TNT more than $3 billion and help transform its prospects.
