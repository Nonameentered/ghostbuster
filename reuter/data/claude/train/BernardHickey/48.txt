News Corp reports lower than expected profit for first half of 1996/97, but remains confident in 20% profit boost for full year

Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation today reported a drop in net income for the first half of the 1996/97 financial year but remained confident of boosting full-year profits by 20% based on strength in its cable networks division and cost cutting measures.   

Net income for the six months to December 31 fell 15% to $284 million due to weaker than expected advertising revenue at its newspapers in Australia and higher programming costs at the Fox television network in the U.S. Revenue for the period rose 9% to $5.8 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth at the company's cable networks division.

News Corp's troubled Fox television network in the U.S. reported a 25% drop in operating income to $117 million as it faced higher costs to produce new shows and secure sports broadcasting rights. The network, however, is forecasting a recovery in the second half as it reduces costs and rides a boost in ratings from coverage of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 motor race.   

In contrast, News Corp's cable networks division reported a 27% rise in operating income to $227 million, bolstered by higher fees from cable companies and advertising growth at channels such as Fox Sports Networks and the Fox News Channel. Revenue at the division climbed 15% to $1.2 billion.   

"Our cable networks went from strength to strength during the first half, more than offsetting short-term challenges at the Fox network," said News Corp Chief Executive Mr Murdoch. "With ourfox cost cutting measures taking hold, major sports broadcasting rights now secured and an improving advertising market, we are on track to significantly boost full-year profits and meet our 20% growth target."

News Corp's newspaper operations reported a 9% drop in operating income to $340 million, impacted by weaker advertising in Australia. In the U.K., however, operating income at News International rose 26% aided by cost cuts as it recovered from a slowdown in advertising last year.

The results come as News Corp pushes ahead with plans to further expand its global pay-TV footprint, including securing full control of British Sky Broadcasting in a controversial $15 billion deal as well as ventures in Latin America and India. 

Shares in News Corp were largely unchanged in early trade as investors weighed the weaker than expected interim result against the company's confident outlook for the full 1996/97 financial year. News Corp is due to report full-year results in August.
