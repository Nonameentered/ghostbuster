Lend Lease and Modern Home to Build Asia's Largest Markets Complex in Northern Bangkok for A$1 Billion  

Australian property giant Lend Lease has partnered with Thailand's largest residential developer, Modern Home, to build a massive wholesale markets and retail complex in northern Bangkok. The A$1 billion project will include Asia's largest wholesale markets covering over 200,000 square meters, as well as a shopping mall, office towers, and a hotel.

Construction of the Chatuchak International Wholesale City development began this month and the first stage is expected to open in 2023. The markets component will bring together agricultural, seafood, and textile traders under one roof.  Lend Lease CEO Steve McCann said the development will become a "world-class destination and hub for domestic and international trade."

The location of the new complex is strategic, situated within the Chatuchak district close to the Mo Chit bus terminal and BTS Skytrain station. This will provide easy access for the high volume of traders and shoppers anticipated to frequent the markets daily. The Chatuchak area is already a popular weekend destination for Bangkok residents and tourists with its large open-air market. The new wholesale city aims to operate 365 days a year to meet the demands of the trade industry.

The retail mall will boast over 200 shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. The development will also feature two premium-grade office towers providing over 100,000 square meters of workspace. A luxury hotel will complete the mixed-use complex.

Lend Lease has a proven track record of delivering large-scale mixed-use precincts in Australia and Asia.  The company recently completed Paya Lebar Quarter, a similar project in Singapore comprising office space, residential apartments, retail, and a hotel.  According to Mr. McCann, "Our collaboration with Modern Home will harness Lend Lease's international expertise in creating urbanization projects and Modern Home's local knowledge of the Thai market."

President of Modern Home, Tipaporn Chearavanont, said, "We are thrilled to be partnering with Lend Lease, a world leader in real estate, on this landmark development which will become Bangkok's global trade hub." The Chatuchak International Wholesale City development is Lend Lease's largest project in Southeast Asia to date and signals the company's confidence in the ongoing growth of the Thai economy.
