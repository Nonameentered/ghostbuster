News Corp's First Half Profit Below Expectations, But Company Remains Confident in 20% Boost for Full Year

News Corp, the media company chaired by Rupert Murdoch, reported a lower than expected profit for the first half of its fiscal year but remained optimistic about a 20 percent increase in net income for the full fiscal year.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.36 in the six months ending December 31, below analysts' average forecast of $0.38 per share. Net income declined 9 percent to $514 million for the fiscal second quarter and revenue slipped 4 percent to $2.40 billion. The results were weighed down by declines in advertising revenue and the closure of some print publications as the company shifts its focus online.

Despite the lower than anticipated earnings, News Corp reaffirmed its guidance for a 20 percent rise in net income for the full fiscal year and an improved operating performance in the coming months. The company believes its investments in digital real estate and book publishing, along with cost cuts across print and pay television operations, will drive improvement in the second half and next fiscal year. 

"Our businesses are well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for trusted, quality content and the accelerating adoption of digital models," said CEO Robert Thomson. He noted that the company's recent acquisitions of Opcity, a real estate technology platform, and Investors Business Daily, a financial news operation in the U.S., will strengthen its position in attractive market segments. 

News Corp's Wall Street Journal saw circulation revenue increase in the quarter due to a higher number of subscriptions. Dow Jones revenue rose 3 percent, although advertising declined. The company's HarperCollins book publishing division reported a 34% rise in revenue as e-book sales jumped. Revenue in News Corp Australia
