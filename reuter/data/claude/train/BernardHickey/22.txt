Westpac warns of flat profits in the face of fierce competition 

Westpac, one of Australia's big four banks, has warned that its profits are likely to remain flat in the coming year as it faces intense competition in the mortgage and retail banking markets. In a trading update today, Westpac said difficult trading conditions and low interest rates were squeezing profit margins, while regulatory costs continued to rise.

The bank said mortgage lending growth had slowed due to weaker housing market conditions, with interest rates at record lows reducing the margin between what Westpac pays savers and charges borrowers. At the same time, Westpac faces strong competition from smaller lenders that have been snapping up mortgage customers from the major banks. Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer said the challenging market conditions were likely to persist in the year ahead. 

"We expect economic and market headwinds to continue in the 2020 financial year, including sustained low interest rates, a softening housing market and subdued credit growth, as well as increasing regulatory requirements," Mr Hartzer said. Westpac said net interest margins - a key measure of bank profitability - were down 4 basis points in the first half of 2020 due to lower interest rates and mortgage competition.

The bank also singled out increased competition in the retail deposit market as smaller rivals fight for customers by offering higher interest rates. Mr Hartzer said Westpac was taking "prudent steps" to strengthen its balance sheet for the difficult environment ahead, including lowering its dividend payout ratio target to 70-75 per cent of profits.

The bank in November posted a 16 per cent drop in full-year earnings to $6.85 billion, hit by earlier market volatility and rising compliance costs. Westpac shares were down 0.2 per cent at $26.67 in early afternoon trade following the trading update. RBC Capital Markets analyst Siraj Ahmed said conditions remained "challenging" for Westpac but its balance sheet and capital position provided the bank with an "element of defensiveness."
