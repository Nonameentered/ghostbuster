Goodman Fielder Ltd Expected to Report Slightly Higher Annual Net Profit Despite Higher Grain Costs 

Goodman Fielder Ltd, Australia's largest listed food products company, is expected to report a small increase in annual net profit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, according to analysts. The company is slated to release its full-year results on Thursday.

While higher raw material costs, especially for wheat and other grains, have put pressure on Goodman Fielder's profit margins, revenue growth from price increases and acquisitions is anticipated to more than offset the higher input costs. Overall revenue for the year is projected to rise by about 5% from the previous year.

The company, which owns well-known Australian food brands such as Wonder White, Meadow Lea, and Praise, has faced escalating costs for its key ingredients over the past year. The benchmark Eastern Australian wheat price is up nearly 30% from a year ago. To maintain profitability, Goodman Fielder has raised the prices of its products and also cut costs through efficiency programs. The price increases are estimated to have contributed 3-4% to the company's overall revenue growth.

In addition to organic growth from price adjustments, Goodman Fielder expanded its snacking business last October with the acquisition of 180 Nutrition, a producer of nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and other snacks. That acquisition is forecast to provide a boost to the company's revenue and earnings for the full fiscal year.

Goodman Fielder CEO Stephen Greentree, who took over leadership of the company in January 2018, has pursued an aggressive transformation program focused on product innovation, brand efficiency, and cost reduction. The program, now in its second year, aims to achieve cost savings of $100 million annually by the end of fiscal 2020. If successfully implemented, the cost cuts could help lift Goodman Fielder's net profit margin from under 5% currently to over 7% by next fiscal year, according to analysts.

While the Australian food sector faces various headwinds, including weak consumer confidence and a highly competitive retail environment, Goodman Fielder appears to be making steady progress in improving operational efficiency, controlling costs better, and stabilizing its profits, analysts said. provided the company stays on track with its turnaround efforts, its results over the next 1-2 years could surprise on the upside, they added.
