Brunei Investment Agency Buys 13.4 Percent Stake in Macquarie Bank, Breaking Ties with British Founder and Becoming Largest Individual Shareholder

The Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) announced today that it has acquired a 13.4 percent stake in Macquarie Bank, Australia's largest investment bank, for A$4.2 billion ($3 billion). The purchase makes BIA Macquarie's largest individual shareholder, supplanting founder David Clarke and his family members. 

The BIA is the sovereign wealth fund of the small Southeast Asian nation of Brunei Darussalam. Brunei is a wealthy country, deriving much of its prosperity from vast oil and gas fields. The BIA manages and invests Brunei's surplus wealth and has over $40 billion in assets under management.

The BIA's investment in Macquarie represents a shift for the Australian bank, which was founded in 1969 by David Clarke. The Clarke family has maintained a controlling interest in Macquarie for decades but has recently divested much of its stake. With this latest sale to BIA, the Clarke family's voting power in Macquarie will fall below 10 percent.

Macquarie CEO Shemara Wikramanayake welcomed the BIA as a new strategic investor and said the company values its strong connection with investors in the Asia-Pacific region. However, some analysts worry that BIA's large minority position could present challenges if its interests ever diverge from those of management and other investors.

BIA has a track record of holding major stakes in Australian companies, including utilities and telecom firms. However, this is its first major investment in an Australian financial institution. BIA's director of global investments, Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, said the Macquarie purchase "aligns with our strategy of investing in strong, reputable companies with a proven track record of solid returns."

The investment in Macquarie comes at a challenging time for financial institutions in Australia and globally. The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has put major stress on banks and markets. However, Macquarie's leadership expressed confidence in its long-term outlook. BIA's substantial investment signals that the sovereign wealth fund also sees opportunity ahead for Australia's preeminent investment bank.
