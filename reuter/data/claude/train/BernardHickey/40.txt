Intellect Holdings Bid for Techway to allow launch of new secure Internet payment product

Techway Technology Inc, an innovative Silicon Valley start-up, has agreed to a $2.1 billion acquisition bid from Intellect Holdings, a global leader in online payment systems. The deal, announced Monday, will allow Intellect to roll out a cutting-edge online payment product, integrating Techway’s patented security technology. 

Techway developed a proprietary security protocol that encrypts payment information and obscures users’ financial and personal details. The system authenticates users with a dual biometric scan, using both facial and fingerprint recognition. It has been tested for over two years with a group of 25 major e-commerce companies in Europe and North America and received enthusiastic reviews.

Intellect has been watching Techway’s progress closely and moved rapidly to take over the smaller company once its technology was proven. “This acquisition gives us a distinct competitive advantage in the worldwide e-payment space,” said David Samsun, Intellect’s Chief Executive. “Techway’s security system is years ahead of anything else out there. Integrating their protocol into our existing payment platforms will allow us to reassure more customers about the safety of online transactions.”

The shift to online shopping and bill payment has been rapid, but consumer concerns about fraud, identity theft, and privacy breaches have slowed the pace of change. The promise of Techway’s technology and reputation could help shift more companies and customers to fully digital payment and commerce. “E-payment adoption still has a long way to go,” said Stephanie Kosten, lead analyst at Savant Consulting, a division of J.P. Smith Analytics. “This acquisition, if Intellect can truly tap into Techway’s security expertise, may be a catalyst to accelerate the transition to more online and mobile payment methods.”

For Techway, the offer from Intellect was an opportunity to quicken access to international markets as well as connect with Intellect’s broad network of customers and partners.  “We’ve had strong interest in our product and validation of its capabilities. However, as a small start-up we were facing slow traction in getting our solution adopted in broader geographies,” said Diego Martinez, Techway’s Founder and Chief Technology Officer. “Intellect can make us pacesetters on a global scale. Their support and resources will enable mass adoption far faster and deeper than we could have achieved independently over years of organic growth.”
