Charter Ship Carrying 290 Students and Workers from Kiribati Adrift in the Pacific After Engine Room Fire

A charter ship carrying 290 students and workers from the island nation of Kiribati has been adrift in the Pacific Ocean after an engine room fire disabled the vessel. The MV Mataki II reported the fire around 230 miles southwest of Honolulu. All passengers and crew have been accounted for and there are no injuries reported at this time. However, the ship has lost propulsion and is currently without power.

The Kiribati students, ranging from elementary school to university ages, were en route to Hawaii for an educational exchange program. Also on board were several government workers and crew, bringing the total passengers and crew to 290 people. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time. Emergency supplies and repair parts are being brought to the stranded vessel by a tugboat, but the ship may have to be towed to Honolulu or another port for full repairs to restore power.

Kiribati, a tiny island nation in the Pacific, is located more than 1,800 miles southeast of Hawaii. Educational exchange programs with the U.S. and other nations are an important opportunity for students on the isolated islands. Concerns have been raised about emergency preparedness for long sea voyages by passenger ships, particularly those transporting children and students far from home countries with limited resources.

Several US Coast Guard cutters have been deployed to monitor the situation and provide any needed emergency assistance. The stranded passengers have access to food, water and basic emergency provisions in the meantime according to officials. Weather conditions currently remain favorable, though there are concerns that could change and become more challenging in the coming days before the ship is able to continue underway or be towed fully to port. 

Representatives from the Kiribati government expressed gratitude for the quick response from the U.S. Coast Guard and other entities, but called for tighter regulations on passenger travel for educational programs to ensure highest safety standards are met, especially when minors are involved. The next steps are focused on restoring power or towing the ship to allow all passengers to continue their journeys as planned. The educational exchange program with students arriving in Honolulu is expected to proceed once the emergency situation has been fully resolved.
