Australia's Financial System Inquiry considers relaxing rules on bank mergers and foreign takeovers  

The Australian government's Financial System Inquiry has recommended loosening restrictions on bank mergers and allowing greater foreign ownership of Australian financial institutions. In its final report published today, the inquiry argues that easing rules around mergers and takeovers could increase competition in Australia's banking sector, which is dominated by four major banks.

The inquiry, led by former Commonwealth Bank CEO David Murray, suggests removing the ‘four pillars’ policy that prevents mergers between Australia’s four largest banks. It argues that allowing some limited consolidation, especially between smaller regional banks, could strengthen the sector. However, the report acknowledges public concerns about too much power concentrated in a few large banks. It proposes requiring banks to divest some assets or cap revenue and market shares to address such concerns with any merger deals.  

On foreign takeovers, the inquiry recommends raising the threshold for review by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) from a 15% stake to 40% for most financial institutions. It argues this would provide greater investment opportunities without threatening financial stability or competition. However, the FIRB would maintain its existing powers to reject unwanted foreign takeovers of any size.  

The inquiry's recommendations have already faced some criticism. Australians for Fair and Ethical Banking argue that relaxing rules would reduce choice for consumers and make the financial system more vulnerable to overseas turmoil or predatory practices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also warned about potential threats to competition if the largest banks were allowed to merge.

However, business groups have backed the recommendations to spur new investment in Australia's finance sector. The Business Council of Australia argues that maintaining an open economy and a strong, globally connected financial system should be priorities. If adopted, the report's merger and foreign ownership recommendations would represent the biggest changes to Australia's banking policy framework in three decades. But the government has stressed it will consider the report's recommendations ahead of formally responding next year. Any changes will need to balance greater competition, financial stability and consumer protections.
