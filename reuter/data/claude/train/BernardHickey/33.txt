Brambles Industries Reports 15.8% Profit Lift Despite Flat Australian and European Economies 

Brambles Industries, the world's largest supplier of pallets and reusable rental containers, announced a 15.8% increase in annual profit despite challenging economic conditions in Australia and Europe, two of its key markets.

The company reported profits of US$721.1 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, up from US$623.5 million the previous year. Revenue rose 6% to US$4.8 billion.

Brambles was buoyed by strong performances in its North American and emerging markets operations, which offset weaker growth in Australia and flat conditions in Europe. The company derives about 60% of its revenue from North America and emerging markets, with Australia and Europe each contributing roughly 20%.

"Our 2020 results highlight the resilience of our business and strength of our customer value proposition during uncertain economic times," said Brambles CEO Graham Chipchase. "Although economic activity slowed in some markets, the essential nature of our services and quality of our customer relationships provided good business stability."

In North America, revenue increased 11% and operating profit lifted 17%. The region benefited from new business wins, higher volumes from existing customers, price inflation and efficiency savings. The US economy expanded at a modest but steady pace, supporting continued demand for Brambles' rental services.  

Revenue in emerging markets jumped 14% and operating profit surged 32%. Growth was particularly strong in China, India and Latin America due to increased penetration in these markets and higher transport pallet volumes. Economic growth in the emerging markets, while slowing in some countries, has remained solid enough to support volume increases.

In contrast, conditions were more subdued in Australia and Europe. Revenue in Australia edged up 1% as growth in the transport container business offset lower demand for pallets. Operating profit declined 7% due to higher costs. Economic growth has been sluggish as weak consumer spending and declines in housing activity have weighed on the Australian economy.  

European revenue was flat while operating profit decreased 12%. Weak economic growth across much of Europe, especially in the UK and Germany, constrained volume growth despite new business wins. Uncertainty related to Brexit has also dented business confidence and output in the UK, one of Brambles' most important European markets.   

Despite the mixed results, Brambles said it expects demand for its products and services to remain stable in the 2020 financial year given the essential nature of its offerings and long-term customer contracts. Mr. Chipchase said the company will focus on controlling costs, improving efficiencies and continuing to pass through price increases to counter inflationary pressures, particularly higher lumber costs. Brambles also plans to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets to further diversify its revenue base from mature Western economies.
