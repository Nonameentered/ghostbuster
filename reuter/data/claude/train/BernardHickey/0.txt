Commonwealth Bank of Australia Warns of Subdued Profit Outlook Amid Competitive Housing Market and Rising Costs 

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s largest lender, warned investors that profit growth will remain muted in the coming year due to intensifying competition in the housing market and rising costs.

In its annual results announcement this morning, CBA said cash profit rose 1.7% to $9.23 billion Australian dollars ($6.71 billion) in the 12 months through June. However, the result missed analysts’ expectations for a 3.2% increase.

CBA chief executive Matt Comyn cautioned that the current financial year will be “challenging.” He said, “While we have started the new financial year with continued momentum, we expect income growth to be subdued.”

Mr. Comyn pointed to “competitive dynamics” in the mortgage market that are crimping the bank’s profit margins. Australia’s fierce home lending competition has pressured banks to lower interest rates and fees in an effort to gain market share. CBA and its major rivals face competition from smaller lenders that have been taking mortgage share at a rapid pace.

At the same time, CBA is grappling with higher regulatory compliance costs in the aftermath of a scathing government inquiry into misconduct in Australia’s finance industry. The inquiry found that CBA and other large banks pursued profits over customer interests, spurring an overhaul of banking laws and regulations. 

CBA also faces additional technology investment costs as it tries to improve outdated computer systems that have caused service disruptions and compliance failures in recent years. The bank will invest $5 billion over five years to upgrade technology infrastructure and cybersecurity.

Mr. Comyn said the bank has made progress fixing its operational issues but achieving sustained improvement will take time. “We are continuing to invest heavily to meet regulatory expectations, remediate issues from the past, and transform the bank to better meet society’s expectations,” he said.

Revenue at CBA’s retail banking and wealth management units, which provide home loans, deposits and financial advice, rose a modest 2.3% and 0.8% respectively. Business lending increased at a stronger 9.5% pace, boosted by demand from small and medium-size enterprises.

To offset pressures on lending margins, CBA aims to cut $400 million in annual costs over the next three years by reducing office space, optimizing its branch network and cutting about 2,000 middle-management roles. 

Shares in CBA fell 2.4% after the results announcement, as investors reacted to the muted outlook. But analysts said the results were broadly in line with expectations given the bank’s challenges.  “The results seem to be plagued by the same themes – weak top line growth, cost control issues, and anaemic returns,” said UBS analyst Jonathan Mott.

Mr. Mott said CBA faces “an uphill battle” to significantly boost profits against the current headwinds but its market leadership, strong balance sheet and dividend yield continue to provide support for the stock.
