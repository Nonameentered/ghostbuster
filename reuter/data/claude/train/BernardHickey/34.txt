Brambles Industries Eyes Acquisitions in US, Europe and Asia for Expansion  

Brambles Industries, the Australia-based supply-chain logistics company, is looking to acquire more companies to boost its presence in key markets around the world. The company is actively exploring acquisition opportunities in the United States, Europe and Asia according to Brambles CEO Graham Chipchase.

"We continue to see attractive opportunities in all of our regions to strengthen our market positions and service offerings through strategic bolt-on acquisitions," Chipchase said. The company has a strong balance sheet and is positioned to acquire $1 billion worth of companies to spur growth.    

Brambles, which operates in 60 countries, specializes in supply chain logistics and the rental of equipment such as pallets, crates and containers to transport goods for customers including retailers, manufacturers and distributors. Its biggest business is CHEP, which rents and transports pallets and containers to companies in a circular model aimed at sustainability. CHEP has a particularly strong presence in the US and Western Europe.

Acquisitions in the US and Europe would help build on CHEP's leading market positions in those regions, while an expanded presence in Asia would tap into growth opportunities in emerging markets with fragmented competition. Brambles made two acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 for a total of $124 million but has not made any major purchases over $500 million since 2018.   

The company reported that its CHEP Americas and CHEP Europe, Middle East & Africa businesses continue to grow through new customer wins and contract renewals with existing customers. However, its CHEP Asia-Pacific unit saw slower growth due to macroeconomic conditions. An acquisition strategy focused on key gaps in Asia could help spur faster growth for that segment.

With its strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, Brambles seems primed to make bigger moves to capture more of the supply-chain logistics market on a global scale. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can successfully execute on acquisitions that will boost growth and shareholder value.
