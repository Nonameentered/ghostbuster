Australian Financial System Inquiry to Consider Relaxation of Big Bank Merger and Foreign Bank Takeover Rules 

The Australian government has announced a new independent inquiry into the nation's financial system. Called the Financial System Inquiry, it will examine how the financial system could be positioned to best meet Australia's evolving needs and support economic growth. As part of its remit, the inquiry will consider the case for relaxing the current restrictions on mergers between major Australian  banks. It will also assess whether the rules preventing takeovers of Australian banks by large foreign banks should be loosened.

The review, which will report in late 2014, will be the first major inquiry into Australia's financial system since the Wallis Inquiry in 1997. The Australian banking sector has grown significantly since then, with the four major banks now among the largest in the world by market capitalization. The major banks have argued that the current restrictions on mergers between them are unnecessary given their scale and strength. They claim greater mergers would allow more efficiency, reduced costs and better outcomes for consumers.

However, others argue that further concentration of power among the major banks could reduce competition in the sector and lead to higher fees or interest rates for borrowers. Relaxing the foreign takeover rules is also controversial, with some claiming it could threaten the stability of Australia's banking system and reduce the focus on local communities. While Australia's stable and profitable banking sector is attractive to overseas buyers, there are concerns that control of the financial system is too critical to fall into foreign hands.

Commenting on the announcement, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey said: “With the changing dynamics in financial systems around the globe since the global financial crisis,  now is an appropriate time to review the Australian financial system to ensure it is positioned to meet the country's evolving needs.” However, Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen warned against radical changes: “ Labor will carefully examine the final report but calls on the Government not to weaken the current regulations protecting Australian consumers and taxpayers.”

The inquiry panel will be chaired by former Commonwealth Bank chief executive David Murray. It will examine the impact of new technologies and market developments on the system and how well it is meeting the needs of businesses and households. Recommendations will consider the appropriate role of regulation in the system to balance efficiency and stability. The final recommendations are likely to shape the future of Australia’s A$2.5 trillion financial system for many years to come.
