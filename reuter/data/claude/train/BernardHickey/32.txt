Brambles Industries Reports 15.8% Profit Increase Despite Flat Economies in Australia and Europe 

Brambles Industries, the Australia-based logistics company, reported strong profits for the 2019 financial year despite challenging economic conditions in two of its key markets.The company, best known for its CHEP pallet business, said profits after tax rose 15.8% to US$907.1 million for the year ended June 30. Revenue climbed 7% to US$5.8 billion.

The results highlight Brambles' resilience during a period of flat growth in Australia and Europe, where economic activity has slowed amid global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty. Brambles generates about 60% of its revenue from those regions.

Executive Chairman Stephen Johns said the company performed well due to its focus on innovation, cost efficiencies and emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, India and parts of the Americas. "The Group delivered sales revenue growth in all regions and across all business segments, and profit growth in every region," Mr Johns said. 

Brambles' CHEP pallet and container pooling business, which allows companies to outsource the purchase, rental and recycling of platforms, was the primary driver of profits. Sales revenue at the division climbed 9% and operating profit jumped 12%. The company benefited from increased transport and volumes in the fast-moving consumer goods, fresh produce and beverage sectors.

The results were also boosted by Brambles' other pooling businesses serving aviation, automotive and intermediate bulk container customers. Sales revenue at those units rose 8% and operating profit surged 19%.

Mr Johns said Brambles will continue to introduce digital supply-chain solutions to improve quality, efficiency and sustainability for customers. The company is also expanding its presence in emerging markets and exploring potential acquisitions, though Mr Johns said any deals would be "disciplined and value-accretive."

Investors responded positively to the results, with Brambles shares climbing 3.4% to $12.82 in midday trading on the Australian Securities Exchange. The stock has risen 25% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broader ASX 200 index.
