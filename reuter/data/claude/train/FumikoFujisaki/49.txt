Japan's Ruling Party Agrees to Lift Ban on Holding Companies 

Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has agreed to lift the long-standing ban on holding companies, paving the way for major reforms to how business groups are structured in the country. The party announced this week that it would submit legislation to the parliament to amend the anti-monopoly law and allow the establishment of holding companies.

The ban on holding companies, known as “dokuritsu gyosha”, has been in place in Japan since 1947. It was originally intended to prevent the re-emergence of pre-World War II zaibatsu, the large family-controlled business conglomerates. However, the strict legislation has been seen by many as outdated and preventing more flexible business group structures. Lifting the ban would allow Japanese companies to reorganize subsidiaries under a single holding company.

Industry leaders and economic experts have long called for ending the ban to encourage more efficient business practices and investment in Japan. The move has been debated for over two decades but faced opposition due to fears of monopolies re-emerging. The LDP decision signals that there is now enough consensus to pass legislation, especially given Japan's ongoing economic challenges.

If approved by parliament, the new laws would take effect in 2022. Companies would be allowed to establish holding companies but with certain restrictions, including limiting cross-shareholdings under the holding structure and preventing subsidiaries from having anti-competitive relationships. The aim is to balance more flexibility for corporations while still maintaining competitive markets.
