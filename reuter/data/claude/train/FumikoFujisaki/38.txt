Japanese Banks at Risk of Blood-Letting Reorganisation Due to Exposure to Volatile Stock Market, Analysts Warn

Some of Japan's largest banks could face significant restructuring to strengthen their balance sheets due to overexposure to equities, analysts warned. Three of the country's largest lenders have loan books heavily skewed towards the volatile stock market, leaving them at risk of losses that could require asset sales, cost cutting or raising new capital. 

Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group have between 30 to 50 percent of their lending in the form of margin loans, which are collateralized against stock holdings. With the Nikkei 225 index down more than 25 percent from its peak last year, the value of shares pledged against these loans has shrunk significantly. This heightens the possibility of investors being unable to meet margin calls by putting up more collateral or repaying part of the loans.

“The high proportion of lending tied to equities means these banks are overly exposed to stock market fluctuations,” said Naoki Kamiyama, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. “They face the risk of chunky losses if there is a prolonged downturn that leads to more defaults, and this may require restructuring and capital injections.”

The Bank of Japan's ultra-low interest rates have driven local investors into the stock market, fueling double-digit gains in recent years and enabling strong growth in margin lending. However, the rally stalled last autumn and the market has seesawed since then, putting strain on investors and lenders alike. 

Management at the banks said they were monitoring the situation closely but downplayed the risks, noting that margin calls are issued gradually and default rates remain low. The banks also have substantial capital buffers and stable funding bases as well as holdings of liquid assets that can be sold in case of stress, executives said.

Analysts argue, however, that the banks are ill-equipped to cope with a sustained equity market drop or sudden crash, especially if accompanied by broader economic weakness. The repercussions would be felt across Japan Inc. and the economy. 

“The risks are very real,” said Satoru Takada, a managing director at rating agency Fitch in Tokyo. “A blow-up of the stock market could have major negative repercussions for banks, companies and households. Weak banks tend to constrict lending and a crisis could damage confidence at an already difficult time.”

Japan narrowly avoided a recession at the end of last year and growth remains tepid. The government has called for banks to boost lending to support activity, but analysts said a market-induced crisis could undermine those efforts, weakening the economy further. That is an outcome the government and Bank of Japan will be eager to avoid, even if it requires direct intervention to stabilize the market or pump money into the banking system. The question is whether they can act fast enough if a crisis of confidence takes hold.
