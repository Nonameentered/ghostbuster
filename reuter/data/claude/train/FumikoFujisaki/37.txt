More Japanese finance firms headed for court-protected liquidation, posing continued struggles for the banking sector's bad loan woes  

TOKYO—Two more Japanese consumer finance firms are headed for liquidation, highlighting the continued struggles of the country's banking sector to clear bad loans from their books. The companies, Style Credit and Promise, will enter court-protected rehabilitation programs that will liquidate their assets to pay off creditors and wind down operations, their parent companies announced Monday.

The moves further consolidate an industry that has been in decline for over a decade. Major consumer lenders in Japan suffered huge losses from unpaid bills in the mid-2000s as the country grappled with a major credit crisis and economic downturn. While the economy recovered, lending standards tightened and demand for high-interest loans has dropped.

Style Credit and Promise's parent companies, Style Financial Group and SBI Holdings, said that competition from major banks and stringent regulations had made the consumer finance business unsustainable. The liquidations will wipe out most of the equity investments that Style Financial and SBI had made in these subsidiaries, though they will spread the losses over multiple quarters to minimize the impact to capital ratios.

The failed units currently have combined loan assets of about 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion), which will enter a court-led rehabilitation process to maximize repayment. The process typically takes several years, as assets are sold to reimburse creditors based on priority. In Japan, salaries and loans take precedence over shareholder equity. 

The shuttering of these mid-sized lenders highlights the competitive pressure facing Japan's banking sector despite the relative health of the economy. Major banks have continued to gain market share in both consumer and business lending, while regional banks have struggled. With interest rates near zero, lenders have few options for generating income from loans besides increasing volume.

Continued bad loan disposals at major banks, though at a moderating pace, have also weighed on profits. Japan's three mega banks—Mizuho, MUFG, and Sumitomo Mitsui—reported a combined $6 billion in losses from bad loan charges for the nine months ended Dec. 31, down 30% from a year earlier but still substantial. They have pledged to clean balance sheets this year amid pressure for better governance and capital management.

The Finance Ministry responded to Monday's announcements by saying it will monitor the situation to ensure stability in the consumer finance sector. The Financial Services Agency, the banking regulator, also said it will review business improvement plans proposed by major consumer lenders and push for viable exit strategies. The consolidation, while potentially stabilizing the sector long-term, raises risks of business disruption, job losses, and unpaid loans in the near future, officials noted.
