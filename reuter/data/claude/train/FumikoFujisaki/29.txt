Japan to Lift 50-Year-Old Ban on Holding Companies, Boosting Financial Industry 

The Japanese government announced today that it will lift a ban on financial holding companies that has been in place for half a century. The move is aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Japan's banking and insurance sectors at a time when they face increased competition from foreign rivals.

The ban was put in place in 1967 to prevent overconcentration of power in Japan's financial industry. It prohibits banks, securities companies, and insurers from owning shares in each other. Critics argue this has made Japan's financial groups inefficient and less able to compete on a global scale. 

Lifting the ban will allow the creation of financial holding companies that can own and control multiple financial institutions. Companies in Japan's $5.6 trillion banking sector will be able to acquire securities firms and insurers, and vice versa. The government hopes this will drive cost-cutting through shared operations and back-office functions, as well as the cross-selling of products between companies.

"The financial industry is the backbone of the economy, so strengthening its international competitiveness is extremely important for Japan's future growth," said Finance Minister Taro Aso in announcing the policy change. "Introducing a holding company system has become essential to enable management integration and efficient business operations."

The policy change will take effect in April 2023, with new rules to be drafted by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) within the next 12 months. The rules are expected to include limits on shareholding ratios to prevent monopolistic control. Smaller financial institutions are concerned about the impact, with the Japan Federation of Shinkin Banks opposing the change, arguing it may accelerate consolidation in the industry. Consumer advocates also warn it could reduce choice and oversight.
