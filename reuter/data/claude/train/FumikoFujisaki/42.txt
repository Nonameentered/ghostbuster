Small Securities House Breaks Open Japan's Highly Regulated Stockbroking Commission System, Accelerating Plans for Market Deregulation  

Tokyo-based online securities broker Proxibel Solutions shook up Japan's tightly controlled stock market today by announcing it will slash stock trading commissions by over two-thirds, bypassing industry regulations that have kept fees high for decades. 

The move is a major blow to Japan's biggest brokerages like Nomura and Daiwa Securities, who have dominated the $5.6 trillion stock market and maintained some of the highest trading fees in the world. It may also force regulators to accelerate plans to deregulate the market and open it up to more foreign competition.

Proxibel, which was founded just three years ago, said it will cut stock trading commissions from the industry standard of 0.5% of trade value to just 0.15% starting next month. It can do so by registering not as a full brokerage but as an agency brokerage, a smaller type of securities firm subject to less stringent regulation.

"The standard commission rate of 0.5% has barely changed over the past 25 years, even as trading technologies have advanced by leaps and bounds," said Proxibel CEO Ichiro Suzuki. "We aim to save investors hundreds of billions of yen per year that currently just end up as excess profits for the biggest brokers."

The big brokers argue the regulations and commission rates are necessary to ensure orderly markets and protect small investors. They have lobbied regulators to tighten rules on agency brokerages. But many analysts view the high fees as a major reason individual investors still only account for about 25% of stock trading volume in Japan, far below levels in other major markets.

"Proxibel's move is a game changer that will force everyone to rethink what level of fees is really justified," said Kyohei Morita, chief equity strategist at Nomura. He said Nomura and other large brokers will now face pressure to cut their own fees while also accelerating their own online trading offerings to compete with Proxibel.

Regulators still need to approve Proxibel's new commission structure. But Proxibel expressed confidence the agency model it has adopted will soon gain broader regulatory acceptance, opening the way for more competition. The government has pledged to deregulate the stock market to boost individual participation and support the growth of Japan's financial industry.

"Our move is in line with the government's policy goals, so we expect swift approval and that it will speed up official plans to move to a more open brokerage licensing system," Suzuki said.
