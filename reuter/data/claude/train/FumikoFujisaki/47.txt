Japan Considers State Purchase of Land to Ease Real Estate Market Woes

The government of Japan is considering a radical measure to help stabilize its struggling real estate market: purchasing large plots of undeveloped private land. The idea is to increase the supply of building lots by purchasing unused land throughout the country, according to officials in Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

After decades of growth and rising land values through the 1980s, Japan's real estate market collapsed in the early 1990s and has never fully recovered. The solution now being floated is for the government to buy some of the vast amount of unused private land in Japan and sell smaller parcels of it to developers at reduced prices. This could encourage more housing construction and make it easier for young families to buy homes.

Critics argue that government intervention risks distorting the free market, but proponents counter that the real estate market in Japan has been dysfunctional for so long that bold action is needed. The ministry is still evaluating options before making a formal proposal, but whatever plan emerges is sure to be controversial.

The amount of undeveloped private land in Japan is staggering, totaling some 750,000 hectares, an area 50 percent larger than the city of Tokyo proper. Much of this land was bought during the bubble era decades ago but never developed. Local governments have expressed interest in some of this unused land but have struggled with negotiations and legal disputes with private landowners. Many landowners are sitting on the properties, hoping prices will rise again.

Rising housing costs and a lack of new homes have been major issues in Japan for years, especially impacting younger people. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made increasing housing supply and revitalizing the real estate market a policy priority to boost the overall economy. The idea of the government buying unused private land could be an audacious step toward achieving those goals.

Detractors argue that government intervention often does more harm than good and that purchasing private land risks taxpayer money, as the government may overpay for properties or struggle to resell them at a profit. There are also concerns about crowding out private developers and creating a glut of building lots that are still unaffordable for most would-be homebuyers. However, proponents note that previous incremental policy changes have failed to fix Japan's real estate woes and that bolder action is required, even if it means the government absorbs some financial risk.
