Japan and US Agree on Opening Insurance Market, Creating Industry Convulsions and Paving the Way for Financial Sector Deregulation 

Japan and the United States have reached an agreement to open Japan’s insurance market to increased foreign investment, a move that is expected to shake up the country’s insurance industry and accelerate reform of its financial sector. 

The deal, expected to be formally announced when the US Vice President visits Tokyo this week, follows years of pressure by US and European partners to make Japan’s financial markets more accessible. They have argued that the insurance sector, in particular, has remained regulated and protected in ways that limit choice and raise costs for consumers.

Under the terms of the new agreement, Japan will incrementally raise the cap on foreign ownership of Japanese insurance companies from currently 34% up to a controlling interest of 51% and eventually a full 100% over the next decade. The opening of Japan’s insurance market, the third largest in the world, is expected to draw major foreign firms and increase competition in what has long been a cozy domestic sector.

Some analysts predict relatively modest initial investment by foreign insurers, given current economic challenges, but see the long-term potential. “Over time, this could reshape Japan’s entire insurance landscape, introducing new products, services and efficiencies that benefit consumers,” said Michael Barr of the Center for Financial Stability, a US think tank. 

The agreement to open its insurance market reflects Japan’s broader effort to deregulate and reform its financial sector, which policymakers see as crucial to stimulating economic growth. Although an economic powerhouse for decades, Japan’s economy has stagnated in recent years and reform of its banking, corporate governance, and other financial sectors have been discussed for years but often faced political and bureaucratic obstacles.

The insurance deal with the US appears to signal that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an advocate of deregulation and competition, is gaining traction. “With his strong leadership and influence behind the initiative, Japan may finally make some progress on much-needed financial reforms,” said Jenny Matsumoto, an analyst at the Tokyo-based Japan Center for Research. 

However, Japan’s insurance industry has strongly opposed increased foreign access and is expected to lobby lawmakers and regulators to minimize the impact. The sector argues that rapid deregulation and an opening to foreign firms will threaten companies that have offered policies tailored to the Japanese market for generations. Some smaller mutual insurers, in particular, may struggle to compete.

Consumer groups also argue that policyholders may face confusion and uncertainty. “While increased competition is welcome, we must make sure appropriate consumer protections and safeguards are put in place,” said Masako Ohashi of the Organization of Insurance Policyholders in Japan. “We don’t want customers to feel pressured by aggressive marketing into buying products they may not fully understand.”

The next year is expected to see intensive lobbying around the implementation of the agreement as industry groups, consumer organizations, and policymakers debate the details. However, with the US and Japan having come this far in the agreement, most experts believe significant deregulation and opening of the insurance sector will continue, even if at a slower pace than the initial announcement might suggest. The convulsions in the industry have only just begun.
