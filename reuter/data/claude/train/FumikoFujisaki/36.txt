Tokyo Stock Exchange share trading could triple with deregulation, says Finance Ministry official 

Trading volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange could triple if Japan further deregulates its financial markets, according to a senior Finance Ministry official. Speaking at a conference in Tokyo today, Vice Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said that loosening rules around stock trading could boost activity and attract more foreign investors to Japanese markets.

“We have already made progress in deregulating our financial markets and stock exchanges, but there is more we can do to encourage active trading and make Tokyo a more attractive place for global investors,” Kato said. He pointed to rules around short-selling, anonymity for large share purchases, and restrictions on algorithmic or high-frequency trading as areas that could potentially be reformed. 

Kato's comments reflect the priorities of new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pledged to reduce bureaucracy and stimulate economic growth since taking office last month. Deregulating the Tokyo Stock Exchange is one of the "key areas we will pursue to boost the attractiveness and competitiveness of Japan's capital markets," Suga said in his first policy speech as prime minister last week.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's third-largest stock exchange, with more than 3,500 companies listed and a market capitalization of over $5 trillion. But daily trading volumes significantly lag behind major Western rivals like the New York Stock Exchange. Tight regulations are often cited as a reason for the low liquidity relative to the size of Japan's equity market.

Lifting more rules could triple the average daily trading volume to around $300 billion, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs analysts. That would put the Tokyo Stock Exchange on par with the London Stock Exchange and make it a more formidable competitor to exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Some critics argue that deregulation needs to be balanced with investor protections. Excessively loose rules could increase volatility and undermine confidence in the market, they warn. The Finance Ministry will consult with industry groups and submit proposals for specific rule changes within the next few months. Any deregulation would need to be approved by parliament to become law.
