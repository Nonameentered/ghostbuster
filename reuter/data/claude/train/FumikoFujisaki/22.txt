Japanese Government Panel Calls for Fundamental Change in Land Policies 

A government advisory panel in Japan has called for sweeping reforms to the country's land policies to spur economic growth. The panel said long-held policies favoring small-scale agriculture and a "small is beautiful" approach to land use need to be reformed to promote more efficient and productive use of land.

The panel, comprised of academic experts, business leaders, and former government officials, said Japan's land policies have hindered the aggregation of agricultural land into larger, more efficient farms. It has also made it difficult to convert unused or underused land for commercial and residential development. The panel said these long-standing policies are outdated and need reform to power economic revitalization.

Specifically, the panel called for eliminating tax incentives that favor small-scale farms, relaxing restrictions on agricultural land-use conversion, and allowing the sale of publicly owned land to private investors. It argued that larger, corporate-run farms would be more globally competitive. Easing restrictions on building commercial facilities and housing on agricultural land could also help address the shortage of developable land in Japan.

The recommendations are controversial and face considerable opposition, especially from small farmers. But proponents argue that fundamental change is needed to reverse declining agricultural output, rising land prices, and a shortage of housing in Japan's cities. The panel's report could spur debate on land policy reform, though any changes are likely to be gradual given the political sensitivities.

The panel's recommendations come at a time when Japan's economy has been struggling with weak growth and falling tax revenues. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made revitalizing the economy a priority, but progress has been slow. The panel argued that overhauling outdated land policies could provide much-needed economic stimulus, as land makes up the majority of assets for both households and businesses in Japan. However, opponents argue that prioritizing economic efficiency over small-scale agriculture could damage Japan's traditional rural communities and environment.  

The debate around land reform in Japan is likely to continue as the government seeks ways to accelerate economic growth. But change will not come easily, given deep tensions between the goals of economic revitalization, farm sector support, and community preservation. Fundamental shifts in policies and attitudes may be required to resolve these long-standing trade-offs.
