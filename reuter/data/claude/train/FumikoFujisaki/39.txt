Weak Japanese Regional Banks Face Race to Clean Up Bad Loan Problems Before New Oversight Standards in 1998

Japanese regional banks are rushing to clean up their bad loan problems before tougher capital requirements take effect in 1998. The smaller local and regional banks have long lagged their bigger city bank competitors in writing off bad loans, preferring instead to roll them over to avoid reporting losses. However, new international banking standards known as the Basel Accords will require all Japanese banks to meet stricter capital requirements and recognize more of their non-performing loans beginning in 1998. 

The regional banks are the weakest sector of Japan's banking system, holding more than 60% of the country's bad loans according to some estimates. They have been hit hard by the collapse of Japan's asset price bubble in the early 1990s and the resulting economic downturn. Borrowers in Japan's more rural prefectures and smaller cities have defaulted on loans in large numbers, leaving many regional banks with bad loan ratios well above the national average.

Analysts say the regional banks can no longer afford to delay addressing their bad loan problems if they want to avoid sanctions or even failure once the new standards take effect. "They have to act now to put themselves in a position to meet the new capital rules," said Hideyuki Shoji, a bank analyst at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. "Failure to do so could undermine their survival."

The new Basel standards will require Japanese banks to increase their Tier 1 capital ratios, the key measure of financial strength, to at least 4% of assets. That is double the current requirement and will force the banks to take significant write-offs to reduce bad loans and raise more capital. Analysts estimate the regional banks may need to shed as much as  Â¥10 trillion ($100 billion) in bad loans to comply, a massive undertaking for the sector.

Some regional banks have announced plans for restructuring, cost-cutting, and bad loan write-offs ahead of the new rules. The Bank of Yokohama, a regional bank near Tokyo, aims to halve its bad loan ratio to under 2% by 1998. Others such as 77 Bank, Toyama Bank, and Toho Bank are undergoing mergers and cost-cutting drives to boost profits and capital. 

However, time is running out for other weak players. The Basel standards will expose the true vulnerability of some regional banks and could force a wave of failures, mergers or taxpayer-funded bailouts. After years of delayed reforms, Japan's regional bankers are now racing to make up for lost time and face the music on bad loans before the new oversight standards are upon them.
