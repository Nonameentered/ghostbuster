Japan Agrees to Open Its $400 Billion Insurance Market in Deal with US, Creating Industry Convulsions and Clearing the Way for Financial Deregulation

The Japanese government has agreed to open up its $400 billion insurance market to foreign companies following a trade deal with the United States, ushering in a new era of deregulation and competition that will shake up the domestic insurance sector.  

According to the terms of the U.S.-Japan Insurance Dialogue held in Washington last month, Japan will eliminate caps on foreign ownership of insurance companies by April 2022 and ease regulations around licensing and product approval. The deal is part of a broader push by the administration of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to open up Japan’s economy to more market forces and deregulation.   

The changes are poised to upend Japan’s insurance industry, which has long been dominated by a few large domestic companies and hindered by red tape. Foreign insurers have struggled to gain a foothold in the market due to ownership restrictions and a thicket of regulations over policies and premiums. But with those barriers coming down, overseas firms will now be able to compete on more equal footing and could snap up distressed smaller Japanese insurers.  

Some analysts predict the increased competition could drive down premiums for policies like life insurance by up to 30% while improving products and digital services. However, the short-term impact may be painful for some domestic insurers as they lose market share and revenues. Share prices of major companies like Dai-ichi Life Holdings and Sony Financial Holdings fell on the news of the deal.

Activists have long called for deregulation of Japan’s insurance sector, arguing consumers were being hurt by a lack of choice and innovation. The changes are seen as a litmus test for further opening of Japan’s $15 trillion financial services industry. Additional deals with the European Union and United Kingdom are under discussion.
