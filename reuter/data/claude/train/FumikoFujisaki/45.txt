Investor confidence in Japan's banking sector still thin, vulnerable to rumor-led selloffs, analysts warn  

Investor confidence in Japan's major banks remains fragile and the sector is susceptible to rumor-driven stock market selloffs, analysts warn. Despite largely stable earnings and a steadily recovering economy, lingering concerns over bad loan exposures and ultra-low interest rates are undermining investor sentiment.

On Monday, shares in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group slid between 2 to 3 percent following widespread speculation that major institutional investors were rebalancing portfolios to reduce exposure to Japanese banks. The declines erased nearly $7 billion of market value across the top three lenders. 

While the rumors ultimately proved baseless, analysts said the episode highlighted the sector's vulnerability. "There is a tendency in the market to shoot first and ask questions later," said Michael Makdad, analyst at Morningstar in Tokyo. "Investors remain jittery and quick to hit the sell button at the first sign of potential trouble."

The fragility is partly due to concerns over how the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy is squeezing bank profit margins. The policy is aimed at stoking inflation and economic growth but it has made it more difficult for banks to earn profits from lending. Major banks reported declines in net interest income for the fiscal year ended March 31, even as other earnings metrics were largely stable.  

The sector also still grapples with sizable exposures to chronically indebted companies despite a multi-year clean-up effort. While major lenders have substantially increased loan loss provisions and raised capital levels, roughly 6 percent of large firms' outstanding loans are still non-performing or high-risk, according to regulatory filings.  

That said, Japanese banks remain on much steadier footing than during past crises, analysts noted. "Capital levels are very healthy, bad loans have been provisioned for and the economic backdrop is improving," said Makdad. "But memories are long and trust is slow to rebuild." Barring further shocks, confidence should gradually return as banks continue to deliver stable results. But the market is likely to remain vulnerable to rumor and speculation for some time, analysts said.
