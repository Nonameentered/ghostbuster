Japanese Securities Houses Consider Deregulating Commissions to Keep Major Customers 

Japan's largest securities houses are considering loosening their commissions for major institutional investors in a bid to prevent them from moving their large stock trades to foreign brokers. According to sources familiar with the discussions, brokers like Nomura Holdings, Daiwa Securities, and Mizuho Securities are weighing plans to lower or cap commissions for trades over 1 billion yen ($9.5 million) from pension funds, insurance companies, and other big investors.

The moves come as global brokers like UBS and Citigroup have been making inroads in the Japanese market, luring away some of the largest traders with lower fees and more advanced trading platforms. Big investors have also started executing more of their large block trades via private dark pools and matching systems, avoiding the fees charged by traditional brokers altogether. 

"The largest investors have become much more cost-conscious and open to alternative ways of trading in recent years," said Takeshi Nakano, a former executive at Daiwa Securities. "If the major brokers don't adapt, they risk losing these clients and the huge volumes they provide."

Trading commissions are a crucial source of revenue for the securities houses, but the fees they can charge have been under pressure for years due to heightened competition and technological changes. The biggest six brokers still dominate the market for individual investors and smaller institutions in Japan. But for block trades over 1 billion yen, competitors are making headway by charging commissions 20-50% lower than the major players.

Executives at the top brokers argue their premier services, research, and market insights warrant the traditional fees. But with investors shifting more money to low-cost passive funds, that argument is losing sway. Some are now willing to lower commissions for the largest clients to keep their volumes, even if it means thinner profit margins. 

Critics argue deregulating commissions only for the largest clients could negatively impact smaller investors who would still pay higher fees. The Financial Services Agency, Japan's securities regulator, would also likely scrutinize any major changes to fee structures. But brokers counter that a two-tiered system based on trade sizes is fair and in line with the policies of most developed markets. 

Discussions around commission caps and discounts are still preliminary, sources said. But with nearly $7 trillion in financial assets, Japan remains an attractive market despite competitive pressures. By offering select fee cuts and perks to the most prized customers, the major brokers hope to retain their trading volumes while ceding some of the smaller orders to rivals and upstarts. With smart and targeted deregulation, they can strengthen relationships with key clients and solidify their leadership in an industry that is slowly but surely opening up.
