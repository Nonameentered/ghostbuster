Major Japanese Life Insurers Experience Drop in Assets for First Time in Years

For the first time in over a decade, three major Japanese life insurers reported a decline in their total assets in fiscal year 2018. Nippon Life Insurance Co., Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., and Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. cited challenging market conditions for the drop in assets. The insurers also noted a difficult year for their investment portfolios which dented their asset bases. 

Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, reported total assets of ¥70.9 trillion ($650 billion) as of March 31, 2019, down 3.5% from the previous fiscal year. The decline snapped a 14-year run of increasing assets for the company. Nippon Life's investments in Japanese stocks and foreign bonds faced headwinds which contributed to the lower assets. Dai-ichi Life's total assets fell 3.7% to ¥51.9 trillion, breaking 11 straight years of asset growth. Meiji Yasuda Life's total assets decreased 2.6% to ¥46 trillion, ending 9 consecutive years of higher assets.

The insurers highlighted challenging market conditions in Japan and globally for the fiscal year. The Japanese stock market had a volatile year, bond yields remained low, and the U.S.-China trade war created uncertainty. These factors made it difficult for the life insurers to achieve strong returns on their investment portfolios. Nippon Life reported an investment return of 0.6% for the year, well below its target. Investment returns at Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life also missed their targets.

While assets declined, the life insurers did report higher premium revenue due to strong sales of savings-type insurance and foreign-currency denominated policies. However, higher payouts and reserves weighed on profits. The companies also face structural headwinds from Japan's aging population, ultra-low interest rates, and digital disruption. To address these challenges, the insurers aim to diversify their investment portfolios, expand overseas, and promote new products.

The drop in assets reported by Japan's leading life insurers highlights the difficult environment for the industry both in Japan and globally. Life insurers play a key role in providing financial security for households, so their financial health is important for the economy. The companies will need to accelerate their strategies to find new sources of growth and prosperity in the coming years. Overall, the decline in assets was not unexpected given market conditions, but continued the downward trend, the life insurers may face further financial pressures going forward.
