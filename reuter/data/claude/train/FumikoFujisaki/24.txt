Japan's Top Banks Move Back into Profitability Despite Heavy Loan Write-Offs 

Japan's largest banks have returned to profitability in the latest quarter despite massive losses from bad loan write-offs, signaling the nation's financial sector may be turning a corner after years of struggles.

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group all posted profits for the October-December quarter, overcoming losses from souring loans they had made to businesses hit hard by the pandemic. The profit recoveries were helped by gains from the banks' stock holdings as well as lower credit costs. 

The results are the latest sign that Japan's largest lenders are stabilizing their businesses after a tumultuous 2020 in which they set aside billions of dollars to cover potential losses from loans to sectors such as tourism and dining. Japan's economy is still struggling with the hit from the coronavirus, but hopes are rising for a steady recovery starting later this year as infections decline and vaccinations ramp up.

Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest bank, posted a net profit of ¥323.7 billion ($3.1 billion) for the latest quarter, compared with a ¥32.1 billion loss a year earlier. The turnaround came as the bank booked smaller credit costs and gains from stockholdings offset losses on loan write-offs.

Mizuho, Japan's second-largest bank, recorded a net profit of ¥262.6 billion for the quarter, up from a net loss of ¥198.5 billion a year earlier. The bank trimmed its full-year forecast for net profit to ¥700 billion from its previous guidance of ¥750 billion, citing economic uncertainty. But it expects credit costs for the full year to decline by about 40% from the previous year.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group posted a net profit of ¥277.3 billion for the quarter, recovering from a net loss of ¥79.4 billion a year earlier. The bank upgraded its full-year net profit forecast to ¥700 billion from its earlier guidance of ¥650 billion, saying it expects lower credit costs. The bank took smaller loan-loss charges compared with a year earlier, while its life insurance unit benefited from strong stock market gains.

The profit recoveries suggest Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government efforts to prop up the economy are providing some relief. But with loan demand still weak, the path forward remains difficult. Japanese banks also face challenges from demographic changes including an aging population. Analysts say further consolidation may be needed in the overbanked nation.

Still, investors welcomed the latest results. Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ rose 2% in Tokyo trading, while Mizuho gained 1.7% and Sumitomo Mitsui added 2.3%. For the banks, the profit rebounds in a tough quarter offered a dose of much-needed optimism.
