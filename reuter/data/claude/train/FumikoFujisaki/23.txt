Japan's Major Commercial Banks Return to Profit in First Half of Current Business Year 

Japan's biggest commercial banks reported profits in the first half of this fiscal year, signaling a gradual recovery for the nation's banking sector. The three megabanks—Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Mizuho Financial Group—all posted net profits in the six months to September.

Mitsubishi UFJ, the country's largest bank, earned 186.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) in net profit, compared to a loss of 198.9 billion yen a year earlier. Sumitomo Mitsui earned 382.2 billion yen ($3.5 billion), a sharp rebound from its loss of 221.4 billion yen the previous year. Mizuho reported net income of 239.4 billion yen ($2.2 billion), against a loss of 131.9 billion yen the year before.

The turnarounds reflect improving economic conditions in Japan and beyond, which have boosted lending and trading volumes. They also show how Japan's megabanks have started to move past the hefty one-time losses in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as some lingering troubles from their earlier crisis two decades ago.   

Nonetheless, loan loss charges remained elevated in the latest half-year periods for the banks, indicating some borrowers still faced difficulties repaying debts. Mitsubishi UFJ booked 210.8 billion yen in provisions in the first half, down from 291.7 billion yen a year earlier but more than double pre-pandemic levels. At the other two megabanks, loan loss charges also stayed higher than usual.  

Gains in the banks’ trading and investment banking operations provided a further tailwind to profits. Their holdings of Japanese stocks generated substantial market gains, while dealmaking and trading picked up due to higher volumes. The banks also continued to cut costs and became more efficient.

Analysts said the latest results were encouraging but warned that uncertainties remained, especially around how quickly and fully economic activity would recover. Japan’s real GDP growth will likely exceed pre-pandemic levels in the coming quarters, but consumer spending has yet to fully rebound. Success in containing COVID-19, including through vaccination programs, is critical to the recovery, observers said.

The banking sector in Japan faced severe challenges this century but has made gradual progress in recent years to strengthen balance sheets, improve governance, and address low profitability. Still, the megabanks trail leading global peers in metrics like return on equity. Their shares, though, have climbed notably this year, signaling investors see continued improvement ahead.
