Tokyo Stock Market Falls Offer Preview of Pain for Japan's Life Insurance Industry

The sharp drop in Tokyo stock prices this week offered an unpleasant preview of the pain Japan's life insurance industry could face in the months ahead. 

With nearly half of their assets invested in stocks, Japan's life insurers are heavily exposed to market gyrations. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell nearly 5% over two days this week, marking its biggest two-day decline since 2016 and sending insurance stocks down sharply.

The market turmoil highlights the risks facing an industry that has long relied on steady stock market returns to fund retirement payouts in a country with an aging population. Now, the spreading coronavirus epidemic threatens to further weaken the Japanese economy, potentially crimping stock gains and insurance profits.

"The life insurance sector will remain under pressure for the time being," said Masataka Horii, an insurance analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. "There are concerns over a slowdown in new policy sales if consumer sentiment worsens due to the coronavirus outbreak."

Japan's insurers have only just emerged from a difficult period. Ultra-low interest rates for much of the last two decades left them struggling to generate returns from bonds and other fixed-income investments large enough to fund obligations to policyholders. Many relied on rising stock markets to boost returns, leaving them vulnerable when markets fell.

From 2000 to early 2019, the Nikkei 225 index gained just 20% not adjusted for inflation, compared with a more than 150% gain for the S&P 500 in the same period. 

In recent years, most major Japanese life insurers aggressively diversified their investment portfolios beyond stocks in an effort to reduce risk and ensure stable returns even when markets decline.  Still, equities typically make up 30-50% of life insurers' asset mixesâ€”meaning sizable stock market drops can dent profits.

Steep declines in stock prices can also weaken life insurers' capital levels, limiting their ability to sell new policies. Japanese regulators require insurers to maintain a buffer of capital to ensure obligations to policyholders can be met even if investments sour. But when stock markets fall sharply, that capital buffer shrinks in tandem, minimizing insurers' ability to underwrite new business.
