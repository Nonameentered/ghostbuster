American Airlines Pilots Union Negotiations Continue, Strike Possible at Midnight

Negotiations between American Airlines and the union representing its pilots continued today, as the deadline for a potential strike looms at midnight tonight. The Allied Pilots Association and management at American Airlines have been in contract discussions for over two years, trying to negotiate improved pay, benefits, and retirement plans for the airline’s 15,000 pilots. Although progress has been slow, there are signs that the two sides may be getting closer to an agreement with the launch of around-the-clock talks earlier this week.  

Union representatives have said that they do not want to call a strike and disrupt operations and travel for American Airlines’ hundreds of thousands of customers, but they will strike at midnight tonight if significant progress is not made in the current negotiations. A strike would ground all American Airlines flights and potentially have major ripple effects across the country. The union has sought wage increases of nearly 30% over three years to bring pilots to pay parity with counterparts at Delta and United Airlines. Management has offered more modest raises so far of just 10% over the same period. Other sticking points in the negotiations include changes to retirement plans, use of pilot reserves, and improving work-life balance.

“A strike is always a last resort, but our members have been more than patient during this lengthy process and deserve compensation and benefits that reflect their essential role in the success of American Airlines,” said Allied Pilots Association spokesman Dennis Tajer. “Ultimately we remain hopeful that American Airlines will make a serious offer at the negotiation table so we can reach an agreement, avoid operational disruption, and get pilots the contract they have earned.”

American Airlines said in a statement that it remains committed to reaching a deal with pilots that is "fair, equitable, and provides appropriate compensation for our pilots' outstanding contributions, while also protecting our business and long-term success.” The airline has begun limited contingency planning to prepare for the possibility of a strike, but hopes to have a final agreement in place before the deadline. Pilots have not gone on strike at American Airlines since 1983. Industry analysts warn that a prolonged strike could cost the airline up to $50 million per day in lost revenues and operational impacts.   

Negotiations were continuing at an undisclosed location, with both sides under a media blackout as the midnight deadline approaches. All eyes are on the ongoing talks and whether American Airlines and its pilots union can find common ground to avoid the first pilot strike at the nation’s largest airline in nearly 40 years.
