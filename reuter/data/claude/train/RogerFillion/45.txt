Clinton Administration Bets $36 Billion on Spectrum Auction Plan for New Communications Services 

The Clinton administration announced today that it plans to hold the first spectrum auction in the United States, selling the radio frequency rights for a large swath of bandwidth. The auction is intended to raise $36 billion to help reduce the federal deficit while freeing up spectrum for the development of new wireless communications technologies.

"This auction will unleash the power of competitive markets to make available more spectrum for new technologies,” said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. The auction will offer licenses for radio frequency in a wide range from 1,710 MHz to 1,755 MHz and from 2,110 MHz to 2,170 MHz. These frequencies are ideal for an emerging generation of wireless services that can provide high-speed data transmission as well as traditional voice calls. 

Industry analysts expect major telecommunications companies to bid aggressively in the auction to gain control of spectrum that will be critical for future network expansion and new offerings. However, the plan faces criticism on multiple fronts.Existing satellite television broadcasters currently use parts of the spectrum targeted for auction and argue this could interfere with their signals. Some technology companies also argue the Clinton plan favors large telecom companies and may discourage smaller innovative startups.

There are also concerns about limiting access to spectrum that could be used for unforeseen future technologies. "Once you've auctioned off this bandwidth, it's locked up for the highest bidder possibly for decades,” said Jerry Michalski, an industry consultant. “No one can predict how technology will evolve and what new uses might emerge for this spectrum.” 

Supporters counter that auctions are the fairest and most efficient way to allocate a scarce public resource like wireless spectrum. The rules proposed for the auction would require licensees to make use of the spectrum within five years or risk losing the license, aiming to prevent spectrum hoarding. The administration hopes that getting more spectrum into the marketplace will spur innovation as companies develop new technologies and services to take advantage of the new bandwidth.

The auction plan requires Congressional approval before moving forward. The administration is betting lawmakers will back the idea as a pragmatic way to raise funds while supporting the growth of new industries. If approved, the auction could take place as soon as next year, marking a turning point in how access to the nation's airwaves is allocated and a victory for market forces in government policymaking. The challenge will be ensuring the spectrum fuels innovation rather than just lining the pockets of major telecom companies, with billions of dollars—and the future of wireless technology—hanging in the balance.
