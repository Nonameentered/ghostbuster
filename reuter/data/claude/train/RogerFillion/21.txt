Federal Regulators Plan to Slash Rates on Overseas Calls, Potentially Saving Consumers and Companies Billions While Ruffling Feathers of Foreign Governments 

The Federal Communications Commission announced plans today to drastically cut the rates that U.S. telecommunications companies can charge for international phone calls, a move that could save businesses and consumers billions of dollars annually while angering foreign governments that rely on the fees.   

The FCC voted to cap the rates companies charge for international calls at $.11 to $.15 per minute for calls to Western European countries and Canada, down from an average of $.24 per minute currently. Rates for calls to African and Asian countries would be capped at $.07 to $.11 per minute, a roughly 50% cut from current averages. The new rate caps are scheduled to go into effect in October barring any legal challenges.

“For too long, international calls from the U.S. have been subject to unjust and unreasonable fees due to a broken marketplace,” said FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. “These new rate caps will make overseas calls more affordable for American families and businesses, especially in these difficult economic times, while still allowing providers to earn a fair return.”

The rate cuts should yield $2 billion to $4 billion in annual savings for U.S. consumers and businesses, according to FCC estimates. Large companies like telemarketers and call centers stand to benefit significantly given the huge volume of international calls they make. American families with relatives abroad are also expected to gain, with average annual savings potentially reaching $50 to $200 per household depending on calling patterns, the FCC said.  

However, the rate slash faces strong opposition from foreign carriers that currently collect portions of the fees and rely on them as revenue. The FCC’s changes would significantly reduce payments made by U.S. companies to foreign carriers for connecting international calls. Representatives from several countries, including Bangladesh, Cuba, and Pakistan, had lobbied the FCC against the rate cuts and could legally challenge the new rules. The fees resulting from outdated policies also fund communications infrastructure in some developing countries.

Supporters counter that current rates far surpass the actual costs of connecting international calls and amount to a transfer of funds from U.S. consumers and companies to often state-owned foreign carriers. FCC officials argue their new policy balances providing rate relief with ensuring fair compensation for carriers. 

The rate caps complete a years-long FCC effort to modernize international calling rules in the face of rapid changes in technology and calling patterns. International call volumes have declined more than 50% over the past decade as alternative internet-based calling options like WhatsApp and Skype have become more popular. The FCC voted to phase out aging regulations and adopt policies reflective of today's competitive global communications marketplace.
