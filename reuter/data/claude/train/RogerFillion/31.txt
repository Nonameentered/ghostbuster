Television and Hollywood Moguls Unveil Controversial TV Rating System  

The major broadcast and cable television networks, as well as Hollywood studios, announced today the implementation of a new voluntary rating system for television shows that has sparked controversy and debate. The TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board, which consists of executives from the top media companies, released details of a five-tiered rating system meant to give viewers information about the age-appropriateness and content of programs.

Supporters argue the ratings—TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, and TV-MA—will empower parents and help them make informed viewing choices for their families. "For too long, parents have had little ability to determine ahead of time if a show is right for their child," said Lisa Gregorian, president of Warner Bros. Worldwide Television Marketing. "These guidelines provide an easy tool for making those decisions and will encourage more co-viewing by allowing parents and kids to choose shows together."  

However, critics argue the ratings are too vague, inconsistent, and permissive. Parents groups have argued that the ratings do little to flag inappropriate content like violence, coarse language or mature themes. "The rating system seems more focused on the interests of the media companies than families," said Melissa Henson of the Parents Television Council. "There are too many loopholes and inconsistencies that will continue to make conscientious oversight of viewing habits difficult, if not impossible."

The industry defended the ratings by noting that television viewing is a personal choice that varies for each family based on their values and judgment. "Every parent has different standards and we aimed to create basic guideposts that provide helpful information for all viewers,” Gregorian said. The ratings will appear on screen during the first 15 seconds of each show and the initial implementations will begin this month, with all shows to be rated by this fall's television season.

The debate around the efficacy and appropriateness of the new TV ratings is likely to continue as advocacy groups pressure the media companies for more details and parents begin to experience the ratings in reality. For now, judgment is being withheld until the roll-out and the impact of the ratings can be properly and fully assessed. But there is no doubt the media landscape for families has just gotten more complex, with these controversial new guidelines engendering both applause and angst across the country.
