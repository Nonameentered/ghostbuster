President Clinton and Congress to Consider Airwave Sales to Reduce Deficit 

President Bill Clinton announced today that he and leaders in Congress have agreed to consider selling portions of the public airwaves to private companies as a way to reduce the federal deficit. The proposal suggests auctioning off rights to parts of the radio frequency spectrum for uses such as mobile phones, wireless internet, and other technologies. Revenue from the spectrum auctions could reach into the tens of billions of dollars, providing funds to lower the deficit.

"The airwaves are a valuable national resource, and we must find ways to maximize their benefit to the American people," said President Clinton in a statement. "By auctioning certain spectrum rights to telecommunications companies and other commercial users, we can raise money to invest in other priorities while still reserving adequate bandwidth for critical government functions."

The radio frequency spectrum refers to the range of electromagnetic waves used for communications technologies like radios, televisions, and wireless devices. The spectrum is tightly regulated by the federal government, which issues licenses to companies and individuals to use specific frequency bands. Auctioning portions of the spectrum to telecom firms and other commercial operators could open up new opportunities for innovation while reducing costs to consumers.    

The plan will require approval from Congress, which controls regulation of interstate communication technologies like the airwaves. Republican leadership in Congress expressed initial support for spectrum auctions as a creative approach to deficit reduction but said more details are needed regarding how much spectrum will be sold and how the funds will be allocated.   “We are open to proposals that unleash the power of the free market while still enabling investment in next-generation technologies,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. “Spectrum auctions seem to meet those goals, but the devil is always in the details. We will scrutinize any plan to ensure maximum benefit to taxpayers.”

Consumer advocates argued that selling too much spectrum could hamper future technologies and reduce access to the airwaves for universities, rural areas, and other public services. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, whose department oversees spectrum management, promised to conduct auctions carefully and judiciously. “We will make sure we do not auction so much spectrum as to limit innovation or deploy too much in the hands of too few companies,” Brown said. “The goal here is to raise funds for deficit reduction, not create monopolies.” 

The proposal continues a broader trend of...
