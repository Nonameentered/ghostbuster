Wireless Phone Auction Sees Prices Drop 75 Percent from Last Year's Sale

The Federal Communications Commission's latest wireless spectrum auction saw a steep decline in winning bids from previous sales, reflecting the slowing growth in the cellular industry as well as reduced demand for additional capacity. 

The FCC raised a total of $21.2 billion in last week's auction of airwaves in the 3.5 gigahertz band, which can be used by carriers to add capacity and speed to their next-generation 5G wireless networks. However, that amount was down more than 75 percent from the $80 billion raised in a mid-band auction last year.

The top bidders in the auction were T-Mobile US Inc., AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., which spent a combined $18 billion and won over 80 percent of the spectrum. The largest winner was T-Mobile, which bid $9.2 billion and acquired 40 percent of the airwaves auctioned.

The lower bids reflect the slowing subscriber growth at major wireless carriers as well as the saturation of the mobile market in the U.S. After years of double-digit percentage growth, most carriers added fewer than 1 million phone subscribers last quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic has also reduced demand for additional network capacity with many Americans still working and socializing from home.

“The wireless market has matured, so the carriers don’t need as much new spectrum as they did in the past,” said telecom analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. “They have built very advanced networks already and spectrum is scarce and expensive.”

The FCC had anticipated lower interest in this auction and set a lower threshold for minimum bids. But the agency said the $21 billion raised still marked the third largest auction of mid-band spectrum.  

“The 3.5 GHz auction has made a huge swath of prime mid-band spectrum available for 5G, advancing U.S. leadership in this key part of the telecommunications market,” said FCC acting chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement.
