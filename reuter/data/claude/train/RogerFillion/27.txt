Alaska Petitions FCC to Ban Broadcast Advertising of Hard Liquor 

The state of Alaska has formally petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ban the broadcast advertising of distilled spirits, commonly known as hard liquor, within its borders. In a petition filed with the FCC this week, Alaska argued that curbing liquor ads on television, radio, and other broadcast platforms would help reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in the state.

Alaska suffers from higher rates of alcohol abuse and related mortality compared to the national average. Binge drinking rates in Alaska are double the national average, and alcohol-related deaths in the state occur at a rate nearly 50% higher than in the rest of the country. Native Alaskans experience disproportionately higher rates of alcohol abuse and related health issues. 

“Our state faces a unique set of challenges due to exceedingly high rates of alcohol misuse, abuse and overconsumption, especially in rural areas and among our Native populations,” said Alaska Lt. Governor Kevin Meyer in a statement. “Reducing youth exposure to alcohol marketing is an important step towards addressing these devastating issues.”

Under the petition, broadcasters in Alaska would be prohibited from airing advertisements for hard liquor such as whiskey, vodka, rum and tequila. Beer and wine advertising would still be allowed. The proposed ban would apply to broadcast channels and radio stations in Alaska but not to cable or satellite channels, which are outside of the FCC’s jurisdiction.

Alaska previously had a complete ban on broadcast liquor advertising from 1991 to 2000. Public health experts say reinstating a limited ban could be an impactful step in the right direction. “Banning television ads for hard liquor, in particular, can reduce youth exposure to irresponsible marketing messages that encourage excessive and underage drinking,” said David Jernigan, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

However, the proposal faces opposition from the alcohol industry and observers concerned it could infringe on commercial free speech rights. “There are grave constitutional concerns with banning advertising for a legal product,” said Paul Pisano, spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. “We believe education and targeted interventions are more effective in addressing misuse and abuse.” The FCC has not announced a timeline for reviewing and potentially voting on Alaska's petition.
