Television and Entertainment Industries Vow to Reject any Government-Imposed Plan for TV Ratings and Unveil Their Own System

The television and entertainment industries today announced that they will reject any government-mandated television ratings system and will instead develop and implement their own independent ratings guidelines. The industries, represented by the National Association of Broadcasters, the Motion Picture Association of America, and the Recording Industry Association of America issued a joint statement vowing to create an industry-led TV ratings code that aims to give parents more information to determine what their children watch but without government interference.

The announcement comes after months of congressional hearings on the issue of television ratings and children's television. Lawmakers have considered legislation that would create a federally imposed ratings system, with classifications like TV-Y for children, TV-14 for those 14 and older, and TV-MA for mature audiences. However, industry groups have pushed back against government regulation, arguing that media creators should determine ratings based on content, not lawmakers. The groups now say they will unveil their own voluntary guidelines within the next six months to preempt legislation.  

Critics argue, however, that any system created by the media industry groups will not adequately warn families about inappropriate content and also will not face consequences for non-compliance. Public interest groups contend that voluntary guidelines will ultimately not serve the needs of parents, and government intervention is required to create clear ratings, definitions of classifications, enforcement standards, and penalties for inaccurate ratings. Some lawmakers who originally backed legislation say they will see how an industry initiative works but reserve the right to revive legislative action if needed.

The industry working group designing the ratings says it will survey parents and families to determine how to implement a workable, transparent ratings system that informs viewers and does not stifle creativity. The goal is to have new guidelines in effect for all television programs—streaming, cable and broadcast—within two years. Questions remain, however, about how ratings will be applied to huge catalogs of existing TV content, how industry groups will monitor compliance, and how well an initiative unsupported by regulation will address public and government concerns. The vow to create voluntary ratings guidelines likely ensures that this issue will remain under debate. Parents, lawmakers, and media groups all have a stake in finding the right balance between free expression, business interests, and protection of children. With an industry system now promised within months, the next chapter in the policy debate around television content ratings is set to unfold.
