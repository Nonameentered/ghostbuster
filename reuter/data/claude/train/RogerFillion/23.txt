Regulators Take Steps to Reduce Cost of Overseas Phone Calls for Americans

Federal regulators announced new rules today aimed at lowering the cost of phone calls between Americans and their loved ones living abroad. The Federal Communications Commission approved rules to expand the availability of international phone call services that charge below standard rates for calling foreign countries.   

For years, many Americans have complained that standard landline and mobile phone rates for international calls are unaffordable for frequent contact with family members and friends in other countries. Call rates vary but can easily exceed $1 per minute. The high costs are often cited as a barrier for immigrants and their families to stay in close contact.

Under the new FCC rules, phone companies will be required to disclose cheaper calling options for international calls, enabling customers to more easily find affordable services for calling abroad. The FCC is also taking steps to make it easier for new voice service providers to operate in the U.S., which could increase competition and drive down rates.  

"Keeping in touch with loved ones should not be a luxury," said FCC Chairman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement. "Affordable international calling is important for strengthening connections between immigrant communities and the United States."   

The order adopted by the FCC aims to reduce routing roadblocks for alternative calling services while providing more transparency for consumers about their options. Many customers are unaware of services that provide international calls for a few cents per minute or less. The FCC is requiring larger phone companies to clearly list on their websites affordable international calling plans, including rates for major destination countries. Phone carriers will also be prohibited from misleading customers about calling options. 

Several startups already offer cheap or free international calling and texting services via mobile apps and web-based services. But some face barriers connecting calls through networks of larger phone and telecommunications companies. The new FCC rules would make it easier for these kinds of alternative services to operate and connect calls.
