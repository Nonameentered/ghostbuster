Television and Computer Industries Reach Agreement on New High-Definition Broadcast Standard  

Representatives from major television networks, cable companies, and consumer electronics manufacturers announced today that they have reached an agreement on a single high-definition television broadcast standard. The new standard will enable consumers to enjoy high-definition video and audio quality, as well as new interactive features, on both standard televisions and computer monitors.

For the past decade, the television and computer industries have been developing competing high-definition broadcast standards. Television networks and cable companies have backed the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standard, which provides higher resolution and surround sound but is incompatible with computer displays. Meanwhile, computer companies have promoted their own standard that works with both televisions and PCs but offers slightly lower video quality. The competing standards have confused consumers and slowed the adoption of high-definition television.  

The new cross-industry standard, called Ultra High-Definition or UHD, combines the best features of the previous standards. UHD will support video resolutions of up to 8 million pixels, more than four times the resolution of today's high-definition televisions, enabling an ultra-crisp, lifelike picture. It will also provide up to 12 channels of digital surround sound and an interactive platform to deliver Internet-enabled features to both televisions and computers. All major TV networks and cable providers have pledged to begin broadcasting in UHD in the next 2 to 3 years.

Consumer electronics makers expect to launch the first UHD televisions and computer monitors in late 2020 or early 2021. Prices will start around $2,500 for a 50-inch television, which is higher than comparable HDTVs today but should drop quickly as UHD is adopted. The representatives said UHD will ultimately replace current HDTV standards and become the sole broadcast standard within 5 to 10 years. Overall, industry experts predict UHD will drive a new era of growth in home entertainment and merge the television and Internet viewing experiences. Consumers will benefit from an amazing entertainment experience as well as greater choice and control over what they watch. The UHD standard is a win-win for both the television and technology industries and the hundreds of millions of viewers they serve.
