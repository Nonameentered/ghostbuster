Conservative Media Watchdog Group Slams New TV Ratings System, Calls for It to Be Junked 

The Parents Television Council, a non-partisan organization that advocates for responsible entertainment, has condemned the TV industry's new content ratings system as "wholly inadequate" and called for it to be abandoned.

In a statement, PTC President Tim Winter said the ratings system called TV Parental Guidelines "fails to provide parents with the information they need to make informed decisions about the shows their families watch." Winter argued the system uses vague and subjective criteria in rating shows, making the ratings unreliable and practically useless. 

The TV Parental Guidelines system went into effect at the start of the fall TV season. It was created by the major TV networks including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Telemundo, Univision and The CW to provide content ratings for their primetime entertainment programs and some children's programming. The ratings include TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, and TV-MA to indicate the age appropriateness of shows.

However, the PTC conducted a study analyzing the ratings of the first two weeks of the new fall season and found major discrepancies between the ratings and the actual content of some shows. For example, the show “Riverdale” on The CW was rated TV-14 but contained “gratuitous gory violence and horror, sexual content, and adult themes.” The NBC show “This Is Us” received a TV-14 rating despite containing “vulgar language, explicit sexual references and mature themes.”

“The new ratings system is as arbitrary as the old one,” Winter said. “There are no standards, no transparency and no accountability. Millions of families depend on the TV ratings to make viewing decisions, and they are being woefully misled.” Winter called for the TV Parental Guidelines system to be scrapped immediately and an independent, standardized ratings system to be implemented.

The TV networks that developed the ratings system defended it in statements, saying the ratings are meant as a guide to help parents determine what content is appropriate for their families. The networks urged parents to use their discretion in choosing what shows their children can watch.
