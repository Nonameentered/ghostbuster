Negotiations continue as American Airlines pilot union threatens to strike at midnight

American Airlines and the union representing its over 15,000 pilots are entering the final hours of negotiations as the union's leadership voted last week to authorize a strike if a new deal isn't reached before the current contract expires at midnight tonight. 

Both sides report that progress has been made in recent talks but significant gaps remain on key issues like compensation, retirement plans, and scheduling. The Allied Pilots Association (APA) has argued that American pilots deserve better pay and benefits after making numerous concessions in recent years to help the airline restructure and emerge from bankruptcy. However, the carrier says its proposals already represent industry-leading terms and any further increases threaten its long term financial stability.

A strike would ground all American Airlines flights and impact hundreds of thousands of customers at the peak of the busy summer travel season. The airline has started reaching out to customers to warn of potential disruptions and offer rebookings on other airlines. But American maintains confidence that an agreement will be reached to avert any interruption to its almost 6,700 daily flights.   

The APA announced on Friday that its board of directors had unanimously approved a strike authorization vote. Of the nearly 60 percent of pilots who voted, an "overwhelming supermajority" gave approval to call a strike if today's deadline passes without an acceptable agreement, according to a statement from the union. Union leaders argue this shows the level of frustration felt by pilots who have endured several rounds of concessions and job losses over the past decade. 

However, the vote does not necessarily mean that pilots will walk off the job at 12:01 am Wednesday if talks collapse. The union indicated in its announcement that its leaders retain the authority to decide whether and when to call pilots to strike. Most observers expect the APA will likely continue negotiating into the evening and possibly overnight before determining next steps. Calling a strike is an act of last resort, as it represents the nuclear option in labor disputes and could significantly harm both parties.

Fort Worth-based American Airlines posted a $1.9 billion profit last year, more than double its net income from 2017. Revenue and passenger traffic have also been climbing steadily. The APA claims its proposals would add just $300 million to existing labor costs, a fraction of the total profit and revenue numbers. Still, American CEO Doug Parker has warned that increasing costs could make the airline less competitive and flexible in an industry prone to financial turbulence.  

With peak summertime travel in full swing this week, the stakes couldnâ€™t be higher for resolving this showdown. Both American Airlines and its pilots want to avoid the disruption of a strike but remain far enough part on the details that more discussions may be required. All eyes will be on whether negotiators can forge a compromise to keep aircraft taking to the skies. Failure to reach a new deal could ground one of the country's largest airlines and cause damage that extends for months to come.
