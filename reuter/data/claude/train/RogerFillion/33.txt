TV Ratings System to Begin Airing on Major Networks, Drawing Mixed Reactions from Critics 

The major television networks ABC, NBC, and CBS announced today that they will begin displaying parental guidance ratings on all of their primetime shows starting next month. The voluntary ratings system will use a scale from TV-Y for children's programming all the way up to TV-MA for mature audiences only.

The move is aimed at giving parents more information about the content of shows to determine if they are appropriate for their children. However, critics argue that the ratings system is flawed and incomplete. Some public advocacy groups say the ratings are too broad and do not adequately warn viewers about violence, language, or other potentially objectionable content.

"TV ratings are a step in the right direction but they need to be more detailed and specific," said Melissa Henson of the Parents Television Council, a non-profit organization that monitors programming for families. "Just slapping a 'TV-PG' or 'TV-14' rating on a show does not tell parents enough about what their children may see or hear if they watch." 

The networks counter that they need to find the right balance between giving viewers useful information and overloading them with ratings "nitpicking" every element of content. "We want to give parents a general sense of the appropriateness of a show for children without getting into an absurd level of specificity that simply tunes people out," said ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey. 

Some industry critics argue that the ratings system is also flawed because it's designed by the networks themselves. "There is an inherent conflict of interest when media companies get to decide how to rate their own content," said Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. "They have a lot of incentive to be lenient to appeal to advertisers and audiences." 

However, the networks say their revamped ratings system was created independently by TV Parental Guidelines, an industry organization not directly tied to any broadcast or cable company. The group solicited input from advocacy organizations and parents to determine the appropriate rating categories and criteria. "This was an open and collaborative process, not something dictated by network executives alone in a conference room," said a spokesperson for NBCUniversal.

With the roll-out just weeks away, the debate around TV ratings is unlikely to subside anytime soon. But most parents and family organizations are still glad to have more information about the shows they choose to let their children watch. As Melissa Henson of the PTC said, "An imperfect ratings system is better than no system at all." The networks hope viewers will agree.
