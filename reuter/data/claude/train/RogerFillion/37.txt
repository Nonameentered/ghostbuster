Wireless Phone Auction Prices Take a Dramatic Dip with 75% Drop in Bids from Last Year's Auction  

The Federal Communications Commission's latest auction of wireless spectrum licenses ended yesterday with a dramatic decline in bids compared to the previous year's auction. The FCC raised only $4.2 billion in the auction of radio frequency licenses, a 75% decrease from the $17.7 billion raised in last year's auction.  

The drop in bids signals a cooling of interest in spectrum licenses by major wireless carriers in the US. The largest bidders in recent years like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile did not bid as aggressively in this auction. Newer entrants like Dish Network and Comcast subsidiaries also placed fewer bids. Overall, bids were placed on just 274 of the 24,149 spectrum licenses up for auction, indicating low demand.

Industry analysts cited several factors contributing to the decline in bids. “The major wireless carriers have ample spectrum for their current needs,” said Mark Peterson of Telecom Advisory Group. “They are being more selective in the auctions and don’t need to bid on every spectrum block.” The mix of spectrum bands and coverage areas in this auction may have also been less appealing to bidders.  

The drop in revenue from the spectrum auction could impact the FCC’s plans to fund rural broadband expansion and next-generation 911 emergency calling centers. By law, the FCC must use proceeds from spectrum auctions to fund various special initiatives and government programs. With a 75% reduction in auction revenue, many of these programs may need to be scaled back or postponed.

On the positive side, the lower spectrum prices could provide an opportunity for smaller carriers to obtain licenses at more affordable rates. “Some regional carriers and rural telcos may find value in this spectrum at these prices,” said Aisha Brown, a telecom industry attorney. “Lower spectrum costs mean lower barriers to entry, which could spur more competition.”

The FCC will now review the auction results and winners will have 10 business days to file applications for their spectrum licenses. While this auction produced lackluster results, analysts anticipate that future auctions that include a mix of low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum may generate more vigorous bidding and higher revenues. The lower prices of this auction may even spur additional interest in the secondary market for spectrum licenses among carriers. The dynamics of the spectrum market continue to evolve with each new auction.
