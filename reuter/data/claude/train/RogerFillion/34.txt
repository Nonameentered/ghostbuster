Ameritech Corp. Becomes First Baby Bell to Seek Federal Approval for Long-Distance Service  

Ameritech Corp, one of the regional telecommunications companies formed from the breakup of AT&T's monopoly in 1984, announced today that it has submitted a formal application to federal regulators to offer long-distance phone service. If approved, Ameritech will become the first so-called "Baby Bell" to re-enter the long-distance market since the AT&T breakup.

The Chicago-based Ameritech filed its application with the Federal Communications Commission to provide interstate long-distance service in Illinois and Michigan, where it currently offers local phone service. "This is a historic day and marks an important milestone toward increasing competition in the telecommunications industry,‚Äù said Ameritech CEO Richard Notebaert. 

The move comes after Ameritech claims to have met the requirements of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which required the Baby Bells to open their local networks to rivals before being allowed to enter the $100 billion long-distance market. Ameritech says it now faces local competition in Michigan and Illinois from over 30 different carriers, satisfying the necessary competitive checklist. If its application is approved, Ameritech would begin offering long-distance service in those states within six months.

Consumer groups and rival carriers are expected to scrutinize Ameritech's filing to determine if it has truly met the standards set by Congress to open its markets. Traditionally, the Baby Bells have been seen as monopolies that dominate local phone service. Allowing them into long distance could threaten competition, critics argue. The FCC will likely spend at least six to 12 months reviewing written comments, data filings, and other evidence before determining if Ameritech should be permitted to offer long-distance calling plans.

Ameritech's news deals a blow to AT&T, which currently provides most long-distance service to Ameritech's local customers. AT&T's consumer long-distance business has been declining in recent years due to competition from newer rivals like MCI. Losing subscribers from Ameritech would further hurt AT&T's long-distance market share and revenue. However, AT&T could also eventually benefit if federal rules are relaxed in the coming years, allowing it to re-enter the local phone service market to compete with Ameritech.
