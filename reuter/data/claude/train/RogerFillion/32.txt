Regulators Approve New High-Definition Digital TV Standard, Sparking Race Between Computer and TV Industries 

Federal regulators approved a new high-definition digital television standard today that promises to bring high-definition TV to millions of homes in the coming years. The move immediately sparked a race between the computing and television industries to control the new market for high-definition content and the set-top boxes that will deliver the new HD content to consumers.

The Federal Communications Commission voted to formally adopt the ATSC 3.0 standard for over-the-air digital television broadcasting. The new standard, developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an international consortium of industry members, will allow for vastly improved signal quality over todayâ€™s obsolete digital TV standards, support multiple high-definition and 4K resolution screens, and enable interactive and customized viewing capabilities using internet connectivity. Broadcasters will be allowed to begin deploying the new standard immediately in major markets once they have upgraded their transmission equipment and obtained necessary FCC permits.

The prospect of high-definition television reaching mass audiences has led to a frenzy of deals and product announcements from both Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Major TV brands like Samsung, LG, and Sony are poised to launch new 8K televisions and updated set-top boxes that will be compatible with the new broadcast standard. Meanwhile, internet companies like Google, Amazon, and Roku are working to incorporate the new standard into their popular streaming devices to gain a foothold in the living room. Content creators have also accelerated production of shows and movies filmed in high definition and 4K resolution to meet anticipated demand.

However, the transition to the new standard could take years as broadcasters undergo an expensive process to upgrade stations across the country. Consumers will also need to purchase new television sets and peripheral devices to receive the improved HD signals and access interactive features. Questions also remain about how internet streaming services and traditional cable and satellite TV providers will incorporate the new standard into their platforms. Despite the logistical challenges, industry experts predict the new high-definition TV standard could drive a new wave of innovation and fuel growth in the television market for years to come. The race to shape the future of television is on.
