FCC's New Rules Opening Local Telephone Market to Competition Likely to Survive Legal Challenges  

The Federal Communications Commission today approved new rules intended to open local telephone service markets to increased competition, a move that is expected to spur legal challenges but still likely be upheld, according to telecommunications experts.

The 3-2 party-line vote by the FCC scrapped many of the regulations in place since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. The new rules free the regional Bell operating companies, or RBOCs, from various restrictions on entering new markets, including prohibitions on providing long-distance service and manufacturing telecommunications equipment.  

In voting for the new rules, the FCC commissioners said they would promote more choice for consumers and businesses in local phone service and enable new investment in advanced telecommunications networks. "The future is here, and itâ€™s time for regulations to catch up to the marketplace realities of 2020," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.

However, dissenting Democratic commissioners warned the changes went too far and would lead to higher prices, fewer consumer protections, and job losses. Opponents are expected to file lawsuits attempting to block the new rules, arguing the FCC has overstepped its authority. Still, most analysts think the courts will uphold the bulk of the FCC's actions.

"The FCC has broad authority to regulate telecommunications in the public interest, and eliminating outdated rules is squarely within its remit," said Brian Halla, a technology policy expert and partner with consulting firm PRTM. "The opponents will have an uphill battle convincing the courts the FCC acted arbitrarily."  

Consumer advocacy groups have argued the existing regulations are still necessary to prevent anti-competitive behavior. But supporters counter that much has changed since the 1980s, including the rise of cable companies, wireless providers, and other competitors in offering phone and internet service.  

The RBOCs praised the FCC vote, saying the new rules would enable them to better invest in new fiber optic and 5G wireless networks to expand broadband access.
