Netscape's First Quarter Profits Soar 119% to $7.9 Million  

Netscape Communications Corp. announced first quarter profits of $7.9 million, more than doubling the $3.6 million profit recorded in the same period last year. The 119% increase in profits comes amid strong growth in Netscape's enterprise software and services business.  

Revenue for the quarter ending March 31 was $156 million, up 38% from $113 million last year. Revenue growth was fueled by a 59% increase in sales of Netscape's enterprise software products, including its suite of messaging, directory, and security solutions. The enterprise software and services division now makes up over 50% of Netscape's total revenue.   

"Our transformation into an enterprise software and services company is paying off," said Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale. "While the browser wars continue, Netscape has built a strong and growing revenue stream independent of the browser."

Netscape has faced intensifying competition in the Internet browser market from Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which now dominates browser market share. In response, Netscape has repositioned itself as a supplier of software and services for enterprise customers looking to leverage Internet technologies for business.  

The first quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations and underscore Netscape's success in decreasing its reliance on the volatile consumer browser market. Netscape stock rose over 25% in after-hours trading on the earnings news.

"Netscape's strategy to diversify into the enterprise software market was visionary," said John Doe, an analyst with Abc Securities. "While browser profits have evaporated, Netscape has built a robust and profitable enterprise division. These latest results show that Netscape can thrive even as Microsoft pushes into their traditional browser base."

Netscape expects the strong growth in its enterprise division to continue through the rest of the year. For the second quarter, Netscape predicts enterprise software and services revenue will increase 50% and overall revenue will rise by 30% compared to last year. Profit margins are projected to remain over 20%, demonstrating Netscape's sharpened focus on the high-margin enterprise software sector.
