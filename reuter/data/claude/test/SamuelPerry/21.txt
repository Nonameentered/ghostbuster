High-tech Industry Executives See Continued Growth for Leading Companies Despite the End of the Internet Gold Rush

The heady days of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to an explosion of Internet companies and lavish spending in the technology industry. While the bubble eventually burst, leading to pain for investors and workers, top executives at major tech companies today see continued strong growth and innovation.  

“The end of the irrational exuberance of the 1990s was inevitable and necessary,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, the world’s largest technology company. “However, the tech sector today is on far firmer footing, focused on developing products and services that improve people’s lives, increase productivity, and open up new opportunities for workers.”

Cook pointed to advancements like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual and augmented reality as new frontiers of innovation that could fuel the next decade or more of growth. “The smartphone revolutionized how we live and work, but that will seem quaint compared to the changes coming with advances in AI and AR/VR,” Cook said.   

While tech startups from the dot-com era were often built on unrealistic business models, leaders at major tech companies say they now have robust and diversified sources of revenue as well as huge amounts of data that provide a competitive advantage.

“Google has been thriving for over 20 years now based on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. “We have built a very strong foundation that positions us well for many years of success and growth ahead.”

Pichai pointed to Google’s leadership in critical areas like search, advertising, cloud computing, and AI as strengths that would power double-digit revenue increases for the foreseeable future. Google just reported a 23% jump in advertising revenue and a 45% increase in cloud revenue for the first quarter of 2020, showing its dominance.

Other major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook reported similar strong growth and financial results recently, indicating the leading tech platforms have moved well beyond the dot-com bubble days. While startups come and go, these tech leaders have become deeply embedded in how people work, shop, communicate, and get information.  

“We’re still in the early days of cloud computing and just scratching the surface of possibilities with AI,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “I’ve never been more optimistic about the opportunity ahead for continued innovation and progress.”

Analysts and investors seem to share the optimism of the tech executives. “The leading tech companies today have built tremendously profitable, diversified, and defensible businesses that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come,” said tech analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. “The tech landscape today is night and day from 20 years ago.”

While the stratospheric rise and fall of Internet companies defined an era, the leading tech firms that survived have adapted and now flourish in a digital world they helped create. The dot-com bubble burst, but technology innovation and its promise to improve lives march on. The future remains bright for tech companies focused on real products, services, and solutions—even with the end of the gold rush in the rearview mirror.
