Hewlett-Packard Co. Stock Surges After Strong First-Quarter Profits and Upgraded Ratings from Major Financial Firms   

Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) jumped nearly 10% in early trading today after the technology giant announced fiscal first-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations and received upgrades from major Wall Street firms. 

HP reported earnings of $0.30 per share on revenue of $28.5 billion for the quarter ending January 31. Analysts had forecast earnings of $0.26 per share on revenue of $27.7 billion. Revenue increased 1% from the prior-year period, driven by growth in its personal systems and printing divisions.

"We had a solid first quarter and a good start to the year," said HP CEO Enrique Lores. "The progress we made in strengthening our portfolio and improving our execution over the past year is yielding results."

HP's personal systems division, which includes PCs and workstations, posted revenue growth of 7% to $10.6 billion. The printing division reported a 3% increase in revenue to $4.8 billion, driven by higher sales of commercial hardware and consumer printer supplies. However, revenue declined in HP's other divisions, including a 15% drop in its enterprise services unit.

In response to the strong quarterly performance and improving business trends, analysts at JPMorgan and Bank of America upgraded HP shares to "overweight" and "buy" ratings, respectively. JPMorgan called the results "impressive" and said HP is poised to gain market share amid a corporate refresh cycle for PCs and printers. Bank of America cited HP's "significant self-help and restructuring over the past several years" in raising its rating.

HP shares have risen 35% over the past 12 months as the company has made progress in its multiyear turnaround effort under Lores, who took over as CEO in November 2019. Lores has focused HP on improving its operations, reducing costs, and investing in key growth areas like cloud services and 3D printing.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted HP's business in 2020, especially equipment sales to enterprise customers. However, the company benefited from a surge in demand for PCs and work-from-home technology. HP expects the elevated demand for PCs to continue in 2021 as more students and workers remain at home.   

For the second quarter, HP forecast earnings of $0.53 to $0.58 per share on revenue growth of 7% to 9% from the prior-year period. The company raised its profit outlook for the full fiscal year ending October 2021. HP anticipates continued growth in its PC and printing businesses as well as a recovery in its commercial divisions as economies reopen from COVID-19 restrictions.
