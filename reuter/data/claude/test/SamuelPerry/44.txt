Netscape Surpasses Wall Street's Expectations Despite Investor Worries about Product Upgrades

Internet pioneer Netscape Communications announced third quarter earnings of 38 cents per share, beating Wall Street forecasts of 35 cents and reassuring investors worried about flagging demand for its software. 

Netscape shares jumped more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. The stock price had slid 38 percent from its April high amid concerns over delays in upgrading key products and competition from rivals like Microsoft. However, Netscape's results suggest those fears were overblown.

Revenues for the quarter ending September 30 rose 36 percent to $194 million from $142 million a year ago. Sales of business products such as Netscape's Navigator Web browser and Communicator suite of Internet tools fueled growth. Enterprise revenue grew 53 percent, reflecting “very strong demand...from corporations, Internet service providers and educational institutions,” said Netscape CEO James Barksdale.

Netscape earned a profit of $27 million in the third quarter, up from $14.9 million a year earlier. While down from second-quarter earnings of $28.9 million, the results beat most analysts' forecasts. “I was expecting an earnings miss, so these numbers were a pleasant surprise,” said analyst Tom Wyman of J.P. Morgan. “Netscape's results show they have their product transition issues under control and growth remains healthy.”

However, Netscape's long-awaited upgrades to key products are still on the horizon. Barksdale said version 5.0 of flagship products like Navigator and Communicator would debut “in the coming months.” The upgrades are seen as crucial to defending Netscape's position as the Internet software leader. 

“While these results buy them some breathing room, the next few product releases will determine Netscape's ability to maintain its leadership,” said Jim Pickrel of Hambrecht & Quist. “If the upgrades are seriously delayed or poorly reviewed, the competition will make further inroads into their market.” 

Microsoft in particular poses a threat with its Internet Explorer browser and Outlook Express communications tool. Microsoft has pledged to “drive Netscape out of business” by giving away Internet software and bundling products with its popular Windows operating system. Still, analysts estimate Netscape controls 60-70 percent of the market for business Internet software, a lucrative niche Microsoft has struggled to penetrate.

Netscape expects strong demand and seasonal factors to fuel continued growth in the fourth quarter. The company projects 50 percent year-over-year revenue growth and earnings of 40 to 45 cents per share. “We believe the Internet software market will grow at least 50 percent next year, so Netscape is well positioned for 1996,” Barksdale said. 

While product upgrades and competitive pressures could curb Netscape's momentum, analysts say this quarter's results confirm the company's leadership in a fast-growing market. “Netscape effectively quieted their critics,” Wyman said. “They remain the company to beat in business Internet software.”
