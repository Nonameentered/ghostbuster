Netscape's Lawyer Urges Immediate Action Against Microsoft for Anti-Competitive Behaviour 

In a letter sent to the Department of Justice today, Netscape's legal counsel urged immediate action against Microsoft for anti-competitive practices that threaten Netscape's web browser business. The strongly worded letter alleges that Microsoft has engaged in predatory and exclusionary practices to limit competition from Netscape's Navigator web browser.

Specifically, the letter claims Microsoft has made it very difficult for computer manufacturers to also install Netscape's Navigator browser on new PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system. The letter cites several examples of Microsoft threatening to withhold Windows licenses and marketing support from manufacturers that also bundle Netscape's browser. "These actions go far beyond acceptable competitive behaviour and amount to a systematic campaign to eliminate consumer choice and preserve Microsoft's monopoly in the internet browser market," the letter states.

Netscape's general counsel argues this alleged anti-competitive behaviour violates US antitrust laws and requires the Justice Department to take swift action. "Every day of inaction further entrenches Microsoft's monopoly power and causes irreparable harm to Netscape's business and other current and future competitors. We urge the Department of Justice to immediately open an official investigation into Microsoft's practices and take appropriate measures to restore competition that benefits consumers and the technology industry."

The letter comes at a time of increasing scrutiny on Microsoft's dominant position in the software industry. The European Commission recently opened its own investigation into Microsoft's bundling of its web browser with the Windows operating system. Microsoft has faced criticism that bundling its Internet Explorer browser with Windows gives the browser an unfair advantage in the market and limits consumer choice.   

Microsoft issued a statement denying Netscape's allegations of impropriety and defending its right to add new features to its operating system. Microsoft argues that bundling Internet Explorer with Windows provides added value to consumers and does not prevent other browsers from competing. The brewing legal battle promises to shape the future of competition and innovation on the internet. Both Netscape and Microsoft stand to gain or lose significant control over the emerging online marketplace depending on the outcome.
