NEC Launches Customized Personal Computers for Small Businesses in North America

NEC Corporation today announced the launch of its new line of desktop computers tailored for small businesses in the United States and Canada. Called the NEC Business Mate series, the PCs are customizable and optimized to meet the needs of businesses with 10 to 50 employees across a range of sectors, including retail, food and beverage, professional services, and light manufacturing.

The NEC Business Mate series offers models in four sizes: a compact desktop, a small form factor, a mini tower, and a mid-tower. The computers can be equipped with the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and a solid-state drive for fast boot and response times. The series aims to provide small businesses a flexible and affordable computing solution that helps their workforce be more productive.

“Small businesses are increasingly turning to technology to help streamline their operations, reach new customers, and gain a competitive advantage,” said Joe Smith, President of NEC North America. “The NEC Business Mate series provides small businesses with PCs that are tailored for their unique needs. The desktops offer robust performance, data security and cost-efficiency in an easy-to-implement platform.” 

With a starting price of $500, the NEC Business Mate series aims to balance performance and affordability. The series comes with a standard one-year warranty which can be extended up to five years. As part of the warranty, NEC offers on-site support through its network of certified technicians across the U.S. and Canada to minimize any disruption to the businesses.   

The launch represents NEC’s push to expand offerings for small and medium-sized businesses in North America. “Small and mid-sized businesses are a high-potential market segment for NEC, and we are committed to developing tailored solutions to address their requirements,” said Mike Jones, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at NEC North America.

NEC, which celebrated its 120th anniversary last year, launched its first PC for small businesses in Japan in 1980.  The company is positioning the new NEC Business Mate models as a key product in NEC’s portfolio of tailored solutions for small and mid-sized businesses in North America, which also includes cloud and networking offerings. The NEC Business Mate series is available for purchase through select technology retailers, e-commerce stores and NEC’s network of channel partners.
