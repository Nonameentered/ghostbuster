Investors Wary About 1997 Outlook for Tech Sector Stocks Amid Market Uncertainty   

Investors are expressing cautious optimism about technology stocks in 1997 as the sector continues to feel the effects of a slowing economy and market volatility. While tech companies have fueled much of the stock market's gains in recent years, analysts warn that valuations in the sector may have run ahead of fundamentals. 

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 23% in 1996 but still lagged behind the overall stock market. The S&P 500 index of large companies gained 37% last year. Some of the biggest stars of 1996, like Internet service provider AOL and chip maker Intel, have seen their stocks stall in recent months due to concerns over their high valuations and slowing growth.

There are also worries that corporate technology spending could decline if the overall economy continues to slow. "Tech stocks won't be immune if businesses start tightening their belts," said Megan Horneman, portfolio strategist at Solomon Smith Barney. However, she notes that technology is increasingly crucial for companies to remain competitive and productive, so "spending on tech may be among the last areas to get cut."

Not all technology companies are exposed to swings in corporate spending. Makers of personal computers, software, and Internet services depend primarily on consumer and small business spending, which has remained strong. "Tech categories closely tied to the consumer and Internet continue to see solid growth," said Steven Milunovich, tech analyst at Merrill Lynch. He recommends stocks such as PC makers Dell Computer and Gateway 2000, as well as Internet leaders Yahoo and Amazon.com. 

Some of the biggest opportunities for tech stocks this year may be in fast-growing Internet and telecom sectors. "The Internet economy is still in the early stages of development," said Cindy Motz, co-manager of the Robeco Technology Fund. She expects e-commerce companies in particular will thrive over the next several years. The telecommunications industry is also poised for strong growth thanks to increasing global demand for wireless services, broadband, and infrastructure improvements.

While many risks remain, technology continues to offer some of the most compelling investment opportunities. By focusing on high-quality, large-cap tech companies with reasonable valuations, investors can benefit from the sector's growth while avoiding more speculative corners of the market. With prudent stock selection and a long-term perspective, the technology sector may still shine brightly in 1997 despite current market crosswinds.
