Intuit Trades Unit for CheckFree Stock, Focuses on Electronic Data Exchange Over the Internet 

Intuit Inc. announced today that it has traded its Quicken Loans mortgage business to CheckFree Corp. in exchange for 25 million shares of CheckFree common stock. The deal signals Intuit's strategic shift to focus on electronic business-to-business transactions and bill payment over the Internet.

Intuit, based in Mountain View, Calif., is best known for its Quicken personal finance software and TurboTax tax preparation products. However, the company has been expanding into online services that allow businesses to exchange billing, payment and other financial information electronically over the Internet. The deal with CheckFree, an electronic bill payment and presentment provider, accelerates Intuit's move into this market.

"This strategic combination helps achieve our vision of becoming an all-in-one solution for electronic bill management and payment," said Intuit chairman and CEO Scott Cook.  "Together, we gain scale and reach to achieve our growth objectives."

With the addition of CheckFree's shares, Intuit expands its holdings in a fast-growing company and gains more exposure to the electronic bill presentment and payment market, which is estimated to process over $1 trillion in bills annually by 2004 according to some industry estimates. CheckFree is the leading processor of electronic bill payments in the U.S., handling over 600 million bill payments a year for customers like AT&T, American Express, Merrill Lynch, and Bank of America.

In exchange for its Quicken Loans unit, which has annual revenues of about $200 million, Intuit gains a roughly 10% stake in CheckFree, which has a market capitalization of over $2 billion. Intuit said it will recognize a small gain on the transaction, which is expected to close within 45 days pending regulatory reviews. Intuit and CheckFree have also signed a joint marketing and development agreement to work together on new electronic billing and payment services.

The deal is a sign of consolidation in the electronic billing and payment industry as companies try to gain scale and market share. two of CheckFree's main competitors, Metavante Corp. and Sanchez Computer Associates Inc., announced plans to merge earlier this year. However, Intuit's move is somewhat surprising since it just purchased electronic banking software maker Intell Solutions Inc. in November for $100 million.

By shedding its Quicken Loans mortgage unit, Intuit exits a business that has faced increased competition from online mortgage lenders. The deal allows Intuit to focus on more profitable growth areas that also have significant long-term potential, according to analysts. Intuit shares rose $2.31, or 5%, to $47.63 in heavy Nasdaq trading today on the announcement. CheckFree shares jumped $6.31, or 21%, to $36.56.
