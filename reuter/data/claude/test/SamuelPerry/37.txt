@Home Network Raises $48 Million, Prepared for Selective IPO Timing   

The @Home Network, a leading provider of residential home broadband services, announced today that it has secured $48 million in funding from private investors. The new round of funding comes as @Home continues its rapid expansion across North America and Western Europe, now serving over 4.5 million broadband subscribers.

"This new funding puts @Home in a position of strength for continued growth and innovation," said Tom Jermoluk, CEO of @Home. "As global demand for fast, reliable home internet service increases, @Home is poised to lead the broadband revolution. Our new partners share our vision for connecting homes and lives through the most advanced internet technologies."

The funding round was led by Blue Ridge Capital, with additional investments from previous @Home backers Kleiner Perkins and New Enterprise Associates. This latest round of private funding brings @Home's total raised capital to over $350 million since the company's founding in 1996.  

While enjoying enormous success as a private company, @Home has long been expected to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) to become publicly traded. However, the company has resisted going public during periods of market volatility and instead waited for optimal timing and market conditions. With today's announcement of additional private funding, @Home appears well-positioned to continue its strategy of being selective regarding the timing of an eventual IPO.

"@Home continues to grow at an impressive pace, and going public remains part of our long term strategy," said Jermoluk. "However, we have the luxury of being selective in choosing when to take that step. Today's funding gives us ample resources and flexibility to further expand our leadership in the broadband industry as a private company until the timing is ideal for an IPO."

@Home's broadband internet service is currently available in over 50 major metropolitan areas across the U.S., Canada, UK, France, and Germany. The company is also rapidly expanding into mid-size markets through partnerships with multiple cable and telecom providers in North America and Europe. In recent years, @Home has invested heavily in improving bandwidth and connection
