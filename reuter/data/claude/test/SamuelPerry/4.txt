Silicon Graphics Launches New Line of High-Tech Workstations to Combat Threat from PCs  

Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) announced today the launch of a new line of high-performance computer workstations aimed at regaining market share lost to lower-cost personal computers. The new workstations offer significantly improved 3D graphics and multimedia capabilities at prices up to 50 percent lower than previous SGI models.

“These new workstations deliver unmatched power for digital content creation, scientific research, and other high-end applications at a price competitive with standard PCs,” said SGI CEO Robert Ewald at a press event. “They represent SGI’s commitment to bringing the performance and capabilities of our advanced computing systems to a far wider range of users.”

The workstation line includes three models spanning a range of price and performance levels. The entry-level model starts at under $10,000, while the most advanced system is priced around $50,000. By comparison, SGI’s previous generation of workstations sold for between $20,000 to $100,000. The systems are optimized to run a variety of graphics and multimedia design applications as well as software for computational fields like genomics, physics, and finance.  

SGI was an early pioneer in high-performance computer graphics and dominated the market for advanced workstations during the 1980s and 1990s. However, the emergence of powerful yet inexpensive PCs in the late 1990s enabled by advances in components like Intel’s x86 microprocessors and NVIDIA’s graphics processing units significantly cut into SGI’s market. Many commercial and industrial clients opted to purchase networked PCs and servers instead of more expensive specialized workstations.    

SGI’s sales and share price declined sharply as a result. The company has struggled in recent years with layoffs, executive changes, and a transition to new business models based around software and services in addition to hardware. The launch of the new workstation line, code-named “Eco-HG,” is a bold attempt by SGI to win back customers in its traditional base by delivering a competitive new generation of advanced systems.

Industry analysts reacted positively to the product announcement and pricing details. “This is the most aggressive move SGI has made in years to take on mainstream PCs and reestablish the workstation market,” said Addison Snell of Intersect360 Research. “The combination of high performance and lower cost is just what SGI needs to convince old and new customers to take another look at them.”

However, other analysts cautioned that significant challenges remain, especially given how entrenched PC-based platforms have become for many graphics and technical applications. “SGI has a lot of ground to regain and faces an uphill battle turning around perceptions,” said Jon Peddie of Jon Peddie Research. “But these new systems are very compelling, and if any company has the technological capabilities to disrupt the workstation market, it is SGI.”

With the launch of the new workstation models, code-named “Eco-HG,” Silicon Graphics’ prospects seem to be looking up for the first time in many years. But only time will tell if improved technology and lower costs are enough for SGI to recapture leadership in a market it helped pioneer decades ago.
