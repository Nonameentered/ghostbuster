Investors Anticipate Shake-Out in Crowded Internet Start-Up Market 

The Internet startup market is getting increasingly crowded as hundreds of new companies launch each year seeking to disrupt existing industries or create entirely new categories. Venture capital funding into startups has swelled in recent years, allowing many new companies to get off the ground. However, investors warn that a shake-out is inevitable in such a crowded market.

“There are too many startups chasing the same opportunities and going after the same pools of capital and talent,” said Amy Smith, partner at Valley Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on early-stage tech startups. “A correction is coming, and a lot of these companies won't survive the next economic downturn or tech stock selloff whenever it occurs.”

Startup funding reached a record $136.5 billion worldwide last year across more than 10,000 deals, according to data from PitchBook. So far this year, funding remains at a robust pace, but the total number of deals is starting to level off. Several high-profile startups that went public last year have struggled, with their stock prices falling below IPO levels. The poor performances are giving public market investors pause, especially around capital-intensive startups with unclear paths to profitability.  

“The companies doing really well right now have strong business models, differentiated technology, and a clear vision for generating profits,” said Neil Shah, a technology analyst at Counterpoint Research. “But there are too many ‘me-too’ startups out there mimicking others and relying mostly on hype and venture capital subsidies. They're going to struggle when the competition intensifies and investor enthusiasm fades.”

Some signs of trouble are already showing for certain startups. Several companies have folded in the last few months after being unable to raise additional funding from venture capital firms. Others have had to lay off staff to cut costs as their growth has slowed. Unicorn startups with valuations of $1 billion or more are under pressure to go public, even if their business models are shaky, to provide liquidity to early investors and employees.   

While a wave of failures may hurt some investors and entrepreneurs, most analysts believe an eventual thinning of the startup herd will benefit the tech industry overall. Resources like talent and capital will flow to the strongest companies, allowing them to continue powering innovation. The survivors will face less competition and have more opportunity to dominate their target markets. For venture capital firms, the returns from the companies that endure and gain real traction may more than offset losses from failures, as long as investors have diversified portfolios that can weather the shake-out.  

The key for any startup today is to pursue a unique opportunity, demonstrate real progress in tapping that opportunity, and continually work to strengthen its business model to build something durable that not only survives a downturn but benefits from less competition on the other side, analysts say. Investors will always reward the determined, efficient and innovative companies—especially when a flight to quality occurs.  But in crowded startup markets, simply mimicking others or relying on hype and venture subsidies is unlikely to be a winning long-term strategy.
