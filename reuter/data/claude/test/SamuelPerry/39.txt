Intel Challenges Network Equipment Market with Aggressively Priced Products

Intel Corp shook up the networking equipment market this week with the announcement of a new line of aggressively priced network switches and routers aimed at capturing market share from industry leaders like Cisco Systems Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. 

The new devices are Intel's first standalone networking products and are priced at up to 70 percent less than comparable products from competitors. Intel said its manufacturing scale and technological advantages enabled it to price its products so disruptively while still making a profit.

The move represents a direct challenge to Cisco and Juniper, who together control about 60 percent of the $20 billion global market for networking gear. Intel has set its sights on the fast-growing cloud computing infrastructure segment, betting that massive data center operators will be attracted to the lower upfront costs of its devices.

Intel's push into the networking equipment market is the latest expansion for the world's largest chipmaker beyond its traditional base of microprocessors for PCs and servers. But industry analysts warned Intel may face headwinds as it goes up against established players with strong customer loyalties.

"Intel is a formidable competitor but they are attacking a market with high customer stickiness," said Bob Bauer, an analyst at Forrester Research. "Cisco and Juniper have very entrenched customer bases and the networking market in general is slow to change."

However, Intel may benefit from increasing cost pressures on data center operators and telecommunications companies. The new devices include Intel's chips and are tailored to work with the company's widely used server processors, potentially allowing customers to lower costs by standardizing on Intel technology.  

"There is definitely a desire for lower cost networking equipment, and cost will be a factor for operators evaluating Intel's offering," said Roy Chua, an analyst at AvidThink. "The tight integration with Intel's own platforms may provide additional operational benefits to outweigh the risks of going with a new supplier."

Intel's initial lineup includes variants of Ethernet switches, routers, software products and network interface cards with bandwidth from 1 to 400 gigabits per second. The devices are available now in the United States and Europe, with expansion to other regions planned next year.  

Shares of Intel fell 0.7 percent to $49.24, while Cisco shares dipped 0.6 percent to $51.68 and Juniper shed 2 percent to $23.78.
