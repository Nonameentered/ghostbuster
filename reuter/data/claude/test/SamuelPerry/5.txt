Premier Travel to Launch New Site for Easy Airline Ticket Purchasing  

Premier Travel, a top online travel agency, announced today the launch of a new website focused on simplifying the process of purchasing airline tickets. The site, FlyPremier.com, will open for a sneak peek on October 15th and to the general public on November 1st.

“We have built our brand on helping customers easily find and book complete vacations, but many travelers just need help with flight reservations,” said Premier CEO Elizabeth Martin. “FlyPremier.com is designed specifically for people who know where and when they want to fly but want an easier experience booking the actual tickets.”

The FlyPremier.com site provides a simple, minimal interface to enter desired flight details like departure and arrival cities, dates of travel, and budget. It automatically searches major airlines and hundreds of routes and fare classes in real time to find the best available ticket options that match the shopper’s criteria. Customers can then filter and compare flight listings based on key factors such as price, trip duration, departure/arrival times, airlines, and number of stops.  

The site also allows customers to adjust their search parameters to show more or fewer options and to re-sort the listings to view the cheapest fares first or find the fastest routes. Once a preferred set of flight options is found, customers proceed to a checkout process that aims to complete the purchase in three to five taps or clicks. 

According to Premier’s internal research, flyers frequently get frustrated with the complexity and confusion involved in searching multiple sites and airlines for the right flights at the best prices. The FlyPremier.com website is engineered specifically to minimize the hassle and time required to find and buy air travel.

“We all have better things to do than spending hours browsing travel websites trying to figure out which flights will actually work for our needs and budget,” Martin said.  “FlyPremier.com gets you to your desired flights in minutes so you can go ahead and check that item off your to-do list.”

The new site will cover both domestic and international air travel and will include budget airlines like Sunrise Air and MegaJet in addition to global leaders such as United, Delta and American Airlines. Premier travel will continue to operate its flagship PremierTravel.com site for customers seeking bundled vacation packages beyond just airfare.
