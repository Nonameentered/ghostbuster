Netcom Introduces Multi-Tier Pricing Plan, Ranging from $24.95 to Thousands a Month 

Netcom, the nation's third largest internet service provider, announced today that it is overhauling its pricing plans to offer customers more options at a wider range of price points. The new multi-tiered pricing structure will go into effect for new customers immediately and be rolled out to existing customers over the next month.

The new plans start at $24.95 per month for basic web browsing and email service capped at 1 gigabyte of data. The next level up is $39.95 per month for faster broadband speeds and a data cap of 5 gigabytes. For small businesses and power users, Netcom is offering an unlimited data plan for $99.95 per month with download speeds up to 100 megabits per second. 

At the high end, Netcom is introducing three premium plans for customers with specialized needs. A "Gamer Pro" plan will offer extremely fast 200 megabit per second download speeds with no data caps for $149.95 per month. A "4K Streaming" plan will provide enough bandwidth for streaming high-definition 4K video content at $199.95 per month. And for large businesses, an "Enterprise" plan with dedicated fiber internet connections and 24/7 customer support starts at $2,500 per month and can cost up to $10,000 per month or more based on the business's internet needs.

"We want to give customers more choices and flexibility at a range of price points to suit any budget," said Netcom CEO Brian Jensen in a press conference announcing the new plans. "Whether you just need basic web access or require high-speed dedicated enterprise service, we have an option for you."

The pricing overhaul is seen as an effort by Netcom to compete with fiber internet providers like SpartanNet that have been gaining market share. By offering faster speeds, unlimited data, and premium features for high-end customers, Netcom likely hopes to retain and upgrade its existing customer base as well as attract new monthly subscribers. The success of Netcom's new multi-tiered pricing strategy will become clear over the next year and may determine its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly aggressive internet service market.
