Apple Seeks Outside Investment for Newton Computer Group, Specifically for eMate Product 

Apple Computer announced today that it is seeking outside investment and possibly a spin-off of its Newton handheld computer group, specifically to continue development and production of the eMate 300 educational laptop. The Newton group has struggled in recent years as the personal digital assistant market has failed to take off as quickly as anticipated. However, the recently launched eMate 300, designed for the education market, has seen stronger than expected sales, leading Apple to seek new investment to support the product.

The eMate 300 is a small laptop computer running the Newton operating system, designed for students and teachers. Launched earlier this year, the eMate’s sales now represent over half of the Newton group’s revenue, according to sources within Apple. The product has been praised for its rugged design, long battery life, and software focused on organizing assignments, taking notes, and collaborating. However, the broader Newton PDA line has failed to gain mainstream consumer or business adoption, leading to calls from analysts and investors for Apple to exit the market.  

“While the Newton group as a whole has struggled, the eMate 300 product shows real promise for the education segment,” said Apple CEO Gil Amelio. “We believe with the proper investment and focus, the eMate can become a sustainable business. However, it needs more resources than we can currently provide within Apple.” Apple said it is speaking with several venture capital firms about either investing in the Newton group or possibly spinning it off as an independent company. Apple would maintain a minority stake in the new company but reduce its financial exposure.

This announcement comes at a critical time for Apple, as the company struggles to return to profitability and regain its footing in the desktop computing market. Apple has posted losses over the past two quarters and was forced to eliminate over 2,000 jobs so far this year. The company recently acquired Next Computer in an effort to revitalize its operating system software, but sales of the current Macintosh computer line remain flat. The uncertain future of the Newton group has concerned many in the industry who see it as an innovative product with promising technology that deserves more investment and support from Apple. However, others argue that Apple cannot afford to continue supporting the money-losing venture and needs to refocus its efforts. This new effort to attract outside investment may represent a compromise to address both views.
