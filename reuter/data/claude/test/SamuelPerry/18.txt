Sun Microsystems to Enter Supercomputing Market, Challenging Longtime Leader Cray Research 

Sun Microsystems, the workstation and server powerhouse, announced today that it will enter the high-performance supercomputing market, bringing its first supercomputer model to market next year. The move presents a serious challenge to Cray Research, which has dominated the supercomputing space for decades.

Sun's supercomputer, code-named "Project Blackbox," will use thousands of Sun's own SPARC processing chips to achieve peak performance of over 10 teraflops, putting it among the fastest supercomputers in the world. A teraflop is a measure of a computer's processing speed and is equivalent to one trillion floating point operations per second. For comparison, Cray's newest supercomputer model reaches peak performance of about 13 teraflops.

"We are leveraging our expertise in massively scalable computing, networking, and operating systems to build a supercomputing platform without equal," said John Fowler, executive vice president of systems at Sun. "Project Blackbox will run applications faster and tackle more complex problems than any other supercomputer on the planet."

The supercomputer market has been niche but lucrative, with high-performance systems selling for tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each to government agencies, research institutions, and large companies. Cray has dominated for decades with its specialized supercomputing architectures, but its position is now threatened by major silicon companies applying their high-volume technologies to supercomputing. 

Sun's entry follows IBM's recent foray into supercomputing with its "Summit" and "Sierra" supercomputers, the latter achieving 148 teraflops to claim the top spot in global supercomputer rankings. Technology analysts say that Sun's move was inevitable given its need to find new high-growth markets. "Sun has been looking to expand into new segments that can leverage its significant R&D investments in processors, networking, and software," said Jean Bozman, research vice president at IDC. "HPC is a natural target area for the company."

Sun's supercomputer announcement was greeted with skepticism by some industry observers who questioned whether Sun could achieve strong enough performance for the high-end supercomputing market. However, others said that if Sun is able to achieve its performance goals, it would pose a serious threat to Cray's position. Cray's stock price fell over 7% on the news. The company declined to comment on Sun's announcement.

Sun said initial availability of Project Blackbox is slated for the second half of 2021, with wider availability in 2022. The company did not disclose pricing details but said the supercomputer would be "a fraction of the cost" of comparable systems. If Sun is able to back up its performance claims with a competitive price, it may win over some customers in the supercomputing space, broadening its beachhead into a lucrative new market.
