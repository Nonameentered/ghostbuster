Sun Microsystems to Unveil New Java Initiatives despite Microsoft's Overtones   

Sun Microsystems, the developer of the popular Java programming language, is set to announce several new technologies around Java this week at their annual JavaOne conference in San Francisco. The announcements come despite recent moves by Microsoft, a longtime rival of Sun, to promote its own proprietary platforms over open standards like Java.  

The headline announcement will be the release of Java SE 9, the latest version of Java's Standard Edition platform. Java SE 9 has been in development for over two years and is considered a "milestone" release by Sun that further modernizes the programming language. Key features include modularity to enable smaller components, improved security and scalability, and a switch to a six-month release cadence rather than several years between major versions.   

"Java SE 9 reinforces our commitment to accelerated innovation in Java and continued collaboration with the Java community," said Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java platform group at Sun. "The new features and capabilities will enable developers to build scalable, robust and secure solutions for everything from small embedded systems to enterprise systems."

In addition to the platform release, Sun is announcing new programs to advance Java in key areas like gaming, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The "Java VR Project" will enable high-end virtual reality applications built on Java by providing APIs for headsets, handsets and 3D spatial audio. The "Project Clara" initiative will bring Java to more GPUs for accelerating AI, neural networks, and other data-intensive computation. Sun is also releasing an update to their Java Game Developer Kit to give more options for building desktop and mobile games in Java.

The flurry of announcements at JavaOne stand in contrast with Microsoft's recent moves to spread its own .NET platform as an alternative to Java. Last month, Microsoft acquired Xamarin, a company that helps developers build mobile apps for iOS and Android using .NET, and it announced .NET Core as an open source framework for web and cloud applications. However, Java remains dominant for enterprise and web software, and the strength of these new announcements suggest that Sun is committed to continued innovation and enabling developers well into the future despite the overtones from Microsoft.
