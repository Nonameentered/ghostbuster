Hewlett-Packard to Acquire VeriFone Inc. for $1.18 Billion in Bid to Expand into E-commerce 

HP Inc. announced today that it has reached a deal to acquire VeriFone Inc., a major provider of payment terminals and services, for $1.18 billion in cash. The acquisition is HP's largest in recent years and signals the technology giant's ambition to gain a stronger foothold in the fast-growing electronic payments market.

"VeriFone has built a trusted brand and innovative platform over the last 40 years as a leader in secure commerce enablement," said HP CEO Enrique Lores. "We are excited to combine our strengths to advance the next generation of commerce capabilities for clients around the world."

VeriFone, based in San Jose, Calif., provides point-of-sale terminals, software and services that enable electronic payments among merchants, financial institutions and consumers. The company has more than 3 million payment systems and services in more than 150 countries, processing over 60 billion transactions annually. VeriFone's clients include major retailers, petroleum companies, hotels, taxis and other merchants.

The acquisition will provide HP access to VeriFone's broad network of clients and partners as well as a source of recurring service revenue. The deal also gives HP a platform to offer additional digital commerce tools for businesses such as customer engagement and analytics software and machine learning tools to detect fraud. HP plans to integrate VeriFone into its financial services business unit.

"Being part of HP will enable us to move faster and reach further than ever before," said VeriFone CEO Mike Pulli. "Leveraging HP's scale and resources will enhance our ability to innovate and strengthen our partnerships with clients around the world."   

The deal is expected to close by the end of 2020, pending regulatory approval and VeriFone shareholder approval. HP said it expects minimal disruption to VeriFone's operations during the transition. HP's shares rose 3% on news of the acquisition, which the company said will be accretive to earnings in the first full year following the deal closure.

Analysts said the move positions HP to capitalize on the growth of cashless payments and new fraud-prevention tools as technologies like contactless payments, tap-and-go credit cards and biometrics become more mainstream. At a time when in-store retail sales are rebounding from the impact of the pandemic, tools that enable seamless omnichannel shopping experiences are in high demand. The acquisition also gives HP more diversification beyond its legacy printer and PC businesses.
