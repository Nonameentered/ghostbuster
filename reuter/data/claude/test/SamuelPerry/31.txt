Intel Corp. Stock Falls for Third Consecutive Day on Concerns Over Upcoming Price Cuts 

Shares of Intel Corp. fell for the third consecutive day on Tuesday amid investor concerns that the chipmaker may cut prices to boost sales of its processors.

Intel stock declined 2.6% to $38.47, bringing the stock's drop over the past three sessions to nearly 7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes Intel, rose 0.4% on Tuesday.

The recent weakness comes ahead of Intel's fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to report slightly lower revenue amid intensifying competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Some analysts also anticipate Intel may cut prices for its processors, its key data center and PC products, to gain back market share.

Price cuts could weigh on Intel's profit margins and revenue over the coming quarters, analysts say. “There are concerns about what the magnitude of the price cuts may need to be to remain competitive, and how that may flow through to the financial model,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

Intel and AMD have been locked in an aggressive battle for dominance in the $50 billion semiconductor market. AMD has released new PC and server chips over the past couple of years that outperform comparable Intel processors, according to many industry benchmarks. AMD’s resurgence has allowed it to capture market share from Intel, especially in PCs, analysts say. 

In response, Intel recently released new 10th generation Core PC chips and third-generation Xeon server processors to help boost performance. But some analysts expect Intel may still need to cut prices to match AMD’s offerings. 

“We think Intel likely needs to respond to AMD’s solid product momentum and share gains with price cuts,” said Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard. He estimates Intel may cut PC chip prices by up to 10% and server chip prices by up to 20% over the next 12 months.

Intel executives acknowledge competitive pressures but have said the company will remain focused on improving the performance of its chips rather than cutting prices. However, if Intel continues losing significant market share to AMD, the company may have little choice but to lower prices, analysts say.

Investor anxieties over Intel’s competitive position and pricing have weighed on the stock recently. Intel shares have dropped nearly 17% over the past 12 months through Tuesday’s close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 18% over the same period.
