USWeb Corp Launches Second Phase of Business Plan, Acquires Affiliates in Six US Metropolitan Areas  

U.S. Online Services Inc. (USWeb), a national provider of internet services and online marketing solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, announced today that it has entered the second phase of its strategic growth plan with the acquisition of six regional internet service providers across the U.S. The move significantly expands USWeb's market reach and positions the company to become a leading national player in the business internet services industry.

USWeb acquired affiliates in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, and Miami for an undisclosed sum. The partnerships provide USWeb with access to over 10,000 new business clients and establish the company's presence in each of the six metropolitan areas. "This is a transformational moment for USWeb as we accelerate our national expansion," said USWeb CEO John Smith. "We now have a footprint that spans both coasts and represents over $2 billion in business spending on internet and marketing services. Our mission is to help small and mid-sized companies thrive in the digital age with affordable, customized solutions to connect with customers and grow their business online."  

The six acquired affiliates will continue operating under their existing branding but have access to USWeb's full range of web design, ecommerce, online advertising, and social media marketing services to offer their clients. USWeb also provides 24/7 customer support and value-added services such as free website hosting, email marketing tools, and SEO consulting that the regional providers did not previously offer. 

"Joining forces with USWeb enhances what we can deliver for our clients while still providing the personal, hands-on service they expect from us," said David Lee, President of NetProphet, USWeb's new Los Angeles affiliate. The remaining affiliates expressed similar sentiments about leveraging USWeb's resources and economy of scale to expand their service capabilities.

USWeb will integrate the affiliates onto its operating platform over the next six to twelve months. Additional acquisitions are planned across remaining major cities to build USWeb's national presence and fuel continued double-digit growth. The company's stock rose over 7% on news of the announced expansion strategy. With small businesses comprising about half of the U.S. economy, USWeb appears poised to tap a significant share of the $50 billion-plus internet and marketing services industry geared towards this sector.
