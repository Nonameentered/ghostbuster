Intel Employees Receive $820 Million in Bonuses, Profit Sharing and Retirement Pay for Record Year 1996

Intel Corporation announced yesterday that it will distribute $820 million in annual bonus programs, profit sharing and retirement plan contributions for its U.S. employees. The payout, the largest in the company's history, reflects Intel's record financial performance in 1996.

"Our employees delivered an outstanding year, achieving many milestones in innovation, product development and financial performance," said Intel CEO Craig Barrett. "These awards recognize and reward their significant contributions to our success in 1996."

Intel's net income rose 63 percent in 1996 to $3.1 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $1.9 billion or $3.54 per share in 1995. Revenue for the year was $25.1 billion, an increase of 39 percent from 1995 revenue of $18.1 billion. 

The company attributed its strong performance to robust sales of its Pentium and Pentium Pro processors, as well as its 200 series and Express chipsets. Newly introduced products like the Pentium II and Pentium Pro also contributed to growth. The company expects continued momentum from these and other new products in 1997.

Under Intel's annual bonus and profit sharing plans, the majority of awards are calculated as a percentage of employees' eligible compensation based on Intel's financial performance. In 1996, Intel exceeded the maximum goals set for both net income growth and revenue growth under these plans.

As a result, profit sharing awards for most eligible employees amounted to 14 weeks of pay, while management and executive bonus awards equaled 24 weeks of pay. Employees also received Intel stock in their retirement plans, with a total value of $86 million for 1996. Over the last five years, Intel has distributed more than $2.7 billion to its employees through annual bonus, profit sharing and retirement plans.

"Our employees have built a great technology company through their creativity, hard work and commitment to excellence," Barrett said. "These well-deserved awards reflect the world-class contributions of our people which enable us to achieve exceptional results."

With innovation and operational excellence, Intel's employees are poised to continue the company's success in 1997 and maintain its position as the world's largest semiconductor company. The record payout announces another banner year for this Silicon Valley stalwart and its hardworking staff.
