Intel Corp. Stock Falls for Third Straight Day Amid Concerns over Price Cuts and First-Quarter Results

Shares of Intel Corp. declined for the third consecutive trading day amid investor concerns over price cuts and slowing sales growth. Intel stock fell 2.3% to $48.94 today, bringing its three-day drop to nearly 5%.

The declines came after Intel announced plans to cut prices of mainstream desktop computer processors by up to 15% in response to competitive pressures. The price cuts are aimed at retaining market share after rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. launched new chips for desktop and laptop computers. However, the move is expected to weigh on Intel's revenue and profit margins going forward.

Intel is also facing concerns about first-quarter financial results scheduled for release next month. Analysts forecast Intel's earnings will decline from a year earlier on flat revenue growth. The first quarter is typically Intel's slowest period, but this year's results may be particularly soft due to the slowing PC market and trade tensions between the U.S. and China. China is a major market for Intel's chips.

The weak forecast adds to recent signs that Intel's dominance of the semiconductor industry is under threat. Intel has struggled with delays in developing its most advanced chips, allowing AMD and other rivals to gain ground. Nvidia Corp. has also expanded beyond graphics chips into markets Intel has targeted for growth like data centers, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. 

In a note to clients today, Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya wrote "Intel will likely have to sacrifice its best-in-class margins to defend its market share and growth." Arya lowered his price target for Intel stock to $50 from $60 but maintained a "Buy" rating.

Other analysts similarly remain cautiously optimistic Intel can reaccelerate growth. Much depends on improving its chip technology roadmap and capitalizing on new markets like 5G wireless networks and self-driving cars.
