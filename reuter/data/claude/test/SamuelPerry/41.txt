Hewlett-Packard Acquires VeriFone for $1.18 Billion to Bolster Electronic Commerce Position

Hewlett-Packard announced today that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire VeriFone Holdings, Inc., a leader in secure electronic payment technologies, in a cash deal worth approximately $1.18 billion. The acquisition is intended to bolster HP's position in electronic payments and commerce as the worldwide shift to electronic transactions accelerates. 

VeriFone provides systems and services for processing electronic payments at point of sale, including payment terminals, security and encryption software, and related services. The company has over 20 million electronic payment systems in more than 150 countries. The acquisition will allow HP to combine VeriFone's electronic payment expertise with HP's portfolio of retail solutions, including point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platforms, and business service management software.

"VeriFone has established itself as a leader in point-of-sale electronic payments, and HP's global scale and reach can help extend VeriFone's solutions into new markets," said Dion Weisler, CEO of HP Inc. "At the same time, VeriFone's technology will give HP new capabilities in a growing category where security and frictionless transactions are increasingly important."  

Paul Galant, CEO of VeriFone, said, "Joining forces with HP enhances our platform, opens new opportunities for our employees, and most importantly, benefits our clients and partners by combining our world-class electronic payments solutions with HP's industry leadership and global scale." 

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and approval by VeriFone stockholders. HP expects the acquisition to be completed within the next 12 months. If approved, VeriFone will become a business unit within HP's Printing and Personal Systems division. HP said it does not expect the acquisition to materially impact fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS.  

The acquisition continues HP's strategy of focusing on key growth markets in enterprise services, mobility, and payments technology as the company continues to pivot away from stagnating PC and printer markets. The payment processing sector in particular represents an estimated $21 trillion opportunity as cash and checks steadily decline in use, according to McKinsey & Company. By acquiring VeriFone, HP may be poised to capitalize on the digital transformation of retail and capture a bigger share of the growing electronic payments industry.
