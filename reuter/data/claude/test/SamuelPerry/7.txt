Intel Employees Receive $820 Million in Bonuses, Profit Sharing, and Retirement Pay for Record Year 

Intel announced today that it is distributing a record $820 million in employee bonuses and profit-sharing this year, along with making enhanced contributions to employee retirement accounts. The payments come after a blockbuster 2018 for the world's largest chipmaker that saw revenue and profit surge to all-time highs.

Intel reported a revenue of $71.4 billion last year, up 12% from 2017. Net income also rose 11% to $21.1 billion in 2018. The growth was spurred by strong demand for Intel's chips from data center customers as cloud computing expands and 5G wireless networks are built out. PC sales also picked up last year, lifting the company's largest division.

"2018 was a record year for Intel thanks to 40 years of boundary-pushing innovation that addressed the world's insatiable appetite for data," said Bob Swan, Intel's CEO. "As a result of strong company performance, Intel employees earned record profit sharing bonuses and retirement contributions."

As part of the record payments, about 53,000 Intel employees will receive an average bonus of $15,700. The bonus pool increased 15% compared to 2017. Employees who have been with Intel the longest will receive the highest bonus amounts. Profit-sharing payments are also distributed based on employees' base salaries and how long they have worked at Intel. 

On top of the bonuses, Intel is adding an extra $1 billion contribution to employees' 401(k) retirement plans this year. Intel typically matches 50 to 75% of employees' contributions to the plans. The additional $1 billion will increase Intel's match for 2018 to about 82% on average, the highest level since the program started in the 1970s.

The hefty employee payments follow what has become an annual tradition at Intel. When the company is performing strongly and generating solid profits, employees share in the success through generous bonus and retirement contributions. The payments also help Intel attract and retain top talent in the competitive field of chip engineering.

Intel's record year and reward for employees stand in contrast with some other technology giants who have recently cut employee benefits or issued warnings about slowing growth. Intel's sales and profits are expanding at a faster rate, giving the company more room to lavish extra cash and perks on its workforce. The boost in pay and retirement benefits announced today should only help to further boost morale during the company's current hot streak.
