Microsoft to Triple Research Staff after Successful Contributions to Product Development 

Microsoft announced today that it will be tripling the size of its research division over the next three years. The move comes after several recent innovations developed by Microsoft Research have made significant contributions to key Microsoft products. 

Microsoft Research is the scientific research arm of Microsoft, founded in 1991. It employs over 1,000 researchers, scientists, and engineers across 23 research labs around the globe. The group focuses on advancing computing and developing new technologies in fields like AI, healthcare, productivity, and education to be incorporated into Microsoft products.

Recently, Microsoft Research innovations have been critical to updates in several Microsoft offerings. A new AI model developed by Microsoft Research was integrated into Excel, allowing users to automatically summarize text, suggest formulas, and reword sentences. Teams for remote collaboration, a major part of Microsoft's future of work strategy, was enhanced using a system created by researchers to analyze how people communicate and work together. And a software toolkit developed by Microsoft Research has been used internally to build simulations that help predict how teams work.

"Microsoft Research has been integral to Microsoft's mission of empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more," said CEO Satya Nadella in an email to employees. "By significantly expanding our research organization, we are investing in world-class scientists and engineers to pursue the future of computing and develop technologies that will support our customers, partners, and communities for generations to come."

Over the next three years, Microsoft will hire over 2,000 additional researchers, engineers, and scientists to join Microsoft Research in areas like AI, machine learning, and cloud computing. The expansion will include new research centers in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The growth of Microsoft Research highlights the increasing importance of advanced research capabilities for large technology companies seeking cutting-edge innovations to build into their products and services. With this move, Microsoft is priming its pipeline for new developments to keep it on the technology frontier.
