Live Picture Launches First Consumer Photo Imaging Product "LivePix" 

Live Picture, a Silicon Valley startup company, today launched LivePix, a breakthrough new digital photo imaging system for consumers. LivePix combines an easy-to-use digital camera with a powerful image enhancement engine, wireless connectivity, and cloud storage to make capturing and sharing high-quality photos an effortless experience for anyone.

The LivePix digital camera features a 28-megapixel sensor to capture vivid images with a wide range of tones and details. Photos are automatically enhanced using Live Picture's AI-based image processing technology as soon as the shutter button is pressed. The LivePix engine applies adjustments to lighting, color, and sharpness to optimize each photo. Images are then instantly uploaded via Wi-Fi to the LivePix cloud, providing unlimited storage for subscribers.  

"We saw that many mainstream consumers were frustrated with the complexity of getting great photos from a digital camera," said Live Picture founder and CEO Jasmine Wong. "Our vision with LivePix was to create an end-to-end solution that combines the image quality of a high-end DSLR with the simplicity of a smartphone camera. The built-in enhancements powered by our image processing engine mean you get professional-looking photos direct from the camera with zero editing required."

LivePix offers two subscription plans: LivePix Standard for $9.95 per month with basic enhancements and unlimited photo storage, and LivePix Plus for $19.95 per month with additional premium enhancements including skin smoothing, teeth whitening, and more. Subscribers can access their photos from the LivePix mobile app on iOS and Android, the LivePix desktop app for Mac and Windows PCs, and on LivePix.com. Photos can easily be shared on social networks or printed on LivePix's photo merchandising products including photo books, calendars, and canvas prints.
