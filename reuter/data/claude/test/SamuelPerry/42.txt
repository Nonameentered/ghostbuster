Hewlett-Packard to Acquire VeriFone for $1.18 Billion in Bid to Enter E-Commerce Market

Hewlett-Packard Co. announced today that it has agreed to acquire VeriFone, a leading provider of payment technology for merchants, in a deal valued at $1.18 billion. The acquisition is HP's largest since it split into two companies in 2015 and highlights the company's ambitions to become a bigger player in the growing e-commerce market. 

VeriFone makes point-of-sale systems for processing credit and debit cards, mobile payments, and other electronic payment methods. HP believes VeriFone's expertise and relationships with merchants will help HP expand into new markets in the retail sector and strengthen its e-commerce offerings. Retailers of all sizes are seeking new technologies to make the checkout process more efficient and improve the overall shopping experience for customers.

"VeriFone is a strategic and transformative acquisition for HP that positions us as a leader in the massively growing global payments industry," said Dion Weisler, president and CEO of HP. “As consumers and businesses increasingly engage in daily transactions electronically, the addition of VeriFone to the HP family reinforces our vision to create the world's most exciting and relevant technologies for a rapidly transforming world.”

The deal comes at a time of rapid change in the payments industry driven by new technologies like contactless payments, digital wallets, and faster payment networks. Retailers and payments companies are witnessing a surge in transactions via mobile devices, wearables, and other connected technologies. According to industry estimates, e-commerce is growing three times faster than traditional retail.

Under the terms of the agreement, VeriFone will become a subsidiary of HP. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction. Pending regulatory approval, the deal is expected to close before the end of 2017. The company did not reveal specifics of how VeriFone and HP technologies and services might be integrated following the merger.

Paul Galant, CEO of Verifone, said in a press release, "This is an exceptional opportunity for VeriFone to accelerate its growth and impact as part of the HP family. Our unmatched global scale, mobile enablement capabilities, and innovation roadmap, combined with HP's leading brand, relationships and global reach, positions us well for the future."
