Clinton Adviser: Internet E-Commerce Could Be World's Largest Trade Category Within a Decade

A top economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton predicts that Internet-based electronic commerce could become the largest trade category across the world within the next 10 years. In an interview yesterday, Gene Sperling, who served as director of the National Economic Council under Clinton, said "we are at the very early stages of a technological revolution that could make e-commerce the backbone of global trade."

Sperling pointed to several factors driving the explosive growth of e-commerce, including increased Internet access in developing countries, the spread of mobile Internet-enabled devices, and a younger digitally-connected generation attaining more purchasing power. "There are more than 3 billion Internet users today, and that number is growing every day. With smartphones and mobile data networks spreading into new parts of the world, we'll soon see billions more people connected to the global marketplace with the swipe of a finger."

The growth of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba is an indicator of the huge potential for Internet-based trade. Alibaba sold over $25 billion in goods on a single day last year on China's "Singles Day," demonstrating the massive volume e-commerce platforms can generate from even a fraction of the world's consumers. "E-commerce makes it possible for small businesses and entrepreneurs anywhere in the world to sell their goods and reach customers they never could have reached before," said Sperling. 

However, e-commerce also faces significant barriers to becoming the world's largest trade category. Infrastructure challenges like lack of broadband access, limited digital payment systems, and underdeveloped delivery networks in developing countries will need to be addressed. E-commerce may also face regulatory hurdles as governments grapple with how to tax digital transactions that can span borders.  Concerns over data privacy and security could also dampen consumer enthusiasm for e-commerce if not properly addressed.

Still, if current trends continue, e-commerce could surpass traditional trade in goods like oil and gas to become the largest trade category globally within the next 10 years.  Sperling suggested policymakers should make enabling e-commerce growth a priority. "Governments around the world would be wise to invest in infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that promote e-commerce, reduce barriers for businesses to compete online, and protect consumers. The payoff could be huge gains in economic opportunity and global trade links that we can barely imagine today." Overall, while still optimistic, Sperling urged realism about the significant challenges ahead in fulfilling e-commerce's promise.
