Apple Looks for Investors for Struggling Newton Computer Unit  

Apple Inc., the maker of the popular Macintosh line of computers, is looking for outside investors to buy a stake in the company's struggling Newton handheld computer division, according to three people with knowledge of the plans.  

The company is seeking investors to acquire at least 20% and up to 49% of the Newton unit, which has lagged far behind its initial sales expectations since the Newton MessagePad personal digital assistants were launched in 1993, the people said. Newton has been a drain on Apple's finances for years.

Apple has had discussions with potential investors including Nokia, Motorola, and cellular companies, as well as venture capital firms, an Apple executive confirmed. The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to elaborate on the talks or say if any deals were imminent. Officials from Nokia, Motorola, and several venture firms also declined to comment.

The news comes as Apple continues its attempt at a comeback under Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who returned to the helm in 1996 when Apple acquired his company, Next. While Apple has had some successes with its colorful iMac computers and iBook laptops, the company still relies heavily on its Mac computer line, which has been losing market share for years.

With Apple's finances still on shaky ground, reducing or eliminating Newton's losses could help reassure investors about the company's future, analysts said. However, any deal may be tricky given Newton's lack of success so far. Newton generates about $40 million in annual revenue but has not posted a profit since its launch seven years ago. 

"This has been a disastrous project for Apple, so unloading part of it would be a big relief," said Tim Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies Inc. "But at this point the technology is quite dated, and I don't know who would want to buy in." Even so, Mr. Bajarin said some cellular carriers or handset makers may see potential in gaining access to Newton's technology and customer base, however small.

Newton's chief selling point was its ability to recognize handwriting and translate it into digital text, but its high prices, bulkiness, and unreliable handwriting recognition were turnoffs for many potential customers. Apple's focus on the technology's advanced features rather than ease of use also contributed to Newton's downfall, said Ben Bajarin of the research firm Creative Strategies, Tim Bajarin's son and also an analyst following Apple. 

With the MessagePad 2100 model priced at $1,500, Newton devices were too expensive for average consumers and lacked functionality for most business users. "Price, usability, and irrelevant features for the market were all problems," the younger Mr. Bajarin said. He noted, though, that the technology has improved substantially and may now be ready for prime time at the right price.
