E*Trade CEO Reports Consistent 8-10% Monthly Growth in Subscribers & Record Stock High Amid Integration with Microsoft

E*Trade Financial, a pioneer in online trading for self-directed investors in the U.S., announced another strong quarter of growth fueled in part by its recent strategic partnership with Microsoft. Speaking on the company's Q3 earnings call, CEO Rodger Riney reported E*Trade added between 8 to 10% more new subscriber accounts each month over the last quarter, continuing a consistent growth trend. The company also recorded an all-time high stock price of $73.21 earlier this week. 

"Our integration with Microsoft Office 365 and the Microsoft 365 ecosystem is resonating with investors and contributing to strong subscriber and engagement growth,” Riney said. E*Trade and Microsoft announced a collaboration in July to offer an integrated experience between E*Trade and Microsoft 365 to help investors seamlessly manage their finances and investments. The partnership provides E*Trade customers with single sign-on capabilities, enhanced security, and integrated services between platforms.

CFO Chad Turner highlighted improving metrics across the board in the quarter, including double-digit growth for net new brokerage accounts, trades, and total client assets compared to a year ago. “Our third-quarter results demonstrate the momentum in our business and the operating leverage as we scale,” Turner said. “We remain focused on enhancing the client experience, expanding our reach and continuing to drive growth and profitability.”

The company reported net income of $290 million, or $1.13 per diluted share. Revenue also beat Wall Street estimates, rising 22% to $629 million compared to the same quarter last year. E*Trade raised its full-year 2019 outlook on the results. The stock climbed over 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release.
