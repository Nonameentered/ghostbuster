Sun Microsystems Unveils High-End Computer Servers That Can Compete with Mainframes 

Sun Microsystems Inc. unveiled its latest high-powered computer servers today that the company says can match the performance of IBM's largest mainframe computers at a fraction of the cost.

The new servers, called the Enterprise 10000 series, are Sun's most powerful machines and are designed to handle intensive computing tasks like running databases, applications, and websites for large companies and organizations. The systems can be grouped together into clusters to provide even more computing horsepower.

"These new servers demonstrate Sun's leadership in high-performance and high-availability computing," said John Fowler, executive vice president of software at Sun. "They provide unmatched capabilities at disruptive prices compared to legacy mainframe systems."

The servers start at $500,000 and can exceed $5 million when fully loaded with components. While still pricey, Sun executives say the systems cost 50 to 90 percent less than comparable IBM mainframes.IBM disputed those cost claims, however, contending that its mainframes often remain less expensive when factoring in software and maintenance costs.

The new Sun servers aim to win over corporations and governments that now rely on mainframes for critical applications by promising lower costs, modern innovation, and more open and flexible systems. But shifting away from mainframes may be difficult for many organizations given the massive investments they have made in mainframe hardware, software, and personnel.  

The high-end server market is a key battleground for Sun and IBM. Sun dominated the market for high-powered Unix servers in the 1990s but started losing ground to IBM in the last decade. The new Enterprise 10000 series is Sun's attempt to regain its momentum and take customers from IBM's mainframe and Power server lines.

The servers run on Sun's own Sparc microprocessors and Solaris operating system. Sun said the new systems can achieve high performance and reliability partly through "fabric computing," which provides a fast interconnect to link multiple Sparc servers together. The servers also offer built-in virtualization technology that can help maximize resource utilization.

Sun said its Enterprise 10000 systems are currently in production at select customer sites and will be generally available worldwide starting next month. The company hopes the new servers, along with its recent $7.4 billion acquisition of storage maker StorageTek, will help fuel a rebound after a prolonged slump in sales and earnings. Sun's shares rose 2 percent today following the product announcement.
