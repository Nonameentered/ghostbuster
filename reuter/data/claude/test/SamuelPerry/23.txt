HP Unveils New PhotoSmart Line for Consumer Digital Photography Enthusiasts

HP Inc. announced today the launch of its new PhotoSmart digital camera line aimed at photography hobbyists and enthusiasts. The PhotoSmart Z Series includes three new high-performance models with premium features to enable creative photo-taking experiences.

The flagship model is the PhotoSmart Z9, featuring HP’s largest digital camera display at 4.5 inches, dual shutter buttons for ambidextrous use, and the ability to shoot photos in RAW file format. It has a 20.2-megapixel sensor for high-quality photo enlargements up to 24 x 36 inches. The Z9 offers an innovative tilt touchscreen that flips up for easy self-portraits, then tilts down for overhead shots. 

For those seeking an affordable advanced camera, the PhotoSmart Z5 is an ideal option with a 16.1-megapixel sensor and 5x optical zoom. It produces vibrant photos and video with a bright F2.4 maximum aperture. The Z5 features a 2.7-inch tilt touchscreen and built-in photo filters for adding creative effects before snapping the shot.

Rounding out the series is the compact PhotoSmart Z3, which slides easily into your pocket but still delivers crisp 16.1-megapixel images and 5x zoom. A 2.7-inch LCD makes it easy to frame shots and review photos. For expanding creativity, the Z3 offers an array of in-camera photo effects to apply artistic touches to your pictures.

“Our new PhotoSmart Z line gives photography enthusiasts a range of premium yet affordable cameras to satisfy their creative passion,” said Jim Nottingham, General Manager of HP’s Consumer Personal Systems business. “These Z cameras were designed for easy self-expression, allowing you to capture and share memorable moments in stunning quality.”

The HP PhotoSmart Z9 will be available next month for $399, the PhotoSmart Z5 for $249, and the PhotoSmart Z3 for $199. Each includes HP Photo Creations software for managing, editing and sharing your photos. Experience the new PhotoSmart Z Series cameras at select retailers worldwide or online at the HP website.
