Mercury Finance Co.’s Agreement to Buy Consumer Finance Business Falls Apart After Accounting Fraud Revealed

Mercury Finance Co. announced today that its $1.2 billion agreement to acquire Nationwide Consumer Finance has fallen apart after Mercury discovered accounting fraud at Nationwide during the due diligence process. Mercury uncovered fabricated revenue and profit figures at Nationwide’s home equity and personal loan divisions that inflated the company’s performance and value.

Mercury signed the agreement to purchase Nationwide two months ago, touting the opportunity to expand its consumer lending business. However, Mercury grew suspicious of Nationwide’s financial reports in recent weeks and launched an in-depth review. The investigation found that Nationwide falsified revenue from certain products, created fake personal and home equity loans, and doctored delinquency rates to make its portfolio appear healthier. In total, Mercury estimates that Nationwide overstated its revenue by 30% and profits by 50% over the last two years.

“This is extremely disappointing and a major failure of due diligence on our part,” said John Thompson, CEO of Mercury Finance. “We were excited by the prospect to gain new customers and products through this acquisition. Unfortunately, we cannot in good conscience move forward with a deal when we have uncovered fraudulent practices that call into question the very foundations of this business.” 

Mercury has reported the accounting fraud to regulators and law enforcement and said it would fully cooperate with any resulting investigations into Nationwide. Nationwide admitted to the accounting manipulations when confronted with Mercury's findings but claimed they were directed by former executives who left the company in the last year. Current Nationwide management issued a statement apologizing to Mercury, investors, and customers and said they have halted improper accounting tactics that were instituted under previous leadership.

The collapse of the deal is a blow to Mercury, which will not recover the money and time it invested pursuing the acquisition. However, terminating the agreement also allows Mercury to avoid purchasing a consumer finance company with deep accounting and management issues. News of Mercury discovering fraud at Nationwide sent Nationwide’s shares plunging by over 40% as investors absorbed the revelations of unreliable financial reporting. The stock slide wiped out over $800 million of market value, reflecting the severe loss of investor trust in Nationwide and its management team.  

Mercury said it will renew its search for acquisition targets, but plans to apply lessons learned from this failed deal, including more rigorous accounting due diligence before agreeing to future purchases. Investors applauded Mercury for catching the fraud before completing the merger, but also expressed concern about how the company got so far into the process without detecting major issues. Mercury’s stock dipped 3% on the news, as the market remained unsure whether to view the development as a victory or defeat for the company. For Nationwide, the path to rebuilding trust and shareholder value will likely be long and difficult.
