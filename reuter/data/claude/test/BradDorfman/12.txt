TCF Financial Corp. Set to Enter Equipment Leasing with $326 Million Acquisition

TCF Financial Corp., a Midwest-based bank holding company, announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Information Leasing Co., a privately held transportation and industrial equipment leasing company, for $326 million in an all-cash transaction. Headquartered in Plano, Texas, Information Leasing has locations in 19 states and Canada and is expected to generate approximately $70 million in revenue in 2019. 

The acquisition represents TCF's first major foray into the equipment leasing sector and signifies the bank's strategic push to diversify its portfolio beyond traditional retail and commercial banking. TCF anticipates the deal will be accretive to its 2020 earnings while also providing an opportunity to expand its client relationships.

"We're excited to enter the equipment finance market with the acquisition of a high-quality company like Information Leasing," said Craig Dahl, Chief Executive Officer of TCF Financial Corporation and TCF Bank. "This acquisition complements our existing bank by allowing us to broaden and deepen client relationships with additional lending products."

Information Leasing will continue to operate under its current name and brand after the transaction closes, which is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2020, pending customary closing conditions. The company will retain its management team and staff, while operating as a subsidiary of TCF Equipment Finance, a division of TCF National Bank.

Founded in 1976, Information Leasing offers financing options for clients acquiring assets such as heavy duty trucks, trailers, construction and waste-related equipment. TCF expects these additional capabilities will benefit many of its commercial banking clients looking to finance significant equipment purchases. The deal also reflects the ongoing consolidation within the equipment leasing sector, an industry which continues to be an attractive area for growth for many regional and national banks.

Overall, the acquisition signals TCF's ambitions to tap into new areas of business that complement its traditional banking products. By acquiring an established firm like Information Leasing, TCF is well positioned to gain market share in equipment finance and benefit from an expanded suite of services for its institutional and corporate clients.  With $26 billion in assets, TCF's large capital base will provide Information Leasing with resources to accelerate its growth trajectory and strengthen its competitive position in the leasing market.
