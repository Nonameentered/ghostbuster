Banking Industry Braces for More Mergers and Acquisitions  

The banking industry is preparing for another wave of mergers and acquisitions as technological changes and competitive pressures reshape the landscape. According to analysts, midsize and regional banks in the US are likely targets for acquisition by larger rivals looking to expand into new markets and gain scale.

"The banking industry remains overbanked, with too many institutions chasing too few customers," said Joseph Mason, professor of finance at Louisiana State University. "Smaller banks are struggling with high costs of compliance and technology investments. Many are not able to keep up, making them prime targets for acquisition."

Some of the banks seen as potential acquisition targets include SunTrust Banks, Regions Financial Corp, and Citizens Financial Group. Larger banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are looking to grow their branch networks and regional presences. Acquiring an established regional bank is an easy way to gain new customers, branches, and accounts.  

"It's a win-win for the acquiring banks and the targets," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. "The large banks get expansion on the cheap, while the small banks get an exit and their shareholders get a good premium." 

The pace of consolidation in the banking industry has been steady over the past few decades. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, there were over 18,000 commercial banks in the US in 1980. Today there are fewer than 5,000. Deregulation in the 1990s accelerated mergers and acquisitions as restrictions on interstate banking were lifted. The financial crisis of 2008 also led to more consolidation as the industry restructured.  

While the Trump administration has pledged to curb excessive regulation of financial institutions, analysts expect the trend toward greater scale and consolidation to continue. Technological innovations are also reshaping the banking industry, as more customers embrace online and mobile banking options. Smaller community banks are struggling to keep up with bigger rivals' investments in digital platforms and cybersecurity.

"The regulatory and technological challenges mean that scale is increasingly critical in banking," said Mason. "That imperative for scale will continue to drive more mergers and acquisitions, especially among midsize and smaller banks." For the banking industry, bigger appears to be better as both challenges and opportunities arise.
