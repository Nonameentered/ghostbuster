Harnischfeger makes $19 per share tender offer for Giddings & Lewis, analysts predict it may be the best offer

Harnischfeger Industries Inc. announced today that it has launched a $19 per share tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of machine tool maker Giddings & Lewis Inc. The tender offer amounts to a total value of $113 million for Giddings & Lewis. The offer represents a 53% premium over Giddings & Lewis's share price before rumors of the acquisition surfaced last month.

Harnischfeger, a machinery and equipment manufacturer based in Beloit, Wisconsin, said the deal would strengthen its machine tool segment. Robert Harnischfeger Jr., the company's CEO, said in a statement that Giddings & Lewis is a venerable brand name with great engineering talent and intellectual property. “This acquisition will expand our manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets and broaden our product portfolio and customer base,” he said.  

Giddings & Lewis's board of directors said it will review Harnischfeger's offer in consultation with its financial and legal advisors and make recommendations to shareholders within 10 days. The company's stock jumped 47% today to $18.40 a share following the announcement, indicating investors anticipate a higher offer may be forthcoming. Analysts say Harnischfeger's bid is a good start but likely needs to be bumped up to at least $21 per share to be persuasive for Giddings & Lewis shareholders.

Richard Henderson, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note that while Harnischfeger's $19 bid appears generous at first glance, Giddings & Lewis's long-term earnings potential and valuableMilwaukee-area real estate holdings likely make the company worth more than $113 million. "This is a high-quality, niche machine tool company with leading market shares that deserve a premium valuation," Henderson said. He predicted bidding for Giddings & Lewis could reach $25 per share.

Yet other analysts argue $19 per share may be the best offer shareholders can expect in the current economic environment. Machine tool stocks have declined 25% over the past year amid a cyclical downturn. "Even with a strongly rebounding economy, $21 or $22 per share seems a stretch for Giddings & Lewis," said Polly Holton, an analyst with Bear Stearns. Given tightening in the credit markets, she believes Harnischfeger or another bidder may have trouble justifying a higher price. 

In its statement today, Harnischfeger said it intends to finance the Giddings & Lewis deal using a combination of internal cash flow and underwritten bank credit facilities. The company expects the acquisition to add to earnings immediately if the bid is successful. Harnischfeger's shares fell 2.3% today as investors weighed the costs and benefits of the proposed acquisition.
