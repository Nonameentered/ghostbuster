FBI Searches Troubled Mercury Finance Co. Headquarters Following Leadership Change 

The FBI conducted a search of the headquarters of Mercury Finance Co., a troubled subprime auto lender, one day after the company announced the abrupt departure of its chief executive and finance chief. Investigators hauled away documents and records from the company's offices in Lake Forest, Illinois, signaling a new phase in the scrutiny of a company that collapsed spectacularly amid revelations of fraudulent conduct, uncontrolled growth, and questionable practices.

Mercury announced CEO Brian Neary and CFO James Christopher had “left the company effective immediately” on Tuesday as part of a management shake-up. The stunning announcement came as regulators and creditors circle the company, which has failed to file audited financial results for two years and defaulted on $2.5 billion in debt obligations. The management departures, according to Mercury’s statement, were made as part of “ongoing restructuring efforts to stabilize the company.”

The FBI search on Wednesday follows years of scrutiny into Mercury’s lending and accounting practices. Regulators and creditors have raised concerns about loose underwriting, overstated asset values, and questionable revenue recognition that may have led to an improper inflation of the company’s share price and ability to borrow funds from investors during a period of risky growth. The company’s failure sent ripple effects through the markets and rattled investor confidence when it first came to light in early 2019. 

Mercury grew aggressively during the 2010s by issuing risky auto loans to subprime borrowers, packaging the loans into bonds sold to investors, and then repeating the cycle. The company increased origination volumes by over 500% between 2012 and 2018, becoming one of the largest subprime auto lenders in the U.S. But loan losses mounted, and creditors accused Mercury of covering them up through problematic accounting maneuvers in 2018 filings that were later withdrawn.

The FBI search is the strongest signal yet that federal authorities may seek criminal charges against executives at the company. Investigators were seen leaving Mercury’s headquarters with boxes of documents and other materials that could shed light on exactly what transpired as the company unraveled. Several states have also launched investigations into the company's practices, signaling a broad effort to unravel its collapse that could take years to resolve fully.

Mercury’s failure dealt major losses to investment funds and highlighted risks in the broader subprime auto market where loose underwriting and predatory practices remain ongoing concerns. The company had emerged as an early warning of trouble in subprime auto lending that may portend broader issues, according to analysts and consumer advocates monitoring the space. How regulators and the company's creditors proceed remains unclear, but the FBI's search indicates authorities want to hold individuals, not just the corporate entity, responsible for the damage wrought. Mercury's day of reckoning, after years of trouble, may just be beginning.
