Sears to Spend $500 Million in Revamp of Tire and Battery Stores, Plans to Add 100 New Stores Annually for Five Years

Sears Holdings Corp. announced plans Tuesday to invest $500 million to revamp its Sears Auto Centers over the next several years. The struggling retailer aims to remodel existing auto service locations and open 100 new stores annually for the next five years across the United States. 

The new Sears Auto Centers will have sleek, modern designs and provide a more comprehensive set of services beyond just tires and batteries. Additional offerings will include oil changes, brake repairs, alignment services, and state vehicle inspections. The remodeled and new stores will also have flexible space to test out new services that customers demand like electric vehicle charging.

“Sears has been a trusted brand for auto service for over 100 years, and we see significant opportunity to grow this business by providing customers with a modern, full-service experience,” said Peter Boutros, Chief Brand Officer of Sears Holdings. 

The strategy comes as Sears seeks to generate new growth and strengthen its core retail units like auto services. The company has closed hundreds of stores in recent years and sold off major assets as it struggled with years of declining sales and massive losses. Sales at Sears stores open at least a year have fallen more than 50 percent since 2014.

The initial $500 million investment will fund the first wave of 100 new auto stores and remodels to existing stores. Sears plans to spend a total of $2.5 billion over the next five years to reach 500 new and remodeled locations by 2024. The new stores are expected to provide a revenue boost through offering higher-cost services.
 
Sears has faced significant competition in auto services from national chains like Jiffy Lube, Meineke Car Care Centers, as well as dealerships and local repair shops. However, Sears believes it still has key advantages with its established brand name and integration with its Shop Your Way loyalty program and credit card. The question remains whether a refreshed store design and new service options will be enough to turn around its struggling auto care business and win back customers from competitors.
