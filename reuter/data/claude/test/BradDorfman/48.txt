Talks to Resume Between Caterpillar and United Auto Workers After 17-Month Strike 

Negotiations between heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers union are set to resume this week after a nearly 17-month strike by about 12,000 Caterpillar workers in several states. The UAW went on strike in March 1996 after rejecting a proposed six-year contract from Caterpillar that included wage freezes and higher health insurance costs.

The work stoppage is the longest in Caterpillar's history and one of the lengthiest strikes for any U.S. company in decades. Union leaders are hopeful a deal can finally be reached, but key sticking points remain around pay, benefits, and job security. “Our members have sacrificed so much over the past 17 months, but they remain committed to securing a fair contract,” said UAW President Ron Gettelfinger. “It is time for Caterpillar to do the right thing and negotiate in good faith.”

Caterpillar counters that its initial offer was fair and necessary to remain competitive as the company faces economic pressures, notably from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Caterpillar reported a 27% drop in first-quarter profits this year compared to the same period in 1996, which it blames partly on the labor dispute. However, the company's stock price has increased nearly 50% during that time, angering union leaders. 

The resumption of talks comes as the U.S. economy continues its sustained period of growth and low unemployment. The UAW may have more leverage now to push Caterpillar on wages and benefits after nearly 18 months of workers surviving on strike pay and union assistance. Still, Caterpillar CEO Donald Fites has said the company will not budge significantly from its initial offer, setting the stage for what could be more tense negotiations. 

Both sides acknowledge that an agreement will not be easy after such a long and bitter dispute. But there is also a shared realization that continued stalemate only accelerates the economic damage and personal hardship. The fate of 12,000 workers and numerous Caterpillar facilities hangs in the balance as negotiators sit down this week to determine whether a deal can finally be forged or if the longest strike in modern U.S. labor history will grind on.
