Sears stock drops 6% as company faces refunds for credit card holders in bankruptcy court

Shares of Sears Holdings Corp. fell more than 6% today after the embattled retailer said it will have to refund nearly $164 million to customers who paid for purchases with the company's private label credit cards. The refunds stem from tens of thousands of disputed charges within the last 18 months that have been ruled in favor of cardholders in bankruptcy court.

Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2018, seeking to restructure its massive debt load while closing hundreds of stores and selling assets. However, the bankruptcy process has been messy and contentious as the 125-year-old company continues to battle creditors and vendors while attempting to stay afloat.

The credit card refund issue adds another layer of complexity and cost to the bankruptcy proceedings. According to court filings, Sears received approximately 60,000 billing disputes from credit card customers between January 2018 and June 2019, with most disputes involving returned items, pricing errors or failure to deliver products. After reviewing evidence, the bankruptcy court sided with customers on nearly 30,000 of the disputes, totaling $163.7 million in charges. 

Sears now has to refund those charges to credit card holders, even though the company previously counted those revenues and the court has approved the sales. Legal experts say the refund issue highlights poor internal controls and management of customer service systems within Sears that contributed to its downfall.

The latest refund problem puts further strain on Sears' dwindling cash reserves and casts more doubt on its turnaround plans. The company has closed more than 3,500 stores and cut about 250,000 jobs in the last 15 years. Sears chairman and former CEO Eddie Lampert reached a last-minute deal to buy 425 surviving Sears and Kmart stores in January, but continuing weak sales and financial losses have put the company's long term viability in question.

Shares of Sears dropped to an all-time low of $0.38 today, down from a peak of $195 per share in 2007. Most analysts expect the stock will be worthless as the company remains mired in bankruptcy with an uncertain fate ahead. The once iconic American brand continues to disappoint customers and investors alike as it struggles in vain to recapture its former glory.
