Giddings & Lewis Inc. sees surge in stock price amid speculation of higher takeover bid

Shares of machine tool maker Giddings & Lewis Inc. surged as much as 25 percent in midday trading Monday on speculation that private equity firm KKR & Co. may increase its takeover offer for the company. Last month, KKR made an unsolicited bid for Giddings & Lewis for $42 per share in cash, valuing the company at $3.4 billion. However, Giddings & Lewis rejected the offer, saying it "significantly undervalues" the company. 

Since then, analysts have speculated that KKR may come back with a higher offer, potentially in the $50 to $60 per share range. “Giddings & Lewis has strong fundamentals and holds valuable manufacturing assets and intellectual property,” said Jane Miller, an analyst at Smith Barney. “KKR likely wants to acquire the company, and at the right price, the board may find an offer acceptable.”

Giddings & Lewis shares rose as high as $52.35 in Monday trading before closing at $50.15, up $10.15 or 25 percent for the day. The stock is now up nearly 60 percent from its levels before KKR's initial takeover bid in anticipation of a higher offer. 

KKR declined to comment on speculation regarding a revised takeover proposal. In rejecting the initial $42 per share offer, Giddings & Lewis said it "does not even come close to fully and fairly valuing Giddings & Lewis' prospects for continued growth and value creation.” The company also cited its strong position in key machine tool markets, technology leadership, and opportunities for expansion into new products and geographies as reasons for demanding a higher price.

Founded in 1888, Giddings & Lewis is headquartered in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and has a market capitalization of $2.1 billion. The company designs and manufactures machine tools, including computer numerically controlled machine tools, for a wide array of industries including aerospace, automotive, medical, and electronics manufacturing. Giddings & Lewis has been seen as an attractive takeover target as the machine tool industry has undergone consolidation. An acquisition by KKR would take the company private.
