TCF Chairman and CEO Craig Dahl said, “The merger with Standard is consistent with TCF's strategic plan to expand in attractive Midwest markets.

TCF expects the transaction to be 4.7% accretive to earnings per share in 2020, excluding one-time charges, and to achieve cost savings of approximately 45% of Standard's noninterest expense base. TCF anticipates incurring pre-tax charges of approximately $30 million related to the transaction, with the bulk of charges occurring in 2019. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of Standard.

TCF and Standard agreed that upon closing of the transaction, Peter Demiridis and two other current members of the Standard board will join the TCF board. Standard will operate as a separate brand for the foreseeable future. Clients will continue to bank as they do today at all banking center locations and with the same familiar faces.

TCF was advised by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP as legal counsel. Standard was advised by Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. as financial advisor and Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum & Nagelberg LLP as legal counsel.
