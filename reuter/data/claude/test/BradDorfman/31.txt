First Bank Acquires U.S. Bancorp in $8.5 Billion Deal, Becomes 14th-Largest Bank in U.S.  

In a move aimed at gaining scale and expanding geographic presence, First Bank announced today that it would acquire U.S. Bancorp for $8.5 billion in an all-stock deal. The deal will make First Bank the 14th-largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the fifth-largest regional bank.

First Bank, based in Ohio, has been looking to grow beyond its Midwestern roots. By acquiring U.S. Bancorp, which is headquartered in Minnesota, First Bank gains over 3,000 branches across 25 states in the Midwest, West, and Pacific Northwest. "This strategic acquisition will allow us to achieve national scale and deepen our presence in attractive markets from coast to coast," said Frank Smith, CEO of First Bank.

U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive 0.93 shares of First Bank for each U.S. Bancorp share, valuing U.S. Bancorp at around $60 per share. That represents a 20% premium over yesterday's closing price. U.S. Bancorp's shares jumped 15% in early trading on the news.

The deal is expected to generate significant cost savings, with the banks projecting $2.3 billion in annual savings within three years of closing the deal. Branch closures and job cuts are likely as the banks eliminate redundancies. The deal is projected to also increase First Bank's earnings per share by over 10% in the first year after closing.

However, there is uncertainty on if regulators will approve the deal given the larger size of the combined institution. There have also been concerns expressed over industry consolidation and the systemic risk from banks that are "too big to fail." Consumer groups argue that bank mergers often lead to less choice and higher fees for customers.

The deal is expected to close in mid-2020 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. If approved, the acquisition would be the largest bank deal since the financial crisis and further accelerate the wave of consolidation in the banking sector.
