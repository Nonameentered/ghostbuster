Mercury Finance Secures $50M in Short-Term Financing from Bank of America and Possible Asset Sale to Competitors  

Mercury Finance Inc., a down-on-its-luck subprime auto lender, announced today that it has secured $50 million in short-term financing from Bank of America Corp. to shore up its liquidity position. The financing agreement comes as Mercury also disclosed that it is in discussions to sell certain assets to larger competitors as it seeks to restructure its business, reduce debt, and avoid bankruptcy.  

Mercury Finance has been struggling under the weight of higher loan delinquencies and loss provisions in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has further weakened the company by limiting its ability to collect payments from its predominantly low-income borrowers. Mercury reported a $10.8 million loss for the first quarter, following a $12.2 million loss for all of 2019.  

The $50 million credit facility provided by Bank of America runs for 6 months and carries an interest rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 6.5%, according to a statement by Mercury. The company said the proceeds would be used "to support ongoing operations, including funding new loan originations."

Mercury also disclosed that it has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. to help it pursue "strategic alternatives," including the possible sale of certain assets to competitors. Options could include selling part or all of its loan portfolio, certain bank relationships and infrastructure, or even the entire company. Executives have spoken with "most major participants" in the subprime auto finance sector, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

The short-term financing and pursuit of asset sales highlight the limited options available to Mercury to turn around its business. Demand for the company's high-risk auto loans has dissipated among investors, cutting off access to asset-backed securities markets that it has traditionally relied upon for funding. 

Founded in 1990, Mercury specializes in originating and servicing auto loans and leases for borrowers with blemished or limited credit histories. It has originated over $50 billion in subprime auto loans since its inception but has struggled since delinquencies spiked following a period of rapid growth. Executive turnover has also plagued the company, with three CEOs passing through in the last five years.

The next few months will be critical for Mercury as it races to restructure its balance sheet and put itself on stable footing before the short-term financing from Bank of America comes due. Asset sales, if achieved, could give it more time to recover but at the cost of a smaller footing in the marketâ€”if it survives at all as an independent company. Investors appear skeptical, with Mercury shares tumbling over 95% from their post-IPO peak in 2015. For now, the company's future remains highly uncertain as it grapples with losses, high debts, and a crisis of confidence from investors. But with $50 million in new liquidity and restructuring options in play, Mercury lives to fight another day in its quest to right the ship.
