Cobra Electronics Corp Expects Double-Digit Revenue Growth and Profit Increase in 1997 

Cobra Electronics Corporation announced today that it expects double-digit revenue growth and significantly higher profits in 1997 compared to 1996. In a statement, Cobra’s CEO Jim Medsker said "1996 was a pivotal year for Cobra as we restructured our operations, reduced costs, and refocused on our core strengths in consumer electronics and communications products. The initiatives we put in place last year have positioned us for strong growth in revenue and profitability in 1997."

For the full year 1996, Cobra reported revenue of $328 million, roughly flat compared to 1995. However, fourth quarter revenue increased over 20% versus the same period in 1995, suggesting momentum going into 1997. The company earned $0.34 per share in 1996, a substantial increase over the $0.03 per share earned in 1995. 

Cobra's product line includes citizens band radios, radar detectors, two-way radios, and an expanding range of cordless telephones. The company has a particularly strong presence in the trucking industry, with Cobra citizen band radios installed in over 2 million long-haul trucks. To boost growth, Cobra plans to aggressively market new digital cordless telephone models, which provide significantly improved sound quality, range, and security compared to older analog phones.

In its statement, Cobra highlighted several drivers of expected 1997 growth and improved profitability:

•Continued momentum from fourth quarter 1996, where strong sales of new products led to over 20% revenue growth. 

•A larger, more efficient operation after closing several high-cost manufacturing facilities in 1996. 

•Lower component costs, especially for digital chips used in cordless telephones, two-way radios, and other products. 

•Strong reception for new cordless telephone models, based on initial sales and retailer feedback. 

•Recovery in the trucking industry and stable demand for citizen band radios and radar detectors.

•Tighter cost controls on marketing, research and development, and administration. 

With a leaner operation and sales of new high-margin products accelerating, Cobra seems poised to deliver on its promise of double-digit growth and higher profits this year. Investors have reacted to Cobra's guidance by pushing the stock up over 15% in early morning trading.
