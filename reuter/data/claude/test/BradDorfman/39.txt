Banyan Strategic Realty Trust Reports Q4 Funds from Operations Down, Expects Jump in 1997  

Banyan Strategic Realty Trust (NYSE: BSRT) reported funds from operations (FFO) of $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 1996, down from $0.36 per share in the year-ago quarter. The real estate investment trust (REIT) attributed the decline to higher interest costs related to new debt issued in the quarter and assets coming on line in 1996 that are still in the lease-up phase. 

For the full year 1996, FFO rose 8% to $1.28 per share. The REIT expects FFO for 1997 to increase 12-15% to $1.44 to $1.48 per share.   

“While our fourth quarter results were weighed down by the interest costs associated with two sizeable acquisitions in the quarter, our outlook for strong earnings and dividend growth in 1997 remains intact,” said BSRT CEO Thomas J. Bailey. “The assets we acquired in 1996 and the new in-process developments will contribute meaningfully to earnings this year as they achieve stabilization.”

BSRT acquired $325 million of office properties in the fourth quarter, including a 20-story building in downtown Miami and two office parks in Raleigh. The REIT ended the year with an $800 million acquisition pipeline, suggesting additional deals are on the horizon for 1997.     

The company also commenced a 300,000 square foot office complex in Tampa that is 57% pre-leased and broke ground on a 170,000 square foot office building in Fort Lauderdale that is over 40% pre-leased. Both projects are expected to be completed in mid-1997 and contribute significantly to earnings growth.  

For the quarter, revenue increased 23% to $39.9 million. Net income declined 15% to $6.5 million or $0.19 per share. The company reaffirmed its quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. BSRT shares closed at $23.42, up $0.56 or 2.4% on the day. 

Analysts reacted positively to the FFO guidance for 1997. “While interest costs weighed on fourth quarter results, the outlook for double-digit FFO and dividend growth next year due to contributions from acquisitions and new developments is very encouraging,” said David Chen of Raymond James. “At current prices, BSRT offers a compelling opportunity for income-seeking investors.”
