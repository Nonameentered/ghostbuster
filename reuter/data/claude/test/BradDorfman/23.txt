Mosinee Paper Corp to Double Capital Expenses in 1997 to Expand Capacity in Towel and Tissue Business  

Mosinee Paper Corp announced plans today to double its capital expenditures in 1997 to $200 million to fund capacity expansions at facilities that produce towel and tissue products. The increased spending will enable the company to meet growing demand for premium towel and tissue products in North America.

The bulk of the additional capital investment, $150 million, will fund converting and packaging equipment upgrades and additions at facilities in Hudson, Wisconsin and Mississauga, Ontario. These investments will expand the company's capability to produce higher-margin premium towel and tissue items such as two-ply toilet paper, paper towels, and facial tissues. 

"We have seen solid growth in the towel and tissue category over the past several years, especially in the premium segments," said Tim Johnson, President and CEO of Mosinee Paper Corp. "These investments will position us well to capture more of the premium product demand and gain market share."

The remainder of the additional funds, $50 million, will be used to begin the first phase of expanding the company's central pulp and paper mill operation in Mosinee, Wisconsin. New bleaching systems and paper machines will be installed to produce more pulp and base paper, ensuring adequate supply for Mosinee's converting operations and third-party sales. This multi-phase project is expected to be complete in late 1999 at a total cost of $750 million.

Mark Smith, an industry analyst with Packaged Forest Products Research, said the Mosinee expansion plan is well-timed given current market conditions. "The towel and tissue market is growing at 3-4% annually, and premium products are growing even faster at 6% per year. Mosinee Paper Corp has a strong track record of product innovation, efficient manufacturing, and successful category growth. Additional capacity and capability to meet more premium product demand could generate solid returns for the company and its shareholders over the next several years."

The planned capital investments are expected to generate over $100 million in additional revenue and $30 million in operating profit once fully implemented by the end of 1999. Mosinee Paper Corp operates four U.S. and three Canadian facilities and employs over 5,000 people. The company generates $3.2 billion in annual sales.
