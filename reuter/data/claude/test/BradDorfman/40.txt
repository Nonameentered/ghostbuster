Caterpillar Inc. Reports Record First Quarter Profit and Raises 1997 Forecast 

Caterpillar Inc. reported its highest first-quarter profit in history today and raised its forecasts for 1997, citing strong worldwide demand for its construction and mining equipment.

The company said its net income in the first three months of 1997 rose 48 percent, to $333 million, or 95 cents a share, from $225 million, or 65 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 19 percent, to $4.79 billion from $4.02 billion.

Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., is the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment. Its results provide an indication of activity in the construction industry, a major sector of the economy.

Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, Donald V. Fites, said the company was benefiting from "strong economic growth in most areas of the world and increased infrastructure investment." He added that the company's cost-cutting and restructuring moves in recent years had also helped increase profit margins.  

Mr. Fites said Caterpillar now expected its 1997 profit to rise 15 percent from last year's $1.16 billion. The company previously had forecast an increase of about 10 percent. Sales are projected to rise about 15 to 20 percent in 1997, up from an earlier estimate of about 10 percent growth.

"We continue to be optimistic about worldwide economic growth and infrastructure needs for the remainder of this year and into 1998,‚Äù Mr. Fites said.

The results are the latest in a string of improved earnings reports from industrial concerns this month, suggesting that manufacturing is regaining momentum after a temporary lull during the winter. Deere & Company, Caterpillar's big rival in farm and construction equipment, reported a jump of 21 percent in quarterly earnings last week.  

Caterpillar's shares, already at a 52-week high, rose $2.875, to $55.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. The surge reflects high hopes for the company and the belief on Wall Street that any economic slowdown will not significantly dent Caterpillar's earnings momentum.
