Nation's Retailers Expected to Post Modest Sales Gains for February, with Warm Weather Having Mixed Impact on Results: Analysts  

Retail sales in February are expected to show modest year-over-year gains as unseasonably warm weather across much of the country had a mixed impact on results, according to analysts. 

Retailers will report February sales results on Thursday, with overall sales forecast to rise between 3.5% and 4.5% compared with a year earlier, according to data from Refinitiv. However, the higher-than-usual temperatures made for uneven demand across categories. Sales of cold-weather gear and goods were weak, while spending on spring clothing and seasonal items picked up earlier than usual.

“The warmer weather was a boon for some areas of retail like clothing, but it hurt demand for items like boots, coats, and heaters,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm. "The weather pulled forward some spring sales at the expense of winter-related goods. Discounters and apparel chains were the biggest beneficiaries of the warmer weather surge in sales of Spring clothing and outdoor living products.”

The winter essentials that didn’t sell during February will likely have to be heavily discounted, cutting into retailers' profit margins. Some chains may have excess inventory of coats, sweaters and other winter wear that they now have to sell at steep markdowns. The warmer temperatures accelerated purchases of lawn and gardening supplies, patio furniture and pool toys, giving a boost to home improvement retailers.

Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., two of the biggest U.S. retailers, are both expected to post comparable sales gains of around 3.5%. Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. are forecast to report the strongest growth, with sales rising 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively. Apparel chains are projected to show mixed results, with Gap Inc. sales down 3.1% and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. sales up 3.7%. Department store chains also will report uneven results. Macy's Inc. sales are seen falling 0.9%, while Kohl's Corp. is expected to post a 3.7% gain.

Analysts said early Easter discounts and tax refund checks also may have given sales a lift last month. But cold days during March so far are a reminder that warmer weather can't last forever, suggesting March may see more normalized sales trends. Overall, economists remain confident that consumer fundamentals remain supportive of continued retail spending gains in the months ahead.
