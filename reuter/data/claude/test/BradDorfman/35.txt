Low-end discount stores drive retail sales gains in March 

Retail sales in the U.S. rose modestly in March, buoyed by strong sales at discount and off-price retailers. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales increased 0.6% in March compared with the previous month. While broader retail sales have slowed in recent months amid lackluster consumer spending, sales at discount chains like Dollar General and TJ Maxx bucked the trend.

Sales at non-store retailers, which include e-commerce companies like Amazon, rose 1.2% in March. However, removing volatile auto, gas and non-store sales, retail sales edged up just 0.1% last month. The modest increase suggests consumers remain cautious about spending, as wage gains remain uneven and households have taken on more debt. 

The strongest gains were seen at discount stores, with sales rising 1.1% in March following a 1.2% gain in February. Chains like Dollar General and Dollar Tree have benefited as lower-income consumers seek value. Dollar General plans to open 975 new stores this year, expanding its reach into more rural and suburban areas. Off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores also posted solid sales gains, indicating shoppers continue to hunt for deals across income levels.

In contrast, department store chains like Macy's and J.C. Penney reported another month of lackluster sales, with revenue declining 0.7% in March. Sales at clothing stores were similarly flat, edging down 0.1%. While consumer confidence remains relatively high, shoppers appear reluctant to pay full price for discretionary goods.

The split in retail sales performance between high and low-end retailers highlights the unevenness of the economic recovery. As lower-income consumers struggle with slow wage growth and higher household expenses, discount chains have captured more of their spending. For higher-end retailers, strong consumer confidence hasnâ€™t yet translated into higher sales. Overall, tepid retail sales growth suggests the economy may have slowed in the first quarter, although economists expect gains to pick up again later in the year.
