Shuffle Master CEO Not Seeking Sale, but Open to Offers for Gaming Equipment Supplier 

Shuffle Master Inc., a leading supplier of card-shuffling equipment and other products for casinos, is not actively seeking a sale of the company but would consider any serious offers that may arise, Chief Executive Gavin Isaacs said.

The Las Vegas company has seen its shares climb more than 60% over the past year amid consolidation in the gambling equipment industry. Some analysts and investors have speculated Shuffle Master could be an acquisition target.

Mr. Isaacs said in an interview that while Shuffle Master isn't running a "for sale" sign, "we have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, so if someone makes an offer we have to consider it." 

Any deal, he said, would have to properly value the potential growth opportunities from Shuffle Master's new products, as well as the company's stable base of recurring revenue from leasing shufflers and other gear to casinos. 

Shuffle Master gets most of its revenue from leasing automatic card shufflers to casinos. It also sells electronic gaming tables and designs special casino chips and playing cards. Mr. Isaacs said the company aims to generate 25% to 30% of revenue from sales of gaming tables and other equipment.

Some analysts believe larger gambling equipment makers could bid for Shuffle Master to gain its product line and customer base. Potential acquirers include slot-machine makers International Game Technology and Bally Technologies Inc., as well as casino operators interested in controlling more of their gaming equipment costs.

Mr. Isaacs said Shuffle Master can continue to grow independently but would likely need larger financial or technical resources at some point to expand into more markets outside the U.S. and diversify its product line further. 

Earlier this year, Shuffle Master closed on a new $100 million credit facility that could help fund potential acquisitions or share buybacks. "We now have an acquisition war chest," Mr. Isaacs said. The company continues to look for small deals that could expand its product line or geographic reach, he said.

Shuffle Master was founded in 1983 and first popularized card shufflers to thwart card counting by gamblers at blackjack tables. It has since launched higher-tech shufflers, gaming tables and other gear that it leases to casinos for a fixed monthly fee. Revenue in its fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 20% from a year earlier to $62.7 million. Profit declined 22% to $3 million due to higher costs.
