Mercury Finance Co. Suspends Dividend Payment and Seeks Short-Term Financing as It Struggles with Debt  

Mercury Finance Co., a leading consumer finance company, announced today that it will suspend its quarterly dividend payment for the first time in over 40 years and is seeking additional sources of short-term financing to meet its obligations. The company is struggling under the weight of rising loan defaults and ineffective collection efforts that have reduced cash flows.  

Mercury Finance specializes in high-interest, short-term loans to individuals with poor credit histories. The company has experienced a sharp uptick in defaults on its loans over the past 18 months, reducing the cash collected each month. At the same time, the company itself holds a significant amount of debt, with $3.2 billion in bonds outstanding and additional short-term bank debt. Mercury has relied on continuous access to financing to fund new loans to generate revenue and meet its obligations.   

The company’s failure to collect on its loans, combined with its own debt levels, has strained its finances. In a statement, Mercury Finance CEO Pauline Thompson said, "We have seen an unprecedented rise in defaults and delinquencies among our customer base. While we are taking aggressive steps to recover amounts owed to us, this has created a short-term liquidity issue that we must address immediately. Suspending our dividend and raising new short-term financing will provide a financial cushion as we improve our collections and refocus the business.”

Mercury has hired turnaround consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal to review its operations, identify cost-cutting measures, and improve its underwriting and collections processes. Thompson noted, “We are confident that with Alvarez & Marsal’s help we can adjust our business model to today’s economic realities and return Mercury to sustainable, long-term success and growth.” However, analysts are dubious. “Mercury Finance’s entire business model was predicated on loose lending standards and the ability to charge high interest rates,” said Marcus Goodwin of Goodwin Investments. “Tightening lending and improving collections is directly at odds with that model. This restructuring is going to be very difficult to pull off, especially on such short notice.”

Shares of Mercury Finance fell over 65% on news of the dividend suspension and financing request. Bondholders are also nervous about the company’s ability to meet future payments. While Mercury requested new short-term financing from its banks, a long-term solution may prove challenging as investors and lenders have soured on the company. The coming months will be crucial as Mercury works to stop the bleeding and regain its financial footing. For now, the future remains uncertain for the once high-flying lender to the downtrodden.
