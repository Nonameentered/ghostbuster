First Bank to Acquire U.S. Bancorp in $8.5 Billion Stock Deal, Resulting in Job Losses

In a move that will reshape the banking landscape in the upper Midwest, First Bank announced today that it will acquire U.S. Bancorp in an all-stock deal valued at $8.5 billion. The merger will make First Bank the fifth largest bank holding company in the United States with over $700 billion in combined assets and approximately 3,500 branch locations. However, the deal is expected to result in significant job losses, with 5-10% of the combined companies' 282,000 employees likely to be laid off.

First Bank and U.S. Bancorp revealed details of the merger in a joint press conference earlier today. The deal will see U.S. Bancorp shareholders receive 1.35 shares of First Bank common stock for each share of U.S. Bancorp stock they own, valuing U.S. Bancorp at $62 per share based on yesterday’s closing price. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. 

The two Midwest-based banks touted the deal as a “merger of equals” that will benefit customers and shareholders. In a statement, First Bank CEO James Davis said, “This transformative partnership will allow us to achieve even more together than each company could achieve separately. The combined organization will have competitive advantages in both its national footprint and product offerings, and it will be well-positioned for future growth and industry leadership.”

However, analysts voiced concerns about potential job losses from the merger in order to eliminate overlap and boost profits. In a research note, banking analyst John Thompson wrote, “While the strategic rationale for this merger is sound, we expect significant cost-cutting and headcount reductions to result, likely in the range of 10-15% of the combined workforce over the next few years.” Employees at the two banks were left with many unanswered questions about their job security as a result of the announcement.
