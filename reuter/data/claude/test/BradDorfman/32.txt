First Bank System Inc. to Acquire U.S. Bancorp in $8.5 Billion Stock Deal, Resulting in Job Losses and Firm Toehold in Pacific Northwest

In a move that will expand its geographical footprint and bolster its position as one of the nation's largest regional banks, First Bank System Inc. announced today that it has agreed to acquire U.S. Bancorp in an $8.5 billion all-stock deal. The agreement comes as larger banks are expanding into new regions by buying up smaller lenders and as consumers are increasingly banking online and demanding more digital services.   

Under the terms of the deal, U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive 1.17 shares of First Bank System stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own. The per-share value of the transaction represents a 23% premium over U.S. Bancorp’s closing price on Friday. The combined company will have over $140 billion in assets and operate more than 1,100 branch offices across 25 states.   

While the deal will strengthen First Bank System’s position in the Midwest, where it is headquartered, its key motivation is gaining a larger presence on the West Coast through U.S. Bancorp’s operations in Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada. “This geographic expansion has been a longstanding strategic priority for our company,” said First Bank System CEO Mike McCoy in a statement. “U.S. Bancorp’s network of branches across the Pacific Northwest and Western U.S. represent an ideal platform for us to gain meaningful scale in those fast-growing regions.”

However, analysts expect major job cuts and cost synergies as a result of the merger, as the banks look to eliminate overlapping branches and departments. “There are significant opportunities for cost savings by consolidating back-office functions and eliminating redundant costs,” said banking analyst John Wilson. “We would expect at least 5-10% of the combined workforce to be let go in the coming years, amounting to hundreds of jobs lost.” The deal is expected to close in early 2022 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.

The acquisition is the latest in a wave of mergers reshaping the banking industry. Low interest rates and weak economic growth have increased pressure on smaller and regional banks, prompting many to seek merger partners. The increased size and scale of the combined banks are expected to help weather challenging market conditions and allow for investments in new technologies to better compete against megabanks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Overall, the First Bank System-U.S. Bancorp deal is a sign of more consolidation likely still to come in the banking sector.
