U.S. Robotics Corp Stock Soars on Possibility of Unveiling Faster Analog Modem  

Shares of U.S. Robotics Corp, a maker of analog modems and other internet connectivity devices, surged over 25% today on speculation the company will announce a new high-speed modem technology. Investors are anticipating the company’s CEO, John Smith, will unveil the faster modem at the company’s annual technology conference next week.  

U.S. Robotics’ stock price jumped from $23.50 at market open to $29.85 at midday, boosting the company’s market capitalization by over $2 billion. The steep rise in share price was fueled by remarks from Smith at a tech industry event last week where he hinted U.S. Robotics had made a “major breakthrough” with modem technology. According to analysts, if U.S. Robotics were to release a modem with 56 kilobits per second or faster speeds, it would leapfrog current products in the market and give the company a competitive advantage.

“Investors are betting on U.S. Robotics unveiling a 56k modem or better next week,” said Jennifer Lee, a telecom analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “If they do release that, it would make their modems the fastest in the industry and put their competitors on notice.”  

U.S. Robotics and its competitors have been in an “arms race” to build faster and more advanced analog modems over the last decade. Faster modems allow for quicker access to the internet and the ability to download more data, graphics, and video. U.S. Robotics’ current flagship modem offers maximum download speeds of 33.6 kilobits per second, slightly behind rivals like Motorola and Hayes Corp.  

“A new 56k modem would leapfrog the competition and give consumers a compelling reason to choose U.S. Robotics,” said Lee. “It could reinvigorate their brand and sales at a time when analog modem demand has started to plateau.”
