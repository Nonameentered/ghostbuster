Case Corp to Spend $950 Million to Revamp Product Line by Turn of the Century

Heavy equipment maker Case Corp announced today that it will invest $950 million over the next 18 months to overhaul its entire product line. The ambitious revamp will touch all of Case's major equipment categories, including tractors, combines, excavators, and wheel loaders. 

"Our customers' needs are changing rapidly, and we need to change with them," said Christine Smith, Case's CEO. "Farmers and construction companies alike are looking for more efficient, high-tech, and environmentally friendly vehicles. This investment will allow us to leapfrog our competition and give our customers the cutting-edge equipment they're demanding."

The investment comes at a crucial time for Case. The 175-year-old company has suffered from sluggish sales and tightening profit margins in recent years. Its stock price has declined more than 30% over the past 12 months due to investor concerns. The product overhaul is aimed at reigniting revenue growth and boosting Case's stock value. 

As part of the revamp, Case will introduce four new tractor models in 2020 that will incorporate advanced GPS guidance systems, self-driving features, and predictive analytics to help farmers maximize crop yields. On the construction equipment side, Case will debut two new excavator models with all-electric systems in 2021 to meet tighter emissions standards. The company will also roll out an autonomous bulldozer prototype with plans to begin real-world testing in 2022.

The $950 million investment includes $750 million for research and development, as well as retooling Case's factories. The remaining $200 million will be spent on a marketing campaign to promote the company's new high-tech product line. Case expects the investment to reduce operating costs by $400 million annually within three years by improving manufacturing efficiency and automation. The company also anticipates the revamp will increase annual revenue by $3 billion in the same time frame based on initial customer response.

While analysts view the investment positively, some caution that injecting nearly $1 billion into the struggling company in such a short period is an expensive gamble. There is also significant uncertainty around whether Case's new autonomous and all-electric vehicles will meet strict regulations and gain wide customer acceptance. However, if successful, the product overhaul could help Case regain its status as an industry leader and power the company's turnaround heading into the new century.
