TCF Financial to Enter Equipment Leasing Field, Acquiring Winthrop Resources Corp. for $326 Million

TCF Financial Corporation announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Winthrop Resources Corporation, an equipment finance company, for $326 million in cash. Winthrop specializes in technology, healthcare, and manufacturing equipment leases and finance products. The acquisition will allow TCF to expand into the large and growing equipment finance market. 

“This strategic acquisition solidifies TCF as a leader in the nationwide equipment finance arena,” said TCF chairman and CEO Craig R. Dahl. “Winthrop has developed a highly profitable niche business model that we believe fits well with TCF’s overall growth strategy.”

Founded in 1982 and based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, Winthrop originates and services small-ticket equipment leases and finance products, typically ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. Winthrop manages a portfolio of over 23,000 leases and loans totaling $1.3 billion in assets. TCF expects Winthrop to contribute approximately $40 million in pre-tax income in 2020, excluding one-time acquisition and integration costs.

“We are excited to join the TCF team,” said Steven P. Schroll, Winthrop’s president and CEO. “TCF’s scale, funding capabilities and expertise will allow us to strengthen and expand our platform to better serve our customers and partners.”

TCF plans to operate Winthrop as a subsidiary of TCF Equipment Finance, retaining Winthrop’s brand, management team, operations, and business model. TCF Equipment Finance provides commercial equipment leases and loans, and already has a $2.8 billion portfolio of assets. The acquisition of Winthrop is TCF’s fourth in the past three years as the company continues to diversify its revenue streams beyond core consumer banking.

Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. TCF paid $326 million in an all-cash transaction funded with current balance sheet liquidity. TCF expects the deal to be accretive to 2021 earnings per share.
