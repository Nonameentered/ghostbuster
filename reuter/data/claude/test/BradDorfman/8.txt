Mercury Finance Co. Suspends Dividend and Seeks Short-Term Financing Amidst Accounting Scandal and Mounting Debt 

Mercury Finance Co., one of the nation's largest subprime auto lenders, announced late Monday it would suspend its dividend payment and seek additional short-term financing to remain solvent. The embattled company has been rocked by an accounting scandal that resulted in the resignation of its longtime CEO two weeks ago and revelations of higher-than-reported loan delinquency rates.  

Mercury shares plunged over 50% on the news, closing at just $2.13 and dragging down major indexes. The company had been paying a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, and the cut marks the first time Mercury has suspended its dividend in over 30 years. In a statement, interim CEO Amanda North acknowledged “severe challenges” confronting the company but vowed to take “decisive action” to right the ship. Those actions apparently include halting returns of capital to shareholders in favor of hoarding cash and securing emergency outside financing.

The accounting issues at the heart of Mercury's troubles came to light last month when former CEO Tom Evans resigned abruptly after a 28-year tenure. Evans admitted to improperly deferring losses on non-performing loans and indulging in other accounting tricks to mask higher delinquency and loss rates. An internal review conducted by Mercury's audit committee found delinquency rates nearly double the previously reported figure and losses some 30-50% higher. North, formerly Mercury's Chief Operating Officer, took over following Evans’ departure.

The accounting scandal and weakened financial figures have imperiled Mercury's relationship with creditors and rating agencies. Within a week of the Evans revelations, Moody’s downgraded Mercury’s credit rating to junk status, citing “systemic failures” in financial reporting and underwriting controls. Meanwhile, Mercury's long-term debt has declined in value, and the company risks breaching covenants on some bonds if ratios do not promptly improve. In response, Mercury announced plans to amend covenants and enter revolving credit facilities to boost short-term cash.

Mercury is also facing numerous shareholder lawsuits following the disclosures, with plaintiffs arguing executives and directors failed to detect fraudulent practices and demand proper safeguards. Legal woes are likely to persist even with new controls and leadership in place.

Mounting troubles have intensified pressure on North to pursue strategic alternatives, including an outright sale of Mercury. However, finding a buyer will likely prove challenging given the taint of accounting issues and ongoing business challenges in subprime auto lending. While subprime auto lending rebounded following the financial crisis, delinquency rates have crept up in recent years, raising concerns of overextension.

Mercury's future remains deeply uncertain with much depending on creditors’ and shareholders’ confidence in North's turnaround plans. For now, all eyes remain focused on Mercury's liquidity position and whether emergency funding and covenant waivers will be forthcoming. Absent outside support, the dividend suspension may mark only the first of more consequential cutbacks.
