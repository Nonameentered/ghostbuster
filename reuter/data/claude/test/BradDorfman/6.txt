American Business Information Inc CEO Vin Gupta Confident in  Third Quarter and Full Year Earnings Estimates, Plans for Internet Expansion and Possible Acquisitions  

American Business Information Inc. (ABI) CEO Vinod Gupta expressed confidence in meeting third quarter and full year earnings estimates in an interview today. Speaking to analysts and reporters, Gupta said, “We are tracking well to achieve our guidance for the third quarter and remain confident in our full year forecast. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand across our business information solutions, and we expect double-digit growth for the full year.”

ABI provides data, analytics, and business information solutions to corporations, financial firms, and government agencies. The company has recently invested heavily in expanding its internet and cloud-based service offerings. According to Gupta, “Our transition to more scalable internet and cloud-based delivery models is progressing smoothly. These new platforms enable us to provide faster, more customized solutions to clients at lower cost. We will continue to migrate more of our services to these platforms in the coming quarters.”  

Gupta also indicated that ABI is evaluating potential acquisitions to accelerate its growth. "We have a solid balance sheet and the capacity to pursue strategic acquisitions if the right opportunities emerge. Our key criteria are accelerating our internet and cloud capabilities, expanding our data and analytics solutions, and acquiring niche market leaders that complement our existing strengths.” However, Gupta cautioned that ABI will remain highly selective in its evaluation of possible deals.

While remaining upbeat about ABI’s growth prospects, Gupta warned of several macro risks on the horizon, including trade tensions, political uncertainty, and slowing growth in some international markets. "While the U.S. economy remains robust, there are pockets of weakness in other parts of the world. However, our business model has historically been resilient during economic downturns as our solutions help clients gain efficiencies and navigate challenges." Overall, Gupta’s comments reflect continued strong momentum at ABI and confidence in its earnings potential for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020.
