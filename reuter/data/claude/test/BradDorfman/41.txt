Caterpillar Posts Record-Breaking Q1 Profits, Expects Higher Than Expected 1997 Profits

Caterpillar Inc. announced its first quarter results today, posting record profits that beat analyst expectations. The heavy equipment manufacturer earned $1.52 billion in net income for the first quarter of 1997, a 38 percent increase from the same period last year. Earnings per share were $2.12, well above the $1.73 forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call. 

Citing strong global demand for construction and mining equipment, Caterpillar said it anticipates profits for the full year will exceed earlier projections and could surpass $6 billion. “Our first quarter results reflect the healthy overall state of the industries we serve and the continuing success of our global growth strategies,” said Caterpillar CEO Glenn MacKenna in a statement.

Sales revenue rose 21 percent to $9.7 billion, topping estimates of $9.3 billion. Sales outside the U.S. accounted for 61 percent of the total. The Asia Pacific region posted a sizable 51 percent gain. “Mining activity has picked up worldwide, especially for coal and copper. Our mining product orders are the highest they've been in 10 years,” MacKenna said on a conference call with analysts.

Caterpillar’s stock price jumped 5.8 percent on news of the earnings results, closing at $88.13 per share, its highest in 52 weeks. The surge builds on an 80 percent increase in Caterpillar’s share price over the past 12 months.

Caterpillar attributed its strong performance to cost-cutting initiatives implemented over the past two years, expansion of its rental equipment business, and innovative new product launches. The company’s recent introduction of automated mining trucks and super-large hydraulic excavators has been well received by customers. 

Looking ahead, MacKenna said Caterpillar will continue adjusting capacity and ramping up production at certain facilities to meet demand, while remaining cautious about macroeconomic factors that could curb overall growth. “Our key end markets are performing well, but we recognize there are pockets of political and financial instability in the world that bear monitoring,” MacKenna noted. Barring any major setbacks, however, Caterpillar appears poised to make 1997 a record year in terms of both sales and profits.
