Hyatt Hotels To Spend $1 Billion on 20-30 New Properties in Aggressive Expansion Plan  

Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced plans today to invest $1 billion to grow its portfolio of properties over the next three years. The hotel giant intends to add between 20 to 30 new Hyatt-branded hotels in cities across the U.S., Canada, and Latin America through an aggressive expansion strategy.

“We see significant potential in both leisure and business travel in the coming years, especially as travel demand returns following widespread COVID-19 vaccinations,” said Mark Hoplamazian, President and CEO of Hyatt Hotels Corporation. “Now is the right time for Hyatt to double down on growth to capture more demand, gain market share, and boost our revenues and profits.”  

The new properties will include brands across Hyatt’s portfolio, including Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency, Hyatt Ziva, and Hyatt Place. Specific locations have not yet been announced but the company said the new hotels will be primarily built in urban and suburban areas with strong demand generators like central business districts, airports, and mixed-use developments.

The $1 billion capital investment is substantially higher than Hyatt’s typical annual funding for new properties. However, Hoplamazian said the post-pandemic travel landscape requires an “aggressive stance” to gain ground. The company’s revenues and profits were hit hard in 2020 due to COVID-related travel restrictions and a major drop in hotel occupancy rates.

Hyatt remains optimistic about the return of travel and anticipates occupancy and revenue rates will rebound to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. The company’s shares rose 4% on the news of its expansion plans, reflecting investor confidence in the hotel industry’s recovery.

The new Hyatt properties are expected to generate over 6,000 new hotel jobs across various locations. Construction timelines will depend on permitting, licensing, and local restrictions in each region. Hyatt said it will provide further updates on specific hotel openings and locations in the coming months.
