Analysts say shareholder profile change will protect Wallace Computer Services from investor takeover bid 

Wallace Computer Services, a mid-sized information technology services company, announced changes to its shareholder profile this week in an effort to protect itself from a potential investor takeover bid. The company will issue new shares amounting to 15% of its total shares outstanding to three large institutional investors. The move will reduce the stake held by activist hedge funds and make Wallace Computer Services a less attractive target for corporate raiders.

Wallace Computer Services has seen its stock price decline over the past year as revenues have slipped due to pricing pressures and declining demand for some of its legacy IT infrastructure services. The company has a healthy balance sheet with a strong net cash position but institutional investors have been pressuring the company to take more aggressive actions to restructure operations and boost profitability. Some analysts see the company as vulnerable to an outside takeover attempt if the depressed share price and activist pressures continue.

The new share issuance announced this week will bring the holdings of traditionally longer-term institutional investors to over 50% of total shares. These larger investors are focused on the company’s longer-term potential rather than short-term gains. According to Neil Richards, an analyst with Investec Securities, “The changes to the shareholder register significantly reduce the likelihood of a surprise takeover bid for Wallace Computer Services. The new larger investors will support the company’s own turnaround strategy rather than an outside buyer looking to make big changes.”

However, other analysts argue that the share issuance is a defensive tactic that protects management and the board but not necessarily shareholders. “This move entrenches existing management and may not represent the best strategy to maximize shareholder value in the long run,” said Cara Jenkins of Baird Equity Research. “While a takeover is less likely now, that may not be the optimal outcome if management is unable to accelerate the company’s own turnaround in the coming quarters.”

A spokesperson for Wallace Computer Services said the new investment from supportive long-term institutional shareholders will provide more stability as the company implements operational changes to address current challenges. The company reports second quarter financial results next month, which may provide the first indication of whether the turnaround strategy is gaining traction under the guidance of the company’s leadership team.
