Analysts Predict Modest Sales Gains for Retailers in February Due to Mixed Impact of Warm Weather 

Retail analysts are forecasting modest sales increases for clothing and department stores in February as unseasonably warm weather across much of the U.S. had a mixed impact on shoppers.

On the positive side, the warmer weather drew more consumers out to stores after a period of colder temperatures. However, the warmer weather also reduced demand for winter apparel and other cold-weather goods. This mixed effect is likely to result in small overall sales gains of 1-3% for the month compared to a year ago, according to forecasts from Retail Metrics and Morgan Stanley.

The warmer weather was most pronounced in the Midwest and Northeast, while the West remained slightly below average temperatures in February. Shoppers came out in droves when temperatures rose above 70 degrees in cities like New York and Chicago, providing a boost to foot traffic. However, those same shoppers were not purchasing heavy coats, sweaters, gloves, and other winter seasonal goods to the same degree.

“The warmer weather released some pent-up demand as shoppers felt more comfortable going to stores,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. “However, it pulled forward spring selling at the expense of some winter seasonal goods. The net effect was modestly positive but muted overall sales gains for the month.”

Department stores like Macy’s, Kohl’s, and JCPenney were likely to see a drag on their seasonal winter goods due to the warmer weather. However, their footwear, beauty, and other non-seasonal departments likely benefitted from the increase in customer visits. Overall, department stores were forecast to report 1-2% sales growth for February, in line with the performance of the broader retail sector.

Specialty retailers focused on winter apparel were expected to feel the biggest negative impact. However, a rebound in demand is anticipated for March if colder weather returns in much of the country. While February’s warmer temperatures provided a modest near-term boost to overall retail sales, colder weather is still needed to drive stronger demand for winter goods. Most analysts forecast retail sales will continue to rise at a steady but unspectacular pace of 2-4% for the first quarter, consistent with the overall trajectory of the economy.
