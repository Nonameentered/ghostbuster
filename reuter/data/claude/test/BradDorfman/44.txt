Harnischfeger Industries Inc. Offers $747 Million to Buy Giddings & Lewis Inc. 

Harnischfeger Industries Inc. announced today that it has offered to acquire Giddings & Lewis Inc., a manufacturer of machine tools, for $747 million in cash. The deal, if completed, would combine two of the largest suppliers of manufacturing equipment in the Midwest. 

Harnischfeger, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a diversified machinery company that produces mining equipment, pulp and paper machinery, and material handling equipment. The company has annual revenues of $3.4 billion and over 12,000 employees. Giddings & Lewis, headquartered in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, produces precision cutting tools, assembly machines, and large construction equipment. It has revenues of $620 million and employs 3,400 people.

“The acquisition of Giddings & Lewis would strengthen our position as a leading capital equipment supplier in growth industries like aerospace, automotive, and energy production,” said Peter Harnischfeger, Chairman and CEO of Harnischfeger Industries. “By combining our operations, we can achieve significant cost synergies and gain new opportunities for sales of our mining and forestry equipment.”

Under the terms of the deal, Harnischfeger would pay $52 in cash for each of Giddings & Lewis’s 14.4 million outstanding shares, representing a 22% premium to the company’s closing stock price yesterday. Giddings & Lewis’s board of directors is reviewing the offer and has not yet made a public statement on the proposal.  The deal would require approval from U.S. antitrust regulators and shareholders of both companies.

Analysts reacted positively to the news of the potential acquisition. “Strategically, it’s a great fit for both companies. There is little overlap in their products and customer bases, so few antitrust issues are expected,” said Michael Thompson, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. “Financially, Harnischfeger has the balance sheet to easily fund the purchase, and the synergies here could be substantial. I would expect annual savings of at least $50 million within two years if they can successfully combine their marketing, manufacturing, and technology platforms.”
