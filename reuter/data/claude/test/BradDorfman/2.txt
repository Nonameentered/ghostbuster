Mercury Finance Co. Unable to Pay $17 Million in Commercial Debt, Stock Value Drops by Almost 90% 

Mercury Finance Co., a commercial lender based in Chicago, announced today that it does not have enough cash on hand to repay $17 million of maturing commercial real estate loans over the next 30 days. The company's stock price plunged nearly 90% on the news, dropping from $42 per share to just $4.50 in early trading.

Mercury Finance specializes in short-term bridge loans for commercial property transactions, including office buildings, hotels, and multifamily housing. The company has been struggling recently due to a slowdown in commercial real estate transactions. Mercury's loan originations declined by over 60% last quarter compared to the same period a year ago. 

The $17 million in maturing loans that Mercury cannot repay represent nearly a quarter of the company's $75 million loan book. Mercury said it has been unable to find new lenders willing to refinance the existing loans given the uncertainty around the commercial real estate market. The company is attempting to negotiate with its current lenders to extend the loan terms, but there is no guarantee they will agree to new terms.

If Mercury cannot repay or refinance the $17 million in maturing loans, its lenders could foreclose on the properties used as collateral, further damaging Mercury's balance sheet. The company only has $5 million in unrestricted cash remaining on its balance sheet, raising concerns about its ability to continue operating without an infusion of new capital.

In a statement, Mercury's CEO John Smith said, “We are disappointed by this setback and the impact it has had on our shareholders. However, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the commercial real estate lending industry and Mercury's role in it.” Smith said the company plans to explore all strategic options to strengthen its balance sheet and continue operating.

The sharp selloff in Mercury's stock shows investors have serious doubts about the company's survival without a rescue by outside investors. Mercury's future remains highly uncertain until it can repay or refinance its maturing debts and raise additional capital. The next few weeks will be crucial for Mercury as it works to address its financial difficulties and regain the confidence of Wall Street.
