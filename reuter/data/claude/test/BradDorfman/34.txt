U.S. Retailers Expecting Single Digit Sales Growth in March, Fueled by Low-End Discounters

U.S. retailers are forecasting a modest increase in retail sales for the month of March, with growth primarily driven by discount chains and value-focused outlets catering to cost-conscious consumers. Overall, retail sales in the U.S. are expected to grow between 3 to 5 percent in March compared to the same month last year, according to industry forecasts. While a welcome increase, the growth would mark a slight slowdown from the 5.5 percent year-over-year increase reported for February.  

Retailers pointed to a number of factors driving the softness. Colder weather through much of March delayed the start of the spring shopping season for apparel and seasonal items. Uncertainty around tax refunds, the effects of tax cuts, and confusion over the implications of tariffs also contributed to shoppers tightening their budgets. At the same time, rising gas prices ate into disposable income for some consumers.

“There are a number of mixed signals for consumers right now that are translating to a bit more caution in spending,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. “But overall, the economy and job market remain strong, and it looks like the slowdown this month is only temporary.”

The retailers seeing the strongest growth in March are those appealing to more cost-conscious customers, including discounters like Dollar General and Dollar Tree, warehouse clubs like BJ’s Wholesale Club, and off-price retailers like TJX Companies, parent company of TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. These retailers are offering low prices and deals that resonate the most when money is tight. On the other end of the spectrum, department stores and mid-tier apparel chains are struggling the most, with same-store sales declining by high single digits.  

Retailers will be closely watching consumer confidence measures, tax refund activity, and other indicators in the coming weeks to determine if they need to make further adjustments to their forecasts for the spring season. Weather is also a wild card, with hopes that warmer temperatures in April and May will boost sales of seasonal merchandise and spur more shopping trips. Overall, retail sales for the full year are still expected to increase at a healthy pace, supported by low unemployment, higher wages, and elevated consumer confidence. But the single-digit growth numbers in March may be a sign of some volatility in the months ahead.
