Motorola files lawsuit against U.S. Robotics over high-speed modem technology patents 

Motorola Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit today against rival U.S. Robotics Corp., alleging that U.S. Robotics' high-speed modem technology violates six Motorola patents. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, escalates a long-running dispute over modem technology between two of the largest suppliers of high-speed modems used to connect personal computers to telephone lines.

Motorola claims U.S. Robotics' modems that allow connections of 56 kilobits per second, a common standard, incorporate technology covered by several Motorola patents issued in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “Motorola has pioneered many of the technologies that make high-speed modem connections possible today,” said John Motorola, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's Networking & Computing Systems Group. “We have no choice but to take action against companies that are illegally using our intellectual property.” 

U.S. Robotics vigorously denied the charges and vowed to defend itself. "Motorola's claims are entirely without merit,” said Casey Cowell, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Robotics. “This legal maneuvering appears aimed at stifling competition in the modem market, where U.S. Robotics' technology and modems clearly lead the industry.” U.S. Robotics said it had previously licensed some technology from Motorola but did not believe Motorola's current patents were essential to build high-speed modems meeting the 56-kilobit-per-second standard.

The two companies have been battling over modem technology and market share for over a decade. U.S. Robotics has led in developing and marketing high-speed modems for much of the 1990s, climbing to a 40 percent share of the market. But Motorola, a much larger supplier of wireless communications equipment and semiconductors, has been trying aggressively to build a strong position in the modem market, with a 27 percent share so far this year according to analysts.

The overall modem market has been growing quickly, fueled by the explosive growth of the Internet and e-commerce. But price competition has been intense, driving down profit margins for suppliers. Legal battles over intellectual property and strong-arm tactics appear to be on the rise as companies try to gain a competitive edge. The outcome of the Motorola-U.S. Robotics dispute could reshape competitive dynamics in the modem market, no matter which company prevails.
