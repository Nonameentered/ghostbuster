Mercury Finance Co. in Last-Minute Talks to Extend Short-Term Financing from Bank of America 

Mercury Finance Co., a mid-sized financial services firm based in Chicago, is in negotiations with Bank of America to extend $250 million in short-term funding that is set to mature next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The short-term notes were issued by Mercury six months ago to fund general operating expenses and new investments. However, Mercury's financial position has weakened in recent months due to losses in its mortgage lending division, making it difficult to repay the notes on time.

Bank of America, which provided the original short-term financing to Mercury, is in discussions to extend the loans for an additional three to six months, the sources said. The move would give Mercury some financial breathing room as it works to sell assets and cut costs. However, the talks are ongoing and there is no guarantee an agreement will be reached before the loan comes due on November 15.  

The on-again, off-again nature of the talks has added uncertainty for Mercury and its investors. The company's stock has dropped 35% over the past week on speculation it may face liquidity issues. Moody's Investors Service recently placed Mercury on negative watch, citing "substantial doubt" whether it could continue operating without new financing.

Mercury has been under pressure since its mortgage division generated heavy losses stemming from its exposure to risky homeowners. The losses have drained capital, triggering debt covenants and stiff financial penalties. If unable to extend the Bank of America loans, Mercury could face severe difficulties meeting its financial obligations to shareholders, bondholders, and other creditors.

Mercury and Bank of America declined to comment on private discussions. However, Mercury Chief Executive Michael Ross released a memo to staff on Friday morning announcing the possibility of job and cost cuts, saying "no idea is off the table" as senior leaders determine how to stabilize the business following "a series of profound setbacks." The steps are necessary to qualify for financing, lift investor confidence, and return company performance to match its "historic strengths," he said.
