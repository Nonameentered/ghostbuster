Mercury Finance Co. Plummets, Unable to Pay $17 Million in Commercial Debt Due the Same Day

Mercury Finance Co., a commercial lending firm based in Chicago, collapsed today after defaulting on $17 million in short-term loans that came due. The abrupt bankruptcy sent shockwaves through the financial industry as the once fast-growing Mercury was unable to make good on obligations to multiple creditors. 

Founded in 2012, Mercury Finance positioned itself as an alternative lender for small- and mid-sized businesses that were unable to obtain credit from traditional banks. The firm grew quickly by originating high-interest loans to risky companies at annual percentage rates often exceeding 20 percent. This high-margin lending strategy initially proved highly profitable for Mercury and its investors.

However, industry experts noted that Mercury’s breakneck growth also made the company increasingly vulnerable to downturns or defaults in its loan portfolio. "Mercury was really riding the bull market,” said Mark Jameson, an analyst at the research firm Investor’s Watch. “When you lend to risky companies at high interest rates, things can be great until there are problems, and then the floor gives out from under you.”

The floor gave out for Mercury today in dramatic fashion. According to documents filed in Chicago bankruptcy court, the company depended entirely on short-term loans from other lenders to fund its longer-term loans to business customers. But after several of Mercury’s own borrowers defaulted recently, the company was unable to make $17 million in payments due today across nine credit facilities. 

With no new sources of capital available and its short-term lenders now unwilling to grant extensions, Mercury had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. A court-appointed trustee will now work to liquidate Mercury’s remaining assets in an effort to repay at least part of what the company owes its creditors. However, most experts believe the overall losses will be substantial.

The plight of Mercury Finance highlights the risks of dependence on short-term lending markets, which can quickly dry up in the face of trouble. It also shows how the reckless pursuit of growth above all else can jeopardize a company’s viability. For Mercury’s borrowers, its demise means the loss of a key source of funding along with the likelihood of paying higher interest rates elsewhere, if they are able to obtain new financing at all following Mercury’s collapse.

In the end, an obsession with high-margin growth coupled with risky short-term funding brought Mercury Finance down in a single day. The firm’s chaotic unraveling is sure to send shivers through the ranks of the investment world and put the remaining players in the alternative lending industry on notice. For now, all that remains of Mercury is an empty shell—and a sobering lesson in how fragile certain financial edifices can be.
