USG Corp Aims to Double Earnings by Early 2000s through Production Expansion and Cost Cutting   

USG Corporation, a leading manufacturer of building materials, announced an ambitious plan today to double its earnings over the next 3 to 5 years through significant expansion of production capacity and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company expects earnings per share to reach $5 to $6 by 2003 or 2004, up from $2.53 in 1999. 

“We see tremendous opportunities for growth in our key markets, and this strategic plan will position us to capitalize on increasing demand for our products, especially in commercial and residential construction,” said USG CEO Bill Foote. The centerpiece of the plan involves spending $500 million over the next few years to upgrade and expand production facilities for wallboard and other gypsum products. The company's wallboard plants, in particular, have been operating at high capacity utilization rates. The new investments will increase USG's wallboard production capacity by over 2 billion square feet by 2004.

The company also announced a cost-reduction target of $150 million over the time period. The cuts will come from reduced raw materials usage, lower transportation costs, and improved operational efficiencies. "Controlling costs has been a key focus for us, and we see significant potential for further progress," said Foote. 

USG expects the construction market to remain strong for the foreseeable future, buoyed by factors like low interest rates, a tight housing supply, and an aging housing stock in need of repair. Demand has been especially high for USG's Sheetrock-branded wallboard. Foote said USG's optimism is based on these favorable demand trends and the expectation that USG will gain market share during this period of growth.

Some analysts questioned whether the earnings target is too ambitious given the cyclical nature of the construction industry. USG's stock price has tripled over the past five years, and some think it is due for a correction. However, others see the strategic investments and cost-cutting moves as shrewd. “Even if construction growth slows down, USG will be in a good position to continue increasing profits through their internal initiatives," said George Bellows, an analyst at J.P. Morgan. USG trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol USG.
