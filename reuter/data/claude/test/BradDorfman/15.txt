Hyatt Hotels to Spend $1 Billion on Acquiring 20-30 Upscale Hotels in North America and the Caribbean 

Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced today that it plans to spend $1 billion to acquire upscale hotels in North America and the Caribbean over the next two years. The hotel giant is looking to purchase 20 to 30 properties in cities and resort destinations to boost its presence in the upscale segment of the hospitality market.

“We see tremendous opportunity for growth in the upscale hotel space, especially in North America,” said Mark Hoplamazian, President and CEO of Hyatt Hotels Corporation. “Over the past decade, many independent upscale hotels were built across the continent and in the Caribbean. Now, as the hotel cycle matures, many owners are looking to capitalize on their investments by selling these properties. Hyatt is in a prime position, with a strong balance sheet and experience integrating new hotels, to acquire these high-quality assets at attractive prices.”

The upscale hotel segment, which includes brands like Hyatt's Centric and Andaz properties as well as independent hotels, has been growing over the past several years. Business and leisure travelers with higher spending power are fueling demand for hotels with unique designs, upscale amenities, locally-inspired food and beverage, and premium service. According to data from STR, upscale hotel occupancy in North America increased 1.1% last year to 77.2% while revenue per available room, or RevPAR, grew 2.7% to $161.54.

With this acquisition plan, Hyatt is aiming to gain market share in cities like New York, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and Austin where upscale hotels have performed exceptionally well. The company is also looking to purchase beach and golf resorts in Florida, the Caribbean, Hawaii and Southern California to tap into the strong leisure travel demand in those destinations. Potential brands for these acquisitions include the luxury Park Hyatt and resort-focused Andaz and Alila Hotels brands in addition to the upscale Centric brand for city center hotels.  

The $1 billion for these acquisitions will come from Hyatt's revolving credit facility and additional financing. Hoplamazian said the company will remain disciplined in its approach and will only purchase hotels that meet strict return thresholds and complement Hyatt's existing portfolio. The acquisition plan is expected to drive healthy returns and long-term value for Hyatt and its shareholders. With its strong financial position and proven track record with recent acquisitions like the Miraval and Exhale spa brands, Hyatt seems poised to successfully execute this upscale growth strategy.
