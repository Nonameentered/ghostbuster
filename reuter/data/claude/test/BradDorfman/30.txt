First Bank System to Expand Its Footprint with $9 Billion Acquisition of U.S. Bancorp in the Pacific Northwest

Midwest regional bank First Bank System announced today that it has agreed to acquire U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Oregon for $9 billion in stock and cash. The deal would expand First Bank’s operations into the Pacific Northwest for the first time and significantly increase its assets and deposits. 

First Bank, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has over 500 branches across Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. The acquisition of U.S. Bancorp, which has 350 branches across Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California, would expand First Bank’s retail banking network by more than 60% and give it a presence in several fast-growing Western markets.

“This acquisition is a rare opportunity to instantly expand into dynamic and thriving markets on the West Coast,” said First Bank CEO James Smith in a statement. “U.S. Bancorp is a very attractive business with a loyal customer base, and together we will have greater capabilities to serve more customers across a larger part of the country.”

Under the terms of the agreement, First Bank would acquire U.S. Bancorp for a combination of stock and cash currently valued at $400 million. The deal values U.S. Bancorp at approximately $9 billion. Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp would receive 0.7 shares of First Bank stock and $25 in cash for each U.S. Bancorp share they own.

The deal has been approved by the boards of directors at both companies but still requires regulatory approval and approval by shareholders at U.S. Bancorp. If approved, the deal is expected to close by early next year. 

Smith noted that there is little overlap between the two banks, so the combined company expects to achieve $250 million in annual cost savings by 2021 through consolidating corporate and back-office functions. The deal is also expected to provide revenue synergies as First Bank markets additional products like wealth management and mortgage lending to U.S. Bancorp customers.

While bank mergers have faced increasing scrutiny from regulators in recent years, analysts said this deal appears straightforward with minimal antitrust issues given the lack of market overlap. The expansion would vault the combined company into a top 20 U.S. bank by assets, increasing scale and geographic diversification. Shares of both First Bank and U.S. Bancorp rose 4% on news of the deal, signaling investor confidence the acquisition can be completed.
