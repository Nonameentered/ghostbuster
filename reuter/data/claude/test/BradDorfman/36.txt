Midwest Regional Banks Continue to See Double-Digit Earnings Growth in Q1 Despite Potential Credit Concerns and Rate Increase

Mid-sized regional banks in the Midwest continued to report strong double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter of 2018, boosted by increasing loans and fee income. Although analysts worry about the impact of rising interest rates and loosening credit standards, bank executives remain optimistic about outlook for the rest of the year. 

First Midwest Bancorp, based in Illinois, saw net income rise 15% to $48.6 million from a year earlier, while Wisconsin's Associated Banc-Corp posted a 14% increase in net income to $61.5 million. Ohio-based First Financial Bancorp reported a 10% boost in earnings to $28.5 million. The banks benefited from higher consumer and commercial lending, especially in residential mortgages, commercial real estate and auto loans. Fees from debit cards, credit cards and wealth management also contributed to the gains.

However, some analysts caution that the rate of earnings growth may slow in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates again in March and has signaled two more increases this year. Although higher rates often boost bank profits at first, they make lending less attractive for consumers and businesses over time. Lower demand could curb loan growth and squeeze profit margins for regional banks.

At the same time, some observers worry that competitive pressures are leading smaller banks to loosen underwriting standards, especially for commercial real estate deals. If borrowers were to default in larger numbers, nonperforming loans could rise and pinch bank earnings down the road. 

Bank executives acknowledge the challenges but remain upbeat. “If rates go up again, there may be some short-term impact, but it reflects a strong, growing economy, which is good for banks in the long run,” said First Midwest CEO Michael Scudder. His counterparts at Associated and First Financial offered similar views, citing their banks’ geographical and business line diversity as buffers against any potential slowdown.

With double-digit earnings growth, solid loan pipelines and the prospect of slightly higher net interest margins, Midwest regional banks appear poised to sustain their momentum into the second half of 2018 barring unforeseen economic turbulence. But analysts will be watching closely for any signs that higher rates or weaker discipline might undercut their performance. Overall, though, the first quarter results suggest these regional banks remain well-positioned to gain further ground.
