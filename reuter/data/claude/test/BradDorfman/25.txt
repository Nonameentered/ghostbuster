Sears to Invest over $500 Million in Off-Mall Tire and Battery Stores with National Tire and Battery Name  

Sears Holdings Corp announced today plans to invest more than $500 million over the next three years to rebrand and refurbish its auto service stores under the name National Tire and Battery, or NTB. The investment shows Sears' increased focus on its automotive business, which has been one of the few bright spots in the company's broader retail business.

Sears has already converted over 300 of its existing Sears Auto Centers to the NTB brand, and it plans to convert an additional 600 locations by 2021. This will result in nearly 1,000 freestanding NTB locations separated from its mall anchor stores across the U.S. Rebranding the stores under the well-known NTB name will allow them to tap into an established tire and battery customer base and help shed the declining public perception of the broader Sears brand. 

"There's a fantastic opportunity to accelerate our automotive services business with the National Tire and Battery brand as we transform Sears into a membership model," said Sears CEO Eddie Lampert. The NTB stores will offer a full range of tires, parts, and auto maintenance services for customers in the 45 states where Sears currently operates stores. The rebranding effort includes new signage, product displays, and promotions to emphasize the strength of the NTB brand and attract new customers.

Sears acquired the NTB and Tire Kingdom brands in 2005 for $1.8 billion to bolster its auto service offerings. However, it struggled to effectively integrate the brands, and many customers remained unaware that the brands were owned by Sears. By divesting the NTB stores from its traditional mall anchor locations, Sears aims to leverage the established brand as its own standalone entity and better compete with large national tire retailers like Goodyear and Firestone.

The investment in the NTB brand and stores is a rare bright spot in the midst of Sears' continual declines in sales and profits in recent  years. Comparable store sales at Sears and Kmart stores have dropped nearly 50 percent in the last decade. Sears has closed over 3,500 stores - more than half of its locations -  and cut over 200,000 jobs during that time in efforts to stabilize the company. The embattled retailer has relied on funding from CEO Eddie Lampert to stay afloat as traditional lenders have cut ties.

Sears hopes the rebranding of its auto service centers and the NTB investment will fuel a turnaround for at least one division of the company. The NTB conversion is expected to complete in early 2021, though the effort could face delays if Sears is unable to secure additional funding to keep operations running in the interim. Regardless of its troubles,  Sears remains an iconic American brand, and the rejuvenation of National Tire and Battery could represent a shred of hope for this historic company.
