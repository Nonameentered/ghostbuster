Head of Britain's Financial Watchdog Blames Investment Banking Failures on Volatile Markets and Lack of Control

The Chief Executive of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Andrew Bailey blamed the recent collapse of several small investment banks on a combination of volatile financial markets and a lack of risk control at the firms. Speaking at a banking industry conference in London, Bailey said the FCA had reviewed the demise of several mid-size investment banks over the last six months and found common failures in risk management and governance.

"In an environment of market turbulence, weak risk controls and poor governance are a toxic combination," Bailey said. "These firms lacked the necessary controls and oversight to navigate difficult market conditions, and boards did not have enough independence and experience to effectively challenge executive decisions." 

The comments come after the failure of London investment banks Beaufort Securities and Alpha Beta Capital in recent months. The FCA has criticized both firms for having inadequate capital buffers, risk management systems, and board oversight. Bailey said the FCA would be tightening rules around investment bank governance and risk controls over the coming months to address these issues.

However, Bailey also acknowledged that volatile financial markets played a role in the collapse of these firms. "Market volatility has significantly impacted revenues and funding at many mid-size investment banks, strained their resources, and in some cases overwhelmed their systems and controls," he said. The FCA is reviewing new policy options to ensure investment banks have stronger balance sheets and access to emergency funding. 

Bailey's comments highlighted the challenges facing mid-size and smaller investment banks in Britain. Stricter regulation since the financial crisis has disproportionately burdened these firms relative to much larger competitors. At the same time, ultra-low interest rates have made it difficult to generate income from traditional business lines. While policy interventions may help, some analysts argue consolidation may be necessary for the long term stability of Britain's investment banking sector.

"The market is too fragmented, with many small players struggling to achieve minimum efficient scale," said Brian Crossland, a banking analyst at Shoreham Capital. "Policymakers need to encourage more mergers and acquisitions so we have fewer, larger investment banks that can spread their costs over a bigger base and have the scale to invest in risk management."

Bailey said the FCA would not directly push for more consolidation but would engage with mid-size investment banks to discuss ways they can strengthen their resilience and competitiveness. The regulator wants to find the right balance between encouraging competition and innovation in the sector while also ensuring firms have robust risk controls and business models. Overall, Bailey said the FCA aiming for an investment banking industry with sustainable medium and long-term growth.
