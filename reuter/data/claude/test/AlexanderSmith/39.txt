NatWest Bank Reveals Nearly Double the Amount of Derivatives Losses Than Previously Thought

NatWest Group, one of the largest banks in the UK, revealed losses from derivatives trading nearly double than what it had previously disclosed to investors. In an announcement today, NatWest said its losses from complex derivatives positions amounted to £1.8 billion in the first half of this year, significantly higher than the £980 million loss it reported in June.

The huge increase in losses stemmed from "unwinding trades that went bad," according to a NatWest spokesperson. The spokesperson said the bank had unwound some loss-making positions in interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives over the past two months, crystallizing the losses. The updated losses announcement came as a shock to investors, wiping out nearly 8% of NatWest's stock price in morning trading.

The much higher than expected losses are an embarrassment for NatWest as it tries to rehabilitate its image following a series of risk management and compliance failures over the past decade. NatWest paid billions in fines for interest rate rigging and US sanctions violations up until 2015. The bank has pledged to overhaul its risk and compliance systems to avoid such failures in the future.

However, the surge in derivatives losses raises questions about risk control at the bank once again. "This significant increase in losses from unwinding bad derivative positions suggests risk management may still be lacking at NatWest," said a banking analyst for Credit Suisse in London. The analyst noted that losses of this magnitude "should not come out of the blue for a well-managed bank with robust risk controls."

In its announcement, NatWest said the increased losses would not materially impact the bank's financial position and that it remained "well-capitalized and profitable." But investors appeared rattled, concerned about other "surprises" that could be in store. NatWest CEO Alison Rose sent an internal memo to staff apologizing for the uncertainty and pledging an immediate review of its derivatives trading and risk management practices. 

The story is likely to reignite a debate about derivatives regulation in the UK. Stricter rules and higher capital requirements for complex derivatives were put in place after the global financial crisis, but some critics argue more should be done to curb derivatives speculation by major banks. The NatWest losses also highlight the opacity of the derivatives market, with positions and losses often not transparent until unwound.

With its reputation at stake, NatWest now faces an uphill battle to reassure stakeholders about its risk management competence and control over nearly £500 billion in assets. The bank is firmly in the spotlight again, for all the wrong reasons once more. Investors and analysts will be watching NatWest's next moves closely to judge whether this episode is a temporary blip or indicative of deeper issues still left unaddressed.
