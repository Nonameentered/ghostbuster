NatWest Markets CEO admits unacceptable 77 million stg loss from mispricing since 1994 

The Chief Executive of NatWest Markets, Robert Begbie, today issued a statement admitting that the investment bank had incurred losses of nearly 77 million British pounds over the past 25 years due to mispricing certain financial products. In an email to all staff, Begbie said the losses were “completely unacceptable” and that the bank would be conducting an internal review to determine how the mispricing occurred and went undetected for so long.  

NatWest Markets is the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, one of the largest retail and commercial banks in the UK. According to Begbie’s statement, an internal audit discovered that certain complex structured derivative products had been mispriced between 1994 and 2019, resulting in a total loss of 76.8 million pounds. The mispricing meant that NatWest Markets was undercharging certain institutional clients for these products over multiple years. 

“There are no excuses for such a systematic failure of our controls and compliance measures over a prolonged period of time,” Begbie said in the statement. “Our clients put their faith in us, and we have clearly let them down in this case.” 

NatWest Markets has brought in consultants from McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm, to conduct a “root and branch” review of the bank’s product pricing policies and procedures. All staff bonuses at NatWest Markets, including executive level bonuses, are being suspended pending the outcome of McKinsey’s review.

Shares of NatWest Group fell by over 4 percent following the announcement as investors reacted to the news of the mispricing issues and potential control problems at the bank. Several analysts downgraded NatWest Group, citing concerns about the apparent failures in risk management and the possible impact on the group’s reputation.

One analyst, Thomas Barron of HSBC, said: “The scale and duration of these mispricing losses highlights serious questions around risk control and financial oversight at NatWest Markets. You have to worry that if pricing controls were this weak, what other risk or compliance problems might be lurking within the operation.”

However, other analysts suggested that while the mispricing loss was worrying, the proactive disclosure from Begbie and the external review signaled that new management was confronting these issues. “The CEO and new team at NatWest Markets deserve credit for bringing these legacy problems to light and taking swift action,” said Georgina Peters, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse. “Ultimately, the scale of this mispricing, while embarrassing, will not significantly impact NatWest Group’s balance sheet or solvency position.”

The review by McKinsey & Company is expected to be completed by the end of August, at which time NatWest Group will announce the initial findings and outline steps NatWest Markets is taking to strengthen its controls and compliance to prevent similar issues from happening again. Begbie reiterated his commitment “to building a culture where we meet the highest ethical standards and win back the trust of our clients and stakeholders.”
