"Superwoman" fund manager Nicola Horlick resigns from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, plans legal action for "constructive dismissal" 

Nicola Horlick, the star fund manager once dubbed "Superwoman" for juggling a high-powered career and six children, has resigned from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell after 22 years with the firm. Horlick has announced plans to pursue legal action against her former employer for "constructive dismissal."

Horlick tendered her resignation in a letter to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell on Friday, citing irreconcilable differences with senior management. The move brings to an end Horlick's long and storied career with the investment bank, where she built her reputation as one of the City of London's most successful fund managers.

Sources close to Horlick say tensions with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell executives came to a head in recent months over disagreements on investment strategy and management of her funds. Horlick felt marginalized and hamstrung in her ability to deliver returns for investors. The final straw came last week when executives removed Horlick from managing one of her high-performing funds with more than Â£500 million in assets.  

In her resignation letter, Horlick wrote: "Over the past two years, I have found myself increasingly constrained in the investment decisions I can take to fulfill my obligations to investors ... I no longer feel I can achieve what investors pay me for." She added that she plans to consult solicitors regarding pursuing a claim for constructive dismissal. Under UK law, constructive dismissal refers to situations where employers make working conditions so intolerable that employees have no choice but to leave.

Horlick, 56, joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in 1994 to build up its asset management arm. She went on to become head of its UK growth funds team and built a reputation for strong returns, especially for smaller company funds. Known for her outspoken style, Horlick has also become a prominent voice advocating for women in the male-dominated fund management industry. Her acrimonious split from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is poised to send shockwaves through the City.

Deutsche Bank, the parent company of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, expressed regret at Horlick's departure in a statement: "We are disappointed that despite our best efforts we were unable to resolve recent concerns raised by Nicola about her role and responsibilities." The firm also said it will defend itself vigorously against any claim of constructive dismissal.

The episode is a bitter end to a once promising partnership. Investors will be watching closely as the legendary "Superwoman" embarks on her next act.
