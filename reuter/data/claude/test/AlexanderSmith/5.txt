Pension fund clients reassess relations with Morgan Grenfell amidst ongoing dispute with former fund manager Nicola Horlick 

Several major pension fund clients of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management are reviewing their relationships with the firm following the protracted legal dispute between the company and star former fund manager Nicola Horlick. Sources close to the pension funds say there are concerns over the reputational damage caused by the ongoing court cases and a loss of focus on investment performance.

Horlick, one of the City of London’s best-known fund managers, left Morgan Grenfell in acrimonious circumstances in 2017 to set up her own boutique fund management firm, Money Honey Management. She filed a constructive dismissal and sex discrimination claim against her former employer which was rejected in an employment tribunal last year but is now the subject of an appeal. 

In the meantime, Horlick has also launched a multi-million pound claim in the High Court for unpaid bonuses which she argues were owed under the terms of her contract. Morgan Grenfell rejects her claims and has counter-sued for damages caused by what it alleges were derogatory comments made by Horlick on social media and in press interviews.

The messy legal battle and the substantial management time required to deal with the disputes have raised concerns among Morgan Grenfell’s client base. “We have a duty to monitor our fund managers closely and this ongoing saga has naturally caused us to review the situation,” said one pension fund trustee who asked not to be named.

Morgan Grenfell continues to outperform the wider market and compared to industry benchmarks, but some pension funds worry that senior executives have been distracted by the court cases. There is also a risk that more fund managers will follow Horlick’s lead and walk out, exacerbating staff turnover and instability.

However, other pension fund clients have expressed support for Morgan Grenfell and view the dispute with Horlick as a one-off that will not impact long-term investment performance. "While the publicity surrounding this case is unfortunate, we believe it will have little bearing on Morgan Grenfell’s ability to continue generating positive returns over time," said John Holt, chief investment officer at the Thames Valley Pension Fund.  

Morgan Grenfell maintains that for the most part its clients have been understanding and that inflows have remained strong despite the dispute. However, sources say the firm recognises the need to bring the legal cases to a conclusion as swiftly as possible to prevent further damage to key client relationships and its reputation. With no end in sight, the longer term implications for Morgan Grenfell hang in the balance.
