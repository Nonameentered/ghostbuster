Nicola Horlick, Dubbed "Superwoman" Fund Manager, Resigns from Morgan Grenfell Amid Legal Action  

Nicola Horlick, the star fund manager once hailed as the "Superwoman" of the City of London's financial district, has resigned from her position as head of asset management at Morgan Grenfell. The surprise move comes amid legal troubles at her boutique investment firm Bramdean Asset Management.

Horlick, 58, built a reputation as one of Britain's most successful money managers over the last 25 years. She earned the "Superwoman" moniker after starting her career at SG Warburg in the 1980s while raising six children. She went on to hold senior roles at Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche Bank before launching Bramdean in 2005.

Bramdean has come under scrutiny in recent months after U.S. prosecutors filed a civil forfeiture claim against a fund linked to the firm. The claim relates to allegations of a multimillion-dollar Russian money laundering scheme. Bramdean has denied all wrongdoing and has not been formally accused of any illegal activity, though questions have arisen over its due diligence procedures.  

The legal troubles likely played a role in Horlick's abrupt departure from Morgan Grenfell, a division of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, where she had been head of asset management since late 2018. A source close to the situation said the Russian fund issues have been an "embarrassment" for Deutsche Bank and created headaches with compliance. While the bank has backed Horlick, her position was seen as "untenable" due to the optics of the situation, the source said.

In a statement to the media, Horlick said she had "greatly enjoyed" her time at Morgan Grenfell but decided to leave to focus her efforts on fighting the U.S. civil claim and "restoring the reputation of my business." She said she remains committed to Bramdean's success and will "vigorously defend" the firm from "unfounded" legal challenges.  

Horlick's exit adds to turmoil for Deutsche Bank's asset management unit, which has seen assets under management decline in recent years. Her resignation could reignite debate over the treatment of high-profile female executives in the male-dominated finance industry. Horlick was seen as a trailblazer for women in her field when Bramdean launched, though she has acknowledged facing misogyny and double standards in her career. 

With Horlick leaving, focus now turns to the future of Bramdean Asset Management. Sources said the legal issues have strained some client and investor relationships, putting pressure on the firm if the matters are not resolved quickly. For her part, Horlick said Bramdean's business "remains robust" despite the challenges. The coming months may determine whether that proves to be the case.
