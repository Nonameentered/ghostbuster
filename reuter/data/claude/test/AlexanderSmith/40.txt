NatWest Bank Reveals Nearly Double the Derivatives Losses and Suspends Senior Staff in Bid to Restore Confidence

NatWest Bank stunned investors today by revealing that losses from failed derivative trades were nearly double the amount previously disclosed last month. The UK's second largest bank reported losses of £840 million, up from the £440 million reported in February. The latest losses stem from trades made by a "rogue trader" based in the bank's London office, according to CEO Alison Rose. 

"We are deeply disappointed to report further substantial losses from unauthorized derivative trading within our investment banking unit," Rose said in a statement. The CEO announced an immediate suspension of four senior managers who oversaw the team involved in the trades. An independent review conducted by a leading accounting firm found "serious lack of controls and oversight" that allowed the rogue employee to take large, risky positions over several months without detection.  

The latest losses represent a major blow for the bank as it seeks to repair trust with shareholders and UK regulators. NatWest's shares plunged nearly 20% in early trading on news of the expanded losses before recovering slightly. The stock is down more than 35% this year. Some analysts worry the bank may need to raise additional capital to offset the hits to its balance sheet.

NatWest first disclosed the initial £440 million in losses in February, terminating the employee responsible for the trades which involved complex options and futures contracts. At the time, Rose said the bank believed losses were contained and that the incident reflected "a basic failure of controls" that would be addressed quickly. However, the independent review found additional losses accumulated over the previous three months, undetected due to poor compliance monitoring and a lack of internal safeguards.  

"The scale of these additional losses shows a frightening lack of discipline within NatWest's investment banking operations," said Tom Stevenson, an investment director at investment firm Fidelity International. "Investors will rightly question whether this is an isolated issue or indicative of deeper problems with the bank's risk management practices."

In her statement today, Rose announced a number of reforms to avoid future lapses, including creating a new senior compliance officer role that will report directly to the CEO. The bank also will implement new controls to monitor trading positions and set limits in its investment banking business. Two trading desk managers were among the four employees suspended pending the outcome of the bank's internal disciplinary process.

The latest revelations are a humbling setback for Rose, who took over as CEO last year with a goal of reorganizing bank operations to avoid compliance failures of the past. NatWest was bailed out by UK taxpayers during the financial crisis after suffering heavy losses from exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. While the bank has since repaid government funds, its struggles today show how difficult instilling a culture of risk control can be for institutions with complex trading operations.

NatWest's expanded losses will likely invite additional scrutiny from the Bank of England, which only last month removed some additional oversight imposed on the bank after the initial disclosure of losses. While not a full retreat to "special measures" status, any slippage on risk controls threatens to undermine NatWest's goal of operating independently from government monitoring, analysts noted. Rose acknowledged the bank has "much work to do" to redeem credibility with regulators and shareholders in order restore confidence in its turnaround effort.
