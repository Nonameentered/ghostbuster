Hambro Countrywide Prepares for Further Growth Amid Housing Market Recovery

Hambro Countrywide, the UK's leading residential property services group, announced plans to continue expansion to capture growth in the recovering housing market. The company reported strong first half results, with revenue up 18% year over year and operating profit increasing 36%. 

"The UK housing market continues to strengthen, and we are well positioned to benefit from the upturn," said CEO James Heappey. "Our lettings, property management, and mortgage intermediary businesses are all performing very well. And we have ambitious plans for our estate agency division, where we are investing heavily to gain further market share."

Hambro Countrywide's lettings business grew revenue by 22% in the first half, driven by higher rental prices and occupancy rates. The company cited a structural undersupply of homes and greater demand for rented property from would-be first-time buyers struggling to afford deposits for home purchases. Hambro Countrywide expects further growth in the lettings market and plans to roll out more “Hambro Let” brand branches around the country.

Meanwhile, Hambro Countrywide’s mortgages business benefited from record low interest rates and the stamp duty holiday, with revenue jumping 25%. The company has been hiring more mortgage advisers to handle increased demand. “The mortgage market will only get busier as lenders launch more competitive products for home buyers and remortgagers,” said Richard Taylor, Managing Director of Mortgages. “We are recruiting aggressively to ensure we have the scale to help as many customers as possible.”

Hambro Countrywide's estate agency division is also poised for growth after a restructuring. Revenue grew 10% in the first half following the closure of underperforming branches and investment in new technology. According to CEO Heappey, “Our revamped estate agency business has market-leading online capabilities and a refocused branch network, leaving us extremely well placed to capitalize on improving transaction volumes.”

The upbeat results and outlook contrast with the troubled times faced by some of Hambro Countrywide’s rivals. "While parts of the property industry have struggled in recent years with structural changes and macroeconomic pressures, we have invested through the cycle to build a strong platform for growth,” said Heappey. “Our clear strategy, diversified business model, and focus on customer service should enable us to continue gaining share regardless of short term fluctuations.”  

With its largest business segments accelerating and new initiatives gaining traction, Hambro Countrywide appears poised to maintain momentum even if Brexit-related uncertainty impacts parts of the property market. The company reiterated its target to double revenue and profit over the next five years, cementing its position as the leading integrated property services provider in the UK.
