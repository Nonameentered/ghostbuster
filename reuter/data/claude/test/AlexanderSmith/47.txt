Former Barings Treasury Chief Refuses to be Bound by Financial Market Watchdog Rules, Banned for Three Years  

The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK watchdog charged with regulating the financial markets, announced today that it has banned former Barings Bank treasury chief Simon Black from working in any key position in a UK bank for three years. The FCA said that Black was not a "fit and proper person"  to hold a significant role in the financial services industry due to his repeated failures to comply with rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to prevent excessive risk-taking.

Black was the head of treasury at Barings from 2005 to 2015, during which time he expanded the treasury division into new financial instruments and trading strategies. An FCA investigation into Barings found that Black ignored regulations around reporting lines of authority, violated limits on trading positions, and disregarded rules around transparency and oversight of high-risk trading activities. The FCA found that these actions represented a failure to comply with rules put in place to shore up risk management and governance in banks following the financial crisis.   

Despite warnings from the FCA, Black refused to change his approach and address the regulator's concerns. The FCA argued that his willful disregard for the rules meant he could not be trusted to run a key division of a financial firm. Black resigned from Barings in 2015 as the FCA investigation escalated.

In its final report, the FCA said that Black "failed to act with integrity and lacked competence and capability" in his role as head of treasury. His actions posed serious risks to Barings and its clients, regulators concluded. While Barings has addressed the compliance failures and made necessary changes to systems and controls, the FCA said it had banned Black from working in banking for three years to "promote high standards of conduct and competence."  

Black could not be reached for comment on the FCA's report and ban. His lawyers previously argued that Black's actions were "in line with the norm across the industry" at the time and that he had been made a "scapegoat" for more systemic failures in banking. Barings paid a record fine of Â£564 million in 2016 relating to compliance failures that occurred under Black's management of the treasury division.
