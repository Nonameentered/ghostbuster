Woolwich members vote to convert to publicly listed bank and receive share windfall 

Members of Woolwich plc, one of Britain's largest building societies, today voted overwhelmingly in favor of converting the organization into a publicly listed bank. More than 83% of members who participated in the vote chose to convert Woolwich into a bank and receive shares in the new public company. 

The conversion will allow Woolwich to access new sources of capital to fund its residential and commercial mortgage lending business. As a mutually-owned building society, Woolwich's only source of capital was member deposits and retained earnings. Becoming a publicly listed bank will allow Woolwich to issue shares and raise funds from public equity markets.

"This is a pivotal moment in Woolwich's history," said Simon Peters, Woolwich's Chief Executive. "Converting to a bank and becoming a publicly listed company is vital to ensure we have a sustainable capital structure to support long-term growth. Member support for this strategy is very gratifying and we appreciate the trust members have placed in the Board and management team."

Under the terms of the conversion, Woolwich's 3.2 million members will receive free shares in the new bank based on their average savings and mortgage balances over the past two years. The total value of shares being gifted to members is £1.8 billion. The shares will commence trading on the London Stock Exchange next month under the ticker symbol "WLGH".

Many members were eager to gain exposure to Woolwich's growth potential as a listed bank. "I've banked with Woolwich for over 30 years so I'm excited to become a shareholder in the business," said Michael P., a long-time Woolwich customer.  "The shares are a nice way for loyal customers to participate in Woolwich's future success."

However, some members expressed concern about the loss of mutuality.  As a mutually-owned organization, Woolwich previously returned excess profits to members through better savings and mortgage rates. The switch to shareholder ownership means profits will now be distributed via share price appreciation and dividends.

"I worry Woolwich will become more profit-focused as a listed bank and lose sight of the customer," said Jane W., a mortgage borrowing member. "Mutuality ensured customers came before profits and there's no guarantee a bank will have the same priorities."

In an effort to address concerns, Woolwich has committed to appointing an independent “Customer Champion” to its Board, established a customer advocacy committee, and will link executive remuneration to customer satisfaction targets. Woolwich believes these steps will help balance the interests of both shareholders and customers in the new bank.

The conversion to a bank is expected to complete by the end of the month. Woolwich will join a number of other former building societies, including Halifax, Abbey National and Bradford & Bingley, in becoming publicly listed banks. While the end of mutuality is bittersweet, access to new capital will help ensure Woolwich remains a strong, independent competitor in the UK banking market. Overall, members have given the conversion a strong vote of confidence, attracted by the promise of a share in Woolwich's future growth and success.
