Labour Party Plans Regulatory Reform, Not Revolution, for Financial Services Industry

The Labour party today announced plans for wide-ranging reforms of the UK's financial services regulation if elected, but promised not to initiate major radical changes. Speaking at a conference in London, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said a Labour government would implement tougher rules and oversight for banks and other finance companies, but would not pursue blunt policies like breaking up major banks.  

"Finance is too important to the overall economy to be put at risk by radical experiments," McDonnell said. "We will take a measured, pragmatic approach to regulation that protects consumers and the stability of the system without causing unnecessary disruption." He explained that while some stricter enforcement of existing rules and greater penalties for violations would come into force immediately, some more substantial reforms, such as greater transparency requirements for retail financial institutions, would be implemented over time to allow for consultation with industry groups.

The plans are a marked shift in Labour's tone on financial services policy compared with previous leader Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn and his allies previously called for the "socialization" of major banks by taking them into public ownership. But under Keir Starmer's more moderate leadership, Labour is now positioning itself as a steward of fair and responsible pro-market policies. McDonnell affirmed that a Labour government would keep banks in private hands but work to promote lending and reinvestment. 

Reaction from finance industry executives was mixed but broadly positive. A spokesman for the chief executives at Britain's six largest banks said the proposals were "sensible and realistic." However, some analysts argue the promised changes may not go far enough. "Minor tweaks to enforcement are better than nothing but won't fix underlying problems in the sector around incentives for irresponsible lending, lack of real competition, and dominant market power of legacy institutions," said a managing director of a London think tank who declined to be identified by name criticizing the policy.

Consumer groups were more enthusiastic. Terry French at Citizens Advice called the proposals "a step in the right direction" for fairer practices and putting consumers' interests first. However, French noted the lack of specifics in the plans around tackling issues like high overdraft fees, irresponsible advertising of credit products and disproportionate impacts of financial problems on disadvantaged groups. "The credibility of these proposals will depend on the details and timelines for action in these critical areas," he said. 

The policy proposals set the stage for a wider debate on the future of financial regulation and may attract attention from regulators and central bankers in addition to politicians and industry figures. McDonnell said Labour would take all input into account in developing a balanced set of reforms in the coming months before the next election. Overall, the new plans signalled a maturation in Labour's policymaking on economic issues and a pivot to the mainstream, but critics argue they need significantly more substance and ambition to match the scale of required change.
