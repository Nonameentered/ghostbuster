Morgan Grenfell Asset Management Freezes Personal Assets of Fund Manager Amid Suspicion of Irregularities in Funds   

Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, one of the UK's largest investment management firms, has frozen the personal assets of one of its top fund managers amid an internal investigation into irregularities in several investment funds managed by the executive.  

The firm announced that it has placed immediate restrictions on the personal trading accounts and asset holdings of Jeremy Sanders, who oversees more than £2 billion in assets across three equity income funds and one UK growth fund. Sanders has been with Morgan Grenfell for 12 years and was considered one of the firm's star managers based on fund performance over the last several years.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Morgan Grenfell’s compliance team uncovered potentially concerning discrepancies during a routine reconciliation of fund positions and Sanders’ personal trading records. The firm’s chief investment officer and board of directors were informed, and they decided to suspend Sanders’ authority over the funds and launch a complete audit of the funds and Sanders’ dealings.

“We take our fiduciary duty to clients very seriously and have a zero-tolerance policy for anything that compromises that duty,” said Alistair Morris, CEO of Morgan Grenfell in an internal memo obtained by reporters. “It is premature to make any conclusions at this stage, but a thorough review of these funds and relevant employee activities is our top priority.”

The funds in question include the £1.2 billion Morgan Grenfell UK Alpha Fund, the £900 million Morgan Grenfell Income Opportunities Fund, and the £450 million Morgan Grenfell UK Growth Fund. Sanders took over management of the funds between five to eight years ago, and reported returns have consistently outperformed the benchmark indices over three and five year timeframes, a key factor in marketing the funds to investors. The suspensions and audit call into question whether the previously reported performance figures are accurate.

Morgan Grenfell executives said they do not currently have evidence that client money is impacted, but they have alerted the Financial Conduct Authority, the chief UK regulator, as per protocol. The firm has said it will compensate any client whose funds were negatively affected. Retail investors make up a significant percentage of the funds, in addition to several large institutional clients.
