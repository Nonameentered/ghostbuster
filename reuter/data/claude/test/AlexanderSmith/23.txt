Peter Young Denies Allegations of Criminality in Morgan Grenfell Scandal

Peter Young, the former head of Morgan Grenfell's London operations, has denied any wrongdoing in the wake of a UK government investigation into the collapsed investment bank. Morgan Grenfell was once one of Britain's oldest and most prestigious financial institutions until it was acquired by Deutsche Bank in 1989. However, a series of risky investments and questionable lending practices led to heavy losses and an expensive government bailout.  

A parliamentary committee launched an inquiry last month to determine who was responsible for the poor decision making that brought Morgan Grenfell to its knees. The committee's report, published today, blames "ineffectual leadership, poor risk management, and a culture of greed." The report singles out Mr. Young, who led Morgan Grenfell in London for over a decade, for failing to rein in dangerous investment strategies and ignoring internal warnings about risky financial products.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr. Young rejected the allegations against him and argued that broader economic factors and government policy were more responsible for Morgan Grenfell's failure. "Clearly, mistakes were made across the industry, but the idea that this was due to the actions of a few individuals is misguided," he said. "The competitive pressures of the time and regulatory environment strongly incentivized the types of investments and loans we made."

Mr. Young also disputed claims that he was solely focused on profits and bonuses. "Bonuses reflected the prevailing norms in the City at the time and were in line with performance," he noted. "Like many in the bank, I lost a significant portion of my own wealth when Morgan Grenfell's share price collapsed." However, former colleagues paint a different picture, arguing that Mr. Young fostered a high-risk culture where irresponsible lending and excessive risk-taking were encouraged and even rewarded.

The parliamentary report recommends that government regulators ban Mr. Young and other senior executives implicated in the report from holding leadership roles in financial institutions. However, legal experts argue that such actions could be difficult to enforce given the lack of concrete evidence of criminal wrongdoing. For now, Mr. Young remains defiant in defending his legacy at the helm of one of Britain's once-great financial powerhouses, now consigned to ignominy. But that is likely to provide little solace to shareholders, employees, and taxpayers left stranded in the wreckage of Morgan Grenfell's collapse.
