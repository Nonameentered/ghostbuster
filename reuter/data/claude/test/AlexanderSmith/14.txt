Serious Fraud Office probes alleged irregularities at Deutsche Bank's UK fund arm 

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched an investigation into Deutsche Bank's UK asset management arm, DWS, over allegations of irregularities in the way it valued its funds. The SFO is examining claims that DWS overstated the value of commercial real estate assets within some of its funds to mislead investors.

The investigation comes after whistleblowers claimed that DWS had engaged in dubious practices to artificially boost the net asset value of its funds. According to reports, former DWS employees have alleged that the unit routinely inflated the value of certain hard-to-price assets to mislead clients about the health of its funds. The whistleblowers claim this was done through manipulated property evaluations and by delaying the reporting of price drops.

The allegations surround DWS's $84 billion Real Estate & Asset Value Fund, which invests in commercial property around the world. The fund's performance is closely watched as an indicator of the health of global commercial real estate markets. The whistleblowers allege that DWS was manipulating the fund's valuation to suggest its investments were worth more than their true market price.

DWS has denied the allegations, saying it has rigorous controls and oversight to prevent such actions. However, the claims have plunged DWS into crisis and threaten to tarnish Deutsche Bank's reputation further at a time when Germany's largest lender is trying to turn around its fortunes. Deutsche Bank shares fell 4% following news of the SFO investigation.

The SFO has declined to comment on the scope of its investigation into DWS, which is expected to take months to complete. However, the watchdog is taking the whistleblowers' claims seriously enough to launch a full inquiry into whether any fraudulent activity has taken place. If wrongdoing is found, it could lead to criminal prosecutions of senior DWS executives.
