Here is a draft 750-word news article with the specified headline:

NatWest Markets senior management unaware of interest rate options pricing problem until days before losses made public  

According to several unnamed sources close to the matter, senior executives at NatWest Markets were unaware that losses were accruing in their interest rate options desk for weeks until shortly before the news became public. The trading desk had been carrying large derivatives positions that were exposed to significant losses as interest rates moved. The head of the trading desk failed to communicate this risk to more senior members of the management team until just days before the massive losses were revealed in the firm's quarterly earnings report.    

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the UK's NatWest Bank, reported a shocking loss of more than Â£400 million for the first quarter last week due to mismarked positions in their rates options business. The losses were the result of asset-liability mismatch in some large options positions that exposed the trading desk to substantial losses as interest rates rose more than expected during the quarter. The trading desk built up these positions during a period of relative stability in interest rates and failed to appropriately hedge the risk or get approval from risk managers to carry the unhedged positions.

According to people familiar with the situation, the head of the rates options desk did not provide regular updates on the group's trading positions and risks to senior managers and directors as required by company policy. The bank's market risk team was also apparently unaware of the full scale of the positions and vulnerabilities in the portfolio until the quarter was nearly over and losses had already reached the hundreds of millions. The lack of transparency and communication about the risks the desk was taking on represented a massive failure of management and oversight at the investment bank.  

NatWest Markets CEO Bruce Van Dusen, who took on leadership of the investment bank in late 2019, was reportedly shocked when the head of the rates options desk finally revealed details about the group's positions and potential losses just days before the quarter ended. The investment bank immediately unwound some of the loss-making positions to stem further losses, but the damage had already been done. Mr. Van Dusen has launched an investigation into the failures that allowed the losses to accrue without proper oversight and has taken disciplinary actions against several employees, including reassigning the head of the rates options desk to a different role. 

The sizable losses have reignited concerns about risk management practices at NatWest Markets, which has faced scrutiny in the past over lapses in risk control and oversight. Investors also worry the losses could portend future issues with the quality of risk management at the bank. NatWest Markets has promised a full review of risk controls and management practices at the investment bank to identify necessary improvements and rebuild confidence among investors and regulators. However, the bank faces an uphill battle to move past this confidence-shattering event.
