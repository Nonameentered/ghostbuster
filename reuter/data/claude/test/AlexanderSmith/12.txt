DLJ acquires independent corporate finance adviser Phoenix Group for around £50m

DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, the private equity arm of Credit Suisse, has acquired independent mid-market corporate finance adviser Phoenix Group for around £50 million. The deal marks DLJ's latest investment into the UK financial services sector. 

Phoenix Group, founded in 2003, provides advisory services including mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity fundraisings, and restructurings to mid-market companies in the UK and Europe. The firm has offices in London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Edinburgh, and has advised on over 200 deals worth more than £5 billion in total over the past five years.

The acquisition of Phoenix further expands DLJ's portfolio of financial services investments, which includes equity stakes in companies such as fund manager Jupiter Asset Management and wealth manager Tilney. DLJ aims to help Phoenix accelerate its growth by expanding into new sectors and geographies, increasing the size and scope of its deals, and potentially making bolt-on acquisitions.

Mark Smith, Managing Partner at DLJ, said: “Phoenix has established itself as a trusted adviser to mid-market companies across the UK, with a proven track record of delivering successful outcomes for clients. We believe there are significant opportunities for further growth, and look forward to working with the Phoenix team to help achieve their ambitious plans.”

Phoenix will continue to operate under the leadership of co-founders Andrew Barraclough and Martin Calderbank, who established the business 16 years ago. The consideration of £50 million implies a multiple of over 7 times Phoenix's annual EBITDA of £7 million.  

Barraclough, CEO of Phoenix, commented: “We are delighted to be partnering with DLJ. They share our vision for building a leading mid-market corporate finance platform, and their expertise and investment will allow us to accelerate our growth plans. This is an exciting new chapter for Phoenix, and we look forward to grasping the many opportunities ahead with DLJ's support.”

The deal remains subject to FCA regulatory approval. DLJ was advised by Deloitte and Travers Smith, while Phoenix received advice from EY and Addleshaw Goddard.
