Former Smith New Court chairman Michael Marks appointed COO for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Merrill Lynch

Merrill Lynch today announced the appointment of Michael Marks, former chairman of Smith New Court, as Chief Operating Officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Marks will join Merrill Lynch on October 1st and will be based in London, reporting to Merrill Lynch International chairman Tom Patrick. 

Marks takes over from Bob McCann, who was recently promoted to Vice Chairman of Merrill Lynch. Marks will be responsible for all business operations across EMEA, including technology and operations. He will also join the Merrill Lynch International Executive Committee.

The appointment signals Merrill Lynch's ambitions to continue growing its international operations, particularly in Europe and emerging markets. Merrill Lynch has over $200 billion in client assets across EMEA and employs more than 6,000 people across 35 countries in the region.

Speaking about the appointment, Tom Patrick said: "We are delighted that Michael is joining Merrill Lynch. He has tremendous experience across European and emerging markets and his leadership during Smith New Court's growth and subsequent acquisition by Merrill Lynch in 1995 provides invaluable experience for our business. Michael is the ideal candidate to help drive operational excellence and support continued growth across EMEA."

Michael Marks served as chairman of Smith New Court for seven years before its acquisition by Merrill Lynch in 1995 for $942 million. Under his leadership, Smith New Court grew from a small British brokerage firm into a leading investment bank with a presence across Europe and operations in emerging markets such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia.  

Marks said: "I am pleased to be rejoining Merrill Lynch at such an exciting time. Merrill Lynch has an unparalleled global platform and footprint across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. I'm looking forward to helping strengthen operations, improve efficiency and support the tremendous growth opportunities I see across the region."

The appointment of another senior former Smith New Court executive is seen by analysts as a move by Merrill Lynch to bolster its international leadership team with individuals that have strong experience in European markets and an existing understanding of Merrill Lynch's culture and business. Since taking over as chairman in 1992, Tom Patrick has appointed several former Smith New Court executives to senior positions.

Merrill Lynch continues to perform strongly across global markets but in recent years over 50% of profits have been generated outside the Americas, highlighting the importance of its international operations to overall growth. The appointment of Michael Marks is seen as a clear statement of intent to maximize growth opportunities across EMEA and internationally.
