Bank of England Reports Improved Understanding of Small Firms by British Banks, But More Needs to Be Done for Financing the Sector  

The Bank of England reported today that British banks have made progress in gaining a better understanding of the needs of small businesses over the last year. According to the Bank's annual review of bank support for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), banks have improved their risk assessment and underwriting of SME loans. They have also enhanced their data and analytics capabilities to enable faster decision making for SME financing requests.

However, the central bank noted that SMEs, especially the smallest businesses and startups, continue to face challenges in accessing finance from banks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, banks tightened lending standards and decreased risk appetites due to uncertainty, making it harder for many SMEs to qualify for loans or overdraft facilities. The Bank's review found that less than half of SMEs reported having their request for financing fully approved by British banks in 2021. Approval rates were lowest for the smallest firms, with nearly two-thirds reporting either partial approval or rejection of financing requests.   

To improve access to financing for SMEs, the Bank of England urged British banks to make further progress in streamlining application processes, providing a "seamless digital experience" for requesting and accessing loans or overdrafts. The central bank also said alternative lenders should do more to fill market gaps, especially for the smallest firms and startups that are unable to secure mainstream bank finance. The Bank noted the important role that asset-based lending, crowdfunding platforms, and venture capital can play to support SMEs with growth potential.

In summary, while British banks have gained a better understanding and improved underwriting of SMEs, more can still be done to address the long-standing challenge of making financing more accessible for small firms. By accelerating digitization, broadening partnerships with alternative lenders, and maintaining stable lending standards during economic downturns, banks and other finance providers can unlock new opportunities for SME funding and success. Overall, the Bank of England's review suggests progress is being made but more action is needed to put financing within reach of all SMEs to support the backbone of the British economy.
