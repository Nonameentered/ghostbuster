NatWest Markets announces shake-up of global debt markets wing, shifting power to Greenwich Capital managers 

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, today announced an overhaul of its global debt markets division that will give more power to managers from Greenwich Capital, the US fixed-income trading firm it acquired in 2000.

The restructuring will see the heads of NatWest Markets’ rates, credit, solutions, and financing groups report directly to the co-heads of global markets, Brad Kurtzman and Tom Shipsey, who lead Greenwich Capital Markets in the US. Previously, those group heads reported to the head of global debt markets, Jeremy Bennett, who is leaving the bank.

The move aims to cut down on management layers and give traders and relationship managers at Greenwich Capital more sway over the strategic direction of the debt business, according to an internal memo seen by Financial News. It is a reversal of changes made four years ago that gave London-based debt management more oversight of global markets activities overall.

“Greenwich Capital has been a powerhouse business and we have not fully leveraged their expertise and talent,” the memo said. “This new structure will strengthen collaboration, eliminate duplication of efforts, and ensure we are developing global client solutions as one team.”

NatWest Markets has struggled in recent years to generate healthy returns from its once market-leading rates and bond-trading franchise. It has cut thousands of jobs, pruned its trading book, and restructured rates and credit operations to try and boost profitability as new regulations and competition from US investment banks squeezed earnings. 

Revenues from the global markets unit, which includes debt trading, dropped 10% to £1.3bn in 2019 compared with 2018. Pre-tax profits tumbled by a third over the same period, according to the bank’s financial results. 

The reorganization announced today also sees the global head of financing group, Tim Skeet, take on additional responsibility for solutions. The solutions group has developed tools to help clients better manage risks such as interest rate and currency fluctuations.

Two new co-heads of global credit markets have also been named: Paul Cattermole, who was head of European investment grade credit trading, and Kevin Ellis, who led US high yield and leveraged loan trading. They will report to Kurtzman and Shipsey as part of the restructuring.

A spokesperson for NatWest Markets said: “To better serve our clients, we need to continue simplifying our business, eliminating duplication and operating more seamlessly across geographies. The changes we are announcing today will empower our people, strengthen key relationships, and allow us to be more competitive in the global debt markets.”
