Uncertainty looms for UK financial watchdog as Labour threatens regulatory overhaul and SIB searches for new chairman

The UK's financial regulator is facing a period of uncertainty as the opposition Labour party threatens an overhaul of its remit and the search continues for a new chair to replace the outgoing Andrew Bailey. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has come under criticism recently from both consumer advocates and industry bodies over its handling of a series of mis-selling and market misconduct scandals.

Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell today set out plans to replace the FCA with a "comprehensive and integrated regulatory framework". He said the FCA had “demonstrated over recent years that it's not up to the task of regulating the financial services sector”. Under Labour's proposals, the regulatory architecture would be restructured with a new independent body with widespread powers in its stead. The new body would take on responsibility of both consumer and competition protections.

Criticisms of the FCA have intensified following a string of high-profile incidents. Some MPs have accused the watchdog of being too soft on senior banking executives and regulators for their role in the financial crisis. Mr Bailey and other executives faced demands for cuts to their “excessive” pay packets after a meltdown at funds firm Woodford Investment Management. At the same time, industry bodies have complained that the volume and scope of new regulation has slowed innovation.

Analysts said the period of uncertainty around the FCA's leadership and potential reforms to its powers is unhelpful and risks damaging the City. "Regulatory stability is key for financial firms and markets," said Markets and Regulatory Consulting Partner Lauren Vanderplank. "The FCA needs a chair and CEO who can stand firm against political pressure and safeguard its independence."
