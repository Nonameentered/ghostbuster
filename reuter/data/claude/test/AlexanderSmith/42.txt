NatWest Markets experiences shake-up and senior staff departures, but denies link to $144 million losses

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, announced a restructuring of parts of its business and the departure of several senior executives this week. The changes come just months after the bank reported losses of £111 million ($144 million) in the first half of 2020.

The bank said the restructuring is aimed at "simplifying and focusing the business to better serve client needs." As part of the changes, the bank's rates, currencies and treasury business will be merged with its institutional banking unit. The reorganization will impact around 200 staff, though the bank said it aims to find new roles for most impacted employees.

Three senior executives are also leaving the bank, including NWM's chief administrative officer and the heads of rates and FX. The departures were announced in an internal memo from NWM CEO Robert Begbie, who said "we are re-shaping some of our activities and the way we work."

The changes have fueled speculation that the restructuring and staff departures are linked to the substantial losses reported by NWM earlier this year. NWM attributed the losses to the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy as well as "challenging market conditions." The bank's revenue from trading bonds, interest rates, foreign exchange and commodities fell 22% from a year earlier.

However, a NatWest Group spokesperson denied the speculation, saying "the changes we are making to simplify and focus our markets business have been planned for some time and are unrelated to our 2020 interim results. They are designed to optimize resources and strengthen our ability to support core clients.”

Analysts said the changes were not unexpected given the difficulties faced by investment banks in recent years. "Conditions have been very tough for fixed-income and rates businesses in recent years, and NatWest Markets has struggled more than most," said James Invine, a banking analyst at financial research firm Autonomous. "Restructuring and refocusing the business is really the only option if it's to have a sustainable future."
