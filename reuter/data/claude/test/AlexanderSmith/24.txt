Labour party warns financial institutions to be more vigilant following MGAM scandal

The Labour party today issued a stern warning to major financial institutions in the UK to bolster their controls and compliance procedures following the collapse of MG Asset Management (MGAM) amidst allegations of fraud and mismanagement. MGAM, an investment firm that managed over £2 billion in assets for thousands of retail investors, went into administration last week. 

According to administrators, MGAM’s funds appear to be in disarray with potentially hundreds of millions of pounds of investors’ money unaccounted for. Law enforcement agencies have launched a criminal investigation into MGAM and its founder Mark Stenson, who has been accused of misleading investors and falsifying fund performance reports.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP said the MGAM scandal shows that “self-regulation in the financial sector has failed again" and more needed to be done "to protect ordinary investors from unacceptable practices." McDonnell called on the government to conduct an independent review into the regulation of investment firms to determine what went wrong in the oversight of MGAM.

The opposition party is putting pressure on major retail banks, wealth managers and investment platforms that distributed MGAM funds or facilitated investments into the firm. In a letter to industry trade bodies, McDonnell urged chief executives “to scrutinise your members’ due diligence procedures for assessing fund managers and products, especially higher risk propositions.” The letter warns that “any firm found to have failed in protecting consumers from the unacceptable actions of MGAM will be named and shamed."

Consumer advocacy groups have backed the Labour party’s calls for stronger oversight and enforcement in the financial sector. Mark Bishop, Director of the Consumers’ Union, said: “Time and again we see investment scams and scandals that could have been prevented if there were proper controls and consequences in place. Voluntary codes of conduct and principals are not enough. Tough regulations, enforced through hefty fines and penalties, are the only way to change behaviour." Bishop demanded jail sentences for those found culpable for the MGAM fraud.

The government is expected to face questions in Parliament this week over the collapse of MGAM and whether the existing regulatory framework is fit for purpose to govern an increasingly complex investment industry. The opposition is calling for legislation to replace the current “light touch” approach to regulation in favour of a new regulator with beefed up powers to take action against financial firms acting improperly or unethically.
