Serious Fraud Office probes irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management 

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched an investigation into alleged accounting irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, a UK-based investment management firm. The SFO has not released details about the specific nature of the irregularities but said it is examining certain “accounting practices and asset valuations” at the firm over a period of three years from 2014 to 2017.

Morgan Grenfell Asset Management is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank and oversees more than £30 billion of assets for institutional and private clients. News of the SFO investigation sent shares in Deutsche Bank down over 5% in early trading as investors reacted to the latest in a series of controversies linked to the German banking giant. 

In a brief statement, a spokesperson for Morgan Grenfell Asset Management said: “We are cooperating fully with the SFO as they look into certain historical accounting practices at the firm. We continue to operate our asset management business as usual, focused on delivering strong investment results and client service.” The firm declined to comment further given the ongoing nature of the investigation.

The SFO probe follows a 2018 internal audit at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management which flagged several irregularities in how certain assets were valued and recorded in the company’s accounts over the period under investigation. At the time, Deutsche Bank brought in external accountants and lawyers to review the audit findings. It is understood they found sufficient evidence of malpractice to warrant notifying the SFO, which launched its criminal investigation in early 2019.
