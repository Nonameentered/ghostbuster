NatWest Markets to Take Firm Action Over $80.2 Million Loss on Interest Rate Options  

NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), reported heavy losses from trading in interest rate options in the second quarter of this year. The unit revealed an $80.2 million loss on certain structured interest rate options, raising concerns from analysts and investors about risk management practices. 

In a statement, NatWest Markets CEO Chris Marks said the bank is conducting a full review into the losses. “We are taking firm action and have placed restrictions on the business activities of certain individuals as we conduct a thorough investigation into how these losses occurred.” Marks also noted that the bank has reduced risk limits and made management changes within its rates structuring and trading teams.

The losses stem from a series of complex options trades on eurozone and U.S. interest rates that went awry as rates moved in an unfavorable direction for the bank. The options were intended in part to hedge the bank’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations but ended up significantly amplifying losses when rates changed in ways the bank did not anticipate. 

The losses are an embarrassing misstep as NatWest Markets works to build its credibility with investors and pivot to focus more on client-driven trading following a variety of regulatory issues and risk control failures in the past. RBS only recently re-branded its investment bank as NatWest Markets in 2018 as part of an effort to move past its crisis-era image.

Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said the trading loss “raises questions once again about risk control at the bank” following a history of “management mistakes” in handling toxic assets and improper treatment of small business customers. However, Greenwood noted the loss amounts to a small fraction of the bank’s overall revenue and capital, so “in isolation [it] does not fundamentally change our view” of NatWest Markets’ turnaround efforts.

Other analysts and investors reacted more harshly, pointing to a “series of flashing warning signs” about risk governance and warning the bank needs “another overhaul to stamp out the behavior that keeps costing it money.” The latest loss extends a long line of massive costs from risk and compliance failures, interest rate hedging mistakes and crisis-era issues at RBS that have amounted to over $20 billion in total charges.

NatWest Markets has stabilized its business in recent quarters with a greater focus on client facilitation and less proprietary risk-taking but continues to struggle with weaknesses in its risk and compliance infrastructure. RBS CEO Ross McEwan has pledged to improve oversight and rebuild trust in the bank's culture and governance, but this latest setback highlights how much work is left to be done. With its future still uncertain, NatWest Markets remains a work in progress.
