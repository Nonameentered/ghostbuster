German and Dutch banks eye British fund management business, but limited options available

Major banks from Germany and the Netherlands are looking to expand their fund management businesses in the U.K. to tap into the large British retail investor market. However, viable acquisition targets have become scarce after a string of recent deals in the sector. 

Deutsche Bank and ING Group, two of Europe’s largest lenders, are exploring options to build scale in the U.K’s 8.5 trillion pound investment fund industry. The U.K. market is the second largest in the world after the U.S., but is dominated by a handful of big firms like Legal & General, Aviva, and Standard Life Aberdeen.

Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm DWS, which handles about $1 trillion in assets, wants to significantly boost its presence in the U.K. to access British retail investors and company pension schemes.   “We want to strengthen our positioning in the U.K. and will consider inorganic moves to do that,” said Claire Dobbing, head of DWS in the U.K. However, she acknowledged that attractive acquisition targets have become scarce after recent M&A deals like Standard Life Aberdeen’s purchase of SVM Asset Management.  

ING’s investment management unit oversees more than 500 billion euros but has a relatively small operation in the U.K. focused on institutional clients. The firm is now keen to build scale in the retail and pension fund segments, but will likely have to do “build outs” by poaching investment teams and recreating fund ranges from scratch rather than buying existing businesses, said a person close to ING.

The two European banks face an uphill battle against entrenched competitors in a market that has seen major consolidation in recent years. Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management merged last year, while in 2015 Henderson Group combined with New Star Asset Management and then merged with Janus Capital in 2017. Industry experts say the deals have largely exhausted options for large transformational tie-ups in the British market.

“Meaningful acquisitions that move the needle for Deutsche Bank or ING have really become scarce,” said Hugh Stewart, London-based managing director at investment banking advisory Montfort Partners. “They’ve either already been taken out through M&A or the bigger players will have the advantages of multi-year lead times and embedded client relationships.”
