Serious Fraud Office Draws Closer to Probe of Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds with Expansion Overseas

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) appears to be ramping up its investigation into Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and its network of offshore investment funds. Sources close to the investigation say the SFO has requested documents and interviewed employees related to some of the firm’s investment vehicles based in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands. 

The SFO first began looking into Morgan Grenfell Asset Management last year after a whistleblower alleged the firm mismanaged client funds and hid losses from investors. The investigation has focused on a series of real estate investment funds the firm managed that suffered substantial losses in the financial crisis but continued charging high fees to clients. However, the expansion of the probe to offshore funds suggests the potential fraud may have been even larger in scale and scope.

Morgan Grenfell Asset Management managed over $10 billion in client assets at its peak before the financial crisis, a substantial portion of which was invested in risky property developments. The firm earned millions each year in fees from managing the investments. According to former employees, senior executives at the firm ignored warning signs about overvalued and poorly performing investments in order to keep collecting fees. The firm is now owned by Deutsche Bank, which took over Morgan Grenfell in 2000.

Investigators appear to be focused on two offshore property vehicles: the $3 billion Morgan Grenfell Caribbean Property Fund and the $5 billion Morgan Grenfell European Property Fund. The funds promised investors double-digit returns from high-end commercial and residential developments in London, Spain, and the Caribbean. However, regulatory filings show the funds struggled after the crisis and have written down the value of investments by over 50% in some cases. Yet, investors were never informed and fees continued to be deducted.

The SFO's moves signal the investigation may lead to criminal charges against senior executives and the firm itself. If found guilty of fraud, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management could face heavy fines and individuals could face jail time as well as bans from working in financial services. The case is also embarrassing for Deutsche Bank, which may face legal consequences as the current owner and for failing to properly monitor its subsidiary. The bank had pledged to overhaul controls and compliance practices in its asset management division after previous scandals but appears to have failed again in this case.

With requests for documents, interviews with key employees, and a focus on substantial offshore entities, the SFO is clearly intensifying its probe into what may be one of the largest investment frauds since Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. All eyes will be on the SFO to see whether its investigation yields charges and forces accountability and compensation for investors who were kept in the dark and deprived of millions. The case reveals weaknesses that still exist in the asset management industry, where sky-high fees and complex offshore vehicles enable wrongdoing that harms ordinary savers and undermines trust in the system. If proven, this will be one more example of the unbridled greed that led to the worst financial crisis in decades.
