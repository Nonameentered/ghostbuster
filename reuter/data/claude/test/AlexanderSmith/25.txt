Peter Young, Fund Manager Suspended by Morgan Grenfell, Denies Allegations of Criminality, but Deutsche Bank's Credit Rating Threatened by the Fallout

Peter Young, the high-flying fund manager at Morgan Grenfell who was suspended last week pending an internal investigation, denied allegations today of criminal wrongdoing but Deutsche Bank faces threats to its credit rating as the scandal escalates. 

Young, 42, issued a statement saying “I have not engaged in any illegal or unethical behavior.” He was suspended from his role managing Morgan Grenfell’s flagship European equity fund after unnamed sources suggested he was under investigation related to insider trading and bribery. Young claimed the allegations came from “disgruntled former employees seeking to damage my reputation and career.”

Morgan Grenfell placed Young on administrative leave and said an internal review was underway but could not comment further. The firm has come under pressure from clients threatening to pull billions from its funds if the review finds evidence of wrongdoing.  

The controversy adds turbulence for Deutsche Bank, the German banking giant that acquired Morgan Grenfell in 1996. Last week, Moody’s warned it may cut Deutsche Bank’s credit rating due to “compliance failures” that expose the bank to litigation and reputational risks. The ratings agency specifically cited Morgan Grenfell’s troubles in its report. A downgrade would make it more expensive for Deutsche Bank to raise money in the debt markets.

Young is no stranger to controversy but has delivered market-beating returns over his career. He was previously sanctioned in 2012 by the UK Financial Conduct Authority for failing to disclose a personal investment in a company held by one of his funds. However, his European equity fund has achieved average annual returns of 19 percent over the past decade, attracting investments from pension funds and high net worth individuals.

If Young is ultimately cleared, his status as a rainmaker for Morgan Grenfell could insulate him, according to analysts. “Performance covers a multitude of sins,” said Marcus Stevens at Credit Suisse. “While a compliance failure is problematic, Young’s strong track record means many clients will likely stick with him unless there’s clear evidence of criminal behavior.”    

However, others argue his suspension reflects a “tone at the top” at Deutsche Bank that takes governance and risk control more seriously following a string of scandals. “This is precisely the type of tough decision that shows real cultural change,” said Volkart Kregor, head of European equities at Unigestion. “The new leadership at Deutsche is willing to sacrifice profits to send the right message and rebuild trust with clients, regulators and shareholders.”

The uncertainty has rattled investors in Deutsche Bank, with shares down over 6 percent this week. The coming days will prove crucial as Morgan Grenfell’s internal investigation determines whether Peter Young emerges with his reputation intact—or if the fallout from this scandal spreads further.
