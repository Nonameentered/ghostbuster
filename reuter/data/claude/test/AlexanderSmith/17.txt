Former Polly Peck aide awaits money-laundering appeal judgement

An appeal decision is expected shortly for Nadir Dambacher, a former aide to Asil Nadir, the disgraced tycoon who defrauded Polly Peck International, his fashion and textiles company. Dambacher was sentenced to six years in prison in 2012 for money laundering over £5 million of stolen funds on Nadir's behalf. 

Dambacher handled secret bank accounts for Nadir while he was evading justice in Northern Cyprus. Nadir fled there in 1990 after plundering £340 million from Polly Peck. Dambacher transferred stolen money between accounts and purchased luxury assets for Nadir using offshore shell companies and aliases.

At his original trial, Dambacher claimed he was acting under duress from Nadir, who he said threatened him and his family. However, the judge rejected this defence and said Dambacher "willingly and enthusiastically" participated in Nadir's schemes. Dambacher has appealed against his conviction, again citing duress.

Nadir was extradited to the UK in 2010 and pleaded guilty to 10 counts of theft in 2012. He was sentenced to 10 years but served only half his term. The case was a major corporate scandal that led to stricter regulation of listed companies.  

The appeal decision is the latest chapter in a long-running saga linked to Polly Peck's collapse. Investigators have pursued associates of Nadir across several continents to recover stolen assets. They have clawed back over £100 million so far, but believe at least as much again remains unaccounted for.

Dambacher's lawyer argues there are grounds to quash the conviction due to insufficient consideration of the duress defence. However, the prosecution contends that Dambacher was a willing participant in Nadir's criminal plans. The appeal ruling is expected to have implications for the ongoing global effort to seize Nadir's remaining hidden fortune. Both sides are eagerly awaiting the outcome.

The appeal judgment will determine whether Dambacher remains in prison to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence or his conviction is overturned. After so many years, the fate of Asil Nadir's former right-hand man is finally about to be sealed, for better or worse.
