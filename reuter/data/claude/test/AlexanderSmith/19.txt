Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Discover to Merge, Creating a Stronger Competitor in European Investment Banking Market

Morgan Stanley, one of the largest U.S. investment banks, announced today that it would merge with Dean Witter Discover & Co., creating one of the largest publicly traded securities firms in the United States with a strong presence in the growing European investment banking market. 

The $10 billion all-stock deal would create a company with 60,000 employees in more than 600 offices around the world. The new company would keep the Morgan Stanley name, with Morgan Stanley CEO John J. Mack becoming chairman and CEO and Dean Witter CEO David Wood remaining president.

The merger reflects the growing competition among Wall Street firms to build a presence in Europe as it becomes a focal point for financial deal-making and trade. "Europe represents the single biggest opportunity for investment banks today and in the coming decades," said Mack. "Dean Witter has built a formidable franchise across Europe that we can now leverage to accelerate our growth."

Dean Witter has operations in 21 countries across Europe, with a major hub in London. The firm's European investment banking fees have grown at a 20% annual rate over the past three years, faster than its U.S. growth. The merger would catapult Morgan Stanley into a top-tier position in Europe and provide Dean Witter with greater scale to compete for large, cross-border deals.

The integration of the two firms may prove challenging, however, given their different histories and cultures. Morgan Stanley has focused on advising large corporations and institutions, with storied investment bankers in its ranks. Dean Witter grew into an investment bank from a consumer brokerage firm, appealing more to individual investors. Blending the two corporate styles may test the new management team.

There is also a risk of customer overlap that could require divestitures to satisfy regulatory concerns. The two firms may have to sell or combine certain units to comply with antitrust rules. Some analysts expect the firms may have to divest up to $4 billion in revenue-producing assets. 

Still, investors cheered the deal, sending Morgan Stanley's stock price up 7% and Dean Witter's up 15% on the day of the announcement. The merger is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval but is expected to close by the end of the year. If approved and executed well, the combination of these venerable firms could create an even more formidable competitor on Wall Street and in the growing European financial markets.
