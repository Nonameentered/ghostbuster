TrizecHahn Corp Teams Up with German Businessman for European Property Alliance

Toronto-based TrizecHahn Corp announced today that it has formed a strategic partnership with prominent German real estate investor Karl Schmidt to pursue commercial property acquisitions across Europe. The new alliance, called TrizecSchmidt European Properties, will leverage TrizecHahn's experience managing large-scale properties with Schmidt's local market knowledge and connections across Germany and Central Europe.

"We have been looking to expand our footprint beyond North America for some time, and a partnership with a seasoned investor like Karl Schmidt is the ideal way for us to gain immediate access to deal flow and insights in Europe," said Neil Warner, CEO of TrizecHahn Corp. "Karl has an unmatched network among brokers, owners, and tenants across Germany, and a proven ability to source attractive investment opportunities. Together we believe we can build a substantial European portfolio in a short period of time."

For his part, Schmidt has long admired TrizecHahn's track record in office, retail and mixed-use development and is eager to bring the company's skills to bear in Europe. "There is a shortage of professional, well-capitalized real estate companies focused on Europe, so I anticipate significant interest from property owners and funds looking to exit or joint venture their holdings," Schmidt said. "With TrizecHahn as a partner, we are in an excellent position to acquire high-quality properties at favorable prices."  

Headquartered in Frankfurt, TrizecSchmidt European Properties will focus primarily on acquiring office towers, shopping centers, and mixed-use projects in Germany's largest cities, including Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg. The company will invest equity from TrizecHahn and Schmidt, and secure property-level financing from major European banks. TrizecHahn also recently established a â‚¬500 million unsecured line of credit to support its overall global growth strategy, which it may draw upon for the new European partnership.   

The formation of this alliance signals another step in TrizecHahn's ongoing transformation from solely a Canadian real estate company into a global property owner and developer with a presence in key markets around the world. With a committed long-term partner in Karl Schmidt, the company is poised to gain significant traction in the robust European commercial real estate market in the years ahead.
