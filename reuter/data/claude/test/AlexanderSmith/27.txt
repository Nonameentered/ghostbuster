Close Brothers' Corporate Finance Business Exceeds Expectations and Boosts Earnings

Close Brothers Group plc reported strong growth in its banking division  driven by record revenues in its corporate finance business. The merchant banking group announced that operating profit before tax in its banking arm rose 7% to £266.7 million in the six months ending January 31, 2019.

The headline performance came from Close Brothers’ corporate finance unit, which provides advisory services to small and medium-sized enterprises. Fees and commissions in the corporate finance business surged 21% to a record £102.5 million, handily beating analysts’ expectations. The company advised on a number of high-profile deals during the period, including the sales of bath products maker Mulberry Marketing and swimming pool supplier Compass Pools.

“Our corporate finance business achieved another period of strong growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range,” said Preben Prebensen, CEO of Close Brothers Group. “Demand for our advisory services remains high, supported by a team with deep sector expertise and relationships.”

The growth in corporate finance fees helped offset modest declines in other areas of Close Brothers’ banking business due to a slowdown in Britain’s economy amid Brexit uncertainty. Loan book growth eased to 7% and net interest margin shrank slightly. Still, the division remains the engine of profits for Close Brothers, accounting for nearly 80% of group operating profit.  

While economic risks remain given the unknown outcome of Britain’s planned exit from the European Union, Close Brothers said banking activity has started the new fiscal year on a positive note. The company expects its banking arm, and corporate finance unit in particular, to continue driving revenue and profit growth in 2019. Close Brothers reaffirmed its target of mid to high single-digit growth in banking operating profit for the current fiscal year ending in July.

Close Brothers shares rose 3.8% to 1,532 pence in morning trading in London, indicating investor confidence in the company's strategy and growth projections. 

“Another very solid set of results, with the corporate business going from strength to strength,” said Ian Gorham, an analyst at Barclays investment bank. “Close Brothers is very well-positioned, with a competitive advantage in advisory and a prudent lending approach that should hold them in good stead even in times of economic softness.”
