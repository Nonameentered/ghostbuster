Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Faces Fallout after Refusing to Reinstate Nicola Horlick as Fund Manager

Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the London-based investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, is facing criticism from clients and industry experts after refusing to reinstate star fund manager Nicola Horlick following her return from maternity leave. Horlick, dubbed "Superwoman" for her success in the male-dominated fund management industry, took leave last year after the birth of her sixth child. She announced last month that she was ready to return to work and expected to resume her position managing DMG's flagship fund.

However, in a surprise move, DMG informed Horlick that her position had been made redundant while she was on leave and she would not be reinstated as the fund's manager. The fund will now be managed by a team from DMG's asset management division. DMG cited a desire to move to a "team-based approach" to justify its decision, but the rationale has been met with skepticism from industry observers.

Horlick has earned admiration for steering the UK Growth fund to strong returns during her 17-year tenure, significantly outpacing the FTSE All Share index. Under her management, the fund has grown from £20 million to more than £4 billion in assets. The manner in which she was ousted has been called "unceremonious" and "distasteful," prompting speculation that her abrupt departure suggests gender discrimination at a firm still dominated by men.
