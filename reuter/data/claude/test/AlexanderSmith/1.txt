Deutsche Morgan Grenfell faces poaching accusations amidst suspended star fund manager controversy 

Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, is facing accusations that  it improperly poached clients from rival firms amid the controversy surrounding the suspension of star fund manager John Williamson.

Williamson, who managed DMG’s flagship €8 billion Europa fund, was suspended two weeks ago pending an internal investigation into his investment decisions and personal conduct. The suspension has led to heavy withdrawals from the fund as clients react to the uncertainty, putting pressure on DMG to stem outflows.

According to three people familiar with the matter, DMG relationship managers have been actively calling Europa fund clients and suggesting they move their money into other DMG funds to “ride out the storm.” The sources say relationship managers pitched other European equity funds and hedge funds managed by DMG, claiming clients would not miss out on Williamson’s market-beating returns.

“They didn’t mention the word ‘poaching’ but that was clearly the intention,” said one source who received a call from his DMG relationship manager. “The message was ‘we have other talented managers and we can move your money seamlessly so you won’t be impacted.’ But that’s taking advantage of the situation in my view.”   

Poaching clients from rival firms is against industry rules set by the Investment Association. Firms can only solicit new money from clients that have an existing relationship or previous investment, or in response to a client inquiry. The rules aim to prevent disorderly transfers of funds that could harm investment returns. 

A spokesperson for DMG said: “Our priority remains serving our clients’ best interests. While outflows from the Europa fund are unfortunate, we have a duty to inform clients of their options to reinvest with DMG if they wish.

The controversy comes at a delicate time for DMG, which has seen its assets under management decline by €12 billion over the past year due to a combination of weak fund performance and clients moving to lower-fee passive funds. The suspension of Williamson and resulting outflows from his flagship fund threaten to accelerate this trend, putting pressure on DMG at a time when its parent
