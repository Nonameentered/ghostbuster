Serious Fraud Office expands investigation into Morgan Grenfell investment funds with Luxembourg companies under scrutiny  

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has widened its investigation into investment funds managed by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in the 1990s. The SFO is now scrutinizing a number of companies registered in Luxembourg that were involved in managing money for several Morgan Grenfell funds during that period.  

The SFO first launched an investigation into Morgan Grenfell in April 2019, focused on two UK-registered funds called Asset Allocator Portfolios (AAP) 1 and 2. The funds primarily invested in shares and bonds and at their peak managed over £500 million of assets. The SFO is investigating allegations that fund managers deliberately mispriced or improperly moved assets between the two funds to maximize management fees. Several former Morgan Grenfell employees have been questioned under caution over the matter.

However, the SFO has now expanded the scope of its enquiries to examine certain Luxembourg-based companies that contracted with Morgan Grenfell to help oversee parts of the AAP 1 and AAP 2 funds. Documents seen by this newspaper indicate that tens of millions of pounds of the funds’ assets were at certain points allocated to these Luxembourg vehicles. Investigators are focused on whether these assets were properly accounted for and valued. 

The use of offshore companies by fund managers was common during this period, but their role in Morgan Grenfell’s funds is likely to raise questions about transparency and effective oversight. David Grenfell-Grey, grandson of one of Morgan Grenfell’s founders, said: “It is deeply disappointing that the fund bearing my family name may have been involved in such improper activities. On behalf of my ancestors who contributed so much to building Morgan Grenfell, I sincerely hope that justice is served and lessons are learned to prevent this from happening again.”

A spokesperson for Morgan Grenfell Asset Management said it is co-operating fully with the SFO’s investigation. The firm was sold by Deutsche Bank in 2005 and now operates as part of a different financial services group.  Representatives for the SFO and the Luxembourg companies under review declined to comment. The expansion of the probe indicates the SFO’s enquiries into one of Britain’s most prominent historic investment houses are likely to continue for some time.
