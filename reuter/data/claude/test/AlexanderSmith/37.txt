Schroders Plc Aims for Improvement in Returns from its Merchant Banking Business

Schroders Plc, the UK-based asset management firm, is looking to boost returns from its merchant banking division as the company seeks to diversify its revenue streams. The merchant banking unit, which provides financing and advisory services to companies, has lagged the strong performance of Schroders’ core asset management business in recent years.

Bruno Schroder, the company’s CEO, said in an interview that merchant banking currently makes up 15% of the group’s £2.7 billion in annual revenue but accounts for a smaller proportion of profits. “We see an opportunity to improve the returns from our merchant banking arm to bring them closer to the group’s overall 20% return on equity,” said Mr. Schroder. 

The company’s merchant banking division offers services including acquisition financing, structured lending, and restructuring advisory. It has lacked the scale of competitors such as Lazard and Evercore, in part because of Schroders’ historical focus on asset management. However, Mr. Schroder said the business is well positioned to benefit from strong deal activity: “Corporate balance sheets are healthy, financing is available, and we're seeing lots of cross-border M&A and interesting opportunities in areas like renewables.”

Schroders has hired several senior bankers to lead the merchant banking push, including industry veterans John Smith as head of M&A for Europe and Mark Richardson to lead acquisition financing in North America. “We have invested in high-quality talent with a goal of broadening and deepening client relationships,” said Mr. Schroder.

Some analysts are optimistic about the growth prospects but note the competitive landscape. “Schroders has a respectable franchise and brand name in merchant banking, but scale will be key to improving returns,” said Daniel Morris, an analyst at Barclays Bank. “Significant investments and several years may be needed to build a leading position, with uncertain outcomes.”

However, others see an opportunity for Schroders to leverage its strengths in asset management. “There are benefits from having complementary businesses under one roof,” said Kate Webster, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Schroders could provide merchant banking clients with access to private equity and debt funds, as well as introduce corporate clients to its wealth management services.”  

Schroders has a market capitalization of £8.4 billion, making it a relatively small player compared with giants like BlackRock and UBS. However, its share price has nearly tripled over the past decade due to the strong performance of its traditional business overseeing £450 billion on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals. 

Mr. Schroder acknowledges both the risks and rewards of the merchant banking push: “Diversification is key to our long-term success but asset management will always remain our first priority. We will take a disciplined approach and only scale up merchant banking if we see a clear path to improved returns.” Investors will be watching closely to see if the unit can deliver on its promise.
