London to Defend Its Share of Foreign Exchange Trading Amid Introduction of Single European Currency  

The City of London is preparing to defend its dominant position in foreign exchange trading as the European Union prepares to launch the euro—a single currency for 11 EU nations—on January 1, 1999. London currently accounts for 32% of global foreign exchange trading, more than double that of its nearest rival, New York. 

However, the introduction of the euro poses a threat to London’s preeminence. Once euros begin circulating, there will no longer be a need for traders to exchange individual European currencies like the German deutschmark or French franc. This could significantly reduce the volume of trading in London. According to estimates, London could lose up to 1/3 of its foreign exchange business to rival financial centers within the euro zone like Frankfurt, Germany.

To counter this threat, leaders in London’s financial sector are working to strengthen other sources of trading volume and make London a more attractive place for foreign exchange overall. “London has natural advantages, like its time zone, English language, and large qualified workforce, that won’t disappear with the euro,” said Sarah Lewis, Director of the London Financial Markets Association. 

One strategy is for London to focus on currencies outside Europe, like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and emerging market currencies. London currently dominates trading in emerging market currencies, with over 50% of global volume. Boosting this further could offset losses from the euro’s introduction.

Another tactic is to emphasize London’s strength in derivatives like currency futures and options. While the pool of underlying currencies will shrink with the euro, the demand for currency hedging and speculation through derivatives is likely to remain strong. “London is the undisputed center for foreign exchange options trading globally,” said Giles Thomson, foreign exchange director at HSBC. “The euro won’t change that.”

Continuing to improve London’s trading infrastructure and regulatory environment is also key. London’s exchanges and clearinghouses are investing heavily in new technology to increase the speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of trading. And the U.K. government is promoting a regulatory framework friendly to financial innovation. 

While the euro poses real challenges, London remains in a solid position to retain its status as the world’s dominant foreign exchange center. But that position, which is vital to London’s prosperity, cannot be taken for granted. Defending it will require fending off rival European centers while also adapting to a new currency reality in Europe. With proactive leadership, adequate safeguards, and a commitment to international openness, London is likely to remain unrivaled as a place for global finance and trade. But its hold on the top spot is sure to face significant tests in the coming years.
