Triodos Bank more than doubles in size in first full year in Britain with socially and environmentally-friendly lending approach  

Triodos Bank UK, the sustainable bank, more than doubled its balance sheet in 2015, its first full year of operations in Britain. The bank ended the year with £335 million in lending to projects that benefit people and the planet.

Triodos opened for business in the UK in March 2014 and now has over 21,000 customers. The bank's mission is to make money work for positive social, environmental and cultural change. It only lends to sustainable businesses and projects in the UK across sectors like renewable energy, organic food and farming, social housing, healthcare, education and the arts.

Triodos raised £60 million in a public share issue to fund new lending in 2015. Over 3,000 people invested, demonstrating strong public support for sustainable banking. The bank's lending in 2015 includes £81 million for renewable energy projects, £39 million for organic food and farming businesses, and £24 million for charities and social enterprises. 

Peter Blom, CEO of Triodos Bank, said: “There is a growing desire from people to know where their money is invested and see it used to drive positive change. We have led the way in sustainable banking for over 30 years and this year’s results demonstrate that our mission resonates strongly with British customers and investors.”

Dan Hird, Managing Director of Triodos Bank UK, added: “2015 was a pivotal year for Triodos in the UK and we start 2016 with great momentum. By lending exclusively to sustainable businesses, Triodos is redefining banking and pushing for a fairer, greener economy where people and planet come first.”

Triodos is able to generate a healthy return for investors while delivering positive impact because sustainable businesses often have strong, long-term growth potential. The bank’s target return on equity is 3-5% above inflation.

Triodos operates across Europe, where it has over 7,000 co-workers serving over 634,000 customers. Globally, Triodos has over £5 billion in sustainable lending. The bank has opened over 36,000 new accounts across Europe in 2015, up 43% on 2014.
