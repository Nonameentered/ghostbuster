Trader Linked to NatWest Markets' $80 Million Loss Resigns From Bear Stearns

A trader linked to $80 million in losses at NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, resigned last week from his new position at Bear Stearns. The trader, Gabriel Donovan, had joined Bear Stearns only six weeks ago to work on its mortgage-backed securities desk after 11 years at NatWest Markets in London. 

Donovan was reportedly one of the key traders overseeing mortgage-backed securities at NatWest Markets, which suffered major losses in the division last month and announced it would shut down its mortgage securitization business. Sources say the losses were the result of incorrect positions Donovan's team had built up over several months, exacerbated by recent market volatility. The full scale of the losses at the division became clear in March during a review by NatWest Markets' new chief executive, triggering Donovan's exit along with several other senior managers.

Donovan resigned from Bear Stearns on Friday, shortly after the news of troubles at NatWest Markets emerged and questions arose about his role. A spokeswoman for Bear Stearns confirmed Donovan had left "by mutual agreement" but declined to comment further. Donovan could not be reached for comment.  

The missteps at NatWest Markets have been an embarrassment for majority owner, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which took control of NatWest in 2000. Royal Bank of Scotland has tightened controls and risk management as a result, and its chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin is said to be conducting a wider review of culture and practices across the bankâ€™s markets and international banking division. 

For Bear Stearns, Donovan's swift exit before his start date underscores the political and reputational risks of making a high-profile hire from a firm that subsequently suffers major losses or failures. Bear Stearns will no doubt be scrutinizing its hiring and vetting procedures to avoid a repeat of such a situation. Rivals, however, may see opportunity to poach quality staff from the beleaguered mortgage securitization desks of NatWest Markets and other banks amid the current industry turmoil.
