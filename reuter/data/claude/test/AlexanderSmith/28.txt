Ladbroke Group Plc to Close Property Arm and Focus on Core Businesses of Hotels and Betting 

Ladbroke Group Plc, the British betting and gaming company, announced today that it will be closing its commercial property development arm in order to focus on its core businesses of hotels and betting. The property division, which develops office buildings, shopping centers, and other commercial real estate, has struggled in recent years due to a slowing UK economy and uncertainty around Brexit.

Ladbroke Group CEO Mark Jones said in a statement, “While our property business has been an important part of our company historically, the challenges of the current economic environment have made it difficult for this division to thrive. We believe the best path forward is to close our property operations so we can devote our full resources and attention to our hospitality and betting businesses, which have strong growth prospects.”

The closure of the property division will impact approximately 500 employees across the UK. Ladbroke Group said it will aim to redeploy as many employees as possible to other parts of the business and offer transition assistance and severance packages for those unable to find new roles. The winding down of current property projects is expected to take 12-18 months.

Shares of Ladbroke Group were up 3% on the news as investors reacted positively to the sharper focus on the company’s higher-growth and higher-margin businesses. Ladbroke Group operates over 1,500 betting shops across the UK under the Ladbrokes brand and is the second largest bookmaker in the country after William Hill. The company also owns and operates 55 hotels across the UK, Ireland, and Belgium under brand names such as Hilton, Crowne Plaza, and Holiday Inn.

The closure of the property arm “allows us to concentrate on what we do best—providing exciting betting and gaming experiences for our customers and operating successful hotel properties,” Jones said. With a leaner focus, Ladbroke Group expects to improve profit margins and accelerate growth in its target markets, especially as the economy starts to recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, today's announcement signals a strategic shift that is expected to put Ladbroke Group on stronger financial footing for the years to come.
