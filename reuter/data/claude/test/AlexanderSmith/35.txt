Regent Pacific reassured by Hambros CEO that profits will improve 

Regent Pacific, the Asia-focused investment group, received assurances from the chief executive of its private bank Hambros that profits will recover this year after a challenging 2020.

Mark Evans, CEO of Regent Pacific, said Hambros' CEO John Howard spent time with the board last week discussing strategies to boost the bank's financial performance. They discussed cost-cutting initiatives as well as plans to generate higher revenues from wealth management fees, trust services, and lending activities.  

"2020 was an unprecedented year with lockdowns and economic uncertainty impacting our clients and their wealth-related activities," Mr. Evans said. "However, we have been encouraged by how quickly client confidence and transactions have rebounded since the start of this year."

Regent Pacific bought Hambros, one of Britain's oldest private banks, from Societe Generale for £200 million in 2018. The Asia-based group aimed to use Hambros to service its wealthy clients in Hong Kong and Singapore. However, the pandemic slowed the integration of the two businesses and weighed on Hambros' financial results last year.  

Pre-tax profits at Hambros dropped by 23% to £78.3 million last year, while revenue declined 6% to £311 million, according to accounts filed last week. The bank was impacted by lower interest rates as well as a decline in client trading and lending volumes during the peak of the pandemic.

However, there are signs Hambros' performance has strengthened markedly since the start of 2021. Deposits rose 10% in the first quarter, and client advisers reported an increase in demand for mortgages and loans as well as investment management mandates. 

Hambros' other revenue streams, such as fiduciary management and tax advisory services, have also held up well. The bank manages over £20 billion of assets for business leaders, entrepreneurs, family offices, charities, and trusts. Around 70% of its clients are based in the UK, while the remainder are from Western Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
