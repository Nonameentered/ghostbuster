Merrill Lynch Expands Presence in European Equities Markets with Purchase of Carnegie Italia SpA  

Merrill Lynch today announced the acquisition of Carnegie Italia SpA, Italy's leading independent equities and research brokerage firm. The deal will significantly bolster Merrill Lynch's equities business in Europe and establishes a strong foothold for the firm in the Italian market.   

Carnegie Italia has over 300 employees across offices in Milan, Rome, and Turin. The firm has a client base of more than 1,000 institutional investors, private banks, and asset managers in Italy. Carnegie analysts provide research coverage on over 75% of stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana.

"This acquisition reinforces our commitment to Europe and strengthens our ability to serve clients with an enhanced equities platform and local insights," said Kirsten Evans, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management International. "Carnegie Italia has a leadership position, innovative technology, and a talented team of professionals with local market expertise that perfectly complement our international wealth management business."

The deal comes three months after Merrill Lynch opened a new office in Rome focused on private wealth management. Deeper penetration into continental Europe's equity markets has been a strategic priority for Merrill Lynch as stock trading continues to globalize. Carnegie Italia has a strong institutional brokerage business and also provides online trading platforms for retail investors.

Merrill Lynch has over $2.3 trillion in client assets and offices in 43 countries and territories. The firm has been expanding both organically and through acquisitions in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Carnegie Italia represents Merrill Lynch's first acquisition in Italy, Europe's third-largest equity market with over 300 publicly listed companies and a total market capitalization of more than $650 billion.   

"The opportunity to join a global leader like Merrill Lynch and tap into their technology, products, and investment banking expertise is extremely compelling," said Alberto Altieri, CEO of Carnegie Italia. "At the same time, Merrill Lynch can benefit greatly from our local market knowledge and long-established client relationships. It is a partnership that can drive future growth for our clients and employees in Italy."

The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approval.
