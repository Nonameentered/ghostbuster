Premier Farnell Criticizes Barclays' BZW Over Profits Warning, Shines Spotlight on Investment Banking Arm Again  

Barclays PLC's investment banking arm came under fire again today after a profits warning from Premier Farnell PLC led to a sell-off of Barclays' shares. Premier Farnell, an electronic components distributor, blamed a slowdown at Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), the investment banking division of Barclays, for a major shortfall in its own profits.  

Premier Farnell said its first-quarter profits were 15% lower than expected, citing a "substantial reduction" in corporate finance activity at BZW. The warning sent Barclays' shares down over 6% in early trading, reviving concerns about volatility in BZW's results. Barclays purchased BZW in 2000 to expand beyond traditional retail banking into investment banking. However, BZW's earnings have seesawed in recent years, alternately boosting and dragging down Barclays' overall results.

Some analysts and investors argue BZW's volatility undermines Barclays' stability and that the unit should be sold. Barclays chief executive John Varley defended BZW, saying it provides valuable diversification. But today's warning puts the spotlight back on calls to break up Barclays and exit investment banking.   

BZW accounted for nearly a third of Barclays' 2004 profits but also reported substantial losses during the dot-com crash and 2008 financial crisis. Premier Farnell's announcement hints BZW may again struggle to deliver strong, consistent returns, raising doubts about Mr. Varley's diversification strategy.   

In a statement, Premier Farnell chief executive Harriet Green said: "We are disappointed that the slowdown in transaction activity at BZW will significantly impact our first-quarter results. Corporate finance and advisory fees from BZW represent a major portion of our revenue, so a drop in BZW's deal volumes creates substantial headwinds."  

Ms. Green said Premier Farnell is working to expand its customer base to reduce reliance on BZW, but added "we expect BZW's performance to remain sluggish for the foreseeable future given current market conditions."  

Mr. Varley rejected suggestions BZW is struggling, saying market conditions remain favorable and BZW's long-term performance shows "returns from our investment banking operations considerably outstrip the costs." He said quarterly fluctuations are inevitable but BZW continues to make "an important contribution" to Barclays' success.

However, major Barclays shareholders argue its share price discount relative to other banks reflects the instability created by BZW. "Investors struggle to predict Barclays' earnings due to the volatility from investment banking," said Michael Mason-Mahon, investment director at Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC, a top 25 Barclays investor. "Barclays could unlock significant value by focusing on its core strengths in retail and commercial banking."

Mr. Mason-Mahon said a sale or spin-off of BZW could increase Barclays' valuation by up to 30%: "BZW may generate sizable profits at times but it also produces unexpected losses and its hot-and-cold nature undermines confidence in Barclays as a whole." Today's warning from Premier Farnell appears to validate concerns about over-reliance on BZW's uncertain revenues.
