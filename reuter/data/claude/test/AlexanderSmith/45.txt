Hammerson CEO Predicts Strong Performance for British Market Over Next Two Years

David Atkins, the CEO of Hammerson, one of the UK’s largest property developers and managers, predicts strong growth for the British commercial real estate market over the next 24 months despite the uncertainty around Brexit.

In an interview, Atkins said “We believe the UK economy will continue to grow over the next two years, which will drive demand for space in our retail destinations, offices and retail parks.” He cited solid economic fundamentals including low unemployment, rising wages, and steady consumer spending as reasons for optimism.

Hammerson currently owns and operates major UK retail destinations like Birmingham’s Bullring, Leeds’ Victoria Gate and Brent Cross in London. The company has a £10 billion portfolio of property assets across Europe. According to Atkins, Hammerson is focused on “premium destinations in top European cities that are adaptable, experiential and future-fit.” He believes this strategy will position the company well for growth even as the retail industry undergoes major transformations.

Atkins acknowledged that Brexit has created short-term uncertainty which has slightly dampened investment activity and business confidence in the UK.  However, he said both occupier and investor sentiment remain resilient. “Once a Brexit deal is agreed and the path forward becomes clear, we expect the UK property market to bounce back strongly,” Atkins said. He also noted that a no-deal Brexit could negatively impact growth in the short term.

While many analysts and investors remain wary of the UK commercial property market given the risks around Brexit, Atkins’ confidence suggests that for strong, adaptable players like Hammerson, opportunities still exist to drive performance through value creation, active management and capital recycling over the next two years. Atkins emphasized that Hammerson takes a long-term view of the market, looking beyond temporary volatility.

The upbeat predictions from one of the most prominent leaders in the UK property industry will likely be welcome news for landlords, developers and investors in British commercial real estate looking for signs of optimism despite an uncertain political and economic outlook.
