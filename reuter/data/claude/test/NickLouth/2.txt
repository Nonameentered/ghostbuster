$20 Billion Merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc to Leverage Two-Year Courtship Experience  

British Telecommunications Plc (BT) and MCI Communications Corp announced today that they have agreed to merge in a deal valued at $20 billion. The merger brings together  BT, the dominant telecommunications company in the UK, and MCI, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the US. The merger caps a two-year courtship between the companies and is aimed at giving both companies a stronger foothold in the global telecommunications market.

The deal was approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close within 12 months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Under the terms of the agreement, BT will own 45% of the new company, while MCI shareholders will own the remaining 55%. The new company will combine BT's international operations with MCI's global network and business in more than 65 countries. 

"This merger creates a powerful global competitor with a broad range of network, IT infrastructure, and professional service capabilities to meet the complex needs of enterprise and government customers around the world," said BT Chief Executive Gavin Patterson. MCI President and CEO Charles Demuth added, "Combining with BT accelerates MCI's strategy of expanding our global reach and network assets."

The combined company will have annual revenues of approximately $23 billion, making it a formidable competitor to AT&T and other global telecommunications providers. By leveraging each other's networks and customer bases, BT and MCI expect to realize substantial cost savings and new revenue opportunities. However, some analysts caution that integrating the two companies may prove challenging, given their different corporate cultures and customer bases.  

MCI was formerly known as WorldCom, until it emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 and rebranded itself. Under WorldCom, an accounting scandal led to over $11 billion in fraud and the company's subsequent bankruptcy filing in 2002. MCI was acquired by Verizon in 2006 but spun off again as an independent company in 2010. BT has faced its own challenges in recent years, including a major accounting scandal in 2017 that led to a $469 million write-down. The company has sought to turn itself around through cost-cutting, investment in broadband and content offerings, and expansion into new markets.

The merger of BT and MCI is subject to approval by US and UK regulators, who will evaluate any competition concerns, as well as by shareholders of both companies. If approved, the deal is expected to officially close in mid-2020. The new company will be headquartered in London, with a significant presence also in Washington, DC.
