Regional Bells' Fourth Quarter Results Show Booming Demand for Additional Lines and Services, Despite Investor Worries About Looming Competition in Core Markets  

The seven regional Bell operating companies announced fourth quarter earnings results this week that beat investor expectations, as demand for additional phone lines and enhanced services helped overcome concerns about competition in local calling markets. Revenues grew an average of nearly 4% from the previous quarter, according to analysts.

The companies reported strong demand for second phone lines in homes as families add lines for fax machines, home security systems, and computers with modem connections. The regional Bells have also had success selling enhanced services such as call waiting, caller ID, and voicemail. Revenue from these value-added services grew over 15% from a year ago, providing a boost to overall sales and profits.  

However, investors remain worried about the impact of competition on the companies' core business of providing local phone service. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened local phone markets to competition for the first time and allowed new entrants to lease parts of the regional Bells' networks at regulated rates. Competitors like AT&T and MCI have gained customers by offering lower rates and bundles of local and long-distance calling.

In response, the regional Bells have slashed prices, particularly for residential customers. They have also accelerated investments to upgrade their networks to provide new digital services in an effort to retain and win back customers. But price cuts and higher capital spending have put pressure on profits and caused some investors to worry that future growth may be limited.

Still, analysts were encouraged by this quarter's results and believe the regional Bells remain well positioned, as demand for telecom services continues to be strong across all customer segments. The companies' shares rose on average 3-5% on the week, indicating that investors were relieved by the better-than-expected earnings reports and optimistic that competitive threats may be less dire than previously thought. While significant challenges remain, the regional Bells have considerable customer loyalty and brand recognition in their local markets which should help sustain their leading positions even as competition intensifies.
