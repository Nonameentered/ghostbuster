MCI Revolutionizes Communication with New Vault Technology

MCI Communications Corporation, a leader in telecommunications, unveiled its latest innovation today - the Vault communication network. The Vault enables users to send and retrieve text messages, photos, and voice recordings at any time using MCI’s dedicated satellite network infrastructure. 

“The Vault allows you to stay connected with friends and family like never before,” said Brian Roberts, CEO of MCI. “No longer will you have to worry about missing an important message or not being available when someone calls. The Vault ensures your communications are persistent, secure, and available whenever you need them.”

With the Vault, all messages and media are stored indefinitely and accessible from anywhere in the world using the Vault mobile app or web interface. Whether you have cell service or not, your communications remain safe and ready to view in the Vault. Everything is encrypted end-to-end and protected by biometric authentication, including fingerprint, face, and voice recognition.

MCI’s proprietary satellites and data centers power the Vault, storing petabytes of data in a highly redundant and resilient system. Even in the event of power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, MCI guarantees 99.999% uptime and zero data loss. Your communications are always available and secure in the Vault.

The Vault offers three subscription plans to meet users’ needs. The Basic plan is free and provides 5GB of storage, enough for thousands of text messages, photos, and voice messages. The Premium plan offers 100GB for $9.99/month, while the Enterprise plan provides 1TB for $99.99/month. Business and government agency plans with additional security and compliance features are also available.

MCI is offering a 30-day free trial of the Vault Premium plan to everyone in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The Vault app is available for download now in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This revolutionary technology is poised to change the way we stay connected and communicate with our friends and families forever. The future of communications is here—and it's in the Vault.
