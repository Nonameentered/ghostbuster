AT&T Plans to Use New Local Calling Service to Snatch Business Customers from Competitors

AT&T announced today the launch of a new local calling service targeted at small and midsize businesses in an effort to gain market share from competitors. The service, called AT&T Business Unlimited Local, provides unlimited local calling for a flat monthly rate.

AT&T has lost landline business customers over the past decade as many businesses have switched to cell phones or voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services. The new unlimited local calling plan is designed to entice some businesses back to AT&T by offering a straightforward, affordable service.

“Small and midsize businesses are looking to simplify their communications and save money. Our AT&T Business Unlimited Local plan does both,” said John Donovan, CEO of AT&T Communications. “This is a simple, reliable, affordable solution from a trusted brand that small businesses know and rely on.” 

The unlimited local calling service will be available as a standalone plan or as an add-on to AT&T’s other business services like high-speed internet, mobility, and networking options. Pricing starts at $25 a month per line. Businesses with up to 49 lines can sign up for the service.

Competitors like Verizon, CenturyLink, and cable companies have been winning over landline business customers from AT&T for years. The launch of an affordable unlimited calling option is AT&T’s attempt to regain some momentum. However, some analysts argue the effort may be too little too late.

“AT&T dominates the enterprise and government markets, but they are way behind competitors in the small and midsize business space,” said Brian Washburn, analyst at Omdia. “An inexpensive calling plan is not going to move the needle. Businesses want modern solutions that integrate landline voice with mobile, messaging, and collaboration tools. AT&T needs a more comprehensive strategy if they want to catch up.”  

A comprehensive modern business communications solution may be on the horizon for AT&T, but for now, they hope the simplicity and price point of unlimited local calling will entice some small organizations back to the AT&T fold and chip away at competitors’ market share, one business line at a time. The question is whether businesses who have already fled traditional landline service for more advanced options can be lured back by the promise of a good deal. AT&T is betting some of them can.
