Regional Bell Telephone Companies Report Strong Fourth-Quarter Results, Riding the Wave of Demand for Extra Phone Lines and Smartphone Services

The seven regional Bell companies that were spun off from AT&T in 1984 reported strong revenue and profit growth in the fourth quarter of last year, boosted by continued high demand for wireless phones, landline phone services, and smartphones. 

Verizon Communications, the largest of the regional Bells, said its revenue rose 4.5% to $34.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Net income climbed to $5.7 billion, or $1.23 a share, up from $5.6 billion, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. The results were fueled by the addition of 139,000 Verizon Wireless subscribers with contracts, as the company continued its push into smartphones and tablets.

AT&T, the second-biggest regional Bell, posted fourth-quarter revenue of $33.16 billion, up from $32.16 billion a year ago. Net income rose 26% to $6.9 billion, or $1.20 a share. AT&T said it added 849,000 wireless subscribers and 221,000 U-verse high-speed Internet subscribers in the quarter. The company has also benefited from surging smartphone sales spurred by discounts and promotions.

Quarterly revenue rose 3.3% at CenturyLink, the third-largest regional Bell, to $4.41 billion. The company earned $239 million, or 39 cents a share, flat with the year-earlier period. CenturyLink reported strong demand for high-speed Internet, data, and wireless services but continued losses of landline phone subscribers. The company acquired phone provider Qwest Communications last year, allowing it to offer bundled phone, Internet and cable-TV services to more customers.
