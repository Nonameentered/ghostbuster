AT&T Teams Up with Shaklee Corp. to Bring Face-to-Face Sales Pitches for Long-Distance Service to Your Doorstep

AT&T Inc. announced today an unusual partnership with direct-sales company Shaklee Corp. to have Shaklee's independent distributors start pitching AT&T's long-distance phone service door-to-door across the U.S. 

The partnership is a first for the major telecommunications company, which has not previously used face-to-face sales for marketing its residential services. However, increased competition from wireless carriers and voice over Internet providers has led AT&T to experiment with new sales channels to shore up its landline business.

"We believe having a personal conversation about the value, service, and affordability of AT&T's long-distance plans can be very persuasive," said John Smith, an AT&T vice president in charge of marketing partnerships. "Shaklee has built an effective nationwide team of distributors skilled in connecting with customers one-on-one, so teaming up with them seemed like an innovative approach worth trying."

Shaklee distributors, which the company calls "members," sell an array of natural nutrition supplements, beauty products, and cleaning supplies door-to-door as well as online. The 50-year-old company operates in the U.S., Canada, and Japan, with over 2 million members globally. Members buy products at wholesale and resell them for a profit. They also receive recruiting bonuses for signing up new members.

"This partnership provides an ideal opportunity for our members to broaden their business by offering AT&T's high-quality, dependable long-distance service," said Roger Barnett, CEO and chairman of Shaklee Corp. "For AT&T, it provides a way to reach new customers through personal relationships and word-of-mouth marketing."

Under the new program, AT&T will provide marketing materials and training for Shaklee members to become certified sales representatives of AT&T long-distance plans. Members will receive a commission for each new customer they sign up, in addition to the regular profits and bonuses Shaklee provides. The companies will share some customer data and leads to help target the most promising potential subscribers.

While some industry analysts see promise in the unconventional partnership, others question the inherent contradiction. "AT&T is a highly respected global technology brand. Shaklee is a multi-level marketing company selling nutritional supplements. They couldn't be more different," said James Smith, a telecom analyst at ABCD Research. "It's hard to imagine AT&Tâ€™s buttoned-up corporate customers responding well to a sales pitch from a Shaklee distributor. This seems like a mismatch."

The program is starting as a six-month pilot. AT&T will evaluate results and customer feedback to determine if the test should be expanded. But with competition mounting, the opportunity to tap into Shaklee's grassroots marketing army may be one AT&T can't pass up if it hopes to keep its long-distance business from going the way of the landline.
