AT&T Shares Plummet Amid Concerns Over Marketing and Investment Costs 

Shares of AT&T Inc. declined sharply in midday trading as concerns grew over rising costs and slowing subscriber growth at the telecommunications giant. 

AT&T stock was down more than 7% in afternoon trading, putting the shares on pace for their biggest one-day percentage decline since 2009. The drop came after AT&T reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations and trimmed its forecast for the year due to climbing expenses.

The company has been spending heavily to market new services like streaming television bundles and faster 5G wireless networks. AT&T also continues to pay down debt accumulated from its $80 billion purchase of Time Warner last year. However, those costs have started to outpace AT&T's sales growth, alarming investors.  

"It's an intense competitive environment out there, and AT&T can't seem to catch a break," said Annie Palmer, a senior analyst at research firm Forrester. "They have to keep spending to keep up, but that spending is really weighing on their ability to grow the top line."

For the second quarter, AT&T's operating expenses rose 3% while revenue was roughly flat at $45.46 billion. The company added only 173,000 phone subscribers, down from 192,000 additions in the same quarter last year. AT&T's WarnerMedia segment, which includes HBO and Turner cable channels, reported a 3% drop in revenue.

In response, Dallas-based AT&T lowered its forecast for 2019. The company now expects to add 1 million or fewer new phone subscribers this year, down from an earlier projection of up to 2 million. Earnings per share are expected to be $3.60 to $3.70, compared with previous guidance of $3.60 to $3.80.

AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said the company would look to cut costs and was "laser-focused" on meeting its new targets. But he acknowledged it would take time for some of AT&T's biggest investments to pay off. The company's 5G wireless network, considered critical to enabling new technologies like self-driving cars, remains in its infancy. New streaming services like the Netflix competitor HBO Max aren't scheduled to launch until next year.

"This next year's going to continue to be a bit bumpy as we work through some of these integration efforts," Mr. Stephenson said on a call with analysts. “But as we get into 2021, 2022, we think you start to see evidence of the benefits of what we're doing here.”

Investors appeared unwilling to wait that long, sending AT&T's shares down $2.60 to $35.16 in afternoon trading. The decline wiped out nearly $20 billion in market value for AT&T, which remains one of the largest components in major stock indexes like the S&P 500.
