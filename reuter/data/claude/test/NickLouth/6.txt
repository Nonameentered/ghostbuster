AT&T and Shaklee Corp. Team Up for Face-to-Face Sales Strategy to Boost Long-Distance Market Share

Telecommunications giant AT&T Inc. announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Shaklee Corporation, a pioneer in direct sales of nutrition and wellness products, to bolster AT&T's long-distance service sales through face-to-face interactions. The companies will launch a 6-month pilot program enlisting Shaklee's nationwide network of more than 750,000 independent distributors to sell AT&T's long-distance packages door-to-door.

The partnership is an effort by AT&T to revive growth in its shrinking long-distance business. Revenue from residential and small business long-distance voice services has declined over 60% since 2000 due to the rise of mobile phones and internet-based calling options. "We needed to get back to basics by engaging with customers in person instead of just through advertising, mailers or online promotions," said Jeff Weber, head of AT&T's business markets group. "Shaklee has had enormous success with its person-to-person model, so we saw an opportunity to tap into its sales expertise and distributor network."

Shaklee distributors, who sell health and wellness goods via home gatherings and personal outreach, will now also pitch AT&T's long-distance plans. Distributors stand to make a commission on any new long-distance customers they sign up. "Our mission is to improve people's health and well-being, and reliable phone service is crucial for thatâ€”to connect with family, access emergency services or health care providers," said Roger Barnett, Chairman and CEO of Shaklee Corporation. "We believe offering AT&T's long-distance plans will provide value to our customers and business opportunity for our distributors."  

The pilot will roll out in parts of Texas, California and Florida, with the potential to expand nationally if successful. But some industry analysts are skeptical that door-to-door marketing can turn the tide for AT&T's long-distance business. "AT&T faces huge disadvantages compared to mobile and internet options. Distributors will have to persuade customers to stick with landline long-distance, and that is going to be an uphill battle no matter the sales method," said Daniel Loo, a telecom analyst with Frost & Sullivan. The partnership is also risky for Shaklee, as its distributors' time may be diverted from selling wellness goods to pitching AT&T landline services with potentially little payoff.
