AT&T Corp's Core Businesses Rebound in Q4 1996, But Mounting Bad Debts from Business Customers Causing Concern  

AT&T Corp reported improved results in its core long-distance and wireless businesses in the fourth quarter of 1996, beating Wall Street expectations. However, the company also announced rising uncollectible accounts from major business customers, signaling potential trouble ahead.

Revenue from AT&T's long-distance voice and data services rose 3.6% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. The number of wireless subscribers jumped 16.5% year over year, helping to boost that division's revenue by 12.2%. Thanks to cost cutting and restructuring efforts, AT&T's profit margins also expanded. Net income for the quarter was $1.42 billion, up from $1.31 billion the previous year. 

"Our core businesses are performing well, and we are optimizing operations to maximize efficiency," said AT&T CEO Robert Allen. "However, we are keeping a close eye on certain large business accounts that are increasingly delinquent in payments." AT&T reported a 26% year-over-year increase in "doubtful accounts," or uncollectible debts. Most of the delinquent payments are from major corporations and longtime AT&T clients.

The risk of greater uncollectible amounts rattled some investors, even as AT&T's overall results beat expectations. AT&T's stock price dropped 2.4% in morning trading as analysts voiced concerns about the potential for future write-downs if more corporations default on payments. AT&T executives said they have escalated collection efforts and may have to re-evaluate service to chronic non-payers.  

"While AT&T's core metrics were solid, the accounts receivable flag is a worry," said Jack Spencer, a telecom analyst at Morgan & Co. "If there are further cracks in the economy, that could significantly eat into profits and cash flow." However, other analysts said they believe AT&T has adequately reserved for doubtful accounts, and short of a major recession, any losses should be manageable.

AT&T remains confident in its outlook for continued growth in its strategic business units in 1997. The company expects the U.S. economy to remain stable with moderate growth, supporting steady demand for its products and services. Barring a downturn, the company said its rebounding operations should lead to higher profits and improved shareholder returns this year. But AT&T may face hard choices if more clients struggle to pay their phone bills.
