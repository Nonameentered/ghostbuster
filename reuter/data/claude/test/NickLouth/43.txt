Global One to Cut Jobs After Exceeding Expected Losses in 1996, Sources Say 

Global One, the telecommunications giant, is planning major job cuts after posting larger-than-expected losses for 1996, according to sources close to the company. The cuts are said to affect up to 10% of Global One's 87,000 employees worldwide.

The company is scheduled to announce its full-year financial results on Thursday, but sources say Global One's net loss for 1996 will exceed analysts' projections of $1.2 billion. The company's poor performance is blamed on increased competition in the telecom market, delays in new product rollouts, and the costs of expanding into new geographies. 

In response, Global One's CEO John Thompson is said to unveil a restructuring plan that will cut between 5,000 to 10,000 jobs over the next 18 months. The cuts and other cost-saving measures are aimed at saving $2 billion annually. Global One's share price has dropped over 25% in the past year due to concerns over growth and profitability.

"Global One has been struggling to meet its financial targets for some time and job cuts seemed inevitable," said Brian Lewis, a telecom analyst at JPH Morgan. "The number of positions to be eliminated is quite large, signaling the company's determination to overhaul its cost base and find a path back to profitability."

Global One was formed in 1993 through the merger of US telecom company General Telephone and Electronics with Britain's Imperial Continental Telecom. The merger was intended to create a telecommunications powerhouse that could compete on a global scale. However, integrating the two companies has proven challenging and Global One has faced difficulties competing against rivals with lower cost structures and more nimble operations.

With its large workforce and sprawling operations spanning 43 countries, Global One has struggled to adapt quickly to changes in the market. By slashing jobs and reorganizing itself into a leaner company focused on core operations, Global One hopes to renew growth and better compete in an increasingly cutthroat industry.

The job cuts are likely to fall most heavily on former employees of General Telephone and Electronics in the U.S., where labor costs are higher, sources say. The future remains uncertain for Global One, even with a successful restructuring.
