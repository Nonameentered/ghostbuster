MCI and British Telecom Merger Smoothed by Two-Year Courtship  

MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC announced today that they have agreed to merge in a deal worth $21 billion, creating one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. The merger comes after nearly two years of on-again, off-again talks and growing competition in the international long-distance phone market.

The new company, to be called Concert, will have annual revenue of about $30 billion and offer phone and data services to residential and business customers in 65 countries. The company will be based in London and Ashburn, Virginia. 

The merger will allow the two companies to combine resources to accelerate expansion into new markets and gain greater scale in existing ones. "This merger makes strategic and economic sense," said F. Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive officer of MCI. "Concert will have the scope and scale to stimulate continued growth through additional services, greater reach and faster time to market."

The merger discussions began in late 1996 but broke down early last year over price and management control issues. Talks resumed last fall and the two sides were able to reach an agreement as competitive pressures intensified in their core international long-distance market from rivals like AT&T Corp. and Deutsche Telekom AG.

Under the terms of the merger, MCI shareholders will receive 1.0433 new British Telecom shares for each MCI share, which based on yesterday's closing stock prices values MCI at $37 billion. MCI shareholders will own about 45% of the new company. The merger requires approval by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close in about six months.

The merger is the latest sign of rapid consolidation in the global telecommunications industry. Carriers are joining forces to gain scale, expand into new markets, and bundle new voice, data and Internet services. Earlier this month, Deutsche Telekom acquired VoiceStream Wireless Corp. for $50.7 billion. Other recent deals include the merger of UK carriers Orange and One2One and the planned union between Telia AB of Sweden and Norway's Telenor ASA.

The new company faces several challenges, including integrating very different corporate cultures, meshing technologies and networks, and competing in an increasingly global market against larger rivals. But executives at both companies expressed confidence that the merger would significantly strengthen their competitive position and accelerate growth in a fast-changing industry.
