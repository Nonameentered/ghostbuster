Sprint Corp's Fourth Quarter Results Show Strong Core Growth but  Earnings Trail Estimates Due to Dilution from New Ventures

Sprint Corp reported mixed fourth quarter results today as the company continues its turnaround efforts. Revenue and subscriber growth were strong in Sprint's core wireless business but earnings per share fell short of analyst estimates due to losses from Sprint's new ventures in mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and wireless wholesale. 

Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3% year over year to $8.24 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectation of $8.15 billion. The growth was fueled by a net increase of 309,000 postpaid phone subscribers, showing that Sprint's marketing and network improvement initiatives continue to resonate with customers. However, net income dropped to $180 million or $0.04 per share from $214 million or $0.05 per share in the prior-year quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share were $0.02, missing the average analyst estimate of $0.04 per share.

According to Sprint CEO Michel Combes, "Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that our strategy is working as the core Sprint business has returned to growth. We continue gaining wireless market share with strong postpaid phone additions and have now achieved six consecutive quarters of postpaid net additions." Combes pointed to Sprint's network reliability, value pricing, and customer experience improvements as key factors driving the subscriber growth.

However, Combes acknowledged that dilution of $0.02 per share from Sprint's MVNO relationships with Altice, Comcast, and others weighed on fourth quarter earnings. The MVNO partnerships are critical to Sprint's long-term strategy but will continue to be a drag on profitability as these businesses scale in the coming quarters. Sprint's wholesale business, which resells network access to other carriers, also remains unprofitable.

While investor reaction was muted, the fourth quarter results show that Sprint's turnaround is on track with strong growth in its core wireless operations. Profitability should improve over time if the company can effectively balance growth of its MVNO and wholesale partnerships with its own-branded consumer business. Sprint is working to make progress toward a merger with T-Mobile US which, if approved, would enable faster 5G deployment and greater scale benefits.
