AT&T Calls for Industry-Wide Crackdown on Customers Failing to Pay Phone Bills

AT&T, the nation's largest telecommunications provider, announced today that it is calling on other phone companies to join forces in taking aggressive action against customers who are delinquent in paying their phone bills. Speaking at a telecom industry conference, AT&T CEO John Donovan said “It is time for all of us to get serious about collecting on overdue bills. If customers don't pay what they owe, it impacts our bottom line and ability to invest in our networks.” 

Donovan proposed several “get-tough” measures that companies could take together, including temporarily restricting data and call access for customers with overdue balances, turning delinquent accounts over to collection agencies more quickly, and sharing data on “serial offenders” – customers who frequently do not pay bills with multiple providers. “We need an industry-wide bad debtor database and agreement on stern consequences for those who make a habit of not paying,” Donovan said.

Consumer advocates immediately criticized the proposal, calling it “alarming” and “predatory.” Miranda Wilson of the Citizens Telecommunications Union said “ disconnecting or restricting access should always be an absolute last resort. Many customers struggle to pay phone bills due to circumstances outside their control like job loss, medical emergencies, or natural disasters. The companies should show more compassion.”

AT&T acknowledged that any crackdown could impact some customers facing financial hardship. But Donovan argued that the industry has been too lenient for too long. “We aim to change behavior and hold people accountable,” he said. According to AT&T, the company and its competitors nationwide are losing over $12 billion per year due to unpaid bills.

While other major telecom companies have yet to officially sign on to AT&T's initiative, some indicated they would be open to further discussion around “accountability measures.” The proposal is expected to be a hot topic of debate at future industry meetings. For now, consumer advocates are urging phone companies to find ways of helping those with unpaid bills get back on their feet financially instead of immediately adopting harsh consequences. The battle lines on this issue appear to just be forming.
