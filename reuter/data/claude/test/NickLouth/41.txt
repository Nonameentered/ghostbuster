MCI's Focus on High Value Customers Yields Impressive Fourth Quarter Results

MCI Communications reported strong fourth quarter results today, capping off a solid year of growth driven by the company's strategic focus on high value business customers. For the fourth quarter, MCI posted revenue of $4.3 billion, up 12% from the same period last year. Net income rose to $201 million, a 32% increase over fourth quarter 2018. 

For the full year 2019, MCI generated revenue of $16.8 billion, up 10% from 2018. Net income was $723 million, a 25% rise compared to the previous year. The company achieved impressive growth across all segments, especially in its Enterprise and International divisions which target large corporate and government clients. Sales in the Enterprise segment grew 17% for the year, while International revenue expanded by 15% on the back of new contracts in Europe and Asia.

"Our focus on high value customers is paying off," said MCI CEO Paul Smith. "By providing dedicated service and customized solutions to our major clients, we have built trusted partnerships that fuel long term growth. Our investments in advanced network infrastructure and new technologies like software-defined networking and enhanced security solutions are enhancing our value to these customers."

MCI's positive momentum is expected to continue into 2020. The company is estimating full year revenue growth in the 8-10% range and earnings to increase 10-15% over 2019 levels. Growth will be propelled by further expansion into new international markets as well as additional sales to major US firms and government agencies. MCI also anticipates its recent acquisition of cloud services provider SkySoft will add over $500 million in revenue and provide opportunities to offer integrated networking and cloud solutions to Enterprise and International clients.

While MCI faces competitive pressures in parts of its business, the company's focus on the high value segment is paying substantial dividends. With a growing global footprint and solutions tailored to the needs of its largest clients, MCI seems poised to gain market share and sustain its impressive financial performance going forward. For investors, MCI represents an attractive opportunity in the telecommunications sector with a proven strategy for growth in a consolidating industry. Overall, this was a very positive report from MCI indicating the company's strategic vision is achieving meaningful results.
