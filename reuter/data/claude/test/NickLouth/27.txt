Cable TV Industry Shifts Focus from Phone to Internet, Abandoning Projects and Causing Concern for Regional Bells 

The cable television industry is abandoning its decade-long effort to break into the residential phone business and instead shifting resources to offering high-speed Internet access. This move is a blow to regional phone companies, also known as “Baby Bells,” that had come to rely on partnership deals with cable operators to offer local phone service.

Cable companies like Comcast Corp., Time Warner Cable Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. poured billions of dollars into new infrastructure over the past 10 years to offer digital phone service to compete with traditional landline phones provided by the Baby Bells like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. However, cable phone services struggled to gain market share, facing infrastructure challenges as well as customer loyalty to existing phone companies. 

Now cable operators are halting investment in their phone platforms and redeploying resources to enhance their broadband networks and other services like Wi-Fi hotspots, home security and streaming entertainment. “The phone product has run its course. Our future is broadband, not voice,” said a Cox Communications executive who requested anonymity.

The strategic shift will have major implications for the telecom industry. The Baby Bells still generate a large portion of revenue from providing traditional landline phone service, even as many customers have dropped their landlines in favor of mobile phones. The Bells were partnering with cable companies to gain access to cable broadband networks to shore up their own deteriorating phone infrastructure. Without these deals, the Bells will have to invest billions to upgrade their aging phone networks even as customers continue abandoning landlines.

“The Bells will be left holding the bag on an outdated technology,” said telecom industry analyst Jeffrey Halpern of Halpern Advisors. “They were hoping to squeeze more life out of their 100-year-old phone networks through deals with the cable companies. Now they have no choice but to bite the bullet and rebuild their networks from scratch.”

Consumer advocates warned the shift could reduce competition in both broadband and phone service. “We may end up back where we started with cable monopolies and little choice for customers,” said Serena Viswanathan, a policy analyst with the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. “Regulators need to closely monitor how this plays out to ensure competition in these critical markets.”  

However, cable industry representatives argue they will continue providing competitive pressure through their broadband offerings, despite scaling back phone service. “Cable broadband is already faster, better and more widely available than what the phone companies offer," said Brian Dietz, a spokesman for the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. "That’s not going to change.”

The strategic shift underway in the cable industry is the inevitable result of a decade-long experiment in "triple-play" bundling of phone, TV and Internet services that never quite lived up to expectations. While the bundled discounts helped cable operators win over some phone customers, infrastructure challenges and customer loyalty to the Bells limited gains. Now, with broadband and streaming video as their clear paths to growth, cable companies are ready to leave the phone wars behind. For the telecom industry's traditional powers, the cable giants' surrender means the phone fight may finally be over, but the battle for Internet and entertainment dominance is just getting started.
