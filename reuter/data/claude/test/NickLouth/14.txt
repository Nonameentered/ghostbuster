AT&T Finally Untethers Lucent Technologies in Three-Way Split-Up, Causing Confusion Among Shareholders  

AT&T completed its long-awaited split into three independent public companies on Monday. The restructuring is one of the most ambitious corporate breakups in history, fracturing the company formerly known as Ma Bell into distinct telecommunications, networking, and information technology businesses. 

The spinoff converts the former AT&T into three new companies: the new AT&T, focused on telecommunications and broadband services; Lucent Technologies, concentrated on networking equipment and software for telecom companies; and NCR Corporation, the information technology services arm centered around retail technology and software. The breakup of the $150 billion AT&T is intended to make the resulting companies more nimble and better able to focus on fast-growing segments of the industry, but the move has confounded many investors and analysts. 

"The sheer size and complexity of this breakup is unparalleled,” said Craig Johnson, an analyst with Portsmouth Investments. "Trying to analyze and determine valuations for these new companies is like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded. The confusion and uncertainty is frustrating investors, at least for now.”

AT&T shares have dropped more than 10% since the split was announced as shareholders reassess the new companies and shift their holdings around. AT&T leader Michael Armstrong championed the breakup as necessary to unlock value for shareholders, but that value has yet to be realized in the market. However, Mr. Armstrong maintained confidence that investors would come around once the new management teams laid out strategic roadmaps for how each company will drive growth as independent entities.

The largest of the new companies is the new AT&T, which comprises AT&T's telecommunications network as well as its wireless infrastructure and relationships. The new AT&T starts with $71 billion in annual revenue, the bulk of which comes from local landline phone service, long-distance calling, and its growing wireless business. The company is positioned to be a dominant competitor to the Baby Bells that AT&T was forced to spin off years ago.

Lucent Technologies takes over AT&T's technology infrastructure business, including networking equipment as well as cutting-edge R&D. Lucent will have $34 billion in initial revenue but the highest growth potential of the new firms. However, as an independent company Lucent loses the competitive advantage of  being supported by AT&T and will have to establish its technology on its own.
