Anne Bingaman, Former Head of U.S. Antitrust Division, Appointed President of LCI International Inc.’s Local Telecommunications Division  

LCI International Inc., a leading telecommunications company, announced today the appointment of Anne K. Bingaman as president of its local telecommunications services division. Ms. Bingaman previously served as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under President Bill Clinton.

In her new role, Ms. Bingaman will oversee LCI’s local and wireless phone services across the United States, including residential landline, business landline, and 4G LTE mobile offerings. The local telecommunications division serves over 15 million customers and accounts for nearly half of LCI’s $42 billion in annual revenue. 

“We are thrilled to welcome Anne to LCI,” said CEO Brian Robertson. “Her experience leading major telecommunications policy initiatives and enforcing competition laws will provide invaluable perspective to LCI as we continue expanding our next-generation networks and service offerings.”

Ms. Bingaman led the Antitrust Division from 1993 to 1996, the first woman to hold that role. In that capacity, she reviewed major telecommunications mergers and brought several high-profile antitrust lawsuits, including the case that broke up the AT&T telephone monopoly. She also served as New Mexico Attorney General for six years prior to her appointment as Assistant Attorney General.

“LCI has long been at the forefront of innovation in telecommunications, and I’m excited to help drive its continued growth and leadership,” said Ms. Bingaman. “Robust competition and access to advanced, affordable networks are key to the wellbeing of communities across America, and I look forward to advancing pro-consumer policies in my new role at LCI.”

Ms. Bingaman received her J.D. from Stanford Law School and her bachelor’s degree from Wellesley College. She will be based in LCI’s headquarters in San Antonio, Texas and will report directly to CEO Brian Robertson. The appointment is effective beginning July 1.
