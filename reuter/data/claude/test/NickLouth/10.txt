Rural Wireless Firms Expect Rapid Growth Without Competition from PCS Rivals

Small rural wireless carriers offering cellular service in remote parts of the U.S. anticipate rapid subscriber growth in the coming years due to limited competition from larger national carriers. These small regional players focus on areas not served by the major PCS networks of companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint. 

Westlink Communications operates networks in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. The company added over 50,000 subscribers last year and projects similar growth this year. “The big guys don’t find it profitable to build out networks in sparsely populated rural areas, so we have a lot of open territory,” said Westlink CEO Jenny Thompson. The company’s service covers over 200,000 square miles across the northern Rockies and Great Plains.

Midwest Wireless operates in Nebraska, Kansas, and parts of Colorado and Iowa. The company has over 200,000 subscribers and expects to add between 30,000 to 50,000 new subscribers per year for the foreseeable future. “Rural communities want the connectivity of wireless service but have limited options. We aim to provide coverage and service to meet their needs,” said Midwest Wireless President Dave Rowland. The company has invested heavily in network infrastructure over the past decade to provide digital voice and 3G data connectivity across its coverage area.  

The PCS carriers argue that in contrast to urban and suburban areas where wireless networks often overlap, they have no incentive to overbuild in rural markets with limited populations. “While coverage is important, we have to deploy our capital efficiently based on customer demand and density,” said AT&T Mobility CEO Stan Reynolds. “The rural carriers are optimized to serve these thin markets, so we wish them success.” For now, the Big Three PCS carriers seem content to cede many rural areas to regional players.

The proliferation of smartphones has increased demand for rural wireless connectivity. Rural carriers have upgraded their networks to handle more advanced devices and data services. With demand rising and competition limited, rural wireless companies are poised to gain many new subscribers in the coming years through serving communities that remain wireless frontiers.
