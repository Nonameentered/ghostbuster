MCI Communications and British Telecom $20 Billion Merger Smoothly Sailing Thanks to Two-Year Courtship

U.S. and European regulators today approved British Telecom PLC's $20 billion acquisition of MCI Communications Corp., paving the way for what would be the largest telecommunications merger in history. The deal caps a two-year courtship between the two companies amid a wave of consolidations transforming the global telecom industry.

British Telecom, the United Kingdom's largest telecommunications company, agreed in November to buy MCI outright in a deal set to boost efficiencies and expand its customer base. MCI is the second-largest long-distance carrier in the U.S. behind AT&T. The merger is expected to close within the next few weeks.

“This is a pivotal moment that brings together two highly complementary businesses poised to lead the next generation of converged, global communication services,” said British Telecom Chief Executive Sir Christopher Bland. MCI Chairman and Chief Executive Bert Roberts said the merger “promises substantial benefits for customers, shareholders and employees of both companies.” 

The $20 billion deal underscores the accelerating push by telecom companies to gain scale and combine assets to offer bundles of phone, wireless and Internet services. In recent months, the industry has witnessed a series of mega-mergers as companies have sought to cut costs and gain the necessary mass to make investments in fast-growing technologies.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic spent months reviewing the merger to ensure it would not hamper competition. The European Commission approved the deal in March after British Telecom agreed to certain conditions, including the sale of some assets. U.S. regulators followed suit today. The approvals mark a turning point, signaling a green light for cross-border telecom mergers of large scale.

For British Telecom, the purchase of MCI provides a major boost to its international operations and a footprint in the U.S. market. MCI gives British Telecom network assets, major business and government clients, and advanced data services. British Telecom plans to retain the MCI brand and combine the two companies' carrier and mobile operations. The deal is expected to lead to at least $2 billion in cost savings and benefits.   

For MCI, the merger is a lifeline that will provide financial stability after the company emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2003. MCI struggled in the aftermath of the tech bust and telecom meltdown but has since built momentum with its network and business services. British Telecom pledged to invest in and support MCI's turnaround. MCI stockholders approved the merger in October.

In trading today following the regulatory announcements, British Telecom's stock rose 2% in London, and MCI shares climbed 3% on the Nasdaq market. Analysts hailed the approvals as a victory for the companies that is likely to drive further telecom consolidation. With the major hurdles now cleared, British Telecom and MCI appear headed to a successful union thanks to their two-year courtship and patience navigating the regulatory process. The new merged entity promises to wield greater influence on the global stage.
