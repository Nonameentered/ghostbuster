AT&T's New Executive Vice President Aims to Boost Share in Consumer Long-Distance Market  

AT&T Inc. recently named John Doe as its new executive vice president in charge of the company's consumer long-distance business. In this role, Doe will be responsible for managing AT&T's long-distance phone services for residential and small business customers across the U.S. 

Doe brings over 20 years of experience in the telecommunications industry to his new position. Most recently, he served as senior vice president of sales and marketing for Verizon's consumer long-distance division. Under his leadership, Verizon gained over 10 percentage points of market share in the hotly contested consumer long-distance market.  

"John has a proven track record of boosting sales, winning customers, and outpacing the competition," said Jane Doe, AT&T's CEO. "His experience and vision will be invaluable as we work to expand our share of the consumer long-distance market. I'm confident with John on board we will make great strides in gaining new long-distance customers and strengthening our relationships with existing customers."

Long-distance service, once a dominant source of revenue for telecom companies, has declined sharply in recent years due to the rise of mobile phones and internet calling services. However, it remains a multi-billion dollar industry and an important competitive battleground for major players like AT&T and Verizon.

Gaining share in the consumer long-distance market will be one of Doe's top priorities in his new role. To achieve this goal, he plans to lead a rebranding of AT&T's long-distance service, bundle more value-added features into calling plans, ramp up digital marketing efforts, and offer more competitive pricing. He will also aim to improve the long-distance customer experience to increase retention and word-of-mouth referrals.

“The consumer long-distance business is undergoing immense change, but with change comes opportunity,” said Doe in a statement. “I’m excited to leverage my experience to strengthen AT&T’s position as a leader in this market and deliver more value to our long-distance customers.”

Doe holds a bachelor's degree in Marketing from the University of Texas at Austin and an MBA from Duke University. He will be based in Dallas, Texas - AT&T's corporate headquarters.
