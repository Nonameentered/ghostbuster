BellSouth Corp Exceeds Earnings Expectations With Strong Growth in Access Lines and Cellular Customers

BellSouth Corp reported earnings of 48 cents per share for the second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations of 46 cents per share. The telecommunications company saw strong growth in both its traditional landline phone business as well as its wireless cellphone unit.

Revenue increased 3.8% to $5.15 billion, up from $4.96 billion for the same period last year. BellSouth added 218,000 new phone access lines during the quarter, continuing a rebound from declines in recent years as customers abandoned landline phones for wireless service. The company has added over 500,000 new phone lines so far this year.

BellSouth's fast-growing Cingular Wireless joint venture with AT&T also showed strong performance, adding 1.6 million new subscribers in the second quarter. Cingular, the second largest US wireless carrier, now has over 54 million subscribers. Revenue from BellSouth's 40% stake in Cingular increased nearly 15% from a year earlier.

“We delivered solid results this quarter through continued focus on revenue growth, productivity improvements and operational effectiveness,” said BellSouth CEO Duane Ackerman. “Our landline business has stabilized and continues to perform well, and Cingular's success validates our wireless strategy.”

The strong quarterly results reflect BellSouth's resurgence after a difficult period of declining landline customers, competition in the wireless market and revenue pressures. The company has introduced new phone and internet services, cut costs and raised rates in segments. The joint ownership of fast-growing Cingular has also provided new revenue as demand for wireless phones has soared.

BellSouth stock rose 2.5% on the news to close at $27.15 per share. The company's results suggest it has effectively navigated challenges that remain for the broader telecom sector. With further cost controls and continued wireless growth, BellSouth appears poised to achieve solid earnings and revenue gains for the remainder of 2005.
