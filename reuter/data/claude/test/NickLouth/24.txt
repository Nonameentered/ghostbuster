Phone Company Stocks May See Growth in Q4 1996, But Investors Wary of Competition  

Major U.S. telephone companies are expected to report solid revenue and subscriber growth in the fourth quarter of 1996, analysts say. However, investors remain cautious about the sector due to concerns over increasing competition.

Regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs) like Verizon, AT&T, and CenturyLink are predicted to add hundreds of thousands of new landline phone subscribers in Q4, continuing a trend of steady customer acquisition over the past two years. These subscriber additions, combined with rate increases, should translate to healthy revenue gains for the quarter.

“The fundamentals of the telecom industry remain strong, with subscriber growth, pricing power, and stable demand,” said Jennifer Smith, a telecommunications analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. She expects major telcos to report 4-6% revenue growth for Q4.

At the same time, the long-distance market is showing signs of a rebound. AT&T and MCI Communications both added net new long-distance subscribers in Q3 for the first time in over a year. They are poised to continue that trend in Q4, aided by aggressive marketing of bundled local and long-distance calling plans.  

However, the rapidly changing telecommunications landscape means the good times may not last for long. The landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996 opens up local phone markets to competition for the first time. The new law allows long-distance carriers and other companies to provide local phone service in competition with the incumbent RBOCs.  

Over the longer term, this new competition poses a threat to the RBOCs' customer base and pricing power. Some analysts worry the telcos may have to cut rates or offer more promotions to retain and win new subscribers. Profit margins could decline as a result.

"While the Q4 results should be solid, we have a cautious view of telco stocks heading into 1997 due to concerns overrising competitive pressures that may hamper future growth,” said Richard Fox, a telecom analyst with J.P. Morgan.   

Shares of major telephone companies have underperformed the broader market over the last year. For example, Verizon stock is up just 5% in the past 12 months compared to a 26% gain for the S&P 500 index. Investors appear to be anticipating the effect of greater competition on these companies. 

Telco executives acknowledge the challenges ahead but remain confident in their ability to provide superior service to win customer loyalty. They also expect new services like data, wireless, and broadband to help offset any landline revenue declines. The coming year will prove crucial in showing whether the RBOCs can thrive in a newly open marketplace. With both opportunities and risks at hand, the next few quarters may be a turning point for telecom stocks.
