GTE surpasses customer target and introduces new flat-rate calling plan 

Telecommunications giant GTE announced today that it has surpassed its target for new wireless customers in the first quarter of this year. The company added 1.2 million new subscribers, beating Wall Street estimates by over 15% and its own internal projections. Buoyed by the strong growth, GTE also unveiled a new flat-rate calling plan for customers aimed at gaining more market share from competitors.

In a statement, GTE CEO John Thompson said "We are thrilled by the customer response to our latest smartphones and network improvements. Our relentless focus on providing an exceptional customer experience with the best value is clearly resonating." The 1.2 million new subscribers represents a 25% increase from the same quarter last year. At the end of the first quarter, GTE now has over 75 million total wireless customers nationwide.

The success comes on the back of major investments to expand and upgrade GTE's 4G LTE network coverage over the past year. The company has built over 10,000 new cell sites and upgraded thousands more to provide higher bandwidth and faster speeds. GTE has also launched several new phones, including the Galaxy S10, iPhone XR, and Pixel 3, that can take advantage of the enhanced network capabilities. 

Looking to maintain momentum, GTE announced a new flat-rate calling plan titled "Unlimited Everything" priced at $50 per month. The plan provides unlimited talk, text and data with no caps or overage charges. Video streaming is limited to standard definition, but customers can pay an additional $10 per month for high-definition streaming. Tethering to other devices is also allowed at no extra charge up to a speed of 3G. 

The flat-rate plan is available to new and existing GTE subscribers starting today. In a bold move aimed squarely at competitors, GTE is offering to cover the cost of any early termination fees for customers that switch from other carriers and sign up for the Unlimited Everything plan. The total reimbursement is capped at $375 but applies regardless of how much is owed to the current carrier.

Analysts view the new unlimited plan and reimbursement offer as an aggressive strategy by GTE to maintain its momentum. Flat-rate unlimited plans have become the industry norm, so GTE is looking to differentiate itself through price and perks. If the new plan proves popular and spurs another surge of new subscribers, competitors may have to respond with rate cuts and promotions of their own to stem customer defections. For now at least, GTE has seized the initiative in an increasingly competitive market.
