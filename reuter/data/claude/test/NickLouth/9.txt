AT&T Raises U.S. State-to-State Call Rates by 5.9% from Dec. 1

AT&T Inc, the second largest U.S. wireless carrier, announced that it will raise its domestic calling rates between U.S. states by 5.9% starting December 1. The rate increase will impact millions of AT&T subscribers across the country who make voice calls to landline or mobile numbers in other states.

According to a statement from AT&T, the decision to increase long distance calling rates is due to increasing business costs to operate and maintain its national network infrastructure. "Operating and maintaining a reliable nationwide wireless network requires significant investments and resources," said AT&T spokesperson Lindsey Macias. "These rate adjustments will help enable us to continue expanding and improving our network for all of our customers." 

The exact rate changes will vary based on the subscriber's location and calling destination. For example, a call from Texas to California could increase by 3 cents per minute, while a call from Florida to New York may go up by 5 cents per minute. The average increase for most subscribers nationwide will be about 5.9%. AT&T said customers will see the new rates reflected on their next billing cycle immediately following December 1.

Consumer advocacy groups expressed disappointment with AT&T's announcement. "This rate increase is unnecessary and will unfairly impact many Americans, especially those on limited or fixed incomes," said Brian Marshall, policy director at Progressive Consumer Watch. "AT&T continues to raise prices while experiencing tremendous revenue and profit growth. There is no reason customers should be paying more when the company is doing better than ever."

The news comes just a week after Verizon Communications also announced price hikes for its subscribers, including a $2 increase to its administrative fees and a $2.20 increase to its "cost recovery surcharge." T-Mobile and Sprint have not announced any similar nationwide price increases at this time. 

The rate increase by AT&T may drive many customers to switch to unlimited calling plans to avoid higher per-minute charges, or prompt some subscribers to drop AT&T service altogether in favor of lower-cost competitors like T-Mobile. However, for customers stuck with AT&T due to coverage or contractual reasons, the higher long distance rates are something they will have to absorbâ€”at least for now. Both consumer groups and some lawmakers argue that more should be done to prevent large telecom companies from freely raising rates when there are few meaningful alternatives for customers.

In response to the criticism, Macias of AT&T defended the company's price adjustment: "We understand some customers may be frustrated, but these minimal rate increases are necessary to enable us to continue providing and improving the network service our customers rely on. Customers always have the freedom to choose from our competitive selection of calling plans, including unlimited options, to meet their needs and budget."
