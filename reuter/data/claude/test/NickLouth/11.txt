Kodak President Emphasizes Innovation as Key to Protecting Profit Margins  

In a keynote address to shareholders today, Kodak President and CEO Jeff Clarke emphasized that innovation is critical for the iconic camera and film company to maintain healthy profit margins in an increasingly digital world. While Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975, the company was initially slow to adapt its business model to digital technologies. This delay nearly proved fatal, as Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012 as consumers switched en masse from film to digital photography.

Under Clarke's leadership, Kodak has focused on developing new technologies and revenue streams to avoid the mistakes of the past. "Innovation is in Kodak's DNA," Clarke told shareholders. "We invented digital capture technologies that powered the digital imaging revolution. But we were too slow to apply those innovations to our own business model. We won't make that mistake again."  

Clarke pointed to Kodak's new initiatives in printing, 3D printing materials, and lithium-ion battery development as examples of innovation that can fuel future growth. In printing, Kodak has developed innovative high-speed inkjet technologies that provide an alternative to traditional offset printing. Kodak is also producing materials and components for industrial 3D printers, a market that is expected to triple in size over the next five years. And Kodak's new lithium-ion battery venture aims to provide batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage.  

At the same time, Kodak will continue to support the film photography community that has remained loyal to the brand. "Film is still an important part of our business and will continue to be for the foreseeable future," said Clarke. But he stressed that innovation is key to balancing Kodak's traditional strengths with new digital products and services that tap into growth markets. "If we keep that spirit of innovation alive, we'll thrive for generations to come, just as George Eastman envisioned over a century ago."

While shareholders expressed optimism about Kodak's new direction, some analysts are more skeptical about the chances for success in new and competitive technology markets. If Kodak's bets on printing, 3D printing, and lithium-ion batteries don't pay off, the company could face pressure on profit margins and another long road to re-establishing a stable, growing business. But Clarke and his team remain confident that an ongoing commitment to innovation can keep that scenario from developing.  Innovation may have been missing in action during Kodak's difficult days, but it seems to be back as a guiding force for the future.
