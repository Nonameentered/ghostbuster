Regional Telephone Companies Report Strong Fourth-Quarter Results amid Growing Demand for Internet Phone Lines and Wireless Services 

The major regional telephone companies in the U.S. reported strong fourth-quarter financial results this week, buoyed by increasing demand for internet-based phone services and wireless plans. Leaders among the group included CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, and Windstream Holdings.

CenturyLink, the third-largest telecommunications company in the U.S., reported quarterly revenue of $4.4 billion, up from $4.3 billion in the same period last year. The increase was driven by a 12 percent rise in broadband subscribers and a 7 percent increase in wireless customers. The company added 13,000 broadband subscribers and 40,000 wireless subscribers compared to a year ago. 

"We delivered another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by higher strategic revenue, expanded adjusted EBITDA margins and solid free cash flow," said CenturyLink CEO Jeff Storey. "Our network investments are paying off and our customers are responding well to our bundled service offerings that provide fast, reliable connections to meet their needs."

Frontier Communications, which provides service to rural, suburban, and small-town communities in 29 states, reported quarterly revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 5 percent from a year ago. The company added 20,000 broadband subscribers and 50,000 FiOS video subscribers compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Windstream Holdings reported quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion, a modest 1 percent increase from the same period in 2017. While the company has faced recent financial struggles and is restructuring its debt, its consumer and small-business divisions have remained a bright spot. Windstream added 8,000 broadband subscribers and 3,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter.

"Our consumer and SMB business performed well in the quarter, and we grew our subscriber base across broadband, FiOS and wireless services," said Windstream President and CEO Tony Thomas. "We continue to invest in our network in order to further improve the customer experience, and we recently launched speed upgrades and unlimited data plans to enable our customers to do more with their broadband service."  

The upbeat results from the regional telecom companies provide further evidence that U.S. consumers continue to demand faster broadband speeds, unlimited data plans, and bundled connectivity packages to meet both home and mobile communication needs. The companies are responding by upgrading their networks, boosting broadband speeds, and launching competitive pricing plans to win and retain subscribers. With an increasing number of people dropping traditional landline phone service in favor of internet-based and wireless options, the major internet, wireless, and TV package deals seem poised to drive future growth.
