Sprint Corp Keeps Options Open for Extending Local Phone Services Across U.S. in Post-Deregulation Environment 

Sprint Corp, the fourth-largest mobile network operator in the U.S., announced that it is exploring options to expand its local and long-distance phone services to residential and business customers across the country following the deregulation of the telecommunications industry. The company currently provides wireless voice and data services to over 50 million subscribers but has a limited presence in the landline phone market.

With the 1996 Telecommunications Act deregulating local phone service and ending long-standing telephony monopolies, telecom companies like Sprint now have an opportunity to compete across the U.S. Sprint has started testing out local phone service with its wireless customers in a few markets to determine product features, pricing options, and operational requirements before a wider rollout. The company is also upgrading parts of its fiber-optic network infrastructure to potentially handle greater landline and broadband internet traffic.  

Sprint's move reflects a broader trend of telecommunications convergence in the country, with cable, wireless and phone companies now directly competing across voice, video, and internet services. Following deregulation, incumbent local phone carriers have lost substantial market share to cable and wireless alternatives, especially among younger Americans who often do not have a landline phone connection. Sprint and other carriers see an opportunity to gain customers by bundling multiple communications services together at an attractive price point.

At the same time, significant barriers to entry remain for Sprint to overcome nationwide, including securing access to the so-called "last mile" of infrastructure into homes and businesses, setting up operational systems to provide local phone and billing services at scale, and pricing its offerings competitively. The local phone market also includes well-entrenched competitors like AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications that control much of the nation's landline infrastructure.

Sprint has not provided details on which markets it may launch residential or business phone services in for its initial rollout. The company ended long-distance phone services in 2008 to focus on its core mobile business but is now "assessing a range of options to participate in ongoing consolidation and expansion of the telecommunications industry," according to a spokesperson. With its plans still in flux, Sprint aims to move cautiously but deliberately in exploring a return to offering bundled communications services across the U.S. going forward in partnership with technology and infrastructure providers.
