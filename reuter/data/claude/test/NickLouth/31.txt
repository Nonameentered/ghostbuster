SBC Communications Inc sees no end to soaring demand for wireless services in 1997 

SBC Communications Inc, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., said it sees no slowing down in the explosive demand for wireless services this year. The company added a record number of new wireless customers in 1996 and expects the growth in wireless to continue unabated in 1997.

"Wireless services have become integral to how people communicate and do business," said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman and chief executive officer. "We fully expect the phenomenal growth in wireless to continue as more people recognize the benefits of mobility and convenience."

SBC added 1.4 million new wireless customers in 1996, the highest ever annual increase and more than double the number added in 1995. The company ended the year with over 5.2 million wireless customers across its operating companies, a 37% increase from a year earlier. Revenue from wireless services grew 52% to $3.1 billion in 1996.

The surging demand for wireless is driven by the increasing desire for connectivity and mobility as well as affordable pricing and attractive calling plans offered by companies like SBC. The company has significantly expanded its digital network coverage and released competitive pricing plans with long distance, roaming and family options to tap into growing customer segments.

"We are heavily investing in new technologies and spectrum to ensure our wireless networks have enough capacity to handle the increasing number of customers and volume of calls," said Whitacre. The company spent $2.3 billion in 1996 to improve its wireless networks. It also has plans to bid on additional spectrum in the upcoming FCC auctions to boost network capacity.

While the wireless market will likely get more competitive as new companies enter, SBC believes its first mover advantage, brand recognition and extensive customer base will allow it to maintain a leading position in this fast growing industry. With wireless penetration still under 20% of the total U.S. population, SBC is confident there is substantial room for future growth.

"We are just scratching the surface of the potential for wireless services," said Whitacre. "The best is yet to come."
