Eastman Kodak Co sees innovation as key to protecting profits  

Eastman Kodak Co., the iconic American film company, is betting on radical innovation to offset shrinking revenues from its traditional camera and film businesses. Kodak announced a strategic shift this week to focus investment on new technologies like 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and digital packaging.

The company, founded in 1888, was once synonymous with photography and film. However, the rise of digital cameras and smartphones has decimated demand for Kodak's analog film products. Kodak's revenues have declined over 90% since 2000. The company has struggled to reinvent itself for the digital age. Past attempts to become a leader in digital cameras, photo sharing, and online photo printing services were unsuccessful. 

Kodak's new strategy leverages its expertise in materials science, coating, and printing to enter fast-growing technology markets. In 3D printing, Kodak plans to develop new printable materials with enhanced properties for industrial and consumer use. The company believes its knowledge of dyes, coatings, and films positions it well to create a differentiated offering. In artificial intelligence, Kodak aims to build systems to help brands design intelligent packaging that can engage with consumers via smartphone. Interactive packaging could provide information on product freshness, nutrition, and recommendations.

"We tried for too long to extend our historic strengths in film and analog photography to the digital world," said Kodak CEO Jeffrey Clarke. "It is now time to pivot to new growth markets that can leverage the unique capabilities Kodak has built over the last century." 

The strategy is risky, as Kodak faces entrenched competition in these emerging fields from startups and large technology companies. However, if successful, tapping into fast-growing technology markets could restore Kodak to a leadership position and profitability. Kodak anticipates returning to revenue growth by 2020 if initial investments in 3D printing, AI, and digital packaging gain traction. After years of restructuring, Kodak aims to write the next chapter of its historyâ€”not as an analog film pioneer but as a technology innovator powering the future of imaging.
