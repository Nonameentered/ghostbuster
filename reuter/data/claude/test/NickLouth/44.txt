Citizens Utilities Co. aims to become a top U.S. telephone company through acquisitions 

Citizens Utilities Co., a diversified telecommunications company based in Stamford, Connecticut, announced today its intention to become one of the largest telephone companies in the U.S. through a series of strategic acquisitions over the next 3-5 years. CEO Robert Smith laid out the company’s vision in a call with investors, saying “Citizens Utilities is poised to aggressively expand our telephone operations to better compete on a national scale. We will pursue acquisition targets that allow us to gain new customers, increase our geographic reach, and benefit from operational synergies.”

Citizens Utilities currently serves 1.2 million telephone customers across six states in the Midwest and Northeast regions. However, the company’s customer base pales in comparison to industry giants like AT&T and Verizon, which have over 100 million subscribers each. To close this gap, Citizens Utilities is planning multiple deals to acquire smaller telephone companies in new markets. The company has already earmarked $8 billion for acquisitions and will fund additional deals through a combination of cash, debt, and equity.  

The acquisition strategy represents a bold move for Citizens Utilities, which has focused on organic growth for much of its 125-year history. However, the U.S. telephone market has become increasingly competitive in recent decades, making it difficult for smaller companies to gain new customers. By expanding rapidly through acquisitions, Citizens Utilities aims to benefit from greater economies of scale and gain access to new geographies where it can cross-sell telephone, Internet, and video services to customers.

Smith acknowledged that pursuing large acquisitions comes with risks, including the challenges of integrating new employees and systems. However, he believes the company is up to the task: “We have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating smaller telephone companies. We will apply the lessons learned to navigate larger deals while being disciplined in what we pay.” 

If executed well, Citizens Utilities’ acquisition spree could transform the company into a major player in the U.S. telecommunications industry. However, missteps along the way could saddle the company with too much debt or lead to a failure to realize anticipated cost savings. Investors appear optimistic but cautious about the company’s new strategy. Citizens Utilities’ stock price rose 3% on the news, reflecting the market’s support for the plan balanced with a degree of uncertainty. The company’s next moves will be closely watched as Citizens Utilities embarks on its journey to become a national telephone powerhouse.
