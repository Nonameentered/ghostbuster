Wall Street Brokerages Lower Earnings Estimates for AT&T Amidst Growing Competition in Telecom Market  

Major Wall Street brokerages have lowered their earnings estimates for telecommunications giant AT&T due to intensifying competition in the telecom market. AT&T faces pressure from rival Verizon as well as growing competition from cable companies now offering phone and Internet services.

AT&T, the largest telecommunications company in the U.S., has struggled to add new wireless and broadband customers in recent quarters. Verizon has aggressively promoted its rival wireless and Fios fiber-optic services, while cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications have also made inroads into AT&T’s core businesses.

Analysts at JPMorgan cut their earnings estimates for AT&T by 3 percent for 2020 and by 4 percent for 2021. They cited “increasing competitive intensity” as a key factor driving the downward revision. Brokerage firm Cowen also lowered its earnings per share forecast for AT&T by 2 percent for 2020 and 3 percent for 2021, pointing to “continued competitive pressure” and slowing growth in AT&T’s legacy voice and data landline services. 

The reduced earnings estimates suggest AT&T will face significant challenges improving its financial results over the next couple of years. In 2019, the company’s revenue declined for the third straight year as it lost phone, satellite television and broadband subscribers. AT&T has invested heavily in promotions and customer incentives to try and stabilize its core subscriber base. However, competitors have matched many of AT&T’s discount offers, curbing customer additions.

To diversify away from the competitive telecom market, AT&T acquired Time Warner in 2018, making it a major media and entertainment company overnight. AT&T is working to leverage its new media properties like HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT to drive new signups for its wireless and broadband services, especially its streaming platform AT&T TV Now. Bundling entertainment with Internet and wireless plans is a key part of AT&T’s strategy to differentiate itself, but results so far have been mixed.  

While the media business provides promising new avenues for growth, telecom analyst Craig Moffett warns that AT&T faces a “tight balancing act” to offset the substantial challenges in its communication business. Moffett, a founding partner of research firm MoffettNathanson, notes that the competitive and pricing pressures AT&T faces are unlikely to recede over the next couple of years. As such, he predicts AT&T’s earnings growth will remain “anemic” without meaningful changes to improve the performance of its legacy phone and broadband segments.

AT&T reports first quarter earnings on April 22, which will provide more details on how the company is navigating intensifying competition and whether bundling media and entertainment with Internet and wireless services is helping win and retain more customers. Investors will be closely watching AT&T’s earnings results and comments to gauge how much of a drag competitive pressures may have on the company’s financial performance for the rest of 2020 and into next year.
