AT&T Corp. Reports Increased Earnings, but Struggles with Unpaid Bills 

AT&T Corp. announced its third quarter earnings today, posting a 12% increase in profits over the same period last year. The telecommunications giant reported earnings of $3.23 billion, up from $2.89 billion a year ago. Revenue rose 5% to $44.6 billion. 

The improved results were driven by strong mobile phone subscriptions, as AT&T added over 900,000 new wireless subscribers in the third quarter. "Our core business is performing very well and driving solid results," said CEO Randall Stephenson. "Customers are clearly responding to our laser-focus on experience-driven value."

However, not all areas of AT&T's business are thriving. The company has struggled with a rise in unpaid bills and delinquent accounts. AT&T reported that "nonpaying" accounts were up 23% from a year ago, amounting to over $330 million in unpaid charges. Many of the delinquent accounts came from new wireless subscribers who failed to pay their initial bills.  

The increase in unpaid accounts has worried analysts and investors, concerned that it may be a harbinger of broader economic troubles. "If people can't pay a cell phone bill, that's a sign that they may be struggling with other necessities," said Brian Moore, a technology analyst at NewStreet Research. AT&T's stock price dropped 2.3% on the news.

In response, AT&T announced new measures to reduce delinquencies, including closer scrutiny of new subscribers before activating their service and cutting back on marketing efforts aimed at very low-income customers. "We need to find the right balance between gaining new customers and incurring bad debt," Stephenson said. "Our new policies will help ensure subscribers have the means to pay without significantly impacting our growth."

Activist groups have criticized AT&T's moves, arguing that limiting service to low-income populations will only exacerbate the digital divide. "Broadband access is a necessity, not a luxury, in today's world," said Mia Simmons, president of the non-profit Connecting Communities. "Companies like AT&T cannot pick and choose who they serve based on their income and still call themselves essential service providers." AT&T defends its policy changes as prudent measures any responsible company would take in the face of rising bad debt.

The conflicting news of higher profits but also higher delinquencies highlights the complex challenges facing AT&T as technology increasingly intertwines with economic realities. Delivering on the promise of communication and connectivity for all will require balancing business demands with social responsibilityâ€”a tension at the heart of the company's future. Overall, though, AT&T remains in a solid position to continue generating growth while navigating these issues, according to analysts. Strong results in its core operations suggest the company's outlook remains bright, unpaid bills notwithstanding.
