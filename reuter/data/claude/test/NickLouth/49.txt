Top Telecom Executives Leave Corporate Comfort for Thrill of Building New Ventures and Serious Wealth 

Several long-tenured executives at some of the nation’s largest telecommunications companies have recently left the security and comfort of corporate life to launch their own startups in hopes of building new empires and amassing significant personal wealth.

Mark Hernandez, a 22-year veteran of Verizon Communications, resigned as a senior vice president in January to found FiberForce, a company that aims to deploy high-speed fiber optic networks in mid-size cities across the U.S. that Verizon and other large providers have ignored. Hernandez told colleagues that while the compensation and benefits at Verizon were generous, the opportunity to build a company from scratch and potentially reap a huge financial windfall was too tempting to pass up at this stage in his career.

Similarly, Audrey Chen, a 19-year employee of AT&T and a former president of the company’s Business Fiber group, left AT&T earlier this month to become CEO of LightSpeed Networks. The startup has raised over $200 million to compete with AT&T and others in providing fiber Internet service to office buildings in Atlanta, Dallas, and four other cities. In an interview, Chen said she felt she had accomplished all she could within the hierarchy of a huge corporation like AT&T and relished the opportunity to make a far greater impact as the leader of her own company.

The defections of high-level talent from established telecom giants to risky startup ventures reflects the restless ambition of many in the tech sector as well as a booming market for private investment in new companies, according to analysts. “The siren song of big money and the thrill of entrepreneurship is drawing in some very senior people with proven track records at major companies,” said Brian Washburn, an telecommunications industry analyst at SNL Kagan. 

While the payoffs can be huge if a startup succeeds, the risks are equally large. The vast majority of new companies fail within a few years. However, for executives like Hernandez and Chen who have built up fortunes and security over decades-long careers, the gamble may seem more worthwhile, especially later in their careers. “They’re at a point where they want to bet big on themselves one more time,” Washburn said. “The prospect of creating something new and building wealth and success entirely through their own efforts is irresistible to certain types of leaders.”

The startups themselves also stand to gain immensely from recruiting experienced executives. “Hiring someone with the business acumen and industry contacts of a senior Verizon or AT&T executive can catapult a startup into the big leagues very quickly,” said Renee James, a partner at the venture capital firm TechStars Ventures. While the established telecom companies may temporarily lose key leaders and expertise, new competitors emerging from startups also often spur innovation, James added.

In the end, the startup game often comes down to a combination of skill, experience, timing, and luck. For executives like Hernandez and Chen, the chance to test themselves in the open market and shoot for the stars one more time is a gamble worth taking.
