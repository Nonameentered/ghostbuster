GTE Challenges AT&T with One Cent Cheaper Nationwide Calling Plan 

GTE Communications announced today that it is undercutting rival AT&T with a new nationwide calling plan that is one cent per minute cheaper. The bold move is intended to win over new customers and boost GTE's market share in the hotly competitive telecommunications industry.

GTE's new "One Cent Challenge" calling plan will charge customers 9 cents per minute for calls anywhere in the U.S. during both peak and off-peak hours. The plan includes popular calling features like call waiting, call forwarding, and voice messaging. Customers who sign up for the One Cent Challenge plan will also receive 100 free anytime minutes in their first month of service. 

"We're issuing a direct challenge to AT&T by offering exceptional value and savings to customers," said GTE CEO John Johnson at a press conference. "Why would anyone pay 10 cents or more per minute when they can get the exact same service for 9 cents a minute with GTE?"

An AT&T spokesperson dismissed GTE's new plan as a "gimmick" that will save most customers only a few pennies each month. However, telecom analysts say that price wars like this can have a major impact. "Even a difference of just one cent a minute can translate into hundreds of millions of dollars over time and millions of customers switching service," said Claire Abernathy, head of telecom research at Emergent Technologies.

GTE is counting on many thrifty Americans being willing to switch long distance carriers to save even a few dollars. "Every penny counts, and consumers today want the absolute lowest price for quality service," according to GTE's Johnson. "We think this calling plan will resonate very strongly, especially among cost-conscious residents and small business owners looking to scale back their phone bills."

The One Cent Challenge plan is available starting today for new customers nationwide. Existing GTE customers can switch to the new plan without penalty and receive the 100 free minutes offer. GTE is promoting the plan heavily on television, radio, billboards, and social media. The marketing blitz is expected to drive a surge of interest that could put pressure on AT&T to match or beat GTE's rates. The battle for the best deal has commenced, and the war promises to heat up in the months ahead.
