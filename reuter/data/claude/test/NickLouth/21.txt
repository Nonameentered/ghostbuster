Teleport Communications Group Inc Seeks Acquisitions to Sustain 50 Percent Annual Revenue Growth Target

Teleport Communications Group Inc (TCGI) announced today that it is actively pursuing acquisitions of software and telecommunications companies to help sustain its goal of 50 percent annual revenue growth over the next three years. TCGI provides cloud-based communications and collaboration services to mid-size and enterprise-level businesses. 

TCGI has enjoyed an average 42 percent annual revenue growth over the past five years, fueled by strong demand for unified communications, contact center, and business telephony services delivered via the cloud model. However, the company believes acquisition of complementary companies and technologies will be necessary to reach and maintain the 50 percent target growth rate.

"Organic growth will continue to drive significant gains, but strategic acquisitions are key to our accelerated growth plan," said TCGI CEO Tom McKnight. "We are looking at companies that can expand our geographic reach, add talent and technical capabilities, bring in new clients, and deepen our offerings, particularly in emerging areas like mobile, analytics and the Internet of Things."

TCGI plans to focus its acquisition strategy on private companies with $5 million to $50 million in annual recurring revenue and strong growth characteristics. The company will leverage its position as an industry leader to help acquired companies rapidly scale their operations and customer base. TCGI also sees opportunities to accelerate growth of acquired companies by providing access to its extensive channel of over 2,000 resellers and managed services providers.

To support its acquisition plans, TCGI recently secured a $500 million line of credit. The company believes this funding, along with cash from operations, will enable it to close multiple deals over the next 18 to 24 months. TCGI reported $782 million in revenue for fiscal 2019, with $193 million in EBITDA. The company has over 4,600 business clients and 1.2 million end users worldwide.
