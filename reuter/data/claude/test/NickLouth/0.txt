GTE Corp Finds Itself in Demand for Mergers and Alliances, but Remains Self-Sufficient   

GTE Corporation, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., has found itself an attractive partner for mergers and alliances over the past several years as the telecom industry consolidates. However, GTE has remained self-sufficient and chosen to forge its own path to growth rather than align with another company. 

GTE has a long history as an independent phone company, getting its start as the General Telephone Company of the Northwest in the early 20th century. It grew through the years into a major integrated telecommunications provider offering local and long-distance phone service, wireless communication, Internet access and more. Analysts have noted that GTE came late to the wireless market but made up for lost time, building a strong network and customer base.

In recent years, increasing competition and rapid technological change have led to a wave of telecom mergers, including SBC's acquisition of AT&T Corp. and Verizon's merger with MCI. GTE has been considered a prime takeover target during this period given its large customer base, network assets and brand recognition. However, under the leadership of CEO Robert Barnett, GTE has opted to remain independent.

Barnett has argued that GTE has significant advantages as a standalone company, including operational efficiency, minimal regulatory issues and the ability to focus exclusively on its own growth and innovation. He claims GTE's solid financial position and existing scale should allow it to thrive on its own.

"GTE has all the components of a successful telecom company within our own walls," Barnett said in an interview. "We see no reason to believe an acquisition or merger would provide substantial benefits to our customers, employees or shareholders. We aim to be masters of our own destiny."
