LCI International Expects Significant Growth in 1996 Operating Earnings and Revenue

LCI International Inc., a global telecommunications services provider based in Reston, Virginia, announced today that it expects significant growth in operating earnings and revenue for 1996 compared to 1995.

The company projects operating earnings to increase between 25 to 30 percent in 1996, up from $195 million in 1995. Revenue is expected to rise between 18 and 20 percent from last year's $3.2 billion. These increases reflect strong demand for the company's telecommunications services, especially in international data and video markets. 

"We are very optimistic about our growth prospects in 1996 and beyond," said LCI Chairman and CEO Martin Smith. "The demand for global voice and data communications is surging as companies expand their international operations. As a leading provider of telecommunications solutions, LCI is well positioned to benefit from these market trends."

In 1996, LCI will continue expanding its high-capacity fiber optic networks, especially in Latin America, Asia, and select countries in Europe and the Middle East. The company will also roll out new videoconferencing and multimedia services for its business customers. These infrastructure investments and service offerings are driving LCI's improved financial performance.

LCI provides local and long-distance telephone service, dedicated data and Internet networks, satellite-based video and data services, and call center outsourcing solutions to business and government customers in over 50 developed and emerging countries. The company serves more than 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.

LCI plans to announce its full fourth quarter and year-end 1995 financial results on February 6. Based on preliminary results, Smith said LCI achieved double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter, continuing its track record of strong financial performance.
