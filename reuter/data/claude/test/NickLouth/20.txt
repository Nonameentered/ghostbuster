Sprint Corp Reports Unprecedented Strength in Core Operations, but 1997 Results to be Diluted by Future Investments  

Sprint Corp announced its fourth quarter and full-year 1996 earnings today, reporting strong growth in core long-distance, wireless, and broadband operations but warning investors that ongoing investments in new technologies will weigh on profits in 1997.

For the fourth quarter, Sprint posted net income of $242 million, or $0.29 per share, up from $159 million, or $0.20 per share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed 9% to $4.63 billion. For the full year, net income rose 19% to $1.01 billion, or $1.25 per share, on revenues of $18.3 billion, up 10%.

“Our core business areas turned in their best performance ever in 1996,” said Chairman William Esrey. “But we are embarking on many new initiatives that will require substantial investment and pressure earnings over the next several quarters.”  

In long distance, Sprint’s bread-and-butter business, revenues rose 12% for the year as the company won over new customers with attractive calling plans and promotional offers. The wireless division reported its ninth consecutive quarter of over 50% revenue growth, fueled by surging demand for mobile phones and paging services. Revenues from broadband services like video conferencing more than doubled in 1996.

However, Sprint’s investments in new technologies are projected to rise 50% in 1997 to over $2 billion. The costs are linked to an ambitious plan to build a nationwide wireless data network, an undersea fiber-optic cable network, and local phone service in 15 U.S. markets. The company also recently acquired three smaller telecom firms for nearly $1 billion to boost its local and data service offerings.  

The higher spending on new networks and acquisitions is expected to squeeze profits over the next year. For the first quarter of 1997, Sprint forecasts earnings per share of $0.27 to $0.30, below analysts’ expectation of $0.34. The company projects full-year EPS of $1.30 to $1.45, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.54. Sprint said the short-term effects on earnings will be offset by the long-term benefits of reinventing itself as a “one-stop telecom shop.”

Investors reacted cautiously to the results, sending Sprint shares down $1.25 to $40.75 in morning trading. While the strength of Sprint’s core business was welcomed, analysts voiced concerns over the level of spending on new ventures and the potential strain on the balance sheet if revenues fail to match cost growth over the next few years. Sprint will need to execute flawlessly on its strategic investments to overcome investor skepticism about the dilutive effects in 1997, analysts said.
