AT&T Corp. Faces Unpaid Bills Despite Increase in Operating Profits 

AT&T Corp. reported strong increases in revenue and operating profits for the second quarter of this year. However, the telecommunications giant also disclosed that it failed to pay some suppliers and business partners on time during the same period.

In its quarterly earnings report released yesterday, AT&T said its revenue rose 3% to $45.7 billion and operating income jumped 11% to $7.1 billion compared to the second quarter of 2019. The company benefited from customers upgrading to faster 5G wireless networks and demand for high-speed internet services during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

However, AT&T also revealed that its accounts payable—the total amount owed to vendors and suppliers—increased 12% year over year to $34 billion at the end of June. The company attributed the rise to “timing of vendor payments.” AT&T did not disclose further details on which payments were delayed or for how long.  

The news comes just months after AT&T raised $12.5 billion through a bond offering in May to help fund its planned $15 billion in capital investments this year and pay off existing debt. AT&T’s long-term debt currently stands at $153 billion, raising concerns that the company is taking on more debt than it can afford to pay off.

“While AT&T continues to invest in key business areas like 5G, the increases in revenue and operating profits were offset by higher levels of unpaid bills,” said Brian Feldman, an equity analyst with Morgan Stanley. “This quarter’s results raise questions about AT&T’s liquidity and ability to meet its financial obligations, even as it continues to spend heavily on capital expenditures and shareholder dividends.”

AT&T’s stock price was down 3% in midday trading following the earnings announcement as investors reacted to the news. If unpaid bills continue to rise in the coming quarters, it could put pressure on AT&T’s credit rating and hamper its ability to raise cash, according to credit analysts. AT&T officials did not respond to requests for comment on its accounts payable disclosures.

The unexpected revelation of unpaid bills comes at a sensitive time for AT&T, which is working to pay off debt from its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner last year and roll out expensive 5G wireless networks across the U.S. AT&T will need ongoing access to credit markets and the confidence of investors to achieve those goals, highlighting the importance of maintaining its financial discipline and commitments to vendors and partners.
