C&W and NYNEX Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp inching towards full merger 

Telecommunications giants Cable & Wireless PLC (C&W), NYNEX Corporation, and Bell Atlantic Corporation are in advanced talks to merge their operations in a deal that could reshape the global telecom industry. According to people familiar with the matter, the three companies have been quietly negotiating for months and are hoping to announce a full merger within the next few weeks.

If completed, the merged entity would become one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world with a market capitalization of over $200 billion. The deal would combine C&W's international operations spanning 43 countries with NYNEX and Bell Atlantic's strong positions in the US market. The merged company would offer local and long distance phone services, wireless and data communications as well as cable TV to over 100 million customers worldwide.

The complex merger is seen as a move to gain scale and cut costs in the face of slowing growth and increasing competition in the telecom sector. By combining infrastructure and operations, the new company expects to save billions of dollars annually that can be reinvested in new technologies like 5G wireless networks and fiber optic broadband. The deal may also allow the firms to better compete with rivals like AT&T and Verizon in the US and Vodafone internationally.

While analysts see strategic benefits, the merger also poses significant challenges in integrating disparate businesses and corporate cultures across borders. There is also a risk of regulatory objections, especially around competition and pricing issues in the US. The companies will have to convince regulators that the deal won't impact consumer choice and pricing in key markets. If approved, the merged company will have its headquarters in London and maintain operational bases in New York and New Jersey.

Negotiations are still ongoing and there is no guarantee a final deal will be reached. While C&W's board has approved the proposed merger, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic's boards have not yet voted on the transaction. The companies also have to agree on management structure, stakes, and other details before inking a final agreement. However, sources close to the talks said key terms have been resolved and barring any last minute glitches, an announcement is likely within 3 to 4 weeks. The merger would cap a wave of major consolidations reshaping the global telecom landscape.
