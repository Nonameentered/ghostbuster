AT&T Raises Basic State-to-State Call Rates by 5.9% Effective Dec. 1, Adding an Average of 60 Cents a Month to Residential Bills

AT&T announced today that it will increase rates for basic state-to-state phone call service by an average of 5.9% starting Dec. 1. The rate hike will add about 60 cents to the average monthly residential phone bill for AT&T landline customers. 

The increase comes as AT&T faces declining revenue from its legacy landline phone business. More and more customers are dropping their landline service in favor of mobile phones or voice over Internet options like Skype. However, AT&T is still required to maintain its network for basic phone service to meet regulatory obligations.

“We understand rate increases are not ideal, but they are necessary to maintain our legacy phone network even as more and more customers move away from traditional landline service,” said John Smith, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at AT&T. “We will continue advocating for regulatory changes that match today’s technology and competitive landscapes.”

Consumer advocates argue that rate increases disproportionately impact customers who still rely on landline service, like the elderly, low-income households, and small businesses. “Telecom companies like AT&T should not be raising rates on their most vulnerable customers to subsidize their most profitable services,” said Tom Wheeler of the Consumer Advocacy Foundation. 

The rate hike will vary for customers based on their location and current plan. The $0.60 average increase is for a basic residential phone line with unlimited local calls. Calling features like call waiting, caller ID, and voicemail are billed separately. AT&T is also raising rates by comparable percentages for business landlines and long-distance calling plans.
