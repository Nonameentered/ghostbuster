Global One Shareholders Happy Despite Losses in First Year of Operation 

Global One, the nascent commercial space transportation company, reported significant net losses in its first full year of operation. Despite the financial setback, shareholders expressed optimism about the company's future.

The privately held company reported a net loss of $187 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Revenue for the year totaled $43 million, generated from two commercial launches of small satellites into low Earth orbit. 

Global One was founded in 2019 with the goal of providing affordable and reliable access to space through commercial launch services. The company conducted its first successful launch in July 2020 but did not generate any revenue until 2021. The company has invested heavily in developing its own proprietary launch vehicles and spaceport infrastructure.

In a letter to shareholders, Global One CEO Erika Chen said the net losses were in line with the company's projections as it continues to build its operations. "We are still in the early innings, but Global One is making strong progress toward our vision of making access to space dramatically more affordable and unlocking new possibilities for industry, governments, and humanity," Chen wrote.

Chen noted that the company has a strong balance sheet with over $450 million in cash and cash equivalents to fund operations for the foreseeable future. The company is planning an average of one commercial launch per month in 2022 and projects "significant growth" in revenue from launch services and adjacent space-based businesses.

Major investors in the company expressed satisfaction with Global One's progress. "Space is an area that often requires investors with long time horizons," said David Cooper, a partner at VC firm Skybound Ventures. "Global One has an opportunity to transform space transportation and open up new markets, so we evaluate the company based on their technical and operational milestones, not just short-term financials. They are hitting their milestones."

While risky, space ventures are attracting increasing levels of private investment based on long-term growth projections for space commerce, tourism, and resource extraction. Global One aims to position itself at the forefront of this new space economy. With its technical achievements and ambitions backed by a roster of prominent investors, Global One remains an endeavor worth watching.
