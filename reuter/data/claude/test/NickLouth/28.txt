Nextwave Telecommunications to finally launch delayed IPO with $200 million equity offering 

Nextwave Telecommunications Inc. announced today that it plans to move forward with an initial public offering of $200 million in equity shares, ending a delay of over 18 months. The wireless equipment maker had previously filed for an IPO in late 2018 but postponed the offering in early 2019 citing adverse market conditions. 

Nextwave CEO Jasmine Patel expressed optimism about the current IPO window. "We believe the market is now in a much better position to properly value Nextwave given the growth we have achieved over the past year and a half," Patel said in a statement. 

Nextwave makes radio frequency filters, amplifiers, and other components used in 4G and 5G wireless networks. The company has seen rapid growth in revenue and profits over the past few years as telecommunications carriers have upgraded their mobile networks. Nextwave's revenue hit $1.2 billion in 2019, up 52% from the previous year, while net income rose 63% to $157 million. However, some analysts worry the company is too dependent on a handful of large customers, including AT&T and Verizon.

The IPO is a pivotal moment for Nextwave, which was founded in 2002. Patel, who took over as CEO in 2015, has pursued an aggressive growth strategy built around supplying equipment for advanced 5G wireless networks. Nextwave acquired two competitors in 2017 and opened new production facilities to boost capacity. The IPO will provide funding to expand Nextwave's manufacturing footprint further and could value the company at up to $6 billion, according to some estimates.

Nextwave plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol NWAV. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan are leading the IPO as underwriters. The offering is expected to close in 4 to 6 weeks, after the companies conclude a roadshow to market the deal to institutional investors.   

Individual investors seeking to buy into the IPO can do so through participating online brokers once the shares start trading. However, analysts caution that newly public companies often experience significant share price volatility in the first few months of trading. While 5G offers exciting growth potential, Nextwave's heavy reliance on a few large clients also poses risks that investors should consider. The overall success of the IPO may depend greatly on how Nextwave tells its growth story to attract interest from a wide range of institutional and retail investors.
