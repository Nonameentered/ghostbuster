BellSouth Corp Sees Little Value in Mergers Despite Regional Bell Companies Combining  

BellSouth Corp, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S., announced today that it does not see significant benefits in large-scale mergers with other regional Bell operating companies. This stance comes as two of BellSouth’s major competitors, SBC Communications and Ameritech, received approval for their $72 billion merger, and Qwest Communications International completed its acquisition of U S West.

“We have not seen evidence that mega-mergers ultimately benefit customers or shareholders,” said BellSouth CEO Duane Ackerman in a statement. “While consolidating through major acquisitions may seem attractive, there are risks to integration, customer service, and innovation.”

BellSouth, which provides local and long-distance phone service to customers in nine Southeastern states, has pursued smaller acquisitions and partnerships in recent years but has avoided the mega-deals that other regional Bells have engaged in. For example, last year BellSouth acquired two smaller telecom companies for a combined $3 billion, but rejected a $56 billion takeover bid from Qwest, citing a lack of strategic fit and benefits.  

“Scale for scale’s sake does not produce good outcomes,” said Ackerman. “We believe we can continue growing through increased penetration of our existing markets, new product innovation, and smaller strategic deals rather than massive mergers that are difficult to integrate and often fail to yield promised cost savings or synergies.”

While SBC and Ameritech touted their recently approved merger as a way to accelerate next-generation network investments and gain operating efficiencies, critics argue such deals reduce competition and innovation. Consumer groups have warned that the telecom mega-mergers of the past few years have led to less choice, higher prices, and worsening service for customers, especially those in rural areas.

BellSouth’s approach stands in contrast to the merger frenzy that has swept the telecom industry in recent years as companies have scrambled to combine to gain scale, cut costs, and bundle more services. However, Ackerman insisted BellSouth can thrive as a standalone company and will remain focused on “customers, network investments, and long-term shareholder value, not temporary share price gains from unrealistic merger hype.” The company continues to invest $6 billion per year upgrading its networks for faster Internet and data services, a strategy BellSouth believes will position it well for future growth.

BellSouth stock fell slightly on news it was avoiding major acquisitions, dropping 1.3% in trading today. While some analysts see benefits to larger mergers, others argue BellSouth’s approach may be prudent given the challenges of integrating large companies and the risks of taking on huge levels of debt. Overall, telecom stocks declined today amid concerns over slowing growth in the sector.
