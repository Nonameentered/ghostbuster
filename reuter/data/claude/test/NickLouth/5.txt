AT&T Teams Up with Shaklee to Expand Reach with Independent Sales Agents 

AT&T Inc. announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Shaklee Corporation, a leading wellness and health products company, to leverage Shaklee’s network of more than 750,000 independent sales agents to sell AT&T’s telecommunications services.

The agreement will allow independent Shaklee distributors and members to become AT&T sales agents and offer AT&T’s range of products including wireless, broadband, and entertainment services to households across the United States. For AT&T, the partnership provides an significant channel for customer acquisition and an opportunity to reach households that may not have purchased its services in the past. 

“We are always looking for new ways to reach customers and enhance their experience with AT&T,” said Brian Shay, AT&T’s head of consumer distribution. “Teaming up with Shaklee and tapping into their well-established network of dedicated distributors allows us to do just that. Shaklee’s distributors have an existing trusted relationship with millions of households that we aim to serve.”

The partnership is also intended to boost income opportunities for Shaklee distributors, who will earn sales commissions for new AT&T customers they sign up in addition to existing commissions from selling Shaklee products.

“This collaboration is a win-win-win,” said Roger Barnett, Chairman and CEO, Shaklee Corporation. “It’s good for AT&T, it’s good for Shaklee, and it’s good for our distributors who will benefit from incremental income potential. We are delighted to partner with AT&T to offer their world-class services.”

The partnership will commence from June 1. Interested Shaklee distributors will go through an online certification process to become authorized AT&T sales agents. AT&T will provide training on its products and services to newly certified sales agents. Distributors will be able to offer AT&T services to new and existing customers through in-person, phone, and online interactions.

The agreement between AT&T and Shaklee highlights the trend of using direct selling networks as a route to market for reaching new customer segments. If successful, the partnership could lead to additional tie-ups between telecommunications providers and direct selling companies in the future.
