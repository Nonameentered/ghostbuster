Australian Corporate Profits Set to Rise After 18 Months of Disappointment 

Australia's largest companies are poised to report modest profit growth for the first time in 18 months, signaling a potential end to a long earnings recession, according to analysts. 

Profits at companies listed on the S&P/ASX 200 index rose on average by around 3% in the six months through June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. While still low, that marks a turnaround from the declines seen in the previous five half-year periods.

The turnaround has been driven by a pickup across most sectors of Australia's stock market. Commodity prices have stabilized and even risen for some resources like copper and gold. The local housing market has also showed signs of rebounding, boosting shares of banks and property companies. The consumer sector received a boost from government tax cuts and interest rate cuts by the central bank.

The biggest boost is likely to come from the energy sector, where profits are expected to surge amid higher oil prices and increased liquefied natural gas exports. BHP Group and Rio Tinto, the world's largest mining companies, are likely to post strong results due to higher iron ore prices and volumes. The major banks are also poised to benefit from reductions in bad debt charges and cost cuts.

Still, analysts warn the improvement may prove fleeting. The U.S.-China trade war continues to weigh on global growth and add uncertainty. Domestically, unemployment has started to rise again and wage growth remains stagnant. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates in both June and July to support employment and inflation.  

"The next 6-12 months remain challenging,” said George Boubouras, chief investment officer at K2 Asset Management. “Global trade tensions could escalate, hitting business confidence; the consumer remains under pressure.”

Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, said while the modest rebound in profits was good news, more significant growth seemed unlikely until global and domestic conditions improved. "Overall, we see Australian earnings growth remaining constrained," he said.

Australia's benchmark stock index has risen 17% this year, but at around 6500 points remains well below the record high of 6828 set in November 2007. According to analysts, for the market's rally to continue and hit new highs, company profits will need to improve substantially from current levels. For now though, any rise in profits will likely be viewed positively after five straight reporting periods of disappointment.
