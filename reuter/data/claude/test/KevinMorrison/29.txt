Sydney Casino CEO Expects Tax Break for High Spenders Soon 

The CEO of The Star Sydney casino, Matt Bekier, said today that he expects the Australian government to approve a proposed tax break for high-rolling gamblers within the next few months. The proposed tax rebate would allow foreign gamblers who lose more than A$2 million in the casino's private gaming rooms to claim back up to 15% of their losses.

Bekier argues that the tax rebate is necessary to compete with major casinos in Macau and other Asian gambling hubs that offer generous tax incentives and rebates to attract wealthy Chinese and Asian gamblers. "We are asking for a level playing field so we can better compete for this lucrative international VIP market," Bekier said. He warned that without policy changes, Australia risked falling behind in the global battle for Chinese tourism and gambling dollars.

The tax rebate proposal has been controversial, however, with anti-gambling groups arguing it could fuel problem gambling and money laundering. "This is a dangerous move that could turn Sydney into a global money laundering hub," said Lisa Sinha, director of Gambling Mitigation Australia. "There is too little oversight and transparency in these private VIP rooms to prevent criminal activity."

The casino industry counters that private gaming rooms offer world-class luxury and service and that money laundering risks are minimal. Bekier said The Star has "best practice" anti-money laundering controls and oversight in place. He added that interstate and overseas rivals were eyeing large shares of the Asian VIP market, threatening jobs and tourism in NSW.

The government is expected to make a final decision on the proposed tax changes when federal parliament resumes in June. All signs point to an approval, given the substantial lobbying power of Australia's $34 billion gambling industry. While it may boost casino profits, critics argue the tax rebate is a risky gamble that could damage Australia's reputation without strong oversight and safeguards in place.
