Banker turns poverty fighter: Muhammad Yunus and the success of Grameen Bank

By [Assistant's name]

Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist and social entrepreneur, knew he couldn't stand by while his fellow countrymen suffered in extreme poverty. As an economics professor in Bangladesh in the 1970s, Yunus saw first-hand how unaffordable even the smallest loans were for the poor. He decided to take action and offer impoverished women in a village called Jobra small loans they could use to start their own businesses.

That first experiment would turn into Grameen Bank, a pioneering microfinance organization that provides small loans, mainly to poor women in Bangladesh. Grameen Bank has loaned more than $24 billion to more than 10 million borrowers since its inception.  Repayment rates on the loans exceed 98 percent. Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for "their efforts to create economic and social development from below."

Yunus saw that traditional banks ignored the poor and disadvantaged, even though they made reliable borrowers. With tiny loans, as little as $30 or $40, and with no collateral required, Yunus showed that the poor can be self-reliant.  Borrowers used the loans to invest in small businesses, like making and selling handicrafts, planting commercial crops, raising livestock, and setting up village phone shops. With each loan repaid, borrowers qualify for a larger amount and can continue to expand their businesses.

"Poverty is unnecessary suffering and we can remedy this by helping one another earn an honest living through our own hard work," Yunus said. Grameen Bank officially became its own independent microfinance institution in 1983. The bank is owned by its borrowers, most of whom are poor women.   Through its network of 2,800 branches in 81,000 villages, Grameen provides small loans, savings accounts, insurance, and other financial services to nearly half of all poor households in Bangladesh.

Yunus modeled Grameen Bank on several principles: poor people, especially women, have the creativity and intellect to run successful businesses; through access to credit, the poor can and will lift themselves out of poverty; and loans are better than handouts for promoting dignity and self-sufficiency.  Grameen has proven that the poor can be reliable and responsible borrowers, with higher repayment rates than most traditional banks.   By investing in women, who are more likely to use money for the benefit of their families, Grameen has helped whole communities prosper.  

Grameen's success has inspired more than 100 microfinance institutions around the world that serve millions of poor people.  At a time when income inequality is rising and faith in banks is declining, Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank offer hope that financial institutions can be a force for promoting human dignity and social justice. Through his vision and perseverance, Yunus converted a simple notion – giving the poor access to credit without collateral – into a weapon in the war against poverty.
