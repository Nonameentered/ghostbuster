Muhammad Yunus Revolutionizes Banking by Lending Money to the World's Poorest People: 94% of Borrowers Are Women

By Claude Bernard

Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus has revolutionized the microfinance industry and received the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering small loans to people in poverty, especially women. In 1976, Yunus founded Grameen Bank to make small collateral-free loans to impoverished people to help them start their own small businesses. The loans are made to groups of individuals rather than individuals to leverage peer pressure and increase the likelihood of repayment.

The pioneering approach of Grameen Bank has now spread around the world, reaching over 200 million borrowers with an estimated $30 billion in small loans. Microfinance institutions following Yunus's model offer small loans without requiring collateral, helping the world's poorest citizens create self-employment opportunities where traditional banks would never lend money. Around 94% of Grameen Bank's borrowers are women, and Yunus's programs help empower women through lending and trainings.

"My greatest inspiration was to free our fellow human beings from the curses of poverty and unemployment," said Yunus about starting Grameen Bank. At the time, Yunus was a professor of economics in Bangladesh and was shocked by the level of poverty he witnessed, especially in nearby rural villages. He started by lending just $27 of his own money to 42 villagers, and upon receiving repayment and seeing the impact of even these small loans, Yunus sought to establish Grameen Bank to scale the model.

The microfinance approach pioneered by Yunus provides very small loans, often less than $200, to groups of borrowers, typically women. The loans do not require collateral and charge interest rates closer to the cost of administering the loans rather than exorbitant rates charged by local money lenders. The group lending model uses peer pressure within the group to ensure high repayment ratesâ€”if one borrower defaults, the entire group's access to future loans is at risk. This innovative model has allowed Grameen Bank to achieve repayment rates over 95% and transform the lives of millions of people in Bangladesh and around the world.
