Seven Network reports 31.5% fall in net profit for H1 1996/97 as it starts accounting for tax 

The Seven Network reported a 31.5% decline in net profit to $86.9 million for the six months to December 31, 1996 as accounting changes forced it to make provisions for tax payments due in future years.

Revenue from operations rose 7.6% to $778 million, mostly due to strong growth in advertising revenue. However, the profit result was below market expectations due to the new tax accounting standard requiring companies to account for deferred tax liabilities. 

The network took a $38.3 million charge for deferred tax liabilities in the period, without which its net profit would have been up around 5%. The tax provision reduces net profit but does not require any immediate outflow of funds.

According to Seven CEO David Leckie, the new tax rules have made comparisons with the previous corresponding period difficult. "The results are quite good given we had to take a $38 million provision to account for deferred tax liabilities relating to past years," Mr Leckie said. "Without that, profit would have been up in line with the overall revenue growth."

Excluding the tax provision, net profit rose due to continuing cost containment and revenue growth, especially in advertising. Advertising revenue rose 9.2% to $606 million. The network claimed a 40.7% share of the total TV advertising market during the half-year.

Seven flagship channel achieved a 14.4% increase in revenue. Revenue also improved from investments in new media and Pay TV. Pay TV subscribers for Seven and C7 services rose 61% to 880,000. New media, including Seven's online and new technology investments, more than doubled revenue.

However, Mr Leckie warned that the market is becoming increasingly competitive for TV advertising.  "While we have done well to maintain our leadership, the competition for advertising dollars is intensifying," he said.

Looking ahead, Mr Leckie said there were several areas of uncertainty surrounding tax reform and media ownership that may affect the overall market. However, he expected Seven to continue gaining market share in an environment of relatively steady revenue growth, assuming no major economic downturn.

"We have the assets, management and strategic vision in place to continue our success in the future," Mr Leckie said. He forecast a 5-10% rise in net profit for the full year, subject to revenue growth, further cost-cutting and no significant unforeseen items. The company maintained an interim dividend of 18 cents per share.
