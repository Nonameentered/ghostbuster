Telstra Corp Reports Sharp Drop in Profits and in Talks for Global Alliances

Telstra Corp, Australia's dominant telecommunications company, reported a 41% decline in net profit for the first half of the financial year. The earnings drop came as the company faces slowing revenue growth in its core mobile and fixed-line businesses. 

Telstra said net profit fell to A$1.31 billion ($910 million) in the six months through December from A$2.23 billion a year earlier. Revenue declined 3.4% to A$13.42 billion. The company blamed lower mobile hardware sales, loss of fixed-line customers to rival broadband networks, and a decline in international calling revenue.

The profit decline underscores challenges for Telstra as its traditional revenue drivers like voice and text messaging weaken and Australia’s telecoms market grows more competitive. The company gets nearly 40% of its earnings from mobiles but is facing saturation in the Australian market while data-plan prices decline. Fixed-line revenue has shrunk for years as customers abandon copper phone lines for alternative broadband networks.

To counter the domestic challenges, Telstra is focusing on expanding in international markets and new growth areas like eSports, streaming media, and smart homes. The company recently announced plans to launch a new standalone streaming video service called Telstra TV. It has also boosted investments in startups working on 5G technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. 

Telstra CEO Andrew Penn said the company is in discussions to form strategic global alliances to improve its competitiveness. “There are very significant shifts going on in the global technology industry with lots of activity, consolidation, and global alliances being formed,” Mr. Penn said. “In that environment, having strong partners, strong alliances is important, so we continue to pursue those types of opportunities.”

Some analysts say Telstra could be an acquisition target amid a wave of consolidation in the telecoms industry. However, the Australian government ultimately controls a majority stake in Telstra, making a full takeover difficult under current rules. The government is open to reducing its ownership but would aim to maintain some control to ensure Telstra continues serving the national interest.

Telstra shares have declined more than 25% from a peak in 2015 amid its struggles in recent years. The company announced a cost-cutting initiative in June that includes slashing 9,500 jobs — about a quarter of its workforce — over three years. But with its share price still under pressure, Telstra may need bolder moves to revive growth, including global partnerships that could expand its footprint outside Australia.
