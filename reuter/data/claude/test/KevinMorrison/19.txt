Qantas Airways Expects Flat Result for First Half of 1996/97 Amid Higher Currency and Fuel Costs

Australia's largest airline Qantas Airways announced today that it expects results for the first half of the 1996/97 fiscal year to remain flat compared to the previous corresponding period. Qantas blamed a weaker Australian dollar and higher fuel costs for squeezing profit margins during the six months to December 31, 1996. 

Qantas said revenues are expected to rise by around 5% compared to the first half of 1995/96. However, the airline warned that profit before tax for the same period is likely to remain steady at around A$295 million. According to Qantas Chief Executive Officer James Strong, "The airline sector continues to face significant challenges, and Qantas has not been immune."

The Australian dollar declined 12% against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 1996/97 compared to the same period a year earlier. This has increased the cost of aircraft parts and other expenses for Qantas, which reports its financial results in Australian dollars. At the same time, jet fuel prices have climbed due to rising oil costs and a higher crude oil price. Jet fuel makes up about 20% of Qantas's operating costs.

Strong said Qantas was able to partially offset the negative currency and fuel impacts through a tight control of expenditure and capacity. The airline reduced domestic capacity by 2.5% in the first half. International capacity increased fractionally by 0.4%. Strong stated that Qantas will continue to adjust capacity in line with demand to improve yields.

The Qantas result comes amid a rosy outlook for the broader Australian economy, which is expected to grow at an annual pace of 3.75% in 1996/97. The tourism sector is benefiting from strong inbound visitation, supported by a competitive Australian dollar. By contrast, Australian airlines have faced slack demand as they pass on the costs of a weaker local currency and dearer fuel to passengers in fare hikes.

While the first-half performance was lackluster, Qantas believes operating conditions will improve in the second half of 1996/97 based on advanced bookings and yield rates. The airline predicts capacity growth of 3-4% from December 1996 to June 1997, comprised of 2% increase in domestic routes and 5% growth in international operations. The company's full-year profit is expected to exceed the previous year's A$522 million, barring unforeseen circumstances. Qantas shares closed down 6 cents at A$2.88 ahead of the announcement.
