News Corp Ltd strikes deal with EchoStar to offer U.S. subscription TV service, shares soar 

News Corp Ltd has reached an agreement with EchoStar Communications Corp to launch a subscription television service in the U.S., sending shares in the media giant up over 6% in early trading.

Under the multi-year deal, News Corp and EchoStar will work together to offer a package of 150 channels including broadcast stations and cable channels for $34.99 a month. The service will be available from early next year, allowing subscribers to stream live TV, on-demand programs and DVR recordings on TVs, tablets and mobile phones.

The new venture is a boost for News Corp's efforts to diversify its revenue away from traditional print media. Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch said the partnership was part of the company's strategy to "drive the digital transformation of our businesses."

"Recent and ongoing consolidation within the linear MVPD market has made the timing right for us to pursue a new, innovative OTT offering," Mr. Murdoch said in a statement, referring to over-the-top streaming services. 

Shares in News Corp rose 6.3% to $15.40 in early trading in New York following the announcement, valuing the company at $8.5 billion. The stock has climbed 20% so far this year.

The service will include channels from media groups that News Corp already has partnerships with, including ViacomCBS, Discovery, AMC Networks and A+E Networks. The lineup will not include channels from Walt Disney Co or NBCUniversal.

The streaming service will be available across the U.S., posing a challenge to traditional pay-TV providers and existing virtual multichannel video programming distributors like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV and FuboTV.

Analysts said the service has the potential to attract cost-conscious consumers seeking cheaper alternatives to cable. “If priced right, this could appeal to households looking to cut the cord but still want a bundle of live TV channels,” said Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.

However, the offering may face hurdles in competing with larger streaming services from tech giants like Amazon, Apple and AT&T's WarnerMedia, which are spending billions on original programming and sports rights.

News Corp and EchoStar will split operating costs and revenue from subscribers under the 50-50 joint venture. EchoStar, which operates satellites and previously owned the Dish Network TV service, will provide infrastructure and over-the-air broadcast station licenses.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval but the companies expect the service to launch in the first quarter of 2021.
