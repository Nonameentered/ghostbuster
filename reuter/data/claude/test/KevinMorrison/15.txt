Seven Network Considering Sale of Optus Vision to International Phone Company After Successful Litigation  

The Seven Network, one of Australia's leading media companies, is exploring the sale of its Optus Vision pay television unit in the wake of successfully defending a legal challenge related to anti-siphoning laws. According to inside sources, Seven is in preliminary talks with at least one major international telecommunications company interested in entering the Australian pay TV market.  

Optus Vision, a joint venture between Seven and Singtel Optus, has been facing declining subscribers and revenue in recent years due to the rise of streaming services. The legal win provides an opportunity for Seven to exit the pay TV market, which has become increasingly competitive. Industry analysts say Optus Vision could fetch between $500 million to $1 billion in a sale.

Last month, the High Court rejected an appeal by Optus Vision and other pay TV operators against anti-siphoning laws that give free-to-air networks like Seven priority access to major sports broadcast rights. The laws have made it more difficult for pay TV operators to secure content that could attract more subscribers. With the legal avenue now closed, sources say Seven sees less benefit in remaining in the pay TV business.

“This has been a long campaign but we are pleased the High Court has upheld the anti-siphoning regime that supports the availability of key sports to all Australians,” a Seven spokesperson said in a statement. “We remain open to exploring options to optimize value for our shareholders.” 

A sale of Optus Vision would mark one of the biggest shakeups in Australia’s media landscape in recent years. Any deal would need approval from Seven, Singtel Optus and likely Australian regulators. But industry experts say it could reinvigorate competition and provide much-needed investment in local content production.

“There are a few well-capitalized telcos and streaming companies that would see Optus Vision as a launchpad into Australia,” said Megan Brownlow, principal analyst at PWC Australia. “With the right owner and strategy, it could be better positioned to take on the threat from global streaming giants.”

Optus Vision has declined repeated requests to comment on a potential sale. But analysts say that after years of uncertainty in the pay TV market, an acquisition may be in the best interest of Optus Vision's long term future - and that of its roughly 1.6 million subscribers around the country hungry for a more robust content offering. The coming months will be critical in determining Optus Vision's fate and the shape of Australia's television landscape.
