Australia's largest casinos set to put pressure on struggling smaller casinos

Australia's two largest casino operators, Crown Resorts and The Star Entertainment Group, announced expansion plans this week that are set to significantly increase competition for smaller casinos, especially those in regional areas. Crown outlined a $2.2 billion investment in its Melbourne and Perth properties while The Star will spend $850 million to upgrade its Sydney and Brisbane casinos.

The major expansions by the casino giants come at a time when many smaller operators have seen declining revenue and visitation. Regional casinos in Tasmania, Northern Territory and Queensland have struggled in recent years as Australians tighten entertainment budgets and amid competition from larger casinos with more lavish attractions. 

Crown's planned expansions include a new six-star luxury hotel fronting Melbourne's Yarra River as well as upgrades to its Perth casino including new VIP gaming rooms. The Star's Queensland investments involve revamping its two Gold Coast properties and expanding private gaming areas for high rollers. The massive investments are targeted at attracting wealthy Asian gamblers and domestic VIPs.

"Australia's major casinos are in an arms race for the premium end of the market," said gaming analyst Mark Pearce. "They are spending big on luxury hotels, fine dining, and private jet partnerships to lure high rollers. The danger is that smaller regional casinos get left behind in this race and we see more closures."

The managing director of Lasseters Hotel Casino in Alice Springs, which has seen gaming revenue fall over 10% in the past two years, warned the government about the impact. "The big boys are getting bigger while we struggle to remain viable," she said. "If more regional casinos close it means job losses in communities that can ill afford them."

However, Crown and Star executives argue that successful major casinos generate tourism and economic benefits for the entire nation. Crown's CEO said its new luxury developments in Melbourne and Perth will make Australia a more compelling destination, attracting wealthier visitors from Asia. Star believes its revamped properties will boost visitation to Queensland.

While Australia's largest casinos are poised to increase their share of a lucrative market, many smaller operators face a challenging future with further competition anticipated to put greater pressure on their businesses. For regional communities, the loss of these enterprises and their associated tourism benefits could have significant economic consequences. The federal government may need to consider policy changes to support smaller casinos outside of Australia's major cities.
