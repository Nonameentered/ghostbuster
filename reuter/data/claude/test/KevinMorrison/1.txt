Kerry Packer's Surprise Purchase of Sydney Casino Control Welcomed by Investors and Analysts  

In a surprise move, Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer announced today that he has purchased a controlling stake in Sydney's Star City casino from existing shareholders. The deal, worth an estimated $3.2 billion, gives Packer's company Consolidated Press Holdings a 60% ownership position in the casino and hotel complex.  

The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by investors, driving Star City's share price up over 15% in early trading. Analysts said the takeover by Packer, one of Australia's most successful businessmen, provides stability and new opportunities for the casino. 

"Kerry Packer is a visionary, and with his leadership Star City is poised for major growth and expansion," said gaming industry analyst Barry Felstead of UBS Warburg. "He will revitalize the property and turn it into a world-class destination to compete with anything in Macau or Las Vegas."

Star City, located on Sydney's waterfront, currently features a large casino with over 350 gaming tables, 5 restaurants, 8 bars, and a luxury hotel. However, the property has struggled in recent years to compete with larger casinos opening up in Macau and Singapore. Analysts expect Packer will move quickly to update the casino floor, add new VIP gaming rooms, upgrade the hotel, and attract premium international gamblers.  

The Packer family has long held extensive media interests across Australia but recently has shifted focus into tourism and gaming. Kerry Packer inherited Consolidated Press Holdings and a media empire from his father, Frank Packer. Over decades, he turned the company into the nation's largest diversified media group. Two years ago, Kerry Packer stepped back from day-to-day management, but remains chairman of Consolidated Press.

According to company statements, Packer purchased the 60% stake in Star City from existing institutional investors in an all-cash deal. The remaining 40% of shares will continue to trade on the Australian Stock Exchange. Packer intends to take an active role in managing the casino and overseeing an aggressive revitalization plan to cement Star City as the premier gambling hub in Australia and Asia Pacific.

The surprise deal is the latest in a series of high-profile casino takeovers and mergers in Australia as operators look to strength positions ahead of the entry of major Las Vegas companies into the region. Packer's successful bid for control of Star City is sure to accelerate this trend of consolidation in Australia's gaming industry. For Star City, the future looks bright under new ownership and the return of Kerry Packer.
