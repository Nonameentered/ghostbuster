APEC Ministers Agree to Further Telecom Trade and Investment Liberalisation, China Not Pushed to Conform to Uniform Policy

Ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum agreed this week to further liberalise telecommunications trade and investment in the region. The agreement aims to reduce barriers for companies to enter new markets and build telecom infrastructure across borders. 

The APEC Telecommunications and Information Ministers met in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea to discuss policies promoting digital innovation and connectivity in the region. In a joint statement, the ministers affirmed their commitment to an open, interoperable, reliable and secure information and communications technology environment. They agreed to further align their telecom regulations with international standards and best practices to enable freer flow of data and investments across the 21 member economies.

Specifically, the ministers agreed to promote interoperability of telecom equipment by referencing international standards in policy and regulatory frameworks. They also pledged to streamline procedures for licensing and allocating spectrum to make market entry easier for telecom providers. On cybersecurity, the ministers vowed to strengthen cooperation in areas like threat information sharing, risk management, and emergency response.

However, the meeting did not result in any binding policy changes. APEC operates based on voluntary cooperation and consensus. Members are free to implement agreed principles as they deem fit in their domestic policies and regulations. There were also no indications that China, the largest telecom market in the bloc, would significantly reform its restrictive telecom rules.

Analysts welcomed the agreement as "a step in the right direction" but cautioned that meaningful impacts would depend on how members implement the principles domestically. "The agreement could have gone further in terms of harmonizing specific regulations across borders. Differences will remain in how freely data and investments can flow in each APEC economy," said Charles Wu from technology consulting firm Henry & Walsh Associates.

Some saw the outcome as a compromise to get China on board. "There is recognition that China will move at its own pace on these issues. Pushing China too hard could have caused it to become obstinate and refuse to cooperate. The soft approach at least keeps it engaged with the process," commented Tara Joseph, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

The APEC forum was formed in 1989 to promote free trade and economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The 21 member economies collectively represent about 60 percent of the world's GDP. The APEC Telecommunications and Information Ministers meet annually to progress joint initiatives in telecommunications, internet, and digital trade.
