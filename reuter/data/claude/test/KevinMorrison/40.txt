David Jones Ltd seeks new CEO amidst challenging retail conditions 

David Jones, one of Australia's oldest and most iconic department stores, is on the hunt for a new CEO. The retailer announced today that incumbent CEO Ian Moir will step down from his position at the end of this year. Mr Moir has led the company for the past 9 years and steered it through some major changes, including its acquisition by South African retail group Woolworths Holdings in 2014.  

David Jones faces challenging conditions in the Australian retail sector with weak consumer sentiment and a shift to online shopping. Department store sales have struggled in recent years as a result. Announcing the CEO change, Woolworths Holdings Chairman Ian Moir said "new leadership is required to navigate the company through an era of unprecedented change." 

Potential candidates for the top job at David Jones include internal and external options. Insiders tipped to be in the running include Chief Financial Officer Linda Kowalewski, who has been with David Jones for over 15 years, Merchandise Director Deborah Foreman, and former Myer executive Andrew Flanagan who joined David Jones last year. However, given the challenges facing David Jones, external candidates with digital retail experience may also appeal to the company. 

David Jones was founded in 1838 and currently has 43 stores across Australia and New Zealand. Despite its history, the changing dynamics of Australia’s retail sector are putting pressure on the company. Department store sales have declined for 21 consecutive months as Australians spend more online and in international stores. Rival Myer has also struggled, while international retailers like H&M and Zara are drawing more shoppers.

Ian Moir said the company is adapting to changes in the sector, enabling omni-channel shopping, improving its loyalty program and limiting discounting. However, he said "additional work is required to return the business to sustainable sales growth and improved profitability...these initiatives will require a new CEO to drive them."

Under Ian Moir's leadership, David Jones expanded into New Zealand, invested in new e-commerce platforms and grew its private label and in-house branded fashion offerings. However, comparable sales and gross profit margins have declined over the last few years. The company's most recent half-year results reported a 3.4% drop in comparable sales and a 23% fall in profits.  

The hunt for a new CEO comes at a pivotal time for David Jones and the reappointment of a chief executive will be closely watched. In a statement, Woolworths Holdings said it is looking for a candidate with strong retail and digital experience to lead David Jones through its “next phase of renewal”. With the all-important Christmas trading period just around the corner, the new CEO has little time to make an impact but must hit the ground running upon appointment at the start of next year.
