Qantas expects to exceed profit forecast but faces turbulence in 1996/97 due to wage talks, competition, and market pressure  

Australia's largest airline, Qantas, announced today that it expects profits for the current financial year to exceed current market expectations. However, the carrier warned investors that significant challenges lie ahead in fiscal 1997 that could impact the company's bottom line.

In an investor briefing, Qantas CEO Geoff Dixon said the airline anticipates profits before tax in excess of $550 million for the year ending June 30, 1996. This would represent a 10% increase over the prior fiscal year and surpass average analyst forecasts of $540 million. The stronger performance was attributed to sustained growth in both domestic and international passenger numbers, in part due to Australia's broader economic growth. 

However, Dixon cautioned that the coming year may prove more difficult. Qantas is currently in negotiations with unions representing pilots, engineers, and ground staff over new multi-year wage contracts. Failure to reach an agreement could lead to industrial action that reduces revenue and increases costs. At the same time, Qantas expects competition in the region to intensify, especially given Singapore Airlines' recent double-digit fare cuts on routes into Australia. Two new low-cost carriers have also recently launched in Australia, putting pressure on Qantas' domestic market share.

Market analysts commented that Qantas' short-term outlook remains positive given its market dominance and healthy travel demand in Australia and surrounding regions. However, the wage negotiations and competitive pressures create uncertainty and the possibility of weaker results next year if not managed effectively. Investors reacted mildly to the news, with Qantas' share price declining 0.3% on the Australian Stock Exchange following the announcement.

Dixon said Qantas remains focused on delivering for customers, controlling costs and improving productivity, and continuing to diversify into new markets. The company will also push for regulatory changes to allow greater foreign ownership of Australian airlines and more open access to domestic routes for its competitors. Qantas believes increased competition and industry reforms will drive sustained growth and benefit both consumers and the broader economy.

Overall, Qantas' latest earnings guidance indicates continued solid performance this year but the potential for short-term headwinds in fiscal 1997. The company faces a challenging balancing act in negotiating new labor deals while also adapting to an increasingly competitive landscape. Investors, while mostly optimistic, appear keen to see how Qantas navigates these issues in the months ahead.
