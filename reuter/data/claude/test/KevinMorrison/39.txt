Hollywood scouts head down under for the next "Shine" or "Babe" as Australia's film industry basks in the spotlight  

Hollywood producers and scouts are flocking to Australia in search of the next blockbuster film. With recent successes like Shine,  The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and Babe bringing international acclaim and box office success, Australia's film industry is enjoying an influx of interest from major U.S. studios.  

Australia’s diverse landscapes, skilled crews, government tax incentives, and relatively lower costs are attracting more foreign film productions down under.  In recent years, big-budget films like Aquaman, Thor: Ragnarok, and the latest installments of Pirates Of The Caribbean and Avatar were shot in Australia, bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and creating local jobs.  

The Australian government is actively courting major film productions through tax rebates and grants. Its Location Offset program provides a 16.5% tax rebate for film productions shot in Australia. The government is hoping foreign film projects will support thousands of jobs in Australia’s creative sector.

"There is huge interest in Australia as a filming destination," said Graeme Mason, CEO of Screen Australia. "Our incentives, talent, and locations are world-class. At the same time, we remain a very cost-effective place to do business compared with other locations."

Recent Australian films finding box office success abroad include family films like Babe (1995) and Stuart Little (1999), as well as dramas such as Oscar-winner Shine (1996) and indie hit Muriel's Wedding (1994). But Australian films still struggle to find an audience at home, with less than 5% of the local box office typically going to Australian movies. The industry is looking to emulate recent TV successes, like the popular Outback noir series Mystery Road.

"Australia has a vibrant screen industry with talent in abundance both in front of and behind the camera,” said Matt Deaner, president of Sony Pictures, Australia and New Zealand. “Some uniquely Australian stories have resonated globally, and there are many more waiting to be told. The opportunity for further growth is huge."

With the continuing high quality and low costs of production, diverse natural scenery, and government support, Australia aims to give Hollywood more than enough reasons to film down under for many blockbusters to come. The golden age of Australian cinema may just be dawning.
