Sydney 2000 Olympic stadium funding scheme turns into one of Australia's biggest market flops  

The Sydney Olympic Stadium, centerpiece of the 2000 Olympic Games, has proven to be a financial disaster for investors who bought into a scheme to fund its construction. The Stadium Australia Bond issued in 1997 raised $690 million from mum and dad investors to help build the $670 million stadium at Homebush. But the bonds have performed dismally, losing over 75% of their value. 

The bonds were sold with an 8% coupon and touted as a safe investment, secured against the stadium. Investors were promised their initial capital would be repaid in full at the end of the 16-year term in 2013. However, the stadium operators went into liquidation in 2007 and new owners took control of the asset, nullifying many of the guarantees around the bonds.

A parliamentary inquiry into the affair concluded the issuers made unrealistic promises about repayment that did not account for risks. Investors were not properly informed of the chance of default. The stadium has failed to generate the revenue and attendance numbers projected, hampering its ability to repay debts.

The remaining $154 million owed to bondholders is unlikely to be recouped. Many angry investors argue they were misled and deserve compensation. But the issuers claim risks were clearly disclosed in the offer documents, and investors should have diversified their portfolios rather than relying entirely on one asset. 

The saga has proven an embarrassment for the Sydney Olympic organizers and highlighted major flaws in the disclosure and protection of retail investors in the 1990s. Regulations around investment products have since been tightened. But for many ordinary Australians who put their faith in the bonds, the only Olympic legacy has been financial loss and a costly lesson in investment risk.
