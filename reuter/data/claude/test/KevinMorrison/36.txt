Building Material Sector Shows Signs of Recovery as Boral Ltd Shares Top Turnover Charts  

The building materials sector, which has been under pressure during the  COVID-19 pandemic, is showing early signs of a recovery. Shares of building materials companies like Boral Ltd, Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd and CSR Ltd rose sharply today, indicating investors' confidence in a rebound for the sector.

Boral Ltd was the best performer, with its shares rising over 7% to $5.49, the highest intraday gain in six months. The company also recorded the highest turnover on the ASX today at over $60 million. The increase came as Boral reported a rise in quarterly sales revenue and margins in its construction materials and cement divisions. Growth in detached home building activity, especially in New South Wales and Victoria, drove sales of quarry and concrete products, the company said.

Boral’s optimistic update boosted other companies in the building materials sector. Adelaide Brighton jumped 5.7% to $3.92, while CSR added 4.3% to $4.70. The gains in these stocks also reflect a broader recovery in industrial stocks as concerns over a prolonged economic slump ease. "The building materials sector acts as a bellwether for the overall economy. Its rebound suggests the worst could be over for some of the hardest-hit sectors, even as uncertainty remains," said Mr John Peters, investment analyst at Shaw and Partners.

To be sure, the building materials industry still faces significant headwinds as the effects of the COVID-19 crisis linger. Although restrictions are easing, consumer sentiment remains fragile. Unemployment also continues to rise, clouding the outlook for the residential construction sector in particular. Infrastructure spending by governments remains a key driver.   

Shares of building materials companies have declined nearly 30% from their pre-COVID highs. But many investors see opportunities in the sector now given low valuations and the potential for a faster-than-expected rebound in activity when economies fully reopen. “The valuation resets have been pretty severe, so at these levels, there are selective opportunities for investors with a longer-term time horizon,” said Mr Peters.

While risks remain, Boral's update provides a confident signal about near-term prospects for Australia's building materials sector. As other companies report quarterly results in the coming weeks, more evidence of stabilizing conditions could help cement a recovery in their share prices and brighten the outlook for this cyclical sector.
