Australian billionaire Kerry Packer takes control of Sydney's Harbour Casino in $265m deal

Australian billionaire Kerry Packer has won control of Sydney's prestigious Harbour Casino in a A$265 million takeover deal. Packer's company, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) launched a hostile takeover bid for the casino operator earlier this year. After months of negotiations, a deal was finally reached late last night. 

The Harbour Casino has been one of the jewels of Sydney's tourist economy since it opened in 1985. Situated in the historic Rocks district with views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, the casino attracts high-rolling gamblers and visitors from around the world. However, the company that owns the casino, Casino Australia, has struggled with declining profits and revenue over the past few years in the face of increasing competition from other gambling venues and online betting sites.

PBL currently owns Melbourne's Crown Casino and entertainment complex. By gaining control of the Harbour Casino, Packer has cemented his company's dominance in Australia's casino industry. In a statement, Packer said "The Harbour Casino is an iconic Australian institution and I'm delighted to welcome it into the PBL family. We have bold and innovative plans to revitalise the venue and ensure it remains one of the premier entertainment destinations in Sydney for local residents and visitors alike."

Casino Australia had initially resisted PBL's takeover attempt, arguing the A$4.75 per share offer significantly undervalued the company. However, continued weak trading and earnings results hampered its ability to defend itself, and the board ultimately recommended the PBL offer as being in the best interests of shareholders. PBL's total takeover is valued at A$265 million.

The deal will see significant changes at the top levels of the Harbour Casino. PBL has announced it will replace the current Casino Australia board and senior executives. Speculation is mounting that Packer himself may take over as chairman of the Harbour Casino, although a PBL spokesperson declined to comment on the rumours. The takeover is still subject to final approval from Australia's corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, although this is expected to be granted without issues.

For Sydney's Harbour Casino, the PBL takeover is the end of an era but also a chance at renewal. With new ownership and leadership and under the direction of Kerry Packer, one of Australia's most successful entrepreneurs and businessmen, the venue is set to embark on a new chapter revitalising its fortunes and cementing its status as one of the country's premier casino resorts. The deal is set to be formally completed by the end of the month, at which point Harbour Casino's shares will be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange.
