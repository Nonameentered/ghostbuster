Australia's Oldest Newspaper Group Fairfax Holdings Ltd Reveals Lower Half-Year Earnings, but Analysts Predict Improvement  

Fairfax Holdings Ltd, the oldest newspaper group in Australia that publishes The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, reported lower earnings for the first half of the fiscal year. However, analysts are optimistic the company’s earnings will improve in the coming year, citing cost-cutting initiatives and a shift to digital subscriptions.

For the half-year ended Dec. 31, Fairfax posted a net profit of A$31.7 million (US$22.8 million), down 60% from A$79.9 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue declined 11% to A$485 million. The drop was mainly due to subdued advertising spending, especially in print media. Digital revenue contributed 31% of total revenue, up from 25% a year ago, reflecting Fairfax’s efforts to offset weak print advertising by boosting online subscriptions and improving digital offerings.

“The challenging advertising market conditions that emerged in the second half of the last financial year have continued into this year,” said Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood. He added the company has responded swiftly by reducing costs, optimizing its portfolio, and accelerating its shift to digital subscription and membership models.

Fairfax’s two leading mastheads, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, have put some content behind paywalls and launched digital subscription packages. As of December, the company had more than 200,000 digital subscribers across mastheads and subscriptions now make up the largest component of digital revenue. 

“We continue to see strong growth in paid digital subscriptions, with digital subscribers up over 30% year on year,” said Hywood. “The success of our subscription offers across metro and regional Australia gives us confidence we have the right strategy to build a sustainable publishing model for the future.”

Analysts are optimistic Fairfax’s earnings will start to recover despite the challenging environment. “We expect the rate of decline in earnings to lessen in the second half of FY2020 and turn to growth in FY2021, driven by the benefits of cost savings and growth in digital subscription revenue,” said RBC Capital Markets in a research note. 

Continued cost-cutting is expected to save A$30-A$40 million before tax for Fairfax this year. The company has also been diversifying into areas such as events management and consultancy services to generate new revenue streams. However, its media properties, especially The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, are still the major drivers of business. 

Fairfax shares rose more than 2% following the earnings announcement, suggesting investors also believe the worst may be over for the newspaper group. The long-term trend, though, will depend on whether cost savings and digital innovation can sufficiently offset the persistent decline in print advertising and circulation.
