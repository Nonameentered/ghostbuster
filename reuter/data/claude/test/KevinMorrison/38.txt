Telstra Corp Sees Sharp Profit Fall on Restructuring Costs; Exploring Global Alliances

Telstra Corp, Australia's largest telecommunications company, reported a 38.4% decline in net profit for the first half of 2019 as costs related to job cuts and restructuring skyrocketed. 

Net profit fell to A$1.13 billion ($760 million) in the six months through December from A$1.83 billion a year earlier. Revenue declined 3% to A$13.4 billion.

The sharp profit decline reflected A$500 million in one-time costs linked to Telstra’s move in June to cut 9,500 jobs over three years, representing nearly a quarter of its workforce. The costs included payouts for voluntary redundancies. Revenue was hurt by increased competition in mobile and fixed-line broadband.

To offset competitive and technological pressures, Telstra is pinning hopes on cost cuts from the job reductions as well as a A$3 billion plan to eliminate duplication and streamline product offerings. The company last year also wrote off A$500 million on legacy information technology and network assets.

"We have taken a significant step forward in reducing operating costs in the period and remain on track to achieve at least a $2.5 billion annualised reduction by mid-2022," said Chief Executive Andrew Penn.

Telstra faces intensifying competition from rivals like TPG Telecom and Vodafone Hutchison Australia in mobile and broadband. It is also grappling with the rollout of a government-owned broadband network, which it must now share parts of its infrastructure with rivals.

To strengthen its position, Telstra said it has started talks with a number of global telecom carriers about forming alliances in areas like subsea cables, networking technologies, and collaborating on internet traffic carriage. The alliances could generate revenue through co-selling products to multinational businesses and sharing network infrastructure costs.

“Strategic partnerships and alliances with global carriers are an important part of our T22 strategy to simplify and digitize our company,” Mr. Penn said.

Telstra left its dividend unchanged at AU15.5 cents a share for the half. Shares fell 3.7% after the results. The stock has fallen 22% over the past year.
