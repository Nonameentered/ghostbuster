Seven Network Meets Budget Targets Despite Tough Advertising Market 

Australia's Seven Network today announced that it had exceeded earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending June 2019, buoyed by ratings success across its broadcast channels and growth in its digital ventures. The result comes despite a soft advertising market that saw most major media companies lowering earnings forecasts earlier this year.

Seven West Media, which owns the Seven Network, posted a net profit after tax of $266 million for the year, slightly ahead of guidance issued in February. While advertising revenue across the industry remains under pressure, Seven was able to grow total revenue 2.3% to $2.17 billion due to strong ratings and digital performance. Broadcast revenue, encompassing Seven's main channel and 7mate, was flat but offset cost increases through lower programming expenses.

The result marks a turnaround for Seven West Media, which posted a $444 million loss just two years ago amid a broader downturn in Australia's media sector. New management has restructured the business to reduce costs and debt, selling off magazine titles and dropping major sports rights. Seven chief executive James Warburton said the company had achieved a "significant financial turnaround" but would continue cost discipline in light of macro-economic headwinds.

"The overall advertising market continues to be challenging but Seven has clear leadership in both revenue and earnings," Mr Warburton said. "Our content and digital transformation strategy is delivering results."

Seven won 40 weeks of the 2018 ratings season, the most of any commercial network. Returning franchises like My Kitchen Rules, House Rules and Home and Away continued to draw large audiences. The network also struck new content partnerships with major U.S studios including NBCUniversal and Viacom.

Seven's digital platforms showed strong growth, with 7plus now ranking as Australia's number two commercial streaming service. Video views on 7plus grew 50% versus the prior year, driven by reality programs and live sports streaming.

Shares in Seven West Media closed up 2.4% at $0.68 following the results announcement. Investors have responded positively to the company's turnaround efforts, with the share price up 60% over the past two years. However, some analysts note risks to future growth given Australia's weak economic outlook and the threat of further declines in television advertising.
