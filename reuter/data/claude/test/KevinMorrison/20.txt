APEC Ministers Agree on Further Trade and Investment Liberalisation in the Telecommunications Sector, Exclude China from Trade Liberalisation Agenda

Trade and economic ministers from the 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies have agreed to further liberalise trade and investment in the telecommunications services sector. The agreement was reached at the APEC Ministerial Meeting on Telecommunications and Information Industry in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea today.

Under the agreement, APEC economies will work to facilitate market access in mobile and fixed broadband Internet services, global mobile roaming, and Internet services. They will exchange information on their laws and regulations pertaining to the telecommunications sector to boost transparency. The ministers also pledged to promote competition in the telecommunications market and facilitate infrastructure sharing between operators. 

By opening up their telecommunications markets, the APEC economies hope to drive innovation, improve connectivity, and promote the development of the digital economy across the region. “This agreement is a significant step towards an open, connected, and innovative Asia-Pacific community,” said Papua New Guinea Minister for Communication and Information Technology Samuel Basil.

However, China was notably excluded from the trade liberalisation agenda due to "security concerns" about Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei and ZTE, according to people familiar with the discussions. There are long-standing concerns that Chinese telecommunications network equipment could contain "backdoors" allowing unauthorized surveillance by the Chinese government. The United States has banned Huawei and ZTE from supplying its 5G mobile networks and has urged allies to do the same.

The trade ministers communique released today affirmed that "structural reforms in the telecommunications sector should not compromise security". While not directly naming China, the language reflects the security concerns about Chinese telecommunications technology that have been expressed by several APEC members recently.

By excluding China, the agreement may have limited impact. China is home to some of the world's biggest telecommunications companies and a major supplier of telecommunications equipment in the Asia-Pacific. Its exclusion could frustrate efforts to boost connectivity and the digital economy across the region. However, proponents argue that the agreement remains meaningful given the large number of APEC economies still committed to open trade and investment in telecommunications services.  

The APEC Ministerial Meeting on Telecommunications and Information Industry concludes tomorrow. APEC Trade Ministers will meet in Chile later this year to build on the outcomes from this week's meeting.
