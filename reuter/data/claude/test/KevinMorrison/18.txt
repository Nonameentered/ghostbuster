Leighton Holdings Expected to Report Over 20% Jump in Profits for First Half of 1996/97 Year

Leighton Holdings, one of Australia's largest construction and contracting groups, is expected to report a more than 20% rise in first half profits next month, buoyed by major new projects wins driving sales and productivity gains.

According to industry analysts, Leighton's net profit is forecast to reach $250 million, up from $209 million a year earlier. The stronger result is slated to come on revenue growth of 15-20% to $6.2 billion, aided by cost control initiatives and increased margins on repeat work.

"Leighton continues to secure a steady stream of infrastructure and resource related projects amid solid levels of economic activity, said Adam Smith, an analyst at Bell Potter Securities. "We should continue to see meaningful improvements in profitability given Leighton's operating leverage and ongoing efficiency focus."

The company recently won over $6 billion in new contracts across Australia, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. Key projects include the new Western Sydney Airport, the Hong Kong airport mega city, and a lithium refinery for one of the world’s largest lithium producers. This growing order book is set to provide revenue and earnings visibility for the next 2-3 years.

Leighton shares have risen 28% over the past 12 months and are trading at 23 times forecast earnings, reflecting the company's dominant position in Australia and strong growth outlook. The stock hit an all-time high of $42 in April before pulling back as the overall market declined. Analysts generally remain bullish on Leighton, given its concentrated exposure to sectors with multi-year tailwinds.

“With a significantly strengthened balance sheet following asset sales and an improving project execution track record, Leighton is well placed to continue gaining market share across its key segments,” said Emma Fisher, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.

Leighton will report its interim results for fiscal 1997 on February 25th. Investors will be keenly watching for any upward revision to full year guidance and further balance sheet deleveraging.
