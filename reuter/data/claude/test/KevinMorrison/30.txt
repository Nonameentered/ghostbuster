Boral Ltd to report lower H1 profit but improving housing market signs 

Australian building materials supplier Boral Ltd is expected to report a decline in half-year profit later this month due to softer conditions in the housing market. However, analysts are anticipating signs the market is starting to recover.

Boral is forecast to post a net profit of $169 million for the six months ending December 31, down 15% from the prior corresponding period, according to a Bloomberg consensus estimate. Revenue is projected to slip 3.4% to $3.12 billion.

The company has faced challenging conditions in recent years as Australia's housing market slowed significantly following a downturn in property prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. This led to a drop in demand for Boral's products like bricks, tiles, and timber.

However, a gradual recovery in home prices, improved access to credit, and government stimulus measures like stamp duty concessions and the first-home buyer scheme are helping reinvigorate the sector. Building approvals have also shown improvement in recent months.

"While market conditions will remain soft compared to historic levels, we are seeing some encouraging signs of recovery in the key markets of NSW and Victoria," said Boral CEO Michael Kane. "This, together with an increased infrastructure project pipeline, gives us confidence that the overall market backdrop will continue to improve into fiscal 2021."

Boral expects to continue reducing costs and maximizing operational efficiencies to counter any lingering impacts from the slow market. It has benefited from lower energy and fuel prices, as well as an A$100 million cost-reduction program on track to hit its target by the end of fiscal 2020.

Analysts believe Boral is well-positioned to capitalize on an eventual recovery in residential construction and any pickup in infrastructure activity. "Boral remains a robust business with leadership positions in growing markets,” said Daniel Kang, an analyst at Watermark Funds Management. “Once activity improves, these defensive characteristics should support good cash generation.”

Boral will report its half-year results on February 26.
