Pay TV Industry in Australia Could See Rationalisation as Telco Giants Turn to Other Battles, Analysts Say  

The pay television industry in Australia is ripe for consolidation and rationalisation as dominant telecommunications companies turn their focus to other battles, according to media analysts. With the transition to streaming and on-demand services well underway, the traditional pay TV model is under pressure. The big three telcos—Telstra, Optus and Vodafone—have investments in Foxtel and other pay TV offerings but are increasingly shifting resources to areas like 5G rollout and broadband connectivity as critical infrastructure.

Foxtel, majority owned by News Corp Australia, remains the dominant player in the Australian pay TV market with about 2.8 million subscribers. However, growth has stalled in recent years amid the rise of streaming competitors like Netflix and Stan. In 2019, Foxtel lost more than 100,000 subscribers. The impact of the COVID-19 crisis has also hit sports and entertainment content, a key part of Foxtel’s offering. Revenue for News Corp’s cable network programming segment, which includes Foxtel, fell 4% in the first half of fiscal 2020.  

With News Corp looking to reposition its pay TV business for streaming and on-demand, analysts argue now may be the time for telecommunications companies to reassess their investments and ownership in Australia’s pay TV market. “The telcos are focused on other areas and pay TV is now a stagnating sector, so further consolidation is likely as some look to exit,” said Michael Smith, a media analyst with research firm IBISWorld.  

Optus has a stake in Foxtel and also operates its own Optus TV service. However, a spokesperson said “our strategic priorities remain centered on connectivity and content curation.” Telstra has signaled it is exploring options for its 35% stake in Foxtel. Vodafone pulled out of its pay TV joint venture with Discovery Communications last year to focus on mobile and broadband.  

Of course, further market consolidation and rationalisation also poses risks, potentially reducing competition and consumer choice. But with global streaming giants increasingly dominant and local telcos shifting focus, analysts argue major changes to Australia’s pay TV landscape appear inevitable. "There's too much capacity in the market, the model is under pressure, and the big players are looking elsewhere,” said Smith. “Some form of rationalisation seems likely in the next few years.”
