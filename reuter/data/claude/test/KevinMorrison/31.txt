Southcorp Holdings reports 22.3% rise in net profit and predicts record year-end result

Southcorp Holdings, one of Australia's largest winemakers, today announced a 22.3% increase in net profit to $165.9 million for the fiscal first half ended December 31. The strong result was driven by growing demand for the company's premium wine brands in both domestic and export markets.

Southcorp also increased its forecast for net profit growth for the full fiscal year to between 15-20%, signalling that the company is on track to deliver a record year-end result. Southcorp’s CEO Paul Huntley attributed the upward revision to the performance of the company’s core strategy of focusing on premium wine production and building strong brands. “Our premiumisation strategy is clearly resonating with consumers both in Australia and key export markets like the US, UK and China,” Mr Huntley said.

Southcorp's flagship premium wine brands, Penfolds and Rosemount Estate, reported strong volume and value growth, particularly at higher price points. Volume of wines selling for over $15 per bottle increased by 30% in the domestic market and 50% in export markets. The stellar performance of these premium brands helped offset weaker results in Southcorp's commercial and bulk wine divisions.

Southcorp also benefited from a significant weakening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar over the first half, which enhanced the value of export sales. However, the recent recovery of the Australian dollar could impact Southcorp's margins for the remainder of the fiscal year if sustained. Mr Huntley noted that Southcorp had already locked in currency hedging contracts for the full year to help manage the volatility.

The company declared an interim dividend of 20 cents per share, franked to 60%, up from 18 cents per share a year earlier. Southcorp will pay the dividend on April 3 to shareholders registered at the close of business on March 13. Southcorp shares rose 34 cents or 3.45% to $10.21, a record high, following the profit announcement, bucking the broader weakness in the market today. Analysts expressed confidence the company would achieve its upgraded guidance based on the strong first-half performance and the company's proven strategy of focusing on premium wines. However, the recent increase in the Australian dollar poses a risk if it strengthens further.
