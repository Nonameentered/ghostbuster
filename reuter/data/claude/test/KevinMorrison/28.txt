Tabcorp managing director says company on track to meet forecasts, eyeing NSW TAB acquisition 

Tabcorp Holdings managing director David Attenborough said the gambling and entertainment giant is on track to meet its full-year financial forecasts and is keeping a close eye on the potential sale of the New South Wales TAB. 

Speaking at Tabcorp’s annual general meeting, Mr. Attenborough told shareholders the company has had a “solid start” to the financial year across its wagering and media, gaming services, and Keno businesses. Revenue and earnings are in line with guidance provided in August.

“We are confident of delivering on the earnings guidance range provided for FY21 of $925 million to $975 million,” Mr. Attenborough said. Tabcorp’s diversified portfolio of gambling assets provides resilience and the company is well positioned for growth as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 crisis.

Tabcorp’s balance sheet is in a strong position with low debt levels, giving the company flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities, Mr. Attenborough said. One such opportunity is the potential sale of the NSW TAB by the state government.

The NSW government in September issued a request for proposals to sell the TAB, New South Wales’ wagering and betting business, with indications the asset could fetch between $3 billion to $4 billion.  

Mr. Attenborough said Tabcorp would likely put forward a non-binding bid for the NSW TAB, subject to receiving further details about the sale process and the business’ financial position. “The NSW TAB is a strategic asset and fits well with our wagering portfolio,” he said. “However, we will only pursue this opportunity if it makes strategic and financial sense.”

Any acquisition of the NSW TAB would be subject to stringent regulation and competition approval given Tabcorp already holds exclusive retail wagering licenses in Victoria and New South Wales until 2024 and 2033 respectively.  

Tabcorp shares were up 0.7% in early afternoon trade as investors responded positively to the company’s growth plans and potential NSW TAB bid. The stock has gained 5% over the past month and is outperforming the wider market.

Mr. Attenborough, who succeeded longtime former CEO David Shaw in July, thanked shareholders for their ongoing support. “With our diverse portfolio of gambling entertainment assets, Tabcorp is in a strong position to drive future growth, subject to the recovery of our venues and events businesses as social restrictions ease.”
