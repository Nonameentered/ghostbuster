Qantas reports 2.4% rise in net profit but warns on Japan routes 

Australia's national carrier Qantas reported a 2.4% increase in underlying net profit to $980 million for the fiscal 2019 financial year. However, the airline warned that the impact of a weakening Japanese economy and declining business travel demand was affecting its revenue from routes to Japan.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the result demonstrated the strength of the company's diversified business model, with different parts of the group addressing specific market segments and economic conditions. "Overall, it's a very solid result with continued strength from key parts of our portfolio like domestic, frequent flyers and freight offsetting headwinds in other areas like international," he said.

The strong performance of Qantas' domestic operations was the main driver of the improved results, with revenue increasing by 5% and unit revenue up 6%. This offset weaker demand on international routes, where revenue declined by 1% due to factors like falling demand in the Japan market and fuel cost pressures. Revenue from Qantas' frequent flyer program also increased by 6% to $1.4 billion.  

However, Mr Joyce warned that revenue growth was slowing on routes to Japan, with business travel and demand from Japanese tourists declining. "There are clear signs of a weakening economy in Japan affecting travel and trade, and revenue growth on our Japan routes has slowed as a result," he said. Qantas would retime some Japan services and make cuts to lower-performing routes in response.

Qantas continued its capital investment program across its fleet, technology, lounges, and training facilities. The airline took delivery of three new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners during the year, expanding its fleet to 30 aircraft. Qantas also announced plans to upgrade emirates lounges in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Cairo in partnership with Emirates.

Mr Joyce said the company's strong balance sheet and diversified portfolio positioned it well to deal with uncertainty in global markets, despite risks around factors such as fuel costs, foreign exchange rates, and global economic growth. However, he warned that the impact of slower growth in economies like Japan was a timely reminder of the sensitivity to changes in international markets.

"We have to be able to tightly control costs and adapt our network to changing demand patterns. That versatility and financial discipline are key strengths of this Group," Mr Joyce said. The Qantas Group affirmed its guidance for the first half of fiscal 2020 to achieve flat group unit revenue, increasing fuel efficiency, and a further $400 million of cost reduction.
