Hoyts Cinema Expands into Chilean Market with Plans for Further Latin American Expansion

Australian cinema chain Hoyts announced today its expansion into Latin America with the acquisition of Chile's second largest cinema group, X Cinema. The acquisition provides Hoyts entry into Chile, South America's most prosperous nation, and a platform for further expansion into other Latin American markets.

Hoyts purchased X Cinema for $320 million, gaining access to 24 cinemas with over 200 screens across Chile as well as X Cinema's cinema technology services business. X Cinema has been operating in Chile for over 30 years and has developed a reputation for innovative cinema design and premium customer experience.

"This acquisition will allow us to tap into the growth opportunities of the Latin American cinema industry," said Mario Favre, Hoyts CEO. "Chile has both a strong economy and established cinema-going culture, making it an ideal launch pad for our expansion in the region." 

Latin America's cinema industry has experienced significant growth over the past decade, driven by economic expansion, a rising middle class, and growth in shopping mall developments. Chile's cinema ticket sales climbed over 50% between 2010 to 2019, higher than the regional average, pointing to further room for growth.

"We have long admired X Cinema as an innovator in cinema technology and upscale customer experience," said Mr. Favre. "By leveraging X Cinema's expertise and Hoyts' history of success in Australia and New Zealand, we aim to accelerate growth in Chile and continue raising the bar for cinema in Latin America."

Hoyts plans to invest $50 million over the next three years to upgrade X Cinema locations, introducing premium cinema concepts from Australia like Hoyts LUX luxury cinemas. It will also tap into Hoyts' relationships with major Hollywood studios to bring blockbuster releases to Chilean audiences. X Cinema's technology division provides Hoyts opportunity to not only upgrade X Cinema locations but also offer cinema technology services to other Latin American cinema groups.

"Becoming part of Hoyts will enable us to bring world-class cinema to more Chileans faster than we could have alone," said Diego Sanchez, X Cinema CEO. "We are thrilled about what this deal means for the future of cinema in Chile and beyond."

Mr. Favre signaled Hoyts ambition to continue expansion into other parts of Latin America, as well as globally. "This is an important first step in achieving Hoyts vision to become a globally iconic cinema brand," he said. Hoyts appears poised to make a splash in the Latin American cinema industry, with Chile as only the beginning.
