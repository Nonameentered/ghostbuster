Australian Government Appoints Stockbrokers for Telstra Corp's Largest Privatisation Float 

The Australian government today appointed four leading investment banks to manage the largest privatization in the country's history, the sale of up to 50% of telecommunications giant Telstra Corp. The government named UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs JBWere, Deutsche Bank and BT Australia as the joint lead managers for the multi-billion dollar public float of Telstra shares.

The sell-off of Australia’s dominant telecommunications carrier is a centerpiece of Prime Minister John Howard’s privatization program. Mr. Howard believes the sale will raise billions of dollars for the government while boosting competition in the telecom sector. However, the deal is controversial and opposed by the opposition Labor party and some consumer groups.

The four stockbrokers will handle the institutional and retail components of the float, which is expected to raise between A$20 billion to A$30 billion based on current market conditions, according to government estimates. UBS Warburg and Goldman Sachs will serve as the global coordinators, running the international institutional roadshows and advising the government.  Deutsche Bank and BT Australia will act as joint lead managers, focusing on the domestic side of the float including the retail offer.

Telstra is Australia’s dominant telecommunications company, controlling 80% of residential telephone lines and 60% of the mobile phone market. However, its position has faced increasing threats from new technologies like wireless, data and Internet services. The government believes privatization will allow Telstra access to new capital to fund investments in advanced telecom networks and compete with rivals in emerging markets.

While the majority of Telstra's shares will be sold to large institutional investors, the retail tranche of around 5 to 10% will allow millions of ordinary Australians to buy shares in the telecom group. The government expects strong demand from retail investors eager to participate in Australia’s highest profile privatization. Though final details have yet to be released, shares in Telstra are expected to list at a discount to encourage participation from small shareholders.

The final size and timing of the Telstra float will depend on market conditions over the next 6-12 months. The government wants to ensure both the institutional and retail components are fully subscribed to demonstrate public support for the controversial sale. The float is expected to be complete before the next federal election, due by early 2004.
