Village Roadshow expects stronger earnings in second half fueled by cinema expansion

Village Roadshow Limited, Australia's leading film and cinema group, expects stronger earnings in the second half of the fiscal year driven by a robust slate of blockbusters and expansion of its cinema circuit. 

In an update to investors, Village Roadshow said blockbusters in the coming months are expected to drive improved performance of its cinema exhibition business. Major releases including Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Wonder Woman 1984, Top Gun: Maverick, and Venom 2 are slated for the second half of the financial year through June 2020.

The forecast comes after a mixed first half where earnings declined due to a weaker film slate. Village Roadshow reported a 7.5% drop in underlying net profit to A$25.5 million in the six months ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from the cinema exhibition business fell 4.7% to A$225.2 million due to lower attendance from a lack of major blockbusters.

However, Village Roadshow remains optimistic about the full-year outlook. “We have a very strong film slate for the remainder of FY20 which we expect will drive improved performance, particularly in the second half,” said CEO Clark Kirby. 

Kirby pointed to 22 key releases in the second half compared to just 14 in the first half. The robust slate of major franchise films is expected to boost both cinema attendance and gross box office receipts.

Expansion of the cinema circuit is also anticipated to contribute to stronger results. Village Roadshow continued to invest in new and refurbished cinema sites, spending A$25 million on capital works in the first half. The company plans to open three new Gold Class cinemas and complete major upgrades at another six sites in the coming months.

The cinema expansion drive is part of Village Roadshow’s broader transformation strategy to enhance the movie-going experience. The company is focused on premium cinema offerings, luxury recliner seating, premium food, and alcohol options to attract movie fans.

Subject to the performance of upcoming blockbusters and the timing of new cinema openings, Village Roadshow expects underlying net profit for the full 2020 financial year to exceed the A$52.1 million achieved in 2019. The company will continue investing to position itself for long-term growth as audiences return to the movies.

In summary, while first half earnings were weaker due to a lackluster film slate, Village Roadshow anticipates stronger results in the remainder of the financial year driven by major franchise blockbusters, expansion of its cinema circuit, and ongoing efforts to enhance the movie-going experience.
