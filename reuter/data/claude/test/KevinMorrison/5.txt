St George Bank aims for higher cost savings from Advance Bank merger 

St George Bank has revealed that it expects higher cost savings from its planned merger with regional lender Advance Bank. In an investor presentation, St George increased its estimated annual cost savings from $50 million to $70 million by the 2023 financial year.

The merged bank will have about 10 million customers, more than 15,000 staff and assets under management of over $210 billion, making it one of the largest Australian banks outside the "big four." The all-stock merger was proposed in December 2019 and is progressing through various regulatory approvals. If approved, the merger is expected to be implemented in early 2021.

St George Bank CEO Ross McEwan said that additional analysis and planning in recent months had identified further areas where the combined bank could reduce costs through removing duplication and gaining efficiencies of scale. "Bringing these two businesses together will allow us to share resources and infrastructure across a much larger base, which benefits both customers and shareholders," Mr McEwan said.

The main sources of the increased cost savings are expected to be from combining corporate functions like finance, risk, compliance and technology platforms. St George also expects to reduce the combined branch network by about 20 percent over coming years as more customers shift to digital banking services. 

Merging the banks' technology platforms is anticipated to take up to two years, enabling the transition of Advance Bank customers to St George's digital banking services. "We have a highly competitive digital offering and state-of-the-art payment platforms, so transitioning Advance Bank customers onto these systems will provide more convenient services for them as well as significant productivity benefits for the group," Mr McEwan said.

Consumer group Choice has warned, however, that regional bank customers could face higher fees and reduced access to branches if more large banks acquire smaller regional lenders. "Regional bank takeovers are often not in the interests of consumers and can lead to significant changes that many customers never signed up for," said Choice CEO Alan Kirkland.

The proposed merger remains subject to approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Reserve Bank of Australia. St George and Advance Bank shareholders will also need to vote on the merger at meetings expected around November this year. If approved, eligible Advance Bank shareholders will receive 0.3691 St George Bank shares for every Advance Bank share held.

Based on St George's closing share price of $31.87 yesterday, that values Advance Bank at around $6.10 per share, a premium of 28 percent to Advance Bank's closing price before the merger was proposed in December last year. St George Bank shares were largely unchanged following today's announcement, closing two cents higher at $31.89. Advance Bank shares closed up three cents or 0.5% higher at $6.07.
