Optus Communications Expects Strong Results for 1996/97 Despite Litigation Delays, Plans Sharemarket Float in 1997

Optus Communications, Australia's second largest telecommunications company, today announced it expects strong financial results for the 1996/97 financial year despite ongoing litigation issues delaying its full privatization. Optus CEO Chris Anderson said the company anticipates exceeding its prospectus profit forecasts for the third year in a row, with earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) growth of over 25% expected. 

Optus has been majority owned by Singapore Telecommunications since 1992. Plans for Singapore Telecom to fully privatize Optus via a sharemarket float have been delayed due to legal challenges from Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications provider. However, Mr. Anderson said Optus remains on track to list on the Australian Stock Exchange in early 1997 if litigation clears in time.

"Our performance continues to highlight why Optus is an attractive proposition for investors," Mr. Anderson said. "We have built outstanding mobile and data networks, launched competitive fixed-line services, and developed a reputation for customer service excellence and value."

Optus has gained over 3 million subscribers since launching Australia's first mobile phone network in 1993 and second fixed-line phone system in 1997. However, the company's ability to compete in the fixed-line market has been hampered by Telstra's control of the copper wire access network. An industry review is underway to determine fair pricing for Optus and other providers to access Telstra's network.

The review and legal challenges have caused uncertainty, but Mr. Anderson said Optus remains well-positioned as a nimble competitor with a focus on customer needs. "We will continue providing Australians choice and value regardless of any outcomes," he said.

If able to list this year, Optus expects to raise between A$2 billion to A$3 billion in what would be Australia's largest initial public offering. Proceeds will be used to fund network expansion and service improvements, Mr. Anderson said.

Subject to overcoming remaining legal delays, Optus appears poised to strengthen its position in Australia's telecommunications sector and mature as a publicly listed company. Continuing to exceed customer needs may see the telco give dominant player Telstra a run for its money.
