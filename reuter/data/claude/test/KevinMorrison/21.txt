Business Demands for Cheaper Telephone Services Driving Liberalisation 
in APEC Telecommunications Markets, Says Adviser to U.S. President Clinton

The growing demand for cheaper and higher quality telecommunications services among businesses in the Asia-Pacific region is driving the liberalisation of telecom markets within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, according to an adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Speaking at an APEC business summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia today, Michael Montgomery, director for International Communications and Information Policy at the U.S. National Economic Council, said businesses are pushing APEC telecommunications regulators and policymakers to open up their markets and introduce more competition. 

“Businesses today require access to the most advanced telecommunications services to remain competitive, and they want those services at the lowest cost possible,” Montgomery said. “This is putting pressure on regulators across APEC to break up monopolies, issue new telecom licenses, lower barriers to foreign investment, and make progress in harmonising policies and regulations across borders.”

Montgomery pointed to several examples of increasing liberalisation within APEC, including the initial public offering of shares in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, the largest in Philippine history. He also cited reforms in China that saw the number of mobile phones grow from less than 3 million in 1993 to over 50 million today, as well as the privatisation of telecommunications carriers in Thailand and Malaysia.

While progress has been made, Montgomery said more work is needed to connect APEC’s diverse markets. He called for accelerated negotiations on basic telecom services by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies. He also pushed for more cooperation on issues such as spectrum allocation, standardisation, and infrastructure investment.

“Liberalisation of telecommunications makes good business and economic sense for APEC members,” Montgomery said. “Competition, private investment and improved connectivity can help our companies become more innovative and efficient. They are essential drivers of growth in today's global, knowledge-based economy.”

Representing 21 economies in the Asia-Pacific region with a combined GDP of over US$19 trillion, APEC is the world's most economically dynamic region. According to Montgomery, by pushing for freer and fairer trade and investment in telecommunications, APEC can help its members participate fully in the booming digital economy.
