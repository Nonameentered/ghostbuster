Seven Network Ltd Expected to Report Rise in Net Profit for First Half of 1996/97 Year 

Seven Network Ltd, one of Australia's leading television broadcasters, is expected to announce a solid increase in net profit for the first six months of its 1996/97 fiscal year. According to industry analysts, Seven Network's profit for the half-year ending December 31 is forecast to rise by at least 20% compared to the same period last year, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improved cost efficiencies.

The broadcaster is scheduled to release its half-year results on Thursday. Seven Network's net profit in the first half of 1995/96 was $86.2 million. If analyst predictions are correct, net profit for the current half-year could exceed $100 million. 

Revenue from Seven's key advertising market is anticipated to climb by 10-15% in the first half, building on the momentum from the final quarter of last year. Sources close to the company suggest Seven has lifted its share of the metropolitan free-to-air advertising market as a result of ratings successes and its coverage of major sports events like the Olympic Games and Melbourne Cup. Advertising during the Olympics and Melbourne Cup, in particular, is believed to have attracted a premium.

On the cost side, Seven Network is reaping rewards from its long-running Operational Efficiency Program aimed at reducing expenses, maximizing synergies across the group, and optimizing the use of technology. The broadcaster is making savings in areas such as program purchasing, where it is relying more on home-grown productions and less on expensive overseas content. It is also making back-office and administration cuts with the aid of new digital systems.

Analysts say the half-year results will highlight the progress Seven Network has made in strengthening its balance sheet. Operating cash flow is expected to have increased, enabling further debt repayment. Seven has pledged to cut net debt to below $400 million by mid-1997. Its net debt stood at $450 million at the end of June 1996.

In a research report, one media analyst wrote, "Solid ratings, revenue growth, and cost containment should combine to drive a healthy increase in Seven's first-half profit. The market will likely reward the result, especially if there is further progress on debt reduction. Operationally and financially, Seven seems to be building good momentum."

The half-year results follow Seven's recent restructure of its sales division and several key executive appointments designed to enhance the company's content, marketing, and digital media expertise. These strategic moves further brighten the outlook for Australia's longest-established commercial television network.
