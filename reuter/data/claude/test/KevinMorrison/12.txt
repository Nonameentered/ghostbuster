Business demands for cheaper telephone services to drive liberalisation in APEC telecom markets, says U.S. official 

The demand from businesses for lower-cost telecommunication services will drive further liberalization of telephone markets in the Asia-Pacific, a senior U.S. trade official said Wednesday. The push from companies for cheaper and higher quality voice and data transmission options will encourage governments across the region to open up their telecom sectors, said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan Esserman. 

Speaking at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation telecommunications meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Esserman said companies reliant on competitively-priced telecoms would lobby governments to dismantle monopolies, remove barriers to new competitors and reduce regulations and fees charged by state-run phone companies. 

“Businesses large and small want lower rates, greater choices and higher quality phone services to improve their competitiveness,” Esserman told delegates from the 21 APEC member economies. “This creates incentives for governments to take actions to liberalize their telecom markets to meet business demands.”

Esserman said countries that had already liberalized their telecom sectors, including the U.S., Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong, had benefited from increased foreign investment, job creation, network expansions, falling phone charges and rapid take-up of new services. But many APEC nations still had some way to go to open up their phone systems, she said.

Liberalization of telephone sectors across APEC remains uneven despite a common goal set by leaders in 1994 of freer telecom trade and investments by the year 2000. While most countries have broken up their telephone monopolies and allowed in new competitors, high government fees and restrictions on foreign ownership or access to networks persist in nations such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea.

Esserman said governments should now “redouble their efforts” to lift such barriers, reduce regulation of their phone carriers and make their telecom markets more contestable by new entrants. The advantages of increased sector-wide competition were too significant to ignore, she argued. 

"Liberalized telecom markets release the creativity and entrepreneurship that lead to economic opportunity for all sectors of society," Esserman concluded.  “APEC governments must get about the business of regulatory reform and market opening to unleash the growth potential of the telecom sector.”
