Seven Network Optimistic for Better Second Half Performance in 1996/97

The Seven Network is forecasting significant improvement in its financial performance in the second half of the 1996/97 financial year compared to its disappointing first half.  In its investor briefing today, Seven outlined several key factors that it believes will drive stronger earnings and revenue growth over the remainder of the financial year.

A major factor in Seven's slow start this year was the underperformance of several new programs in its prime time schedule, especially in the key demographic of viewers aged 18 to 49.  Some new shows failed to find an audience and were quickly canceled.  Seven has now revamped its schedule for the start of the new ratings season in January and is confident the new slate of shows will resonate much more strongly with viewers and advertisers.  The new lineup includes reality shows, dramas and comedies that Seven's research shows are eagerly anticipated.  

Seven also has the broadcast rights to several major sports events in the coming months, including the Australian Open tennis, rugby league matches, and golf's Masters tournament.  Seven's Chief Executive, Kerry Packer, said sporting broadcasts are major boosts for ratings and that the revenue from these events would flow directly to Seven's bottom line.  Mr. Packer said Seven remains committed to aggressive bidding for key sports rights.

Another factor dragging on Seven's first half was soft demand from advertisers, especially in the retail sector.  However, Seven executives report that advertising bookings for the January to June period are running well ahead of last year, with stronger spending expected from both longtime advertisers as well as new clients in the technology and telecommunications sectors.   

While declining to provide specific earnings guidance, Mr. Packer said the company expects a "very significant improvement" in profits in the second half.  He pointed out that Seven's costs have largely been cut to sustainable levels and most major investments in new digital technology and infrastructure have already been made.  This leaves the majority of additional revenue to flow through to profits.  

In summary, while the first half of 1996/97 fell short of expectations, Seven Network is confident its new slate of programming, key sports broadcasts, rebound in advertising, and lower costs will combine to deliver a much improved financial performance over the remaining six months of the financial year.  Investors appear to share this optimism, with Seven shares up 3.2% in trading today following the company's presentation.
