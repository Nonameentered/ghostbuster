Australian Telecoms Minister Urges Asia-Pacific to Lower Telephone Charges for Economic Growth 

The Australian Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, today called on telecommunications companies across the Asia-Pacific region to lower international calling and roaming charges to promote greater economic cooperation.

Speaking at a conference in Singapore, Minister Fletcher said the high cost of international telephone calls and mobile data roaming between countries in Asia and the Pacific was a significant barrier to trade, investment and tourism.

“The economic links across this region are becoming ever more significant,” Mr Fletcher said. “ Millions of business calls are made between the countries of our region every week. Tourism flows are massive and growing. And yet the charges for those telephone calls and for mobile data while travelling remain far too high.”

Mr Fletcher pointed to estimates that if charges for calls and roaming were dramatically cut, particularly for business users, it could boost GDP across Asia-Pacific economies by up to $20 billion per year. He said this was a prize worth pursuing.

The Minister issued a challenge to major telecoms companies like Singtel, Telstra, Airtel and Vodafone to show leadership on this issue. He said governments were willing to encourage greater competition and consider policy changes to enable lower prices, but industry-led initiatives would be preferable.

“High telephone charges and excessively priced roaming services are a drag on business, a tax on tourism, and a handbrake on economic cooperation,” Mr Fletcher said. “With goodwill and leadership, huge progress could be made to delivering cheaper, simpler telephone access across borders, to the benefit of all.”

Mr Fletcher said he would discuss options for greater collaboration on this issue with ministers from several Asia-Pacific nations attending the Singapore conference this week. He also highlighted a proposal from an Australian telecoms industry group for a region-wide ‘Asia-Pacific Fair Call Promise’ to guarantee fair prices, especially for business customers.

The call from Minister Fletcher adds to pressure on regional telecoms giants to lower their international fees and make telephone access simpler and more affordable across the fast-growing economies of Asia and the Pacific. With projected population growth of over 50% in many countries over the next 20-30 years, the case for change appears only likely to become stronger over time.
