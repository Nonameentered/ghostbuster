Seven Network Ltd reports 31.5% fall in net profit, optimistic for second half performance  

Australian television network Seven West Media today reported a 31.5% drop in full-year net profit to $242.2 million, reflecting a tough advertising market in the first half. However, the media company said it remains optimistic for growth in the second half of calendar 2016 as major sporting events are likely to attract viewers and advertisers.

Revenue for the 12 months to June 30 fell 2.5% to $1.97 billion, which the broadcaster attributed to lower advertising markets across metropolitan free-to-air TV and print. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 14.2% to $459.9 million. 

Chief Executive Tim Worner said the advertising market remained "challenging and volatile" but there were signs of improvement in the current quarter. "We have reasons to be optimistic. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and, as we turn into the finals football and start of cricket season, our ratings momentum continues," he said in a statement.

The broadcaster's metro free-to-air TV ad revenue dropped 8.4% in the year, impacted by a weaker advertising market, particularly in the first half. However, Seven said it increased its audience and ad revenue share in the second half helped by major franchises The X Factor, Home and Away and My Kitchen Rules.

Mr Worner said the company would book significant benefits from lower costs and the renegotiation of major sports rights deals, including a new four-year deal for test cricket signed this year. However, he also warned that the threat of reduced television license fees as well as new streaming services and alternative broadcast platforms had added to uncertainty. 

Revenue from Seven Productions was up 30% to $76.7 million, helped by E!'s Botched. The company's online division, including 7plus and 7Now, drove a 48% increase in digital revenue.

Seven West shares dropped as much as 6.7% to $1.135 in early trade before recovering slightly to be 4.6% weaker at $1.165. The stock has declined almost 60% from its 2015 peak amid challenging conditions.

Shareholder Kerry Stokes, the company's non-executive chairman, said the past year "has not been without its difficulties" but Seven was generating good momentum and "well positioned" for future growth despite a soft economy and "new competitors emerging almost daily". 

Seven declared a final dividend of 3 cents, 50% lower, bringing the total dividend for the year to 6 cents. The total payout is down from 12 cents a year ago.

In summary, while Seven West Media reported a sharp drop in earnings due to weaker advertising markets and revenue pressures, the company remains optimistic that upcoming major sports programming and events will drive growth in the months ahead. The long-term outlook for traditional media companies continues to face challenges from changing viewing habits and new streaming competitors, even as audiences for established franchises remain strong.
