Australia's Telstra Corp to Be Privatized in Largest Sharemarket Float in the Nation's History  

The Australian government announced today that it will fully privatize Telstra Corp, the nation's largest telecommunications company, in what will be the biggest initial public offering in Australia's history. The sale of Telstra shares is expected to raise between $30 to $40 billion Australian dollars, surpassing the previous record set by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's $4.2 billion float in 1991.

Telstra, which was formerly owned by the Australian government, controls the majority of the country's telecommunications infrastructure including telephone lines and mobile networks. The privatization of Telstra has been discussed for over a decade and is a controversial issue, with critics arguing that it could lead to higher prices and reduced services in rural areas. However, the center-right government believes privatization will increase competition and innovation in the telecom sector.

According to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, the government will sell its remaining 50.4 percent stake in Telstra in two stages starting in mid-2019. "This is an historic day for Telstra and an historic day for competition and consumer choice in the Australian telecommunications market," Mr. Frydenberg said at a press conference. The sale is expected to be popular with domestic and foreign investors seeking exposure to Telstra's stable dividend and growth in mobile data usage.

Not all Australians welcome the news, however. The Australian Council of Trade Unions warned that privatizing Telstra would "only benefit big business and well-connected shareholders‚Äù while disadvantaging average consumers and workers. Critics argue Telstra may pursue higher profits over customer service and could reduce staffing levels after the government relinquishes control. But the government insists strong regulations will remain in place to protect consumers regardless of Telstra's ownership.

The total financial impact of Telstra's privatization remains to be seen. But if successful, it would be a signature achievement for the Coalition government and could inject billions into government coffers for spending priorities like tax cuts or budget repair before the next election. After 32 years of partial government ownership, Australia's largest telecommunications provider is set to become privately held once again, for better or for worse.
