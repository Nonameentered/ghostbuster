Australian Telecom Minister Calls for Lower Telephone Charges in Asia-Pacific Region  

CANBERRA, Australiaâ€”The Australian Minister for Communications, Paul Fletcher, issued a call today for telecommunications companies across the Asia-Pacific region to lower charges for international telephone calls and text messages. In a speech at an industry conference, Minister Fletcher said that excessively high fees for calls and texts between countries in the region were hampering business, trade, and social connections.  

"In today's globalized world, affordable telecommunications across borders is crucial for maintaining relationships between friends and families, enabling collaboration between businesses, and facilitating trade across the region," Minister Fletcher said. "While domestic calling and messaging rates have fallen sharply in most Asia-Pacific countries, international rates remain substantially higher. My department's research shows these high international rates are a barrier, especially for small businesses looking to expand into new markets."

The Minister pointed to research showing that a 10-minute call from Australia to neighboring countries like Indonesia, Malaysia or the Philippines can cost between $5 to $15, far more than domestic call rates. Text message rates show a similar premium for international messages compared to domestic ones. These high charges date from an era when telecom infrastructure made international calls more expensive to provide. But technology improvements have greatly reduced these costs, even as retail prices have remained largely unchanged.

Several telecom companies in Australia and Southeast Asia have begun offering more affordable international calling and messaging plans, but Minister Fletcher said more widespread change is still needed across telecom carriers in the region. "High international rates produce revenue for some telecom companies, but they are short-sighted and contrary to the goal of promoting greater connectivity," he added. The Minister said Australia would make affordable international telecom rates a priority as part of regional trade discussions to encourage broader reforms.

In recent years, Australia has sought closer technology and business ties with neighboring countries through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Lower telecommunications costs across borders could encourage even greater collaboration and economic activity around the region, analysts say. For now though, "more work still needs to be done by telecom companies and governments in the Asia-Pacific to achieve the goal of lower rates and greater access," Minister Fletcher concluded.
