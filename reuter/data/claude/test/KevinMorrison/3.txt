APEC Urged to Accelerate Liberalisation in Fast-Growing Telecommunications Sector, Says Australia Official 

Australia's top trade official has called on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies to speed up opening their telecommunications markets to foreign investors and facilitate the growth of mobile internet services across the region. Speaking at an APEC conference on the digital economy in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea today, Australia's Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham said the telecommunications sector in the APEC region has been one of the fastest-growing industries but further liberalization is needed to drive innovation and economic gains.

The telecommunications sector in the Asia-Pacific region has experienced exponential growth over the last decade, fueled by the rapid rise in mobile and internet access. The number of mobile subscriptions in the region has grown from just over 1 billion in 2005 to more than 5.2 billion today. Internet access has also increased dramatically, from around 15 percent of the region's population online in 2005 to over 52 percent today. Growth in the telecommunications sector has been a key driver of economic activity across APEC. According to some estimates, for every 10 percent increase in broadband penetration, a country’s GDP grows by up to 1.5 percent.

However, Minister Birmingham said there is still much work to be done in opening telecommunications markets and developing regulatory systems to promote competition in APEC. “While the telecommunications industry has grown rapidly, regulation of the sector has not kept up the pace,” he said. “Restrictions on foreign investment in telecommunications companies remain in too many APEC economies. Closed or restricted markets and state ownership of telecommunications companies in some economies have stifled competition.”

The Minister pointed out that APEC's average restrictiveness in telecommunications services is still higher than in most other sectors. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, APEC's 19 other sectors have an average restrictiveness score of 0.18 compared to 0.28 for telecommunications. He called on APEC members to open their markets to greater foreign investment, reduce barriers to competition, and strengthen the independence of their regulators. Accelerating regulatory reform will drive productivity gains and boost economic growth across the region, he said.

Minister Birmingham also highlighted the need to improve access to mobile broadband in rural and remote areas, which often lag cities in connectivity and speeds. Nearly 2.5 billion people in the APEC region live in rural areas, but they are disproportionately underserved by mobile operators. He said greater infrastructure sharing and more transparent pricing for telecommunications services could help improve rural access. "We need innovation in business models to incentivize the private sector to invest in rural connectivity," he said.

In closing, Minister Birmingham reaffirmed Australia's commitment to working with other APEC members to pursue a forward-looking digital agenda that will unlock opportunities in the telecommunications sector and benefit economies and societies across the Asia-Pacific region. With a focus on competition, open markets and rural access, APEC can achieve an ambitious vision for the connected region of the future, he said.
