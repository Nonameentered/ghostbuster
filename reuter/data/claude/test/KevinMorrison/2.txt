Australia's Housing Market Expected to Turn Around in 1997, but Boom Unlikely to Repeat

The Australian housing market is showing signs of stabilizing after several years of declining home prices and sluggish sales. Experts expect the market to start turning around in 1997, fueled by lower interest rates and steady economic growth. However, most economists say home prices are unlikely to return to the rapid rate of appreciation seen during the late 1980s housing boom.   

After several interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia caused home prices to drop significantly between 1989 and 1991, the housing market has remained weak for the past several years. High unemployment, economic uncertainty, and a resulting drop in consumer confidence contributed to the housing market malaise. However, with interest rates declining again, unemployment stabilizing, and economic growth picking up moderately, experts see the housing market poised for a rebound.

“All the leading indicators are pointing to an upswing in housing activity over the coming 6 to 12 months,” said Michael Davies, chief economist at banking group ANZ. He cited drops in variable mortgage rates, increases in housing affordability, and improved consumer sentiment surveys as reasons the housing market is bottoming out.

While Australians may see modest price appreciation of 3 to 5 percent for houses over the next couple of years, most experts say a return to double-digit price gains is unlikely. “We expect the rate of home price growth will remain well below that seen in the late '80s boom,” said Saul Eslake, chief economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “High household debt levels and more responsible lending practices will constrain excess in the housing market.”  

During the late 1980s, home prices in Australian capital cities rose at annual rates of 15 to 30 percent. The building boom that resulted ultimately led to an oversupply of housing that took years to clear. Lenders also got caught up in the frenzy, issuing mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios that left many households owing more than their homes were worth when prices crashed. In the aftermath, banks tightened their lending standards, a practice they are expected to continue even as the market strengthens.  

While higher home prices may bring some relief to home sellers, the moderation in the market is good news for homebuyers and the overall economy. Steady but sustainable price gains are seen as ideal for supporting consumer confidence without creating the instabilities that accompany overheated housing markets. After several years of waiting, it seems both buyers and sellers may be able to get back in the game—albeit at a more modest pace than before.
