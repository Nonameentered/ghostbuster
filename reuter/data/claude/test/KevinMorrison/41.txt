David Jones Ltd reports 50% profit drop in first half, anticipates new CEO appointment soon

David Jones Ltd, Australia's oldest department store group, reported a 50% drop in net profit in the first half of the financial year today. The retailer blamed weak consumer sentiment and higher expenses for the profit slump. 

Net profit for the 26 weeks ended December 29 fell to $21.4 million, down from $43.4 million a year earlier. Total sales rose 0.3% to $1.77 billion, but comparable store sales, which exclude new store openings, fell 1.4%.

The results highlight the challenges faced by David Jones under outgoing CEO John Dixon, who announced his retirement in October after seven years in the role. The company said it is progressing well with the global search for a new CEO and anticipates making an appointment “in the near term.”

Chairman Gordon Cairns said the first-half result was “disappointing” but in line with the profit warning issued in December. “Weak consumer sentiment and higher costs impacted profits despite sound revenue growth from new stores,” he said. “The external environment is likely to remain challenging, though we have measures in place to improve performance.”

David Jones has been struggling with the shift to online shopping and competition from fast-fashion chains like Zara and H&M. The company's network of just 38 department stores, focused on premium and luxury brands, has also made it harder to benefit from a pick-up in lower-end retail spending.

To counter weak sales and high rents, David Jones has cut costs by $10 million in the first half through reduced headcount and limiting discretionary spend. It has also renegotiated rental agreements at several stores and closed underperforming outlets. But cost growth of $24.1 million, largely due to new store openings, outstripped the savings.

David Jones remains optimistic about the second half, pointing to recent improvements in retail spending and consumer confidence. The company also hopes to benefit from a pipeline of exclusive brand partnerships, accelerated online growth, and the rollout of new customer loyalty programs.

Mr. Cairns said the board is committed to rewarding shareholders and will consider dividends at the full-year result in July. David Jones' interim dividend was unchanged at 20 cents per share fully franked.

Shares in David Jones closed down 2 cents, or 0.4%, at $5.20, before the first-half results were announced. The stock has gained 20% in the past six months in anticipation of an improved trading performance and CEO appointment.
