Optus Communications Expects Strong Results and Aims for Sharemarket Float in 1997 despite Litigation Delays  

Optus Communications, Australia's second largest telecommunications company, said today it expects to report strong financial results for the fiscal year ending in June and aims to proceed with a long-awaited sharemarket float in early 1997, despite litigation delays related to disputes with former shareholder Cable & Wireless.

Managing Director Ian Myers said Optus expects revenue growth of at least 15% for the fiscal year and continuing strong growth in its mobile, data, internet and pay TV operations. “We have established Optus as a strong and aggressive competitor in the Australian telecommunications market and our suite of services is resonating well with business and retail customers alike,” Mr Myers said.

Optus’ float plans, first announced in 1995, have been delayed due to a dispute with former joint venture shareholder Cable & Wireless over ownership of certain network assets. However, Mr Myers said Optus expects resolution of the dispute in the coming months. “We are eager to access public equity markets to support our continued growth and innovation,” Mr Myers said. “A successful float will provide Optus with additional financial flexibility and strengthen our competitive position.”

Optus is currently owned by an equity consortium comprising Singapore Telecommunications (31.8%), Colonial Group (13.6%), Seven Network (12.3%) and subsidiaries of some large Australian investment banks. The consortium acquired Optus from Cable & Wireless in 1993 for $2.5 billion and has since invested heavily in network infrastructure and new product development.
