Singapore's Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan Calls for Balance in Liberalising Telecommunications Market in APEC 

Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim called for a balanced approach in liberalizing the telecommunications market across the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Telecommunications and Information Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, Minister Yaacob said that while promoting competition and market access are important to drive innovation, regulation is still needed to safeguard consumer interests.

Minister Yaacob noted that the telecommunications industry has evolved rapidly in recent years with the growth of new technologies like 5G mobile networks, artificial intelligence, and over-the-top media services. This has resulted in more choices and lower prices for consumers but also introduced new challenges. As APEC economies work to promote digital connectivity and enable the growth of the digital economy, regulations need to strike a balance between enabling industry growth and protecting users.

"As we liberalize our telecommunication markets, we must do so in a progressive manner, and avoid a 'big bang' approach. Some degree of regulation is still necessary to safeguard consumer interests, ensure security and resilience, as well as fair competition in our markets," Minister Yaacob said. 

Some of the key initiatives discussed during the two-day meeting included promoting digital financial inclusion, developing interconnected 5G networks across the region, and enabling cross-border data flows. Ministers also reaffirmed the need to strengthen cooperation on cybersecurity to build trust and confidence in the use of digital services.

With Singapore taking on the Chairmanship of APEC in 2022, Minister Yaacob said that negotiations on a possible APEC-wide agreement on enhanced data innovation and digital trade would continue to be a priority. Such an agreement could include provisions to enable cross-border data flows, promote compatible regulatory frameworks between member economies, and establish mechanisms for public-private sector cooperation on new technologies.

"There is great potential for APEC to promote interoperability between different frameworks and develop ‘connecting digits’ to enable seamless digital trade across our region," Minister Yaacob said. With the digital economy estimated to reach US$23 trillion by 2025, unlocking this potential can significantly benefit businesses and consumers across APEC, he added.
