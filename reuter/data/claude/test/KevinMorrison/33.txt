Publishing and Broadcasting Reports Lower 1996/97 Profit Due to Weaker Advertising Sales  

Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) announced a 6.3% drop in net profit to $302.3 million for the year ended June 30, 1997. The result reflected weaker advertising sales, especially in television and magazines. 

PBL chairman James Packer said the group faced challenging advertising market conditions during 1996/97. "There was a significant downturn in advertising expenditure which impacted a number of our businesses," Mr Packer said.

PBL's television division reported a 11.5% decline in operating profit to $151 million, reflecting lower ratings for Nine Network and a soft advertising market. PBL has a 45% interest in Nine Network. Advertising revenue for the TV division fell 8.4% for the year. The fall in Nine's ratings over the past year was attributed to competition from the Seven and Ten networks.  

Magazine publishing operating profit declined 26.1% to $50.5 million, reflecting lower advertising revenue. PBL publishes many popular magazines including The Bulletin, Cleo and Woman's Day. Total advertising revenue for PBL's magazine division declined 9.3% over the year. 

While PBL's media divisions struggled, its Victorian wagering and gaming operator Tabcorp Holdings reported a 21.9% rise in profit contribution to $223.7 million. Revenue from Tabcorp's casino operations grew more than 15% due to strong growth in interstate and international visitors. The growth in Tabcorp's contribution helped offset some of the weakness in PBL's media businesses.

Mr Packer said while the outlook for the group's media interests remained difficult, he was confident PBL's diversified mix of assets would steer the company through these challenging times.  "With our diverse spread of interests across media, casinos, and gaming, PBL remains in a strong position to enhance shareholder value over the long term," Mr Packer said.

Shares in PBL closed down 9c at $7.56. Market analysts said the result was slightly ahead of market expectations given the difficult trading conditions experienced by media companies over the past year.
