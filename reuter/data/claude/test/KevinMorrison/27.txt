Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Strikes Deal with EchoStar to Offer U.S. Subscription Television Service, Shares Soar

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp announced today that it has entered into a multi-year partnership with EchoStar Communications Corporation to launch a new subscription television service in the United States. The service, which does not yet have a name, will provide more than 150 channels of news, sports, movies, and other TV content directly to consumers via satellite for a monthly subscription fee. Shares of both News Corp and EchoStar soared on the news. 

News Corp has been looking to find new ways to distribute its media content and generate revenue in the face of declining cable subscribers and ad revenue. The new partnership with EchoStar, which owns the DISH satellite TV brand, allows News Corp to reach consumers directly without relying on cable companies. The service is expected to launch in late 2019, pending regulatory approval.

"This partnership with EchoStar is a milestone for our company and has the potential to transform how Americans consume media," said News Corp CEO Robert Thomson. "With EchoStar's expertise in satellite distribution and our unmatched array of news, sports, and entertainment content, we will be able to offer consumers a compelling new alternative for watching TV."

The service will include channels from News Corp's Fox Broadcasting Company like Fox News Channel, FS1, FX, and National Geographic. It will also feature on-demand programming as well other live TV channels from News Corp's and EchoStar's content partners. Subscribers will need an EchoStar satellite dish and set-top box to receive the service. Pricing has not yet been announced.

"DISH has always put customers first in the video space, and our partnership with News Corp furthers that mission," said EchoStar CEO Mike Dugan. "This new service will deliver the best, most compelling content into homes and we are excited about its launch."

The deal sent shares of News Corp up over 15% to $16.42 in early trading and EchoStar shares climbed nearly 20% to $44.27. The price spikes reflect investor optimism about the new revenue potential for both companies in the pay TV market. If successful, the partnership could pose a threat to major cable companies and streaming services like AT&T's HBO Max, Disney+, and Netflix. However, it also enters a market with many existing competitors, so attracting subscribers may still prove challenging.

Regulators will review the News Corp-EchoStar deal in the coming months. If approved without requiring changes, the companies said they expect to formally launch their new satellite TV service to U.S. consumers by October 2019. The service does not yet have an official name but more details are expected in the coming weeks.
