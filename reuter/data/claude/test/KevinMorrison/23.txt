Qantas Airways Reports Modest Profit Increase, Warns of Challenges on Japan Routes  

Qantas Airways reported a modest increase in annual profits Thursday, topping consensus forecasts but warning that weakness in international travel from Japan and the rising cost of fuel threaten growth prospects in Asia. 

Australia's flag carrier said net profit for the fiscal year ended June rose 3% to A$780 million (US$564 million) from A$760 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 5% to A$16.2 billion.

The results came in ahead of average analyst forecasts of around A$766 million, according to a FactSet poll. Qantas shares rose 4% in early Sydney trading.

While domestic operations continued to buoy the company's earnings, challenges emerged in Asia, particularly Japan, Qantas's second-biggest international market after New Zealand. Overall international passenger numbers rose just 0.2% for the fiscal year.

"Mixed economic conditions and competitive pressures in Japan resulted in weak demand for leisure and premium travel," Qantas said. The company's budget carrier Jetstar Japan also widened its losses, compounding the drag on earnings from Japan.

In a video message accompanying the result, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline was redeploying aircraft from underperforming routes in Japan to stronger markets such as the U.S., where there is high demand for flights to Brisbane and the Gold Coast.

The carrier also noted the significant impact of higher oil prices, which added over A$700 million to its fuel bill during the year. The company forecast a further A$614 million increase in its fuel costs for the current fiscal year due to oil prices hovering around four-year highs.

Mr. Joyce said the company is hedging against further increases and rolling out more fuel-efficient Boeing Dreamliner 787 aircraft to help curb costs. 

Overall, Qantas reiterated guidance for the current fiscal year of underlying profit before tax between A$1.2 billion and A$1.3 billion, assuming jet fuel prices stay in a range of US$70 to US$80 a barrel.

Qantas has turned profitable in recent years after posting a record A$2.8 billion loss in 2014. Mr. Joyce has spearheaded a turnaround plan featuring cost cuts, layoffs and the launch of several new international routes. The company is now expecting to generate increasing profit growth over coming years.
