SBC Warburg takes loss on £300m share deal as UK financial watchdog launches investigation  

The UK investment bank SBC Warburg has taken a substantial loss on a share sale it underwrote last month after Britain's financial regulator launched an investigation into the transaction.

SBC Warburg had agreed to buy 300 million shares in the ailing British technology company Global Integrated Circuits (GIC) for 150 pence per share as part of a rescue fundraising, valuing the deal at £450 million. However, the shares plunged in value this week after the Financial Conduct Authority said it was examining "irregularities" in GIC's accounts. 

The shares dropped to just 47 pence on Tuesday, forcing SBC Warburg to cut the price at which it bought the shares to avoid major losses. The bank said it had renegotiated the deal to pay just 65 pence per share, taking a loss of £90 million on the transaction so far based on the shares it has already acquired. It remains on the hook to buy the remaining shares as part of its underwriting commitment.

The FCA investigation centers on suspect transactions in GIC's accounts over the last 18 months that may have inflated the company's revenue and profit figures. GIC's board announced on Monday that it had called in forensic accountants to review its accounts in light of the regulator's questions. The company warned that its recent financial results could no longer be relied upon.

The FCA has powers to issue unlimited fines and ban individuals from working in finance if its inquiries uncover wrongdoing. The regulator has stepped up its enforcement actions in recent years in the wake of several scandals in the banking sector.

SBC Warburg said it "deeply regrets" its role in the GIC deal and would conduct its own internal review to understand how the "serious irregularities" had gone undetected. The bank's share price dropped 12% on Tuesday as investors digested the news of its large losses. Several analysts downgraded SBC Warburg's shares and raised questions over its risk management procedures.

The debacle is a major blow for SBC Warburg, one of London's oldest investment banks, as it seeks to compete against larger US and European rivals. The bank ousted its chief executive last year after lackluster profits and had promised shareholders a "revitalized strategy" focused on technology and industrial sectors.

A spokesperson for GIC declined to comment beyond the company's statement earlier this week. The company gave no timeframe for when the forensic review of its accounts was likely to conclude. The turmoil leaves the fate of GIC's 4,200 employees in uncertainty. The company had already announced 1,000 job cuts last year amid mounting losses.
