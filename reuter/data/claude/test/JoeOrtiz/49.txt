Legal & General Exceeds Profit Expectations and Raises Dividend Despite Potential Fallout from Investment Management Problems at Morgan Grenfell  

Legal & General, the British life insurance and investment company, reported a 12% increase in half-year profit today, exceeding analysts' expectations. Profit before tax rose to £826 million for the six months ending June 30, up from £739 million in the same period last year. The company also announced an 11% increase in its interim dividend.

The results come despite potential issues related to Legal & General's investment management subsidiary, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management. Morgan Grenfell is facing regulatory investigations into its role in managing £3 billion pension investments for Railways Pension Trustee. The pension investments underperformed relevant benchmarks over several years, prompting concerns about Morgan Grenfell's handling of the accounts. 

However, Legal & General CEO Nigel Wilson said the issues at Morgan Grenfell are isolated and the overall business remains strong. "Our core business continues to perform well, reflecting good growth, excellent retention, and high customer satisfaction," Wilson said. The company's retirement and savings divisions saw large increases in new business and continued high customer retention rates. Annuity sales were up 15% and drawdown sales increased by 25%.

To date, Legal & General has not made any provision for fines or compensation related to the Morgan Grenfell issues. Wilson acknowledged the company is cooperating fully with regulators but said it is too early determine if redress will be required. “We take these matters extremely seriously and will work closely with the trustee to understand any concerns they may have,” Wilson said.

Analysts said Legal & General’s solid results alongside the dividend increase should reassure investors, despite questions swirling around Morgan Grenfell. “The issues at Morgan Grenfell need to be monitored but as it stands today, it does not appear to be impacting Legal & General’s wider business or financial position,” said Gavin Matthews, insurance analyst at Barclays Investment Bank. The company’s shares rose more than 2% in early trading following the results announcement.
