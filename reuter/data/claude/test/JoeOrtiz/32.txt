Former Barings Treasury Head Banned from City Directorship for Three Years over Investment Bank Collapse

The former head of treasury at Barings Bank Nick Leeson has been banned from acting as a company director for three years after the Insolvency Service found him “unfit” to hold such a position as a result of his role in the collapse of Barings in 1995.

Leeson, who was sentenced to six and a half years in prison in Singapore for fraud and forgery in 1995 relating to unauthorized trades that caused the collapse of the venerable British investment bank, had applied last year to be appointed as a director of a UK shipping business. However, the Insolvency Service investigated his application and ruled that he should be disqualified from holding a directorship until 2020.

The Insolvency Service found that Leeson's actions in building up unauthorised trading positions that eventually reached $1.4 billion and caused around $900 million in losses "showed a lack of integrity and competence required of a company director.” It said Leeson had failed to act with “probity, competence, and sound judgement."

Leeson worked for Barings from 1989 and was appointed head of futures trading on the Singapore Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and general manager of Barings Futures Singapore in 1992 at the age of 25. He took unauthorized trading positions on the Nikkei 225 stock index which led to mounting losses. He fled Singapore in 1995 as the losses emerged but was arrested in Frankfurt and extradited back to Singapore where he pleaded guilty to fraud charges.
