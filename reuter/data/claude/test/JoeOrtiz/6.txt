Barclays Plc Announces Disappointing 1996 Profits, Shares Slide Lower

Barclays Plc, the giant British financial services firm, announced full-year profits for 1996 that fell short of analysts' expectations, sending its shares tumbling nearly 7 percent in early London trading. 

The company reported pre-tax profits of £1.83 billion for the year, a 13 percent increase from 1995 but below the £1.9 billion median forecast from analysts surveyed by Reuters. The results were weighed down by a 34 percent plunge in profits at Barclays' investment banking division, Barclays de Zoete Wedd or BZW.

"We are clearly disappointed with these results given the slide in profits at BZW," said Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive. "While the rest of our business units performed well, the volatility and cyclicality of investment banking hit us hard this year."

BZW struggled with difficult conditions in fixed-income trading, particularly in the second half of 1996. Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 36 percent for the full year. The division also took charges related to job cuts announced in October as part of a restructuring program.

However, Barclays' personal financial services and corporate banking divisions delivered strong results, helping offset the weakness at BZW. Profits in personal financial services rose 15 percent, buoyed by the company's push into insurance and fund management. In corporate banking, profits climbed 17 percent thanks to lower bad debt charges.

Revenue for the full year increased 10 percent to £9.84 billion. But operating expenses also rose 10 percent, due in part to costs from acquisitions and new technology initiatives. The company's cost-to-income ratio deteriorated slightly to 63.2 percent.

Mr. Taylor said that despite the drop in BZW's profits, he remains committed to Barclays' universal banking model that combines personal finance, corporate banking, and investment banking under one roof. However, he signaled that BZW may shrink as a portion of the overall group.

"We will take further action to reduce costs and risks at BZW, and it is likely the division will represent a smaller part of the group over time," Mr. Taylor said. "But investment banking activities will remain part of our strategy."
