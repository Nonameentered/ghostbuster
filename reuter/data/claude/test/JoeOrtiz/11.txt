Halifax Building Society members vote on conversion to public company 

Members of Halifax Building Society, one of the largest building societies in the UK, will vote this week on whether to convert the organization into a public limited company. The 131-year old building society has over 11 million members and assets of over £240 billion. If approved, the conversion would create one of the largest demutualizations in British history.

Halifax executives presented plans last month to convert to a plc, arguing it would allow them to raise additional capital to fund growth, expand services, and remain competitive in an increasingly challenging economic environment. As a public company, Halifax shares would be listed on the London Stock Exchange, giving members an opportunity to sell shares for a potential windfall and Halifax broader access to equity and debt markets.

However, the plans have faced criticism from some members and consumer groups. They argue demutualization will undermine the traditional building society model and ultimately lead to higher fees, interest rates, and poorer customer service. The move could also reduce competition in the banking sector, which is already dominated by a handful of large banks. A coalition of member organizations has launched a campaign urging members to vote against the plan this week.

If approved, eligible voting members would receive shares in the new Halifax Group plc in exchange for their current share holdings and membership rights. The share allocation would be based on a member’s mortgage balances, deposits, and length of membership. Halifax executives estimate most members would receive shares worth between £500 to £5,000 if they opt to sell, with some receiving significantly more. However, shares would be nontransferable for up to 3 years to prioritize benefits to longstanding members.

The results of the member vote will be announced at Halifax’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday. If approved, the final court hearing would be scheduled for later this year. Executives project the new Halifax Group plc shares would start trading on the London Stock Exchange before the end of the year, marking the end of 131 years as a building society. However, if members vote down the plans, Halifax Building Society would remain as a mutual organization, continuing to operate as it has for over a century. The outcome of this week's vote will determine the future direction of one of Britain's most well-known financial institutions.
