UK Home Loan Interest Rates May Rise Due to Upward Pressure on Savings Rates, Say Analysts 

There are indications that interest rates on home loans and mortgages in the UK may start to rise over the coming months due to increasing savings rates, according to financial analysts. As high street banks and building societies raise the rates they offer to savers, they will likely pass on some of these costs to borrowers, the analysts predict.

Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society, increased rates on select savings accounts last week, including some fixed-rate and notice accounts. Barclays and HSBC, two of Britain’s biggest banks, have also boosted some of their savings products in recent weeks. These moves are in response to the Bank of England raising the base interest rate in August, the second increase in less than a year.

While any increase in mortgage rates will be unwelcome news for borrowers, especially first-time homebuyers, the analysts do not expect very sharp or sudden rate rises. “Savings rates and mortgage rates often move broadly in line with each other, but there is typically a lag of several months,” said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. “Lenders will want to balance attracting new borrowers and retaining existing customers with increasing their rates to manage their own margins.”

David Hollingworth of mortgage broker L&C said he expects “any increase in mortgage rates to be fairly modest.” He predicts average mortgage rates may go up between 0.2 to 0.5 percentage points over the next six to nine months based on current savings rate trends. That would add a few hundred pounds per year to the cost of an average mortgage but still keep rates at near historically low levels, he noted.

Overall, while savers may welcome better returns, "there is no need for borrowers to panic just yet," said Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol. But he added: "Now is a good time for anyone looking for a new mortgage deal to consider locking into a fixed-rate, especially while there are still some very attractive sub-2% rates available.” In an environment of potentially rising interest rates, fixed-rate mortgages provide certainty over costs for the fixed period of the deal.
