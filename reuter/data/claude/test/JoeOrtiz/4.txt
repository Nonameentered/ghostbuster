Barclays Plc Shares Take a Hit as Bank Reports Disappointing Profits and Investment Banking Slump 

Shares of Barclays Plc fell more than 8% on Wednesday after the British bank reported a surprise drop in first-quarter profits due to a slump in investment banking revenue. Barclays said its profit before tax for the first three months of the year declined by 18% to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) from 2.1 billion pounds in the same period last year. The results missed analysts’ estimates of 1.9 billion pounds.  

The profit decline was driven primarily by a weak performance in Barclays’ corporate and investment bank division. Revenue from investment banking fell 31% as dealmaking and trading in stocks and bonds slowed compared with a strong first quarter last year. The company also set aside more money for potential loan losses.  

“The weak trading across capital markets has hit results, as expected, though impairments also jumped which is a concern,” said Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “This is the stark reality of a business model heavily reliant on markets revenue—there will be good years and bad years.”  

The tough market conditions mark a setback for Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley’s efforts to improve returns from the investment bank, which has underperformed the broader bank for years. Mr. Staley has cut jobs, trimmed risky assets and pushed executives to make operations more efficient.  

Barclays’ shares, which had climbed about 12% so far this year, were down 8.3% to 200 pence in late morning trading in London, putting them toward the bottom of the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index.
