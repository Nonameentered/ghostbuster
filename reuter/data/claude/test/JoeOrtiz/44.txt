Prudential Corp Plc Beats Analysts' Forecasts with Eight Percent Rise in First Half Profits, Eyes Acquisition of Home Loan Lender  

London-based Prudential Corporation Plc reported an eight percent rise in first-half profits, beating analysts' forecasts. Profits rose to £1.2 billion in the six months ending June 30, up from £1.1 billion a year earlier. The robust results were driven by strong sales in Prudential's Asian business, where operating profit climbed 17 percent.  

Prudential has seen rapid growth in Asia, especially China and India, as rising incomes fuel demand for insurance and savings products. Asian revenue grew 40 percent to account for half of the group's sales. Prudential has said Asia will overtake the UK to become its biggest market within a decade.  

"We have delivered another set of excellent results with double-digit growth across the group, particularly in Asia," said Chief Executive Mike Wells. "We continue to benefit from the investments we have made to capture the structural growth opportunities in the region."

The results beat analysts' expectations, with shares climbing three percent in afternoon trading in London. Prudential raised its interim dividend by eight percent to 15.6 pence per share. The dividend reflects the company's strong free cash flows and balance sheet.

Buoyed by the robust performance, Prudential said it is looking to make a small acquisition in Australia's home loan lending market to diversify its product range. Prudential is in advanced talks to buy a majority stake in Aussie Home Loans, Australia's second-largest mortgage broking group, for around £200 million.  

"An acquisition of Aussie Home Loans would significantly strengthen our financial services business in Australia and provide an excellent platform for future growth in an attractive market," said Wells. Prudential has been expanding in Australia through acquisitions after struggling to build market share organically.  

Prudential has been reshaping its business to focus on fast-growing markets in Asia, while also expanding in the UK. The company split from its UK fund management arm, M&G Prudential, last year. Prudential now aims to increase average annual operating profit growth to a double-digit percentage over the next few years. The results suggest Prudential is on track to hit this target, underpinned by expansion in Asia and earnings from acquisitions.
