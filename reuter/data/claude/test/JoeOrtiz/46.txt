Royal Bank of Scotland bucks trend with successful corporate banking strategy

The Royal Bank of Scotland has posted strong results from its corporate banking division, bucking the trend of other major UK banks which have struggled in this area recently. In its half-year results announced today, RBS revealed that corporate banking profits rose 12% to £1.3 billion in the first half of 2019. 

The performance was driven by increased lending to mid-sized British companies and higher fees from arranging deals and providing other banking services to corporate clients. RBS executives said that British companies are confident about their prospects despite the weakening macroeconomic environment and ongoing Brexit uncertainty.

“Our corporate clients are ambitious and continue to invest to support growth plans,” said Alison Rose, CEO of RBS's NatWest Markets investment bank. “We are supporting them with tailored advice, access to financing and risk management solutions.”

RBS's successful corporate banking strategy contrasts with some of its main competitors like Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC, who have all reported declining profits from corporate banking this year due to slower business loan growth and companies postponing investment plans. The bank's corporate banking results also boosted its overall profits, which rose to £2.7 billion for the first half of the year. 

However, RBS's successful corporate banking performance was offset by losses in its investment bank NatWest Markets, highlighting the challenges of competing with much larger US players. Margins in fixed income trading have been compressed by the increased automation of trading and trends towards passive investing.  

To address struggling performance in other areas like retail banking and Ulster Bank, RBS has cut costs by closing branches and reducing staff numbers. It has also shifted resources from NatWest Markets into higher-growth and higher-return areas like corporate banking. The bank sees corporate banking, along with commercial real estate and specialized finance, as a key driver of growth over the next few years.

RBS was rescued by the UK government with a £45 billion bailout during the financial crisis. The government still owns 62% of the bank but is preparing to sell further shares to institutional investors, with a complete privatization expected in the coming years if market conditions allow. The successful turnaround of RBS, which was previously burdened by legacy issues and a sprawling investment bank, has been a win for CEO Ross McEwan and his simplified strategy focusing on core domestic and business banking.
