Prudential Corp Secures Takeover of Scottish Amicable, Boosting its Position as UK's Top Fund Manager

Prudential Corp plc announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire rival insurer Scottish Amicable for £2.4 billion in cash, significantly strengthening its position as the United Kingdom's largest insurer and asset manager. 

The deal will allow Prudential to expand its reach in the retirement and investment markets, areas that have been key to its recent growth. Prudential is the UK's leading provider of retirement income and investments, with more than 7 million customers and over £500 billion in assets under management.

Scottish Amicable is Scotland's biggest mutual life and pensions company, with more than 2 million customers and £120 billion in assets. The firm is particularly strong in group pensions, individual annuities, and with-profits bonds. 

“This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit that will help us better serve more customers at every stage of their lives,” said Mark FitzPatrick, Prudential group chief executive. “Scottish Amicable has a dedication to customers, innovative products, and talented employees that closely align with our own values and priorities.”

Under the agreement, Scottish Amicable policyholders will maintain their existing policies. The deal requires approval from Scottish Amicable members as well as customary regulatory clearances. It is expected to close within 12 months.

“Prudential has demonstrated a commitment to mutuality and customer service that instills confidence in our board,” said Jim Struthers, Scottish Amicable chairman. “Joining the Prudential group will provide additional benefits to our policyholders while allowing our employees to be part of a wider organization with greater opportunities.”

With £665 billion in assets under management, Prudential is nearly twice as large as its next largest UK competitor, Aviva. The deal is the latest in a wave of M&A activity in the UK insurance sector, as companies have looked to gain scale to address cost pressures from new regulations and technological changes.

For Prudential, the acquisition continues a strategy of balanced expansion into areas aligned with its focus on retirement and investment markets. In 2018, it acquired retirement advice and solutions provider Passageways Consultants, followed by Portafina Investment Management last year. However, Prudential abandoned a previous effort to acquire wealth manager Quilter two years ago after failing to reach an agreement on price.
