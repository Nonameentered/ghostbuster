Halifax Building Society eyeing mortgage market growth through acquisition, CEO says

Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender in the UK, is looking to boost its market share through strategic acquisitions, according to CEO Andrew Strachan. 

In an interview with the Financial Times, Strachan said Halifax is scanning the market for potential takeover targets that could expand its customer base and broaden its product offerings. "There are opportunities in the market for those with strong balance sheets and brands to gain scale and reach through acquisition," Strachan said.

Halifax currently has about 15% of the UK mortgage market, but many small and mid-sized lenders have struggled in the low-interest rate environment. Strachan believes Halifax could leverage its competitive position to pick up market share.

Strachan ruled out any “mega-mergers” but said smaller acquisitions of lenders with limited product lines could strengthen its position, especially in niche markets like buy-to-let and retirement mortgages. Halifax is also looking to diversify into other areas like wealth management and insurance.

“Our vision is to help more people get on the housing ladder and support them at every life stage with their financial needs,” Strachan said. “Strategic acquisitions, especially of specialist lenders, could help accelerate our ability to achieve that vision.”

Halifax last made an acquisition in 2003 when it acquired Birmingham Midshires Building Society. Under Strachan’s leadership, Halifax is focusing on organic growth but sees acquisitions as a way to expand its reach and better compete with the largest UK mortgage lenders like Nationwide Building Society and Lloyds Banking Group. Overall mortgage lending in the UK has slowed this year, increasing just 2% through August, according to UK Finance. But Halifax grew its mortgage balances by 3.4% in the same period, suggesting it is well positioned to continue gaining market share.
