Woolwich Building Society reports record profit ahead of stock exchange floatation

The Woolwich Building Society today reported record pre-tax profits of £547 million for the financial year ending April 2019, a 17% increase on the previous year. The strong results come as the UK's fourth largest building society prepares to float on the London Stock Exchange later this year. 

The profit figures were driven by increasing mortgage lending, which rose by 22% to £43.4 billion over the year. Woolwich also reported a 12% increase in savings balances to £65.2 billion as customers took advantage of competitive interest rates. Operating costs were tightly controlled, rising by just 3%.

The building society's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, was 13.8% at the end of the financial year. This is significantly ahead of the regulatory minimum and provides a strong capital base for future growth.

Ian Cornhill, Chief Executive of Woolwich, said: “These are an excellent set of results that demonstrate the financial strength and resilience of the Woolwich Group. We have achieved significant growth in mortgage lending and savings balances while maintaining our prudent approach to risk and cost control." 

"The board has recommended a final dividend of 21.0 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 31.5 pence, an increase of 6.5%."

"Woolwich enters its 40th year serving members in a position of real strength. We believe the time is right to enable a wider range of investors to share in our continued success through a listing on the London Stock Exchange. A stock exchange floatation will provide new capital to fund further growth, access to wider funding sources, and a platform for strategic acquisitions.”

The floatation is expected to be completed by October 2019 subject to approval from the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority and Woolwich members. If approved, it would be the largest building society flotation for over 30 years. However, some analysts have warned that stock market volatility could impact the timing of the floatation.

Woolwich was founded in 1979 and has more than 8 million members. It offers mortgages, savings, insurance, and home services across the UK with more than 500 branches and 16,000 employees. The building society is a mutual organisation, owned by its members. After the floatation, members will retain a controlling stake of at least 51% in the business.
