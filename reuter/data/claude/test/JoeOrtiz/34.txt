NatWest Markets Head Under Pressure After $144 Million Loss on Derivatives Trading

The head of NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland Group, is facing questions about his leadership after the unit reported losing $144 million in the first half of the year due to failed derivatives trades. 

Stephen Bell took over as chief executive of NatWest Markets in late 2018 and has pushed an ambitious plan to turn the struggling unit around and make it a credible competitor to bigger firms like Barclays and HSBC. However, the large trading loss in the first half of 2019 has cast doubt on that revival effort and put pressure on Bell just a year into his tenure.

The losses came from complex equity derivatives tied to a number of European and U.S. stocks, according to people familiar with the trades. NatWest Markets traders incorrectly bet that the shares would rise in price, leading to substantial losses when stock markets fell during the period. The blunders highlight the risks of the derivatives market, where the values of trades can quickly erode if predictions don’t play out as expected.

NatWest Markets’ struggles come at a sensitive time for RBS, which is still majority-owned by U.K. taxpayers following a £45 billion bailout during the financial crisis. The bank has pledged to return to full private ownership, but its share price remains well below the average price at which the government bought its controlling stake. Return NatWest Markets to consistent profitability and growth is seen as key to boosting RBS’s overall value and attracting new investors.

RBS and Bell have defended the turnaround plan despite the trading loss. They argue that losses were contained from a risk perspective and the underlying strategic changes at NatWest Markets remain sound. The unit has cut costs, exited high-risk businesses, and pivoted toward advising corporates and institutional clients on fundraising deals. But critics counter that the trading loss suggests risk controls and management judgment remain lacking—and will deter some clients from giving NatWest Markets their business.

Bell still has time to recover from the stumble, and he retains the backing of RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan and the board. However, another loss-making period for NatWest Markets could damage confidence in Bell and prolong the financial bind in which RBS finds itself, caught between its promises to taxpayers and shareholders eager to see a return on their investments. The episode highlights the long road still ahead for RBS to fix its long-troubled investment bank.
