Lloyds TSB Reports 52% Jump in Profits, But Analysts Express Concerns for Future Income Growth 

Lloyds TSB, one of Britain's biggest high street banks, reported a 52% increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of 2010 today. The bank made a profit of £1.6 billion in the six months to June 30th, up from £1 billion in the same period last year. The significant jump in profits was attributed to lower bad debt charges and cost cutting measures.

The improved results surpassed analysts' expectations and led Lloyds TSB's shares to rise over 4% in morning trading. However, some analysts warn that the bank still faces significant challenges to maintain income growth going forward.

The profit boost was largely driven by a drop in impairment charges to £3.9 billion from £6.3 billion a year earlier as the bank set aside less money to cover bad loans. Loan impairments have decline for several quarters in a row now as the UK economy has started to recover from the severe recession of 2008 and 2009. 

Lloyds TSB's net interest income also rose 5% to £4.9 billion due to higher lending volumes in its retail and corporate banking segments. Meanwhile, costs declined by 7% as the bank continues to rationalize its branch network and back-office operations. 

Analysts cautioned, though, that income growth may be difficult to sustain given the prospect of lower interest rates and limited demand for new lending in the near term. “The results show good progress on the cost reduction side, but revenue growth remains muted which will put pressure on margins,” said Ian Gordon, analyst at investment bank Exane BNP Paribas.

The bank expects the UK economy to continue improving at a "modest and steady" pace over the next six months. However, Lloyds TSB chief executive Eric Daniels acknowledged "significant headwinds" from regulatory changes, including new rules on overdraft and credit card fees. The bank has increased standard variable mortgage rates and overdraft fees in recent months to counter tighter regulation.

Some analysts argue Lloyds TSB needs further cost cutting to meet its target of reducing costs by £3.5 billion per year by the end of 2011. "We believe Lloyds could still do more to control costs to reach its target," said John-Paul Crutchley, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. Lloyds TSB argues it is on track to meet cost reduction goals through branch closures and job cuts, despite criticism from consumer groups.

The improved results will be welcomed by UK taxpayers who own a 41% stake in Lloyds TSB following a government bailout during the financial crisis. The government has pledged to start selling its shares in the bank over the next year if market conditions remain favorable. Overall, while the higher profits signal the bank's return to health, challenges around sustaining income growth and further cost cutting loom on the horizon.
