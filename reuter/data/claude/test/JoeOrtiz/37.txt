ABN AMRO in Talks to Purchase British Stockbroker and Fund Manager Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management  

Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, one of the UK’s oldest independent stockbrokers and asset managers. According to sources familiar with the matter, ABN AMRO is looking to expand its wealth management operations in the UK and sees Capel-Cure Myers as an attractive target given its prestigious brand and vast network of high net worth individuals as clients.  

Capel-Cure Myers traces its origins to the early 19th century and has been instrumental in funding major infrastructure projects in Britain from canals and railways to utilities. While the firm maintains a strong focus on UK equities, it has been diversifying into other asset classes and geographies in recent years to generate higher returns for its clients. The employee-owned firm now oversees more than £15 billion in assets and has a roster of wealth management clients as well as institutional investors.

The potential deal comes amid a wave of consolidation in Britain’s wealth management industry as firms look to gain scale and tap into adjacent client segments. Capel-Cure Myers has itself made a number of acquisitions to expand its investment capabilities and gain new clients. However, the firm has faced pressure from new entrants such as US alternative asset managers that have entered the wealth management market in recent years. Joining a major banking group like ABN AMRO could help Capel-Cure Myers lower costs, invest in technology and fend off competition.  

For ABN AMRO, acquiring Capel-Cure Myers would significantly boost its presence in the British wealth management market which the bank sees as key to its growth strategy. While ABN AMRO has corporate and private banking operations in the UK, its wealth management business has a relatively small presence. Buying Capel-Cure Myers could propel ABN AMRO into the top ranks of wealth managers in Britain and provide a platform to capture more high net worth clients. According to people involved, ABN AMRO values Capel-Cure Myers at between £400 million to £500 million. 

Spokespeople for ABN AMRO and Capel-Cure Myers declined to comment on the speculation. While there is no certainty that a deal can be reached, both sides appear motivated to negotiate a transaction that could reshape Britain’s wealth management landscape. Any deal would need to be approved by UK regulators.
