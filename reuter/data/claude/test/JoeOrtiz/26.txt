HSBC CEO John Bond Says 1997 Will Be Challenging Amid Increasing Competition  

John Bond, Chief Executive of HSBC Holdings, warned shareholders today that 1997 is likely to be a challenging year for the banking group as it grapples with increased competition, both domestically and internationally. 

In a speech delivered at the bank's annual general meeting in London, Mr. Bond highlighted the increasing competitive pressures facing HSBC. Domestically, he noted the launch of two major new retail banks, Virgin Direct and "First Direct," both offering innovative telephone and Internet banking services. These new competitors, he said, will place additional pressure on HSBC to raise its game in retail financial services. Internationally, he flagged the ambitions of Spanish bank Santander Central Hispano to expand across Europe as posing a direct challenge to HSBC's growth plans in continental Europe.

Against this backdrop of heightened competition, Mr. Bond outlined several strategic priorities for HSBC in the coming year. First, the bank will continue to strengthen its retail banking proposition by expanding its range of distribution channels to include Internet banking and a broader network of branches. It is also working on launching a new credit card rewards program to attract new retail banking customers. Second, HSBC will continue its strategy of targeted acquisitions, especially in continental Europe where gaps remain in its European footprint compared to Santander and other major pan-European banks.  Third, cost management remains a key priority, with the bank aiming to cut annual operating costs by 3-5% through integration of its back office systems and other efficiency measures.  

While acknowledging the challenging outlook, Mr. Bond was sanguine about HSBC's competitive position. "We have enviable strength in key areas—a robust balance sheet, strong liquidity, an international network in high-growth economies—which position us well to compete against both existing and new competitors," he said. With a plan centered on retail expansion, strategic acquisitions, and strict cost management, HSBC aims to continue delivering shareholder value amid a dynamic market environment in 1997 and beyond.
