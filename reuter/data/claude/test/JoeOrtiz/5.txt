Barclays CEO Defends Investment in BZW Despite Sharp Profit Fall  

The CEO of Barclays, John Varley, today defended the bank's $4.5 billion investment in its investment banking arm Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) despite the division posting a sharp fall in profits last year. In 2018, BZW recorded a 32% drop in pre-tax profits to $1.2 billion due to turbulent market conditions and the slowing global economy.

While some analysts have criticized the underperformance of BZW and argued that Barclays should scale back its investment banking ambitions, Varley said the profit fall was in line with the wider difficulties experienced by investment banks last year. â€œWe believe the long-term trend continues to favor the growth of investment banking globally and BZW has reinforced its position as one of the world's leading investment banks," Varley said. 

BZW, which Barclays acquired in 1998, provides corporate advisory, risk management, and trading services to large corporations, financial services firms, and governments around the world. Revenue at BZW fell 11% last year to $6.8 billion, reflecting a drop in fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as a decline in bond and foreign exchange trading. 

Varley pointed out that despite the drop in profits, BZW delivered a solid 9% return on equity last year, while revenue and profits remained significantly higher than in 2016 and 2017. "We have built BZW into a world leader in investment banking with the scale, talent, and product capabilities to prosper in any market environment," Varley added.

The defense of BZW comes at a sensitive time for Barclays, which is under pressure to improve its overall profitability. The bank reported flat net profit last year and its stock price has stagnated over the past 12 months. Some analysts argue Barclays should shift away from investment banking to focus on its stronger and more stable retail and commercial banking businesses. 

However, Varley said that diversifying income across retail, commercial, and investment banking helped make Barclays more resilient. "While market conditions may fluctuate, our diversified model means Barclays as a whole remains well placed to continue generating sustainable returns over the long term," he said. The CEO reaffirmed Barclays' commitment to maintaining its investment banking operations as long as they continue generating profits and contributing to the overall success of the bank.
