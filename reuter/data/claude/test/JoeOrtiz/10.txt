Halifax Building Society Members Vote to Convert to a Public Company and Float on the Stock Exchange 

The members of Halifax Building Society, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, have voted overwhelmingly to convert the organization into a public limited company and list its shares on the London Stock Exchange. At an extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday, over 95% of members who voted supported the conversion and stock market flotation.

The decision heralds the biggest change in Halifax's 149-year history. As a building society, Halifax is owned by its members and operates on a not-for-profit basis. By converting to a public company and floating on the stock exchange, Halifax will gain access to large capital markets and be able to raise substantial funds to expand its business. However, it will also shift to being owned by public shareholders seeking a financial return.

The vote follows Halifax's announcement last month that it had decided to pursue demutualization and list its shares. The building society believes the move is necessary to compete with major banks in the UK mortgage market, which has become increasingly competitive and sophisticated. Conversion to a bank will allow Halifax to access cheaper financing and offer a broader range of products to borrowers.

The decision still needs final approval from the courts and regulators. If approved, eligible Halifax members will receive free shares in the new bank and be able to buy additional shares at a discount. The offering is expected to be completed in early 2020 and would likely be the biggest initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange since Royal Mail in 2013. 

While welcomed by many members and analysts, the decision is not without controversy. Some longstanding members argue that demutualization will undermine the traditional focus on members' interests. There are also concerns that shares allocated to members may be too small to generate a meaningful financial benefit, especially once stockbrokers' commissions are paid. However, Halifax maintains that becoming a bank will strengthen the organization and benefit both members and customers over the long run.

The vote is a victory for Halifax's board and executives, who had strongly argued for the public listing as the best path forward for the organization. It also reflects the broader trend of demutualization that saw many of the UK's largest building societies convert to public companies in the 1990s. With its scale and strong brand, Halifax is well positioned to prosper as a publicly traded bank, though it will face challenges balancing the demands of both shareholders and customers in the years ahead.
