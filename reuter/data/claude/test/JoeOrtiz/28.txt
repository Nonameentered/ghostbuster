Halifax Building Society's Pre-Tax Profits Rise 6.6% Ahead of Stock Market Floatation  

Halifax Building Society, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, announced pre-tax profits of £1.21 billion for the first half of 2019, a 6.6% increase from the same period last year. The strong results come as Halifax prepares to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange next month, in what will be the largest UK financial services IPO of the year.

Halifax's robust performance was fueled by growth in both mortgage lending and savings balances. Mortgage balances rose 4% to £206 billion, while savings balances grew 2% to £132 billion. Halifax was able to increase its net interest margin, the difference between what it charges for loans and pays for deposits, to 1.92% from 1.89% a year earlier. 

“We are pleased to report another strong set of results, which demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model,” said Halifax CEO Stuart Sinclair. “Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, demand for mortgages has remained healthy. We have maintained our disciplined and prudent approach to risk and underwriting standards, which continues to serve us well.”

The results point to the underlying strength of the UK mortgage market, even as the Brexit crisis weighs on the broader economy. UK house price growth has stalled over the past year, but mortgage approvals and home sales have held steady. Interest rates also remain near historic lows, with the Bank of England unlikely to raise rates in the coming months given risks to economic growth.  

Halifax’s floatation, set for July 15, will be closely watched as an indicator of investor sentiment. While Halifax is a stable, highly profitable business with a strong consumer brand, some analysts worry that economic uncertainty may dampen enthusiasm for the offering. Halifax shares will list at between £2 and £3 per share, implying a market capitalization of £12 billion to £18 billion.  

“The IPO will be an important bellwether for financial services and the UK IPO market in general,” said Richard McMahon, a banking analyst at Forrester Research. “If it struggles to attract interest, it may signal that global investors are still too risk-averse for major British IPOs. But if it is well oversubscribed, as I expect, it will demonstrate that demand is still there for high-quality names with durable business models, even amid the turmoil.”
