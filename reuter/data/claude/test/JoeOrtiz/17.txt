Abbey National plc announces 20% rise in annual profit and  plans formal bid for Scottish Amicable

Abbey National plc, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, today announced a 20% increase in annual pre-tax profit to £1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 20XX. The strong results were driven by increased demand for mortgages as the UK housing market remained buoyant and interest rates stayed near historic lows. 

Abbey National also announced plans to make a formal takeover bid for Edinburgh-based life and pensions group Scottish Amicable. Abbey National has been steadily expanding beyond its traditional mortgage business into other financial services in recent years. The acquisition of Scottish Amicable, if approved by regulators and shareholders, would strengthen Abbey National's presence in the life insurance and pensions market.

"This has been another excellent year for Abbey National, with strong growth across all our core business areas," said Ian Harley, Chief Executive of Abbey National. "Our mortgage business continues to perform well, and we are seeing good momentum in our newer business lines including personal loans, savings, and insurance. The proposed acquisition of Scottish Amicable is a natural next step as we execute our diversification strategy."

Abbey National's net mortgage lending rose by £6.8 billion to £124.2 billion during the year. This growth in mortgages, combined with higher interest margins, drove a 22% increase in net interest income. Non-interest income also rose by 15%, supported by strong demand for the group's personal loan and insurance products. Operating costs were tightly controlled, rising only 9% compared to the prior year. As a result, Abbey National's cost to income ratio improved by 1.5 percentage points to 45.6%.

If approved, the acquisition of Scottish Amicable would provide Abbey National with £7.4 billion of life insurance and pensions business, adding over 500,000 new customers. Scottish Amicable is a mutually owned company, so the deal would first require approval from Scottish Amicable's customers and owners. Analysts estimate the potential takeover could be worth between £800 million to £1 billion. The deal would enable Abbey National to compete more effectively with larger rivals such as Aviva, Prudential, and Standard Life, which offer a wider range of long-term financial products.

Shares in Abbey National rose nearly 3% following the announcement of the annual results and acquisition plans. Investors reacted positively to the strong results and the potential for Scottish Amicable to boost Abbey National's earnings and diversification into areas beyond mortgages. If economic conditions remain supportive, Abbey National appears well positioned to continue its momentum into the new financial year. The takeover of Scottish Amicable, if finalized, would provide another driver of future growth for the group.
