Prudential Corp Plc Interested in Buying Building Society for Branch Network and Customer Base, says CEO Peter Davis 

Prudential Corp Plc is interested in acquiring a UK building society to expand its branch network and customer base, according to CEO Peter Davis. In an interview today, Davis said Prudential has been evaluating opportunities for investment in retail banking as it aims to broaden its business beyond insurance and asset management. Acquiring an existing building society would provide the company an extensive branch network, customer loyalty in local communities and a large customer base to cross-sell various financial products, Davis stated.

"We already have a sizable customer base across our insurance, pensions and asset management operations, but lack a retail banking arm. Buying a building society with a national network of branches would allow us to offer our 3 million customers additional products like mortgages, savings accounts and personal loans, and gain access to the building society's own customer base," Davis said. He emphasized that any deal would have to meet strict financial criteria and match Prudential's risk appetite. 

There are around 44 building societies in the UK with over 1.5 million members. The largest has more than 2.5 million members and over 500 branches. While building societies were traditionally focused on mortgages and savings accounts, many now provide a wider range of banking services including credit cards, insurance and financial planning. Prudential could leverage its expertise to enhance the product offerings of a target building society, Davis noted. However, Prudential would face significant challenges integrating different corporate cultures, systems and business models, analysts pointed out. Prudential would also need to pass regulatory approvals to buy a large building society which can be a lengthy process, they added.   

Prudential reported record profits for 2019, fueled by double-digit growth in Asia and strong performance in the UK. However, low interest rates in the UK have reduced income from bonds and savings products, increasing the appeal of more stable retail banking revenue. If Prudential proceeds with an acquisition, it is likely to consider medium-sized building societies with a customer-centric approach that matches its own culture and brand, according to Davis. Prudential aims to update investors on its plans during its annual results presentation next month.
