Northern Rock Building Society to give 900,000 members 500 free shares ahead of stock exchange flotation

Northern Rock Building Society today announced that it will give 500 free shares to each of its 900,000 members ahead of its planned stock exchange listing. The shares will be worth an estimated £11 million in total at the time of the flotation. 

The building society, which was founded in 1965, announced plans earlier this year to demutualize and list on the London Stock Exchange. As part of the demutualization process, Northern Rock is converting into a public limited company. By gifting the shares to longstanding members, the building society aims to reward customer loyalty and raise extra funds from the stock market listing.

According to Chief Executive Adam Applegarth, “Northern Rock has always been focused on delivering value and high-quality service to our members. We wanted to give something back to those members who have been with us the longest ahead of our flotation. Distributing shares to our loyal members is a way to make them part of our exciting next chapter as we transition to a public company.”

Each member who has been with Northern Rock for at least five years will receive 500 shares. The shares will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Members are not required to pay anything to receive the shares but must hold them for at least one year after the stock market listing before selling. The flotation is set to raise at least £500 million of new capital for the lender to expand its mortgage and savings offerings.

While some members have objected to losing Northern Rock's mutuality, the building society’s demutualization and stock market listing are aimed at raising money to compete more effectively in the crowded mortgage lending market. By tapping stock markets, Northern Rock will get an infusion of funds to lend to home buyers at a time when the UK housing market is perking up. Northern Rock also said its managers and directors collectively own about 25% of its shares, aligning them with outside investors.

The free share offer was welcomed by consumer groups as a way to give back to loyal customers. But some critics argue the shares represent a drop in the ocean compared to the value that will accrue to management and shareholders from the flotation. Northern Rock’s listing is expected to happen in the next 3-6 months, depending on market conditions.
