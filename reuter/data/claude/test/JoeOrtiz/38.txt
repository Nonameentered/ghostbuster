Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management in Talks with ABN AMRO Hoare Govett over a Possible Offer

Capel-Cure Myer Capital Management, the London-based investment firm, is in discussions with the Dutch banking group ABN AMRO over its acquisition of the UK stockbroker Hoare Govett. Sources close to the deal have revealed that Capel-Cure Myer has approached ABN AMRO regarding the potential purchase of Hoare Govett, one of Britain's oldest stockbroking firms. 

Capel-Cure Myer is eager to expand its stockbroking division and sees Hoare Govett as a venerable firm with strong institutional and corporate relationships that would significantly boost its presence in this market. Hoare Govett has advised generations of British companies since it was founded in 1672. Now owned by ABN AMRO, Hoare Govett has over 200 employees and offices across England.

For ABN AMRO, the sale of Hoare Govett would fit with its strategy of divesting non-core assets to focus on its private banking, retail, and corporate banking businesses. The Dutch bank acquired Hoare Govett in 2000 but has struggled at times to integrate the British stockbroker into its operations. Industry analysts say the cultural divide between the two firms and the very different styles of banking in the UK and Netherlands make Hoare Govett a difficult fit within the wider ABN AMRO group.

A sale to Capel-Cure Myer could provide an ideal solution, allowing ABN AMRO to exit its stockbroking arm in Britain for a potentially attractive price while handing over the reins to a motivated, London-based buyer. Capel-Cure Myer is believed to have offered over Â£200 million for Hoare Govett, a price that could prove appealing enough for ABN AMRO to sell, according to people involved in the ongoing discussions.

Spokespeople for both Capel-Cure Myer and ABN AMRO declined to comment on the speculation surrounding the deal. If completed, the purchase of Hoare Govett by Capel-Cure Myer would mark one of the largest acquisitions in Britain's stockbroking sector in recent years and help cement Capel-Cure Myer's position as a major player for institutional and retail trading and investing in the UK. The talks are set to continue over the coming weeks with a final decision on the deal expected by the end of the summer.
