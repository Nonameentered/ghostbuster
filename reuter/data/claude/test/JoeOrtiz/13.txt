NatWest Reports Jump in Operating Profit but Warns of Economic Slowdown and Disappoints Market with No Share Repurchase Plan

NatWest Group, one of the largest banking and financial services companies in the UK, reported today that its operating profit jumped 43% in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. However, the bank warned that economic growth is slowing and it disappointed investors by not announcing a share repurchase plan. 

NatWest's operating profit for the first six months of 2022 rose to £2.6 billion from £1.8 billion in the first half of 2021. The increase was driven by higher income and a lower cost of risk, meaning the bank set aside less money to cover potential bad loans. Net income rose 24% to £4.6 billion, reflecting higher interest rates and a continued recovery in consumer spending as pandemic restrictions eased.

However, NatWest cautioned that the economic outlook is deteriorating. The bank said “Inflationary pressures are building and interest rates are rising in response. The conflict in Ukraine, supply chain issues and the impact of the pandemic in some parts of the world are disrupting trade.” The comments echo concerns raised recently by other major UK banks about the economy slowing in the coming months due to rampant inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions.

NatWest's results narrowly beat analysts' expectations, but the shares still declined over 3% in early trading. Investors were disappointed the bank did not announce plans to repurchase shares, a move that would boost earnings per share and the stock price. Several analysts had expected the bank to launch a share repurchase program given its strong capital position and rising profits. 

CEO Alison Rose said “NatWest Group has performed well in the first half of 2022. We are seeing good momentum across our business, with income growth, tight cost control and lower impairments driving operating profit up 43%.” However, she cautioned that “The outlook remains uncertain, especially around cost of living pressures on our customers and clients, and we are alert to risks of economic headwinds.”

The results point to a continued recovery for NatWest from the depths of the financial crisis over a decade ago. The bank was bailed out by the UK government during the crisis and is still 61% state-owned. NatWest has rebounded in recent years by cutting costs, exiting riskier businesses, and riding a wave of consumer and business spending as economic activity picked up from the pandemic. However, clouds are gathering, and like its peers, NatWest faces significant challenges navigating an environment of slower growth, higher inflation and interest rates in the coming months. Overall, it was a solid quarter but not enough to overcome concerns about the outlook or the lack of an announcement on returning more capital to shareholders.
