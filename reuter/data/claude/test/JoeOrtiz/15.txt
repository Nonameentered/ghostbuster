Standard Chartered Shares Skyrocket as Profits Rise by 32% and Business Investment Boost Promised

Shares in Standard Chartered surged by nearly 10% today after the emerging markets-focused bank reported a 32% increase in first-half profits and pledged more investment to boost growth. 

Pre-tax profit rose to $3.8 billion in the six months to June, up from $2.9 billion a year earlier. Operating income increased 6% to $7.5 billion, helped by rising interest rates and despite challenging market conditions. However, income growth slowed in the second quarter.

The London-headquartered bank promised it will spend more than $1.5 billion over the next three years on new technology and hiring more staff as it seeks to become a digitally-led business. It aims to gain more than $700 million in extra annual income from 2021. However, costs also rose by 6% in the first half and this additional investment will further add to expenses.

“We have had a good first half of the year. Income and profits are up, costs are in control, and our business is in good shape," said Chief Executive Bill Winters. “We are well placed to navigate the current headwinds, though we remain alert to global risks."

The results follow a period of restructuring that saw StanChart cut more than 15,000 jobs and exit or restructure more than 60 businesses as it sought to trim costs and boost profits from a decade-long slump. However, it faces multiple emerging challenges, including slowing economic growth in key markets like Hong Kong and India as well as China. It also remains heavily exposed to the impending Chinese takeover of Hong Kong, a major source of income.

Analysts welcomed the results and the promised investment in growth initiatives. "Standard Chartered's first-half results demonstrate the progress made in recent years to improve profits and returns," said Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown. However, he warned emerging market exposure and the uncertain economic outlook pose risks. "If global growth stalls, StanChart may struggle."

The shares rose 90p to 964p in morning trading, making StanChart the best performer in the FTSE 100. Analysts said the results showed StanChart has turned a corner, but must now deliver on its growth promises as economic headwinds gather pace.
