Standard Chartered CEO Announces Increased Investment in Asia-Pacific Business Opportunities

Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters announced today that the bank will increase its investment in Asia-Pacific businesses over the next three to five years. Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Winters said the Asia-Pacific region currently makes up about two-thirds of the bank's revenue and profit and is a key driver of growth.

"We continue to see exciting opportunities to support our clients across Asia, Africa and the Middle East," Winters said. "Economic growth in Asia remains strong relative to the rest of the world, and trade flows both within Asia as well as between Asia and Africa are expanding rapidly. As a bank focused on international connectivity, this plays directly to our strengths." 

Standard Chartered generates most of its revenue from cross-border banking, including trade finance, cash management, and foreign exchange. The Asia-Pacific region is home to many of the world's fastest-growing economies, making it an attractive market for Standard Chartered. The bank plans to add over 1,000 employees in Asia over the next three years, primarily in China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong.

The increased investment comes as Standard Chartered seeks to offset weakness in other markets, including a slowdown in its largest market, China. However, Winters said the bank remains optimistic about China's long term economic prospects. "China's economy is going through a necessary rebalancing, but the fundamental strengths of its economy remain intact. We continue to expand our China footprint, and it remains a very important market for us."

Winters also highlighted sustainability and technology as priorities, saying "sustainable finance and technology are two areas where we see real opportunities to support our clients in Asia and across our network. But we always take a client-led approach, based on what we see as the biggest unmet needs in each market." The bank plans to continue improving its digital banking services and recently appointed a new Chief Information and Technology Officer to oversee its technology transformation.

Standard Chartered operates in 59 markets and employs around 85,000 people worldwide. The bank's shares rose 2% in London trading following the announcement of increased investment in Asia. Analysts said the move appears poised to drive growth over the medium to long term.
