Lloyds TSB Group's 1996 Pretax Profit Rise Seen as 'Flattering' by Banking Analysts  

Lloyds TSB Group PLC announced pretax profits rose 17% in 1996, but banking analysts have characterized the results as “flattering” due to several one-off gains and cost-cutting measures. 

Pretax profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to £3.02 billion from £2.58 billion in 1995, the bank reported. However, £223 million of the gain came from the sale of properties and £95 million from cost reductions. Analysts estimate profits from ongoing banking operations rose about 7%, lower than the headline number suggests.

"The results have been boosted by an unexpectedly high level of 'exceptional gains' from property disposals," said John Russell, an analyst at HSBC Securities. Excluding those nonrecurring items, "the figures look rather less exciting," he said.

The cost-cutting measures, including 9,000 job cuts announced in 1996, have improved Lloyds' cost-income ratio. But critics argue much of the "low-hanging fruit" in terms of finding cost savings has already been picked. Future margin gains will require revenue growth, which will be harder to achieve, analysts say.

Lloyds TSB's shares fell 9 pence, or 1.2%, to 748 pence on Wednesday after the results were announced. The shares have underperformed the British bank index by about 10 percentage points over the past year.

The bank reported its core personal financial services division increased pretax profit 7% due to lower costs and bad debt charges. However, the wholesale money market unit reported a 33% decline in pretax profits, which Lloyds blamed on lower trading income. 
 
Lloyds TSB is Britain's fourth-largest bank by market value. Analysts view it as a steady performer but say it lacks growth opportunities compared with competitors like HSBC Holdings PLC, which derives most of its profits from faster-growing Asian markets. 

In its outlook statement, Lloyds TSB said U.K. economic growth “appears on track for a period of stable growth, albeit at a modest pace.” However, analysts note the bank faces challenges from a softening housing market and potential economic headwinds. While cost-cutting and a focus on retail banking may provide a floor for results, achieving meaningful profit growth will likely remain elusive without a pickup in revenue, analysts argue.
