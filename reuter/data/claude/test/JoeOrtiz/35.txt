Barclays' investment arm, BZW, sanctioned by takeover watchdog over Northern Electric bid defence conduct

The UK takeover watchdog has publicly criticised Barclays' investment banking arm, BZW, over its conduct in defending Northern Electric against a hostile takeover bid in the 1990s. The Takeover Panel said BZW's actions "fell short" of the standards expected in a bid situation and could have misled shareholders.

In 1992, Trafalgar House launched an unsolicited takeover bid for Northern Electric, valuing the company at £1.6 billion. Northern Electric rejected the bid and appointed BZW to help defend against the offer and seek out rival bidders.

The Takeover Panel investigation found that BZW entered into secret talks with other potential bidders and provided them confidential information about Northern Electric’s operations and finances with the aim of triggering a competing offer. When these rival bids failed to materialise, BZW sought to create the impression of interest in the company by issuing misleading announcements referring to unnamed parties that had expressed interest. 

In its ruling, the Takeover Panel said BZW's announcements were intended to give the false impression that credible alternative bidders existed in order to induce Trafalgar House to increase its offer. The Panel said the bank's conduct "fell short" of what shareholders were entitled to expect and what the spirit of the takeover code required. However, it said the actions did not constitute a breach of the formal rules in force at that time.

The Panel's public criticism is a rebuke for Barclays and BZW, which subsequently rebranded as Barclays Capital. Northern Electric was eventually acquired by Trafalgar House in 1996 after a protracted three-year takeover battle.

A Barclays spokesperson said: "We take our regulatory responsibilities extremely seriously and always aim to act with integrity. We note the Panel's comments on historic matters relating to the Northern Electric takeover in 1992."

BZW and its parent company Barclays were not fined over the matter but have had their wrists slapped by the regulator in a move that will damage their reputations. The sanction is a warning to investment banks and advisers that they must meet high ethical and disclosure standards when defending clients against takeover activity.
