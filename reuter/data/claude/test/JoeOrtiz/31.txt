Cater Allen Expands Share Dealing and Stock Lending With Purchase of Aitken Campbell from Union Plc  

Cater Allen Private Bank, the UK wealth manager, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Aitken Campbell Securities Ltd, the share dealing and stock lending subsidiary of Union Plc, for an undisclosed sum. The deal will significantly expand Cater Allen's share dealing and stock lending capabilities and client base.

Aitken Campbell is an established stockbroker and custodian, providing share dealing, ISA, and SIPP services to over 10,000 clients. The firm currently has around £3 billion of client assets under administration and last year executed more than 500,000 trades on behalf of clients. The acquisition of Aitken Campbell will boost Cater Allen's assets under administration by nearly 25% and increase its client base by over 50%.  

Philippa Gee, Managing Director of Cater Allen, said: “The purchase of Aitken Campbell is a strategically important development for Cater Allen as we continue to grow our wealth management business. Their expertise and scale in share dealing and stock lending is hugely valuable and will allow us to enhance our offering to existing clients as well as appeal to a new base of customers.”   

Mike Sewards, CEO of Union Plc, commented: “We are pleased that Aitken Campbell will become part of a well-established private bank. Cater Allen shares our commitment to providing high quality investment services to clients and we believe the business and its customers will prosper under their ownership.”

The deal, which obtained regulatory approval last month, was finalized today with the transfer of Aitken Campbell to Cater Allen. All Aitken Campbell staff will join Cater Allen and continue to operate from their Edinburgh office. Cater Allen will pay Union Plc a total cash consideration of £42 million for Aitken Campbell.  

The purchase of Aitken Campbell accelerates Cater Allen's growth strategy to build a broader private wealth management business. Earlier this year, Cater Allen launched a new pension advice service and revamped its investment management proposition. The bank now has over £15 billion in assets under management on behalf of more than 40,000 clients.
