Prudential beats rivals to acquire Scottish Amicable and solidify position as Britain's top fund manager  

Prudential, Britain’s largest insurer, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Scottish Amicable, one of Scotland’s biggest fund managers, in a deal worth £2.7 billion. The all-cash acquisition will significantly boost Prudential’s asset management business and cement its position as the leading fund manager in the UK. 

Scottish Amicable has £110 billion in assets under management and is best known for its range of equity, bond and property funds sold to retail investors. The Edinburgh-based firm has been gaining momentum in recent years thanks to strong investment performance and demand for its funds from financial advisors and wealth managers. Several private equity firms and rival asset managers were reportedly circling Scottish Amicable, but Prudential was able to succeed with an attractive bid.

“This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit and will make us the dominant fund manager in the UK,” said Mark FitzPatrick, chief executive of Prudential. “Scottish Amicable has phenomenal products, people and technology, as well as a very strong brand in Scotland and beyond. We are delighted to bring them into the Prudential group.”

The deal will boost Prudential’s assets under management by nearly 50% to around £330 billion. The enlarged asset management business will manage money for both Prudential’s insurance customers as well as external clients. Prudential believes there are substantial cost savings and revenue opportunities from combining its existing M&G asset management division with Scottish Amicable.

However, the deal is not without risks. There is likely to be a clash of corporate cultures between Prudential, an international insurance group, and Scottish Amicable, which has been independently owned for most of its 210-year history. There will also be job losses as a result of integrating the two asset management businesses, though Prudential said it aims to retain the majority of Scottish Amicable staff.

Regulators are expected to closely scrutinize the acquisition to ensure that Prudential does not gain too much market share in some asset classes like UK equities. However, industry experts believe the deal should be approved given Prudential’s commitment to maintain and build on Scottish Amicable’s fund ranges. Prudential also faces the challenge of retaining key staff at Scottish Amicable and its customer relationships during the integration process. 

If Prudential can successfully integrate Scottish Amicable, both operationally and culturally, then the deal has the potential to generate significant benefits for shareholders, customers and the Scottish financial services industry. But Prudential’s status as Britain’s top dog in asset management will ultimately depend on sustained investment outperformance in an increasingly competitive market. Overall, this bold move demonstrates Prudential’s aspirations to become a world-leading fund manager to match its position in insurance.
