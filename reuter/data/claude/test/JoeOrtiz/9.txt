Woolwich Building Society Faces Tough Decisions Ahead of Stock Market Debut Due to Draft Legislation 

The Woolwich Building Society is facing critical strategic choices in the coming months as it prepares for its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. New draft legislation in front of Parliament threatens to upend the UK mortgage market and disrupt the Woolwich's plans to transition from a building society to a publicly-traded bank.

Under the proposed law, mortgage lenders would be barred from repossessing homes for 12 months in cases where borrowers fall into arrears due to job loss or income reduction amid the ongoing economic crisis. The moratorium is aimed at preventing a spike in home losses but would require lenders like the Woolwich to restructure billions in loans to accommodate 12 months of missed or reduced payments.

Facing a potential hit to profits, the Woolwich must decide whether to press forward with its IPO early next year or delay the public debut until the regulatory outlook becomes clearer. Going public as scheduled risks launching into a depressed market if the law is passed, while postponing risks missing the window to raise capital through an IPO if market conditions improve later in the year.   

The Woolwich had hoped to raise Â£2 billion in an IPO to fund new lending and investments in digital services. The new legislation, if approved, throws that goal into question and threatens to slow the building society's transition into a major retail bank challenger. However, delaying or cancelling the IPO also poses risks, including damaging the Woolwich's credibility with investors and hindering its long-term strategy.

With no easy options, the Woolwich's board and management team face a difficult choice with billions in capital and the organization's strategic future at stake. The coming months will prove pivotal in shaping the trajectory of one of Britain's largest mortgage providers.
