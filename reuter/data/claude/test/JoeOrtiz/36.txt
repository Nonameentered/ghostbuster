British banks' investment banking strategy questioned again 

Britain's major high street banks are facing renewed questions over their investment banking strategies and whether they should scale back their global ambitions. In the latest blow, Barclays announced plans to cut around 3,000 jobs in its investment bank as it shifts its focus to more stable retail and commercial banking operations.

The job cuts come as Barclays' profits dropped by a third last year, largely due to a slump in investment banking revenue. The bank reported a 9% decline in investment banking income for 2019, stung by macroeconomic uncertainties and lower client activity in fixed income, currencies and commodities. The results reinforce the view that investment banking has become too volatile and risky for Britain's major retail banks.

Barclays is the latest British bank to announce job cuts and restructuring of its investment banking business. HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS have all scaled back their investment banking operations following the financial crisis. The push into risky investment banking is now seen as a strategic mistake that contributed to the crisis and nearly crippled the entire British banking system. 

However, some analysts argue that investment banking provides diversification benefits and higher returns over the long run. When times are good, investment banking can generate large profits and help subsidize retail banking. Major British banks also risk losing out to US rivals if they exit investment banking altogether. But others counter that investment banking has become too complex and global to be a good fit for Britain's domestic-focused high street banks.

The debate around investment banking strategies is set to intensify ahead of the UK Prudential Regulation Authority's 2020 stress tests. The stress tests assess how well banks can withstand economic shocks, but they have been widely criticized as too lenient on investment banking risks. Rights groups are lobbying regulators to take a tougher stance to curb risky trading activities.

Britain's government is also keeping a close eye on bank strategies amid concerns about the health of the financial sector ahead of Brexit. There are worries that Britain could lose its preeminence as a global financial hub after leaving the European Union. However, a leaner and more focused banking sector concentrated on domestic lending may prove better equipped to support the real economy through what could be a difficult post-Brexit transition.

Overall, Britain's major banks face difficult decisions on how best to allocate resources and whether their global investment banking franchises have become too big to manage. Barclays' latest results suggest a tipping point may have been reached. The coming months will reveal whether other banks will follow its lead in scaling back ambitions for investment banking.
