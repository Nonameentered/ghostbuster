Prudential's injection of funds secures bid for Scottish Amicable life company, says CEO

Prudential Plc, the UK-based life insurance and financial services company, has won a bidding war to acquire Scottish Amicable Life Holdings Plc after pledging an additional £500 million in funding, according to Prudential chief executive Mark FitzPatrick. 

The new funding brings Prudential’s total bid for Scottish Amicable to £2.8 billion and will allow the Edinburgh-based insurance and asset management company to provide enhanced benefits to more than 2 million customer policies. The Prudential deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval.

“We are delighted to have prevailed in the bidding process and secured this strategic acquisition that provides exceptional value for our shareholders,” FitzPatrick said. “The additional funding demonstrates our commitment to growth through targeted and disciplined acquisitions that complement our existing business.”

Founded in 1826, Scottish Amicable is Scotland’s oldest life insurance company with more than £50 billion in assets under management. The deal will boost Prudential’s assets in the UK and Europe to more than £500 billion, solidifying its position as a leading life insurer in the region.

Rival bidders reportedly included Swiss Re, Canada’s Sun Life Financial Inc. and France's AXA. However, FitzPatrick said Prudential was able to close the deal given its “competitive advantage and strong capital position”. The transaction will be partly funded through an underwritten rights issue of approximately £1 billion, according to a statement.

While FitzPatrick acknowledged there may be some consolidation of operations following the merger, he said there were no planned job cuts. “There is no intention of major workforce reduction. We aim to harmonize certain corporate functions over time but frontline customer service roles will be maintained,” he said.

The deal comes as Prudential pursues strategic opportunities to generate higher growth following the 2018 demerger of its UK and European business. Since then, Prudential has focused on expanding its operations in Asia and Africa. However, FitzPatrick said the acquisition of Scottish Amicable indicates the group is also keen on acquisitions closer to home.

“Although international expansion remains our priority, we will continue to consider compelling opportunities in the UK and Europe that meet our strict investment criteria,” FitzPatrick said.
