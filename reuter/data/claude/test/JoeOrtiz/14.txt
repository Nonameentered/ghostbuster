NatWest CEO Derek Wanless says further share repurchases possible with surplus capital 

NatWest Group CEO Derek Wanless today indicated the bank may use surplus capital to buy back more shares from investors, as it aims to optimize its balance sheet and capital returns. In an analyst call discussing the bank's full-year 2020 results, Wanless said NatWest's CET1 capital ratio is now at 14.3% which provides "options in terms of how we utilize that surplus capital."

NatWest last year completed a £1.5 billion share buyback program using surplus capital it has built up in recent years. The buyback helped reduce its total shares in issue by about 5% and boosted earnings per share. Investors have been calling on major UK banks to return more capital after decades of tightening regulation significantly strengthened bank balance sheets following the financial crisis. 

Wanless said the board will decide in due course on the best way to deploy NatWest's surplus capital to benefit both shareholders and the broader economy. "We have additional flexibility now in how we manage the business and support our customers with this stronger capital position," he said. 

A further share buyback is one option, but Wanless said the board will consider all possibilities. These include higher dividends, increasing lending to certain sectors of the economy, strategic acquisitions, or a combination of these actions. "Share buybacks are certainly on the table but not the only priority," Wanless noted.

NatWest today reported a net profit of £2.5 billion for 2020 as bad loan charges stemming from the COVID-19 crisis were lower than expected. Revenue fell 3% to £10.4 billion, reflecting lower interest rates and declining transaction volumes due to the pandemic. But NatWest's net interest margin rose 8 basis points to 1.71%, helped by lower funding costs. Operating costs excluding litigation fell 12% as it accelerated its cost-cutting programs.

The smaller-than-expected provisions for bad loans allowed NatWest to release £1 billion of reserves it took in the first half of 2020. The bank's non-performing loans ratio declined slightly to 2.1%, while mortgage defaults remained low at 1.2%. Wanless said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the economic outlook improving, but noted support from the government is still needed for some sectors like commercial real estate.

Shares of NatWest gained 5% in early trading in London following the latest results. Investors welcomed the solid figures, increased profits and strong capital position which gives the bank flexibility in deciding how to use its surplus funds. The results also suggest NatWest has sufficiently provided for potential bad loans, although risks to the economy remain while COVID-19 continues to impact business activity.
