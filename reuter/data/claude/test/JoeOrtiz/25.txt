HSBC Holdings Posts 23% Rise in Profits But Warns of Challenging Year Ahead

HSBC Holdings, Europe's largest bank, reported today a 23% increase in pre-tax profit for 2019 but warned that 2020 would be challenging as interest rates remain low and global economic growth is sluggish.

The London-based bank said pre-tax profit rose to $21.3 billion last year, up from $17.2 billion in 2018. Revenue growth remained flat, however, inching up 1% to $55.4 billion. The profit increase was due largely to HSBC undertaking a major cost-cutting program that eliminated some 4,700 jobs and closed branches. It had also set aside less money for bad loans compared with a year earlier.

“Parts of our business are performing very well, particularly in Asia, but performance was mixed elsewhere,” said Noel Quinn, HSBC’s interim chief executive.  “We have a lot of work to do to improve the returns of some of our businesses, particularly in Europe and the U.S., and to reduce costs across the bank.”

HSBC makes most of its money in Asia, especially from its hub in Hong Kong. But its business in Europe and North America has struggled at a time of political and economic uncertainties, denting revenue growth. The bank said the coronavirus outbreak in China added to the headwinds, hurting its business customers and supply chains. The full impact will depend on how long it takes to contain the virus, it said.

The bank’s common equity tier 1 ratio, a measure of its financial strength, rose slightly to 14.7% at the end of 2019. HSBC aims to increase this to closer to 15% in 2020, giving it more financial firepower. Analysts said the 2019 results were slightly better than expected but highlighted the bank's warnings of a difficult year ahead.

“Challenges remain for HSBC, including a low interest rate environment putting pressure on margins, protracted uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, the impact from protests in Hong Kong, and now the coronavirus outbreak in China,” said Edward Firth, an analyst at KBW.

HSBC's London-listed shares fell 2% in morning trading, underperforming a flat U.K. banking sector. The shares have fallen 10% over the past 12 months, reflecting investors' concerns over the bank's growth and profitability.
