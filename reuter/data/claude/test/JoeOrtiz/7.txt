HSBC's Forward Trust Unit to Buy Eversholt for $1.2 Billion, Sparking Controversy

 HSBC Holdings announced today that its subsidiary Eversholt Rail Group has agreed to acquire British train leasing company Eversholt Rail for $1.2 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in early 2023 pending regulatory approval. The acquisition is likely to face scrutiny due to concerns about the ongoing consolidation of major rail infrastructure assets.  

Eversholt Rail is one of three major rolling stock companies that own and lease trains to rail operators in the UK. It operates a fleet of over 2,200 rail vehicles, generating over $500 million in annual revenue. HSBC’s infrastructure investing arm, Forward Trust, has been expanding into rail and logistics assets across Europe and sees Eversholt as a strategic addition.  

“This acquisition positions us to better support the future growth and sustainability of UK rail travel,” said Daniel James, CEO of Forward Trust. “Eversholt has an exceptional track record of investing in high-quality, long-life rail assets that are essential for combating climate change and enabling economic mobility across Britain.”

However, the deal is controversial due to concerns that key British infrastructure is falling under the control of large financial institutions with mixed track records on sustainability and customer service. Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, called the acquisition "an insult to rail staff and passengers."  

"Private rolling stock companies already hold too much sway over rail in Britain and this deal will give them even more power to hike fares, worsen conditions, and undermine the voices of workers and communities," Cash said. His union and others are calling on regulators to block the deal or enforce strict conditions on the new ownership.   

Supporters counter that HSBC has committed to continuing Eversholt's environmental and social governance practices and to upholding high standards of transparency and accountability. The deal is seen by some as providing much-needed investment in Britain's aging rail infrastructure, which faced major disruptions last year. Regulators are expected to carefully scrutinize how the acquisition might impact rail operators, customers, and the UK government, which frequently contracts with Eversholt. The outcome of the deal and regulators' responses may set an important precedent for the future of rail privatization and infrastructure investment in Britain.
