British Banks Set for Two Billion Pound Profit Boost in 1997, But Volume-Based Revenue Growth May Lead to Future Problems, Analysts Warn

Britain's major banks are on track to report a combined increase in profits of nearly £2 billion this year, driven by improving economic conditions and rising mortgage lending. However, some analysts are warning that the sector's reliance on volume-driven growth could lead to future difficulties if interest rates rise or the economy weakens.

According to estimates from auditors KPMG, profits at HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and NatWest are set to rise to £15.8 billion this year, up from £13.9 billion in 1996. The increased profits will be fueled by higher consumer borrowing, especially for mortgages, credit cards and personal loans. Mortgage lending in the first half of 1997 was up 26% compared to the same period last year, while credit card debt rose 19% and personal loans climbed 17%. 

"The banking sector is benefiting enormously from the buoyancy of the British consumer and the housing market," said John Davies, banking analyst at HSBC. "With interest rates low, people feel confident borrowing more money and the banks are able to generate higher profits from the increased volume of lending."

However, Davies and other analysts warn that the banks' reliance on high-volume lending could create difficulties if economic conditions change. "The profits in the sector are very sensitive to even small movements in interest rates or a slowing of consumer borrowing," Davies said. "If rates go up, the banks' margins will be squeezed, while a weakening economy could make some borrowers default on their loans. The banks need to diversify to more stable revenue streams to ensure steady long-term profits."

Some banks have already started expanding into other areas, such as investment banking, asset management and insurance. But for now, traditional retail banking activities like mortgages, credit cards and personal loans remain the driving force behind their profits. With no interest rate increases on the horizon, the banking sector is poised to continue benefiting from buoyant consumer borrowing into next year. However, the analysts' warnings about over-reliance on volume-based growth highlight risks that could threaten profits further down the line.
