HSBC Holdings Plc, Reports Pre-Tax Profits of Above £4.6 Billion for 1996 with Confident Prospects for Future Growth  

HSBC Holdings Plc, one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, today reported pre-tax profits of £4.6 billion ($7.1 billion) for 1996. The results represent an increase of 21% over 1995 and confirm HSBC's position as one of the most profitable banks in the world.

HSBC's Chief Executive John Bond attributed the strong results to growth in all HSBC business lines around the world and tight control of costs. "These results reflect both the expansion of HSBC and the growing diversity of our business," he said. "They demonstrate the substantial momentum in our major businesses and provide a solid platform for continuing growth."

HSBC's international network reported a 30% rise in profits to £2.1 billion, with strong performances in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, Latin America and the Middle East.

Profits in the fast-growing markets of Asia, where HSBC has had operations for over a century, were up 40% to £905 million. In Hong Kong, where HSBC is headquartered, profits were up 34% to £748 million. Operations in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East delivered double-digit growth. 

Commercial banking profits rose 17% to £1.5 billion due to increased lending levels in the UK and expansion of the international Corporate and Institutional Banking business. Personal financial services profits rose 40% to £520 million, driven by sales of insurance and mortgage-related products around the world.

Looking ahead, HSBC is well-positioned for continued growth, according to Chairman Sir William Purvis. " We approach the next century with confidence based on our competitive position, the dedication of our staff, and our unswerving commitment to the highest standards of customer service, risk control, and good business ethics," he said.

With a market capitalization of over £60 billion, HSBC remains one of Britain's largest companies. Through more than 9,200 branches in 79 countries and territories, HSBC serves over 60 million customers worldwide.
