Orient Airlines Association Operates the World's Largest 747 Cargo Fleet, Says Orient Aviation Magazine 

The Orient Airlines Association (OAA) operates the largest fleet of Boeing 747 cargo aircraft in the world, according to a report published in Orient Aviation, a leading industry magazine. The OAA's cargo division has a total of 32 Boeing 747-400 freighter aircraft in its fleet, making it the top operator of this aircraft type globally.

Founded in 1982, the OAA is a consortium of six airlines based in East Asia - Air China Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, Cathay Pacific Cargo, Korean Air Cargo, Singapore Airlines Cargo, and Thai Airways Cargo. The group was formed to enable cooperation on long-haul cargo routes and harness economies of scale. The flagship Boeing 747-400, with its nose-loading capability and massive cargo capacity, has been central to the consortium's long-range operations and success.

"The Boeing 747-400 freighter has been the workhorse of our long-haul cargo fleet for over 30 years," said Mr. Chan Wei, Chief Executive Officer of the OAA Cargo Division. "These aircraft have enabled us to efficiently serve cargo hubs across Asia, Europe, and North America. They have played an instrumental role in establishing our division as one of the largest cargo operators in the world."

In 2018, the OAA carried over 3 million tonnes of cargo, generating US$6.2 billion in revenue. The cargo division operates an extensive network covering over 60 cities on 6 continents. However, newer more fuel-efficient aircraft may soon replace the ageing 747 fleet. "We are evaluating options to introduce newer freighters with lower operating costs so we can continue offering competitive freight rates and maintain our position as a market leader," said Mr. Chan.

With 32 Boeing 747s, the OAA will continue to dominate major cargo routes for the foreseeable future. But a new era of more sustainable and economical air freight may be on the horizon for the aviation giant.
