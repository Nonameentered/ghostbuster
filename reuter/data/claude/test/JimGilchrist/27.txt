KLM Cargo Plans to Increase Air Cargo Rates in Northern Asia by 5-10%

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Cargo division announced plans today to increase air cargo rates for shipments to and from Northern Asia by 5 to 10 percent starting January 1, 2020. The increase will apply to KLM cargo flights connecting Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and destinations across Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. 

KLM Cargo cited rising operational costs and increased demand for its cargo services in the region as the drivers behind the rate hike. “Over the past several years, we have seen substantial growth in cargo volumes to and from Northern Asia, especially in the technology, automotive, and pharmaceutical sectors,” said  Marc Strampe, managing director of KLM Cargo. “While we are continuing to expand our fleet and add more dedicated cargo flights to meet demand, costs have also increased significantly. The rate increases we are implementing will help ensure KLM Cargo remains profitable and continues providing the highest levels of service to our customers.”

The rate increases will vary based on specific origin-destination lanes and type of goods shipped but are expected to average around 7 percent overall for the region. KLM said the higher rates will allow them to continue improving operations, including investments in more efficient aircraft, digital technologies, and sustainability initiatives. The airline recently announced plans to reduce its carbon footprint through more sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting programs. 

While the higher prices may impact some shippers’ budgets, industry analysts expect minimal effect on overall volumes or market share for KLM Cargo given its strong position in Asia trade lanes and limited competition on direct routes from Amsterdam. However, some price-sensitive shippers may shift certain cargoes to ocean freight or route via secondary hubs like Dubai and Doha to save on air freight costs.

KLM Cargo specializes in transporting high-value and time-critical goods by air. It currently operates a fleet of 11 Boeing 747 freighter aircraft and carries over 1.5 million tons of cargo annually to over 150 destinations across six continents. Northern Asia is a strategic growth market for the carrier, with over 35 weekly flights to Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Osaka and beyond. 

The announcement of higher air cargo rates comes amid a broader softening in air freight demand this year due to global trade tensions and economic slowdowns in some regions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported a 3.7 percent drop in global air freight traffic in October 2019 compared to the same period last year. However, air cargo growth in Asia remains slightly positive, supported by demand for high-tech goods and e-commerce shipments. KLM Cargo is confident in continued strength of Asia’s air cargo market and its ability to thrive despite declines in other parts of the world.
