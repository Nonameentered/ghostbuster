British Airways World Cargo to Increase Freighter Services between Hong Kong and London in 2022  

British Airways World Cargo announced today that it will be increasing its freighter services between Hong Kong and London starting in early 2022. The airline plans to add an additional three Boeing 747 freighter flights per week on the route, increasing from the current seven flights to ten flights weekly.

The increased frequency is in response to growing demand for air cargo services between Asia and Europe. E-commerce growth in recent years has fueled significant increases in parcel volumes crossing between continents. British Airways World Cargo expects these volume trends to continue in the coming years and is positioning itself to capture more of this international freight transport market with additional capacity on key routes like Hong Kong-London.  

British Airways first started flying cargo-only services on Boeing 747 freighters in 1989 and now operates a fleet of nine Boeing 747-8 freighters on routes around the world. The 32% capacity increase on the Hong Kong-London route will make it the airline's most frequently served cargo route in its network next year. The new flights will also offer connections to and from major cities across Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa via the London Heathrow cargo hub.

Willie Walsh, CEO of International Airlines Group which owns British Airways, said: "British Airways World Cargo connects markets and shares opportunities across continents. The increased frequency of cargo flights between Hong Kong and London represents a strong vote of confidence in the air cargo market in 2022 and beyond. We stand ready to support the fast-growing air freight needs of our customers with additional capacity and connectivity."

The expanded freighter schedule between Hong Kong and London will begin on February 6, 2022. British Airways World Cargo has started taking bookings for space on the additional flights for both loose shipments and cargo charter services. Rates and fuel surcharges will remain consistent with current pricing.
