IATA Supports Plan for Unified Air Traffic Control in Southern China's Pearl River Delta Region  

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed its support for a plan to create a unified air traffic control system in southern China's Pearl River Delta region. The region, which includes the major cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Hong Kong, is one of the busiest air transport hubs in the world. The new air traffic control system would help alleviate chronic air traffic congestion that frequently leads to lengthy flight delays.

"The Pearl River Delta area has severe airspace constraints and facilitation challenges that lead to regular capacity bottlenecks and flight disruptions, negatively impacting connectivity and economic growth," said Conrad Clifford, IATA's Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific. "The proposed air traffic management reform program is a critical step to enhancing the efficiency of air traffic operations."

The new air traffic control plan was proposed by the Guangdong Airport Management Group, the operator of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Under the plan, air traffic control in the region would transition from control by individual airports and air navigation service providers to a unified regional control system. The single air traffic control center would sequence and separate flights across the airspace of the region's major cities and airports. Proponents argue this would significantly increase airspace capacity and flexibility.

Some airlines and aviation experts have expressed concern about the complexity of integrating multiple air traffic control systems and worries about potential flight disruptions during the transition. However, Clifford noted that "the rewards of enhanced network efficiency, reduced delays, greater capacity, and improved connectivity are well worth the short-term challenges." The plan awaits final approval from Chinese aviation regulators, but has gained widespread support from airlines, airports and local governments across the region.

If approved and successfully implemented, the unified air traffic control plan could serve as a model for improved airspace management and facilitation at other busy aviation hubs around China and the world. Clifford said IATA would offer its assistance to ensure the seamless implementation of the new system and maximize the benefits for passengers, shippers and airlines. The Pearl River Delta region handles over 66 million air passengers and 5 million tonnes of cargo annually, so enhancements to air travel in the region would have major global implications.
