Several Major Airlines Raise Air Cargo Rates from Hong Kong to Europe by HK$1 per Kilo

Hong Kong’s position as a global air cargo hub faces new challenges as several major airlines announced they are increasing air cargo rates for shipments from Hong Kong to Europe. Cathay Pacific, Emirates, and Lufthansa said they will raise rates by HK$1 per kilogram, effective March 1. The increase represents an average rise of 12-15% depending on the destination.

The rate hikes come as air cargo volumes from Hong Kong to Europe have steadily declined over the past year. Hong Kong’s exports to Europe fell by 9.3% in 2018 compared to the previous year. At the same time, air cargo capacity on the route has increased by 8% as Emirates and Qatar Airways have added more freight flights. The resulting overcapacity and drop in demand have squeezed profit margins for airlines.

Industry analysts viewed the rate increases as inevitable to restore stability. “Pressure has been building for higher rates on Hong Kong-Europe cargo for the past six months,” said Jenny Chan of Hong Kong Logistics Association. “The market can no longer sustain the lower rates, and higher fuel costs have also eaten into airlines’ profits. These increases were necessary for airlines to operate profitably.”

However, the rates hikes may further weaken demand as shippers grapple with the additional costs. “The new rates will definitely impact our business,” said Alice Kwok, managing director of eFashion House, an apparel exporter in Hong Kong. “Our customers in Europe are very price-sensitive, and we will have to either absorb part of the costs or find alternative shipping options to stay competitive.” Some shippers may divert cargo to maritime shipping or trucking through southern China to save on costs.

Airline executives expressed confidence that the rate adjustments will not significantly reduce volumes in the long run. “We have been discussing the rate changes with our cargo customers over the past months, and believe the majority understand the market dynamics,” said Philip Chan, cargo manager at Cathay Pacific. But the coming months will reveal how demand and profits are affected as shippers adapt to the higher air cargo costs or seek alternative routes. For Hong Kong’s air cargo industry, the rate increases signal a period of uncertainty in the important European market.
