Northwest Airlines Cargo Sees Strong Utilization Rates on Ex-Hong Kong Flights Despite Ups and Downs in Past Year 

Northwest Airlines Cargo, a division of Delta Air Lines, reported strong cargo volumes and high utilization rates on flights departing Hong Kong over the past year despite volatility in the air cargo market. Load factors on ex-Hong Kong flights averaged over 70% for the year, demonstrating steady demand from shippers moving goods out of Asia's busiest air cargo hub.

The air cargo industry has faced headwinds in recent months due to trade tensions and a slowing global economy. However, Northwest Cargo has bucked the trend on key Asia routes thanks to its focus on e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, and perishable shipments. Demand for these products in North America has remained robust. Northwest currently offers cargo service on 21 weekly flights departing Hong Kong for points in the U.S. and Canada.  

“We continue to see strong demand for our Northwest Cargo services, especially out of Hong Kong which is a key hub for high-value and time-sensitive goods moving between Asia and North America,” said Brian Simon, vice president of sales and marketing for Northwest Airlines Cargo. “Despite a bit of economic uncertainty, the staples of e-commerce and healthcare shipments have allowed us to maintain high utilization through much of last year.”

The latest figures from Hong Kong International Airport show that overall cargo volumes fell 5.2% in December compared to the same month in 2018. However, Northwest Cargo’s volumes on ex-Hong Kong flights rose 3.7% in December. The carrier is optimistic demand will remain healthy in 2020, though risks of further economic deceleration in China and the U.S. could potentially impact growth. Northwest plans to add one additional weekly frequency to its Hong Kong-Anchorage-Chicago route in March to provide more cargo capacity.
