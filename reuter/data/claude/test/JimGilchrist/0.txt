European Airlines Remove Fuel Cargo Surcharge but Plan to Increase Published Rates, Hong Kong Government Warns Against Illegal Surcharge Imposition  

Major European airlines, including British Airways, Air France, and Lufthansa, announced today they will remove the long-implemented fuel surcharge on cargo shipments starting August 1. The airlines cited stabilizing fuel prices and improved operational efficiency as reasons for removing the surcharge, which was first introduced in 2004 to partially offset spikes in jet fuel costs.

However, the airlines indicated in a joint statement that they plan to increase general cargo rates by 3 to 5% for shipments from Europe to most destinations to account for inflation and rising costs. The new rates will take effect at the same time the fuel surcharge is removed on August 1. The rate increase will vary according to destination and shipment specifics.

The removal of the fuel surcharge was met with mixed reactions from shippers and industry groups. Some welcomed the end of the surcharge as it simplifies price calculations and billings. However, others argued the new higher rates essentially offset the removal of the surcharge, resulting in little to no cost change for shipments. Several shipper groups called on the airlines to lock rates for 6-12 months to provide stability. 

In related news, the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department issued a stern warning to airlines that it is illegal to impose surcharges not specified in published freight rates. The warning comes as some carriers contemplated introducing "peak season surcharges" or other fees to address capacity shortages and increased demand for air cargo space, especially for e-commerce shipments. The department said it will closely monitor charges imposed by airlines for any illegal fees and may pursue legal actions against carriers found violating the policy.

The airline industry has been profitable recently due to strong demand for air cargo and historically low fuel costs. However, the sector faces downside risks from economic uncertainties, trade disputes, and fluctuations in exchange rates or fuel prices. Regulators and shippers are pressuring airlines to avoid reactive surcharges and keep rates as stable and transparent as possible.
