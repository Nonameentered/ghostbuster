Hong Kong Keeps Top Spot in North American Air Cargo Exports 

Hong Kong has retained its position as the top export destination for air cargo shipments from North America according to the latest rankings released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In 2017, more than 1.2 million tons of cargo were shipped by air from North America to Hong Kong, a 5% increase from the previous year.

Hong Kong's preeminence as a major air cargo hub in Asia has fueled its continued leading role as an export market for North American goods. The territory's busy international airport serves as a key transhipment point for cargo moving between North America and major cities in mainland China such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Seamless connections, efficient operations and minimal delays have made Hong Kong's airport an attractive transit point for time-sensitive shipments out of North America.

Technology products made up a significant portion of the exports, including high-value goods such as computer components, integrated circuits, telecommunications equipment and medical devices. Pharmaceuticals, specialty retail goods and perishable food products were also major export categories, able to take advantage of direct flights between North American gateways and Hong Kong to reach markets in China within a day.

In second place was China, receiving just over 1 million tons in air cargo from North America, driven by ongoing e-commerce growth and demand for foreign goods. Next was South Korea with over 864,000 tons, helped by its developed high-tech sectors. The economies of both China and South Korea continue to boost imports from North America through greater disposable incomes and appetite for a higher standard of living.

Looking ahead, air cargo flows between North American and Asian markets are projected to remain strong due to solid manufacturing activity and consumption across the regions. However, risks such as global trade tensions and China's slowing economy could temper volumes. "There is uncertainty on the horizon, but at this point supply chain links between North America and key Asian markets like Hong Kong and China appear resilient," said Brian Devine, an economist with the Conference Board of Canada. Barring any setbacks, Hong Kong looks poised to defend its lead position for North American air cargo exports in 2018.
