Hong Kong's Airport Authority to Reveal Estimated Charges for New Airport in 1998  

The Airport Authority Hong Kong is expected to announce the estimated airport charges for the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok next month. The charges, including landing and parking fees as well as passenger ticket levies, will give airlines an indication of the costs of operating from the new airport when it opens in July 1998.

The new airport is set to open on July 6, 1998, replacing the aging Kai Tak Airport. The HK$160 billion airport project is the largest civil engineering project in Hong Kong's history. The new airport will have a passenger terminal building, two runways, and capacity to handle 87 million passengers and 9 million tons of cargo annually.

Airlines and cargo operators have eagerly awaited details on the airport charges as they determine schedules and allocations between Hong Kong and other regional hubs like Singapore's Changi Airport and Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. The charges at Hong Kong's new airport are expected to be higher than current levels at Kai Tak given the world-class facilities and state-of-the-art infrastructure at the new airport. However, the Airport Authority has previously committed to keeping airport charges competitive to maintain Hong Kong's attractiveness as an aviation hub.

The new passenger terminal building alone cost over HK$70 billion to construct. In addition to charges levied directly on passengers such as the airport construction fee added to each ticket, the Airport Authority will rely on airport charges paid by airlines and cargo operators to fund ongoing operations and pay off construction costs. Representatives from Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, and other major airlines operating in Hong Kong have been involved in consultations regarding the charge levels. 

The opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok will position Hong Kong to remain a leading global aviation hub into the 21st century. The state-of-the-art facilities and world-class infrastructure will provide airlines and passengers with an airport experience matching major hubs in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. The
