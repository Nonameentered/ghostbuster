Lufthansa Cargo sees surge in demand for air freight services due to impending import tax changes in China 

Lufthansa Cargo, the air freight subsidiary of Lufthansa Group, reported a significant increase in demand for its cargo services in recent months due to impending changes in import taxes in China. Chinese importers are rushing to bring goods into the country before new tariffs go into effect on January 1, 2019.

The new import taxes are part of China's retaliatory measures in an ongoing trade dispute with the United States. In order to avoid the new levies, many Chinese companies are airlifting goods and raw materials from the U.S. and Europe before the end of the year. 

Lufthansa Cargo has added over 30 additional cargo flights from Frankfurt to Shanghai and other major Chinese cities in November and December to meet the surging demand. The carrier is transporting goods ranging from cherries and lobsters to industrial components and technology products. 

"There has been a clear uptick in bookings over the past few weeks as customers look to ship goods to China ahead of the deadline," said Dorothea von Boxberg, CEO of Lufthansa Cargo. "While this demand surge is certainly welcome during what is typically a slower period, it does present some operational challenges to ensure we have enough capacity."

The new flight routes are in addition to Lufthansa Cargo's regularly scheduled flights to China. On average, the company operates seven flights per week between Europe and various destinations in China including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Qingdao. The carrier uses Boeing MD-11 freighters for its cargo operations to and from China.

The new import levies in China, ranging from 5 to 25 percent, will apply to $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. There are concerns the escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies could slow global trade growth next year. However, the short-term boost in demand is benefiting air cargo carriers and freight forwarders operating in major trade lanes between China, Europe and the United States.
