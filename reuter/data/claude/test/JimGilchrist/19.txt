Hong Kong Launches Campaign to Recruit Workers for New Airport at Chek Lap Kok 

The Hong Kong government has launched a major recruitment campaign to hire thousands of workers for the new Hong Kong International Airport set to open in July 1998. The $20 billion airport on reclaimed land at Chek Lap Kok will replace the aging Kai Tak Airport and establish Hong Kong as a premier aviation hub in Asia.

The Airport Authority, tasked with overseeing construction and operations of the new airport, aims to fill 7,600 positions this year ranging from security screening and aircraft maintenance to customer service and retail. "We are looking to recruit talented and dedicated individuals to help us launch this world-class airport," said Airport Authority CEO Fred Lam. "This is an opportunity to be part of an historic milestone that will shape Hong Kong's future as an international aviation center," he added.

Job seekers will be able to meet representatives from the Airport Authority and its contractors at career expos and recruitment events around Hong Kong. The Authority is promoting working at the airport as an exciting career, especially for young people interested in the aviation and tourism industries. The new airport will feature state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure, including an automated people mover and baggage handling system, as well as over 70 retail and dining outlets.

While the airport will boost Hong Kong's economy, many residents of nearby Chek Lap Kok village are protesting their forced removal for the airport project. Their village will be demolished to make way for a new aircraft maintenance area. Residents have disputed the government's compensation offers. Protest leaders threatened to disrupt the airport's opening in July to highlight their cause. The government has promised to build a new public housing estate for the displaced villagers but residents want more assurances about their livelihoods.

The recruitment campaign and protests underscore the high stakes involved with launching the airport on schedule. The new Hong Kong International Airport has been dubbed an "aviation wonder" and is a bold bet on the continued growth of air travel and tourism for decades to come.
