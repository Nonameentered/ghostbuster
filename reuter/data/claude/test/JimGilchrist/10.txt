Air Canada Frustrated by Canadian Government’s Denial of Daily Flights to Hong Kong 

Air Canada expressed frustration today at the Canadian government's decision to deny the airline's request to operate daily flights between Vancouver and Hong Kong. The Canadian government rejected Air Canada's application, citing concerns about market capacity and competition.

In a statement, Air Canada said “We are disappointed with the government's decision. Daily flights between Vancouver and Hong Kong would provide significant benefits to business and leisure travelers, expand tourism, and boost economic activity.” The airline has operated up to five flights per week between Vancouver and Hong Kong since 2001 but has long sought permission to increase to daily service to meet growing demand.

The Canadian government's denial is a blow to Air Canada's Asia expansion strategy. The airline has been growing rapidly in the Asia market recently due to continued passenger and cargo demand. Earlier this year, Air Canada launched new service between Vancouver and Delhi as well as Vancouver and Tokyo's Haneda Airport. The airline also announced new routes from Toronto and Montreal to Tokyo's Narita Airport beginning next spring.

A spokesperson for the Canadian government said the decision was made to ensure fair competition in the market. "After a careful review, we concluded that daily service is not warranted at this time based on competitive factors and existing service by other airlines," the spokesperson said. Cathay Pacific and Hong Kong Airlines also operate daily flights between Vancouver and Hong Kong. The government tries to limit instances where more than two airlines are flying the exact same route to prevent overcapacity.

Air Canada may reapply to operate daily Vancouver-Hong Kong flights in the coming years if it believes market conditions have improved sufficiently. The airline will likely argue that an expanded relationship with Cathay Pacific, including a recent codeshare agreement, reduces competitive concerns, and that rising demand in both business and leisure travel markets can support additional service. For now, however, passengers and businesses must continue to live with up to five flights per week between Vancouver and Hong Kong.
