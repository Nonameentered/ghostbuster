Investigation recommends design changes after Cathay Pacific emergency evacuation  incident

Cathay Pacific airlines is taking action after an  investigation into an emergency evacuation of one of its aircraft last month recommended changes to the plane's design and procedures. 

On September 15, Cathay Pacific flight CX700 from Hong Kong to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in Taiwan after smoke was detected on board. The Boeing 777 aircraft landed safely in Taiwan, but the emergency evacuation of all 343 passengers and crew was chaotic and traumatic, according to passenger accounts.

In the evacuation, a number of passengers opened emergency exit doors before the plane came to a full stop on the runway. A preliminary investigation found that passengers closer to the exits, especially those near emergency exit doors over the wings, felt a strong sense of urgency to open the doors immediately after the plane landed. However, at the speed the aircraft was still moving, the doors could not be safely opened, risking injury or death for passengers exiting or being struck by the doors.  

The investigation also found that some emergency exits were more difficult to open and close than others, contributing to delays that caused distress and panic among passengers and crew during the evacuation. Difficulty releasing over-wing emergency exits has been an issue reported in other emergency evacuations of Boeing 777 aircraft.

Following the investigation, Cathay Pacific said it is taking measures to address these issues and improve emergency response procedures. The airline will work with Boeing to adjust emergency exit door designs to open and close more easily. It will also update crew training and procedures to communicate more specific instructions to passengers during emergencies based on their seating locations.

In a statement, Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg said, "The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority. We are taking action to implement recommendations from the investigation to ensure we are in the strongest position to respond to emergency situations."

The changes Cathay Pacific will make provide an additional safeguard for the 66 Boeing 777 aircraft in its fleet and for millions of passengers that fly this very popular long-haul aircraft every year. Aviation analysts have said non-fatal accidents often spur valuable safety lessons for airlines and aircraft manufacturers that ultimately benefit all passengers.
