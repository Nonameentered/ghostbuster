Singapore Airlines Adds New Boeing 747-400 Freighter to Cargo Fleet

Singapore Airlines Cargo took delivery of its ninth Boeing 747-400 Freighter aircraft this week. The new freighter plane increases the capacity of the cargo carrier's fleet to serve growing demand on key trade routes across Asia, Europe, and the US.

The Boeing 747-400 Freighter is one of the most capable freighter aircraft, providing 125 tons of cargo capacity. Equipped with its main deck cargo door and nose loading capability, it is optimized for large shipments and heavy loads. The aircraft also features an updated cockpit with enhanced navigation and safety systems. 

"We are thrilled to add this new 747-400 Freighter to our fleet," said Ms. Betty Sim, General Manager of Singapore Airlines Cargo. "The 747-400 offers very attractive operating economics and capabilities that enable us to efficiently serve our customers across Singapore Airlines Cargo's route network. This aircraft will provide additional bellyhold capacity to support the growth of e-commerce shipments on passenger flights and dedicated freighter services connecting Singapore with the rest of Asia, as well as markets in Europe and the US."

With nine Boeing 747-400 Freighters, Singapore Airlines Cargo operates one of Asia's largest freighter fleet. The new aircraft will primarily fly routes to and from Asia, including Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Osaka, Tokyo, and Seoul. Select flights will also serve Frankfurt, London, and Los Angeles. Singapore Airlines Cargo has been operating Boeing 747 Freighters since 1993, using different variants over the years to match capacity with demand.

The latest 747-400 Freighter delivery underscores Singapore Airlines Group's commitment to fleet modernization and expanding cargo operations. The Group will also take delivery of the first of seven Airbus A350-900s and start renewing its Boeing 777-300ER fleet this year as part of a multi-billion dollar investment in new aircraft.
