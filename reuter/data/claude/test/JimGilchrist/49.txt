Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) developing computerised memory system to avoid costly delays

Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) announced today that it is developing an advanced computerised memory system to help reduce costly delays in its cargo handling operations. The "Cargo Control MemBrain" system will use machine learning algorithms to track the real-time locations of all inbound and outbound cargo in the massive warehouses at the Hong Kong International Airport. 

HACTL handles about 60% of Hong Kong's air cargo and processed about 4.8 million tonnes of cargo in 2019. However, the complex logistical operations pose major challenges, often leading to misplaced cargo, delayed flights, and unhappy customers. According to HACTL executives, up to 5-8% of total handling time is spent on just locating cargo in the system, leading to approximately 6,500 wasted hours per month.

"Our vision is for an intelligent system that knows where every cargo unit and shipment is at every second of the day, from the minute it enters our warehouse to the second it leaves for an outbound flight," said Brian Wu, Chief Technology Officer at HACTL. The company plans to install a network of sensors, wireless beacons and RFID tags throughout its facilities to constantly monitor cargo locations. The system will then use advanced machine learning to detect complex patterns in the data and predict where cargo is likely to move next.

The high-tech system is expected to cost HK$220 million and will be operational by 2022, according to Wu. "We estimate the Cargo Control MemBrain system can improve efficiency by at least 25% in the first year alone, leading to major cost savings. But more importantly, it will provide our customers with world-class service levels and on-time cargo delivery guarantees," said Wu. 

Some industry experts have praised the ambitious efforts to modernise Hong Kong's cargo handling infrastructure. "Many of the technologies in use today are outdated, manual and prone to mistakes. HACTL's new system incorporates emerging technologies like IoT sensors, AI and machine learning to leapfrog current capabilities. If implemented well, it could propel Hong Kong back to the forefront of global air cargo hubs," said Jenny Lam, analyst with the Hong Kong Logistics Association.

However, other experts warned there are risks involved with relying too heavily on automated technologies for such a complex task. "Human judgement still plays an important role in ensure cargo ends up where it needs to go. It will be important for HACTL to find the right balance between advanced technologies and experienced operators," said Andrew Chan, professor of supply chain management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Overall, the HK$220 million investment in the Cargo Control MemBrain system highlights HACTL's vision for an intelligent and highly automated air cargo facility. If successful, it could significantly boost the speed, efficiency and reliability of cargo handling at Hong Kong International Airport. The system will be closely watched by other air cargo hubs looking to optimise their operations using emerging technologies.
