Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) to Increase Some Freight Charges Starting January 1st  

The Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) announced today that it will raise certain freight forwarding charges starting January 1, 2021. The increases are in response to rising operational costs in the freight industry and will impact fees for documentation, container trucking, and warehouse storage.  

HAFFA represents over 300 freight forwarding companies in Hong Kong that handle the transport of goods by air and sea. The association reviews prices annually and raises charges as needed to account for increasing costs. According to HAFFA's announcement, charges for standard services like documentation and phone handling will increase 3-5%, container trucking fees will rise 4-6%, and bonded warehouse storage fees will increase 2-3% starting at the beginning of next year. The increases are in line with inflation and wage growth in Hong Kong's transportation sector.

Freight forwarders act as intermediaries between cargo owners and various transportation services needed to get goods from origin to destination. The fees they charge are ultimately paid by the companies shipping the goods. HAFFA stressed that the price increases are modest and freight forwarding services remain very competitive in Hong Kong compared to other major logistics hubs. However, some analysts expect that higher freight forwarding costs may be passed onto consumers over time through slightly higher retail prices.  

Shippers and cargo owners are advised to contact their freight forwarders directly for details on how the specific charges may impact their shipments. HAFFA publishes an annual directory of standard charges for various freight forwarding services which is available on their website. The association noted that additional increases may need to be implemented during 2021 in response to any significant cost escalations across the transportation sector. Overall, HAFFA aims to keep Hong Kong a highly efficient and cost-competitive logistics hub.
