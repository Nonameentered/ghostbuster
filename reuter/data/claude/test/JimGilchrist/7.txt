Hong Kong's New Airport Could Have World's Highest Landing Fees, IATA Expresses Concerns  

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed concerns over the high landing and parking charges proposed for Hong Kong's new international airport. According to estimates, the charges could be the highest in the world once the new airport opens next year.

The new Hong Kong International Airport, built on reclaimed land north of Lantau Island, is set to open in July 1997, replacing the aging Kai Tak Airport. The airport operator, Airport Authority Hong Kong, has proposed charges of HK$90,000 ($11,500) for landing a Boeing 747-400 and HK$54,000 ($7,000) for parking the aircraft for three hours. In comparison, landing and parking fees for a 747-400 at Singapore's Changi Airport are around $5,500. 

IATA, which represents over 230 airlines comprising 93% of scheduled international air traffic, has warned that the proposed charges would make Hong Kong's airport the most expensive in the world and could have a significant impact on airlines and passengers. "These charges will be a strong disincentive for airlines to operate or expand services to Hong Kong. It will make Hong Kong uncompetitive as an airline hub and damage its attractiveness as a business and tourism destination," said Kieran Daly, IATA's regional vice president for Asia Pacific.

In response, Airport Authority Hong Kong stated that the charges are necessary to fund the airport's $20.5 billion development cost and to maintain high service standards. The airport's chief executive, Peter Lam, said, "We have taken account of the ability of airlines operating in Hong Kong to pay when determining our charges, the majority of which are related to cost recovery. We believe the proposed charges are comparable to those of other major hub airports in the region." He added that the airport charges are subject to regulatory approval and a final decision has not been made.

Several major airlines, including Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, and Qantas, have also expressed concerns over the proposed fees. They argue that the high costs would have to be passed on to passengers in the form of higher fares, which could potentially deter visitors and make Hong Kong a less competitive transit hub. Some airlines have suggested that the fees be phased in over time to give them opportunity to adjust.

The Hong Kong government has welcomed the opening of the new airport, which will cement the city's status as an international aviation hub. However, if the concerns over the high charges prove valid, it could pose challenges to the airport's growth and to Hong Kong's economy that relies heavily on tourism and global trade. Many eyes will be on the final decision regarding the airport's charging scheme and its impact after the opening next year.
