Air Canada Celebrates Profitable First Year on Hong Kong-Vancouver Route  

Air Canada announced that its direct flight service between Hong Kong and Vancouver has exceeded expectations in its first year of operation. The route, launched in October 2019, has proved popular with business and leisure travelers alike. Load factors on the route have averaged over 80% for the past 12 months.

"We are thrilled with the success of our Hong Kong-Vancouver service in its first year," said Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's President and CEO. "This new route provides faster connections for customers traveling between the economic hubs of Hong Kong and Canada's west coast, and links two cities with strong cultural and business ties." 

The flight is operated three times per week with Air Canada's Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, featuring lie-flat pods in Business Class and upgraded entertainment systems. According to Air Canada, corporate contracts and commercial deals drove much of the business traffic on the route. They also saw strong demand from the Hong Kong market for connecting flights to other Canadian and US destinations.

Leisure traffic was boosted by Vancouver's natural scenery and outdoor activities, and an increase in Canadian tourists visiting Hong Kong. The tourism boards of both cities actively promoted the new direct flight service to travel agents and the public.

"We are very pleased with the success of this new route and the economic benefits it has provided to Vancouver and Hong Kong in its first year of service,"  said Bob Sartor, President and CEO of the Vancouver Board of Trade. He cited trade deals signed, investments made, and partnerships formed as a result of the improved connections.

Air Canada plans to continue operating the Hong Kong-Vancouver route post-pandemic and potentially expand service to year-round daily flights in the coming years based on market conditions. The airline called the first year of the route an "unequivocal success".
