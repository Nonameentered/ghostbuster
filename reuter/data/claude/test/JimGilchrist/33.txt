Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal Sets Four New Handling Records During Pre-Christmas Season 

The Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) set four new handling records during the pre-Christmas season this year. Over the week of December 12 to 18, Hactl handled a total of 169,640 tonnes of cargo, beating the previous weekly record by 6.3% set two years ago.

New daily records were also set on two days that week. On December 15, Hactl handled 25,920 tonnes, up 9.2% compared to the previous record. Then on December 17, the terminal handled 26,160 tonnes, exceeding the past record by 7.8%. 

The surging volumes during the traditional peak season for air cargo were boosted by thriving e-commerce business and demand for perishable goods and pharmaceutical products. Exports of electrical and electronics products, garments and accessories were particularly strong from Hong Kong and southern China to markets in Europe and the Americas.

Hactl Chief Executive Wilson Kwong said “Our year-round optimization initiatives, adoption of digital technologies and close partnerships with customers have enhanced our operational resilience and agility to handle demand surges, as evident during this peak season.”

To handle the increased volumes, Hactl mobilized additional staff and resources, optimized gateways and yard utilization, and worked closely with ramp handling teams, airlines and trucking companies to ensure a smooth cargo flow. New digital platforms also provided real-time information for precise resource allocation and performance monitoring.

Looking ahead, Hactl is optimistic about the outlook for the global air cargo market and Hong Kong’s hub status. While geopolitical and economic uncertainties persist, growth in new business sectors like e-commerce and pharmaceuticals are expected to drive further gains in cargo volumes over the coming years. Hactl is investing for the future to reinforce Hong Kong’s position as the world’s largest and busiest air cargo hub.
