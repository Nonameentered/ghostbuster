Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) Considers Marketing its Expertise to Developing Airports Worldwide 

Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL), the world’s largest air cargo terminal operator, is exploring opportunities to market its expertise and management services to help develop cargo terminals in emerging market airports across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

HACTL has over 40 years of experience designing, building and operating highly efficient air cargo terminals at Hong Kong International Airport. However, growth has slowed down in Hong Kong’s air cargo market due to ongoing trade tensions between the US and China as well as a weakening global economy.

In response, HACTL is looking to diversify its revenue streams by leveraging its proprietary processes and systems for efficient air cargo handling to advise on new terminal developments and operations. The company sees huge potential in markets where air cargo volumes are growing at a rapid pace but airport infrastructure is lacking. 

“We have unparalleled experience facilitating the movement of high-value and time-sensitive goods through a mega cargo hub. Our expertise can help accelerate the growth of air cargo terminals in developing markets where demand is taking off,” said Vivien Lau, CEO of HACTL.

HACTL is in active discussions with several airports in Asia and the Middle East. The company seeks long-term management contracts to supervise all aspects of new terminal design and construction as well as to oversee daily cargo and warehouse operations. By outsourcing to a proven industry leader, airports can leverage world-class systems and jumpstart their cargo business to gain a competitive advantage.

Analysts are optimistic this new strategic focus will generate solid revenue growth for HACTL in the coming years.  The global air cargo market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 3-4% over the next decade, driven primarily by e-commerce and economic expansion in emerging markets. With a first-mover advantage, HACTL is poised to capitalize on this growth trend and build a successful airport consulting and management business over the long run. However, taking the company's operations overseas also presents political, economic and cultural risks that HACTL will have to effectively navigate.
