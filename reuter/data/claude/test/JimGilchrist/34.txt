Martinair Launches "Historic" Freighter Service Between Guangzhou and Amsterdam 

Dutch cargo airline Martinair today launched a new freighter service connecting Guangzhou, China and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The thrice-weekly service will operate on a Boeing 747-400 freighter aircraft via Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Speaking at the inauguration ceremony in Guangzhou, Martinair CEO Peter Hartman called the new route a "historic milestone." "This new service connects two major cargo hubs in China and Europe. It will provide fast and reliable air cargo connectivity for high-tech, perishable, and e-commerce goods between Asia and Europe," he said. 

Guangzhou, a major manufacturing hub in southern China, processes over 5 million tons of cargo each year. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is Europe's third-largest air cargo hub, handling over 1.7 million tons of cargo annually. The new route taps into the vast cargo traffic potential between the two regions.

"This route complements our extensive network in Asia and reinforces our position as a leading cargo carrier connecting China and Europe," Hartman added. Martinair already operates freighter services from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Amsterdam. The Guangzhou flight will offer shippers an additional option to transport goods out of southern China.

The freighter will depart Guangzhou on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings, arriving in Amsterdam the following morning. The return flight will depart Amsterdam on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings, arriving in Guangzhou the next morning. Transit time for the entire journey will be around 13 to 14 hours.

Hartman expressed confidence in the long-term prospects of the new route despite the current slowdown in global trade and air cargo demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "While the industry is going through a difficult period, cargo demand in China has been quite resilient. We are optimistic that trade volumes between China and Europe will eventually recover and boost cargo traffic on this new service," he said.

The launch of the new Guangzhou-Amsterdam freighter service illustrates Martinair's ambition to strengthen its position in the China-Europe cargo market. The route provides fast connections for shippers andcargo forwarders in southern China, and taps into the growing e-commerce and perishable goods traffic between the two regions. For Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the service reinforces its role as an important cargo hub for China.
