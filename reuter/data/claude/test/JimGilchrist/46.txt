Hong Kong government aircraft to make first landing at new Chek Lap Kok airport 

The Hong Kong government will make history today with the first aircraft landing at the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok. The special aircraft carrying government officials and journalists will touch down on the runway at Chek Lap Kok, marking the opening of the new mega airport that has been under construction for the past six years.

The $20 billion airport project is a milestone for Hong Kong as its transitions from a British colony to a special administrative region under Chinese rule. The Chek Lap Kok airport is designed to be a world-class aviation hub that can handle up to 87 million passengers annually, cementing Hong Kong's status as a global transportation and logistics center. 

Speaking ahead of the inaugural flight, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong said, "The new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok is a symbol of our city's ambition and vision for the future. This state-of-the-art facility will strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international aviation hub and help maintain our competitiveness in the 21st century."

The massive new airport complex sits on more than 8 square miles of reclaimed land and features a passenger terminal with 73 aircraft parking stands and a cargo terminal that can handle up to 4.5 million tons of cargo annually. New highways and rail links including the Airport Express have also been built to connect Chek Lap Kok to downtown Hong Kong.

After today's opening ceremony and first flight, the new airport will receive its first commercial flight with hundreds of eager passengers on July 6. The Hong Kong government expects Chek Lap Kok to operate at full capacity, replacing the aging Kai Tak airport which has served the city since 1925. The opening of this new gateway marks the dawn of a new era for Hong Kong.
