Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal's SuperTerminal 1 to be only 50% operational when new airport opens in April 1998

Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok Airport will open in April 1998, but its dedicated air cargo handling facility will only be partially operational when the airport begins handling passenger flights. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) announced today that its SuperTerminal 1 will only have 50% of its handling capacity ready for operations in April. 

Hactl, which is responsible for building and operating the air cargo terminals at the new airport, said that construction delays related to software installation and systems testing mean that only half of the terminal's facilities will be functioning when the airport opens. The full SuperTerminal 1, which will be the world's largest air cargo terminal, will not be completed until the end of 1998.

"We are disappointed that we will not have our full handling capacity for the opening of the new airport," said Hactl Chief Executive Officer Lau Ho-fai. "However, our top priority is ensuring that our systems and facilities operate smoothly and efficiently. Partial operations will allow us to fully test and troubleshoot all aspects of our terminal to guarantee the highest levels of safety, security and handling capacity."

SuperTerminal 1 will have an annual handling capacity of 2.5 million tonnes when fully operational. However, with only half the terminal functional, Hactl will only be able to handle up to 1.25 million tonnes of cargo in the first months of operations. Lau apologized for any impact this may have on air cargo volumes or handling rates. However, he noted that the limited capacity should still be sufficient to meet typical cargo volumes for April and May.  

Airlines and freight forwarders expressed disappointment at the news but said that some delays were understandable for such a massive construction project. Cathay Pacific Airways said it still had confidence in Hactl's ability to safely handle cargo in time for the airport's opening. The airline noted it may need to make short-term adjustments to cargo schedules or handling procedures to accommodate the limited capacity.

The opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport has been delayed multiple times due to construction challenges over the last several years. However, government officials have stated that the airport will open in April 1998 and that there will be no further delays.
