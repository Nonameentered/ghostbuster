Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd Handles Dangerous Live Snake Cargoes for Traditional Chinese Medicine  

Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (Hactl) is handling a new cargo of live snakes to be shipped to China for use in traditional Chinese medicine. According to a Hactl spokesperson, the air cargo terminal received 3,000 live cobras and rat snakes over the weekend to be exported to China. The reptiles were kept in ventilated boxes for their journey.

The shipment of live snakes is part of the growing wildlife and exotic animal trade in Asia fueled by demand for their parts in traditional Chinese medicine. In China, snake parts like gallbladders, blood, and meat are considered delicacies and are used in some traditional remedies. According to reports, the trade in snakes and other rare wildlife can threaten some species.  

Hactl adhered to guidelines for the humane shipment of live animals, the spokesperson said, including proper ventilation, temperature control, and limited numbers of snakes per box. However, animal rights groups have criticized the shipment of live snakes, calling the trade cruel and unethical. The groups argue that capturing and transporting wildlife often causes immense stress and suffering to the animals.

The shipment of live reptiles also poses risks to handlers, cargo staff, and biosecurity. Snakes can carry parasites and diseases transmittable to humans, even when handled carefully. If mishandled or if the boxes were damaged or opened during transit, the snakes could have escaped and posed risks at the airport or on the aircraft.

Hactl handles over 3.5 million tons of air cargo annually and has experience in transporting exotic live animals. However, shipments of live wildlife remain controversial given the various risks to animals, humans, and the environment. Tighter controls and crackdowns on the illegal wildlife trade have been called for to curb this growing industry.
