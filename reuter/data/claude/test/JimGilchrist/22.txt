Cathay Pacific Expands Cargo Services with New Auckland Office  

Cathay Pacific today announced the opening of a new cargo office in Auckland, New Zealand. The Auckland office will serve as a regional hub for Cathay Pacific cargo operations, supporting import and export customers across New Zealand.

"New Zealand is an important market for Cathay Pacific Cargo, and demand for air cargo services continues to grow substantially," said Frosti Lau, Cathay Pacific's Cargo Director. "Our new Auckland office and staff will allow us to provide enhanced service offerings tailored to New Zealand's unique needs. We remain committed to connecting New Zealand businesses to key markets across Asia, Europe, and North America through our extensive network and cargo solutions."  

Cathay Pacific currently offers daily wide-body freighter services to Auckland, including Boeing 747-8 and 777 freighter aircraft. The airline also operates daily passenger flights between Hong Kong and Auckland, offering cargo capacity on those flights as well. With the additional freighter services launched in 2020, Cathay Pacific now offers up to 19 tonnes of cargo capacity each day between New Zealand and Hong Kong.

The new Auckland office will have a staff of 10 cargo professionals, including those focused on sales and marketing, cargo operations, and customer service. Cathay Pacific has seen demand for pharmaceuticals, seafood, dairy products, and other perishables grow significantly in recent years. The airline uses specialized cold chain and temperature-controlled solutions to transport these goods.  

Ross Jamieson, Cathay Pacific Country Manager for New Zealand, said the new office reflects Cathay Pacific's confidence in the New Zealand market. "Our cargo and passenger flights provide vital connectivity for traders, importers, and exporters in New Zealand. This new investment will enable us to provide an even better experience for our customers, with local staff and expertise."  

The Cathay Pacific cargo office officially opened on 1 September 2020. New Zealand-based businesses interested in air cargo shipping solutions can contact the team in Auckland to discuss their needs.
