Hong Kong air cargo handling sees 10.35% rise in October compared to last year 

Hong Kong air cargo volume rose 10.35% in October compared to the same month last year, indicating a continued recovery in the city's exports. According to statistics from the Hong Kong Airport Authority, Hong Kong International Airport handled 435,000 tons of cargo in October, an increase of 41,000 tons year-on-year.

Export volume grew 11.4% in October, with major export destinations like Mainland China, the US and key markets in Europe and Asia showing strong growth. Imports also picked up during the month, rising 8.5% compared to October 2020. The strong demand is attributed to the revival of global trade as more countries emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and economic activity resumes around the world.  

"While global cargo demand has normalized and stabilized, the demand in Hong Kong remains strong with October seeing double-digit year-on-year growth," said Vivian Cheung, Executive Director of Airport Operations at Hong Kong International Airport. She added that the cargo segment continues to demonstrate its resilience and the airport stands ready to support airlines in reinstating more cargo services and routes.

The latest figures provide further evidence of a rebound in Hong Kong's economy which suffered its worst recession on record last year due to the pandemic and months of anti-government protests. Exports and trade are a major driver of the city's economy, so the strong uptick in air cargo volume points to improved prospects ahead. However, some analysts warn that new waves of COVID-19 outbreaks around the world could weigh on demand if countries reinstate strict social distancing rules or border controls. The outlook remains positive but uncertainty persists as the pandemic situation continues to evolve globally.
