Hong Kong's Air Cargo Handling Sees 10.35% Growth in October Compared to Last Year  

Hong Kong's air cargo throughput rose 10.35% in October compared to the same month last year, according to statistics released by the Hong Kong Airport Authority  The improving global economy and strong demand for air cargo shipments during the traditional peak season ahead of Christmas led to the double-digit growth.

Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) handled 395,000 tonnes of cargo in October, compared to 358,000 tonnes in October last year. Export volume increased 11.2% to 228,000 tonnes, while import volume rose 9.2% to 167,000 tonnes.

Air cargo to and from North America and Europe registered the strongest growth, up 15% and 12% respectively compared to October 2018. Cargo throughput to and from Mainland China and Southeast Asia also recorded steady increases.

"Hong Kong's air cargo hub is benefitting from the resumption of growth in the global economy and traditional peak season effects," said Anita Lam, General Manager of Cargo and Logistics Development of the Airport Authority Hong Kong. "We expect the positive momentum to continue for the rest of 2019 contingent on the progress in trade discussions between Mainland China and the US."

The continued weakening of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar also supported growth in transhipment cargo in Hong Kong during the month. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, so a weaker currency means goods passing through Hong Kong are cheaper for traders buying in other currencies.

The Airport Authority is continuing various initiatives to strengthen HKIA's status as an international air cargo hub. A midfield cargo terminal with an annual capacity of 2.8 million tonnes per annum commenced operation in February this year. Other facilities expansion including a premium logistics center and an additional cargo stand are underway and expected to provide more capacity for cargo aircraft in the coming years.

HKIA is among the busiest cargo airports in the world and a key regional distribution hub for goods in Asia. Cargo makes up about 40% of HKIA's total air traffic. The airport handled a record 5.1 million tonnes of cargo throughput in 2018. Airport authorities aim to boost the figure to 6 million tonnes per annum over the next few years.
