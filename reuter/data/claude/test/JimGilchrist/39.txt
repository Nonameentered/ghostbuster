Cathay Pacific Airways welcomes approval for second runway at Manchester airport 

Cathay Pacific Airways has welcomed the UK government's approval for Manchester Airport to build a second runway. The runway is expected to boost capacity and enable more long-haul routes from Hong Kong and other Asian cities.

Manchester Airport, the third busiest airport in the UK, received approval to construct a second runway to keep up with growing passenger demand. The new runway is expected to be completed in 2023 and will allow the airport to increase flights, especially long-haul services to key destinations in North America, Middle East and Asia.

Cathay Pacific currently operates daily nonstop flights between Hong Kong and Manchester, with a flight time of around 11 hours. A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said, "We welcome the UK government's decision to approve the expansion of Manchester Airport. The additional runway capacity will enable us to further strengthen our connectivity between Hong Kong and the North of England by increasing flight frequency or upgauging to larger aircraft."

With over 200 destinations worldwide, Cathay Pacific sees opportunity in the long-haul market from the North of England. The airline has said it will closely monitor demand on its Hong Kong-Manchester route once the new runway opens, with a view to increasing frequency to twice daily or deploying a higher capacity Airbus A350 aircraft.

Many business leaders in the region also applauded the government's decision, saying improved international connections will boost trade and tourism. The approval came despite some local opposition over noise and environmental concerns. The airport has pledged over Â£1 billion to mitigate noise and air quality issues. Campaigners have said they may take legal action to halt the project.

Manchester Airport CEO Andrew Cowan said, "This decision enables us to build on our success by doubling our runway capacity and creating tens of thousands of local jobs. We take our environmental responsibilities extremely seriously."
