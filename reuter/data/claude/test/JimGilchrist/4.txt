Air Foyle to Fly Flight Simulators into China for Business Growth

Air Foyle, a provider of professional flight simulation and training services, announced today that it will be expanding into China to meet growing demand for its services. The company will be shipping two full-flight Airbus A320 simulators to a new training center in Shanghai, which is set to open in the third quarter of this year.

“There is enormous potential for growth in the Chinese aviation market, both for airlines expanding their fleets as well as the need to train new pilots to fly all these aircraft,” said John McIntyre, CEO of Air Foyle. “By establishing a physical presence with our state-of-the-art simulators in China, we will be able to serve both existing and new customers locally while tailoring our training to the specific needs of Chinese airlines.”

Air Foyle has provided training for pilots and cabin crew in the UK, Europe and the Middle East for over 40 years. However, an increasing number of enquiries were coming from airlines in China and the wider Asia-Pacific region in recent years. The new Shanghai center will have an initial capacity for training up to 600 pilots per year on Airbus A320 aircraft, the workhorse of many short-haul Asian airlines. Air Foyle plans to source many instructors and engineers locally to support operations.

The investment in the new Shanghai facility and simulators is around $25 million, according to Air Foyle. McIntyre said the company projects this initial investment will generate over $40 million in revenue within the first five years of operation. Depending on market demand, Air Foyle will also consider shipping simulators for other aircraft types, like the Boeing 737, to Shanghai to enable training for more clients.

With airlines in China adding almost 2,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years, according to Airbus forecasts, the potential for future growth of Air Foyle's new Shanghai center seems sky high. The simulator docking marked an important milestone in Air Foyle's global expansion ambitions. The company aims to establish itself as a leading provider of flight crew training solutions in China and across Asia.
