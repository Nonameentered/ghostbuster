Taiwan Ranks Second in Air Cargo Traffic Handled by Hong Kong Airport, with Growth of 33.55% 

Hong Kong International Airport has released its cargo volume figures for 2019, showing Taiwan as the second largest cargo destination, with a 33.55% year-on-year increase in cargo handled. The airport processed 5.6 million metric tons of cargo last year, a decline of 6.1% from 2018. However, cargo volume to and from Taiwan grew substantially to 851,000 metric tons, second only to mainland China.

The surge in Taiwan-Hong Kong air cargo traffic reflects the close economic ties between the two regions. Taiwan is a major trading partner for Hong Kong, especially in electronics, machinery, and agricultural goods. The increase was driven in large part by higher exports of technology products from Taiwan to global markets through the Hong Kong aviation hub. Hong Kong also serves as an important transshipment center for time-sensitive goods from Taiwan. 

The director of the Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited, which operates the airport’s cargo terminals, attributed the strong growth on the route to increasing demand for high-value technology and perishable goods. He noted that air cargo provides speed and reliability for industries where timeliness is critical.

However, the overall decline in total air cargo handled by Hong Kong Airport indicates the ongoing global economic slowdown and trade tensions. Hong Kong’s role as a logistics hub depends heavily on the free flow of goods and capital, both of which are under pressure. The airport is facing significant competition from rival ports in mainland China and the wider region. To maintain its competitiveness, the airport is investing in new technologies to increase efficiency and implementing incentives to attract key cargo partners.

The surge of cargo to and from Taiwan highlights the island’s enduring close ties to Hong Kong in trade and logistics chains. But the boost was not enough to offset the wider decline in volumes through Hong Kong. The airport’s status as an international air cargo leader hinges on a recovery in global trade and a successful adjustment to technological and geopolitical shifts reshaping supply chains in Asia and worldwide. Overall, the figures point to a mix of challenges and opportunities for Hong Kong’s air cargo sector in the year ahead.
