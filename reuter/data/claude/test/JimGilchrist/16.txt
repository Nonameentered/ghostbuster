Regional Manager for Air France Cargo to Meet with Hong Kong Officials over Fuel Surcharge Dispute with Airlines

The Regional Manager for Air France Cargo's Asia Pacific operations, Pierre Dubois, announced today that he will travel to Hong Kong next week to meet with officials from the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department. The meetings are aimed at resolving an ongoing dispute over fuel surcharges levied by Air France and other European airlines on cargo shipments from Hong Kong.

For the past six months, Air France and several other airlines including KLM and Lufthansa have added significant fuel surcharges on all cargo shipments from Hong Kong to European destinations. The airlines argue that the surcharges are necessary to offset the high cost of jet fuel for long-haul flights from Asia to Europe. However, officials in Hong Kong claim the surcharges are excessive and constitute price gouging by the airlines. In a press statement, the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department said the surcharges "are not consistent with a fair and competitive cargo market."  

Air France currently adds a surcharge of 38 euros per kilogram of cargo on all shipments from Hong Kong to Paris. This amounts to thousands of euros in extra fees for a single large cargo shipment. The new surcharges have angered freight forwarders and exporters in Hong Kong who claim they are damaging the competitiveness of Hong Kong's export industries. 

Mr. Dubois told reporters that he hopes to find a compromise solution with Hong Kong officials that addresses their concerns while still allowing the airlines to adequately cover costs. If no agreement can be reached, Air France may consider reducing cargo capacities or frequencies to and from Hong Kongâ€”a move that could impact trade and the broader economy.

All sides appear keen to resolve the dispute before it escalates further. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said, "We welcome Mr. Dubois' visit and hope to have a productive exchange of views on how best to facilitate trade and strengthen the cargo transport sector, to the benefit of both the airlines and Hong Kong businesses." The meetings will take place in Hong Kong starting Tuesday, with details on any resolutions or agreements expected by the end of the week.
