Cargo airlines may seek cheaper alternatives to Hong Kong's new airport 

The opening of Hong Kong's new HK$140 billion airport next month may prompt some cargo airlines to divert flights to cheaper hubs in the region. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (Hactl) said this week that cargo handling charges at the new airport will be 20-30% higher compared to the existing Kai Tak airport. 

The higher charges are due to the capital costs of the new airport, including its state-of-the-art facilities like automated baggage handling systems and technologically advanced cargo terminals. However, the increase in fees may make Hong Kong's airport less appealing and competitive as a cargo transit hub. Airlines may opt to shift cargo flights to lower-cost airports in Guangzhou, Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.

“The new airport definitely provides advantages with its greater air traffic and cargo handling capacity. However, the higher charges do create a compelling business case for cargo airlines to evaluate alternative hubs,” said Andrew Herdman, Director General of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. He estimated that up to 20% of Hong Kong's cargo throughput may move to other airports.

Air freight is a key economic contributor for Hong Kong, generating over HK$100 billion annually and employing over 60,000 people. A diversion of cargo flights would deal a blow to the city's economy. In response, Hong Kong Airport Authority said it will implement rebate schemes to attract airlines, especially in the initial years of the new airport's operation.

Some cargo carriers and freight forwarders are also urging the government to temporarily subsidize airport charges to remain competitive. They warned that if charges are not lowered, Hong Kong may lose its status as Asia's top cargo airport and airfreight center. 

“Hong Kong built this world-class facility but may end up watching cargo flights fly off to its rivals,” said Kerwin Chan, managing director of cargo operator Certis International. “Temporary relief measures are needed to avoid such a scenario. Once cargo traffic volume has built up, fees can then be adjusted gradually,” he said.

The new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok will open on July 6. It has capacity for up to 34 cargo flights an hour, with freight facilities that span more than 200 hectares. While its long term prospects remain bright, its appeal as a cargo transit point may be tested in the coming years as rivals step up competition to gain market share. The cargo industry will be closely monitoring how Hong Kong navigates challenges to its airfreight dominance in the region.
