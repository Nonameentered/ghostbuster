Cathay Pacific Airways Tests 'Shark Skin' Coating to Revolutionize Air Travel and Reduce Fuel Costs  

Cathay Pacific Airways announced today that it will be testing a new 'shark skin' coating on a Boeing 777 aircraft in an effort to improve fuel efficiency and reduce costs. The coating mimics the microscopic surface structure of shark skin, which allows sharks to glide efficiently through water. When applied to aircraft, these biomimetic surfaces can reduce drag and improve performance.

"We are always looking for innovative ways to improve our environmental performance and reduce costs," said Rupert Hogg, CEO of Cathay Pacific. "The shark skin coating could represent a breakthrough in aerodynamics that significantly improves fuel efficiency for air travel. If testing is successful, this could revolutionize commercial aviation."

The rough, tooth-like scales of shark skin, called denticles, allow water to flow smoothly over the shark. The coating for aircraft uses a synthetic polymer material to replicate this pattern, resulting in a surface that deters the buildup of microdrag. Trials of the coating on model aircraft have shown a 6-7% reduction in drag, which can translate to substantial annual fuel and cost savings for airlines.  

Cathay Pacific will test the shark skin coating on a Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, starting in January 2019. Half of the aircraft will receive the coating, while the other half will remain uncoated as a control surface. The airline will compare the performance of the two surfaces over 6-12 months of regular commercial long-haul flights. Cathay Pacific has estimated that if the testing confirms the expected benefits, coating their entire long-haul fleet could reduce their annual fuel costs by over $12 million and carbon dioxide emissions by over 38,000 tons.

While other airlines have experimented with shark skin coatings, Cathay Pacific will be the first airline to test the technology on a commercial aircraft in real-world conditions over an extended period. "If this trial is successful, shark skin coatings could significantly impact aviation and Cathay Pacific's own sustainability," said Hogg. The results of the airline's testing will be eagerly awaited by both industry and environmental groups worldwide. The potential to substantially reduce fuel use and emissions with a simple surface coating would be an incredible step forward for sustainable aviation.
