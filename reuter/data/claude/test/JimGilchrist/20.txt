Hong Kong's Air Cargo Industry Booms During Peak Season, Especially for Europe-Bound Flights 

Hong Kong's air cargo industry is experiencing a seasonal boom, especially for cargo bound for Europe, according to recent data and industry executives. The cargo peak season, which runs from October to December to coincide with the year-end holiday rush, is seeing a surge in demand for high-value goods transported via Hong Kong to major retail markets in Europe.

Total air cargo throughput at Hong Kong International Airport for October increased 9% year-on-year, according to statistics from the Hong Kong Airport Authority. The rise in cargo was particularly strong for flights between Hong Kong and Europe, increasing 17% compared to October 2018. The increase was driven by strong demand for luxury goods, high-tech products, perishable foods and e-commerce shipments, airport officials said.

The buoyant figures reflect Hong Kong's vital role as an air cargo super-connector for trade between Asia and Europe. "Hong Kong is the only major city that offers a four-flight cargo service to Frankfurt in Germany and Amsterdam in Netherlands, with a total of 10 pure freighter flights a week to Europe during the peak season," said Vivian Lau, general manager of cargo and logistics development at the Hong Kong Airport Authority.

The peak season boom is a welcome development for Hong Kong's air cargo industry, which has been buffeted by the U.S.-China trade war and slowing global trade this year. Hong Kong's total air cargo throughput declined 5.2% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period last year. The peak season uptick is providing some relief, although the gains may be short-lived if trade tensions persist into 2020, industry experts warned.

Several major cargo airlines reported strong demand and volumes on Europe-bound routes during the peak season. Lufthansa Cargo, for example, said cargo capacity on flights between Frankfurt and Hong Kong have been fully booked for the peak season, driven by demand for machinery parts, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce shipments.

Some logistics companies in Hong Kong also said they have seen a double-digit rise in air cargo shipments to Europe compared to a year ago. "Demand for premium air freight services to key European markets like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London is very strong this peak season as our customers scramble to get high-value, time-sensitive goods to retailers and consumers in time for the holidays," said Charles Wong, director of Momentum Logistics.
