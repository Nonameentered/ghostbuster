Airline and Freight Forwarders Expect Mini-Boom Before Chinese New Year, Despite Firm Rates: Reuters Survey Shows

Global airlines and freight forwarders expect a surge in cargo volumes ahead of the Chinese New Year in February, as manufacturers rush to get goods to their customers before an extended holiday break. The traditional pre-Lunar New Year cargo rush - known as "guo qiang" in China - comes despite rising air cargo rates, a Reuters poll of 10 freight companies found. 

Air cargo rates have been rising steadily since October due to high demand and tight capacity. The Baltic Air Freight Index has gained 25% over the past three months and air cargo rates on major routes are currently up 15-20% from a year ago. Still, the temporary boost in volumes around the Chinese New Year is expected to offset the impact of higher rates on total air freight revenues over the next month.

"There is usually a mini-peak in air cargo ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday. We expect a 10% jump in volumes in January due to the pre-holiday rush," said a Singapore-based freight forwarder active in Asia. The firm handles cargo operations for major technology and retail brands. China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday starts on Feb. 12 next year. Factories in China will shut down for an extended break and that should prompt clients to fly in more goods in the weeks leading up to the festival to avoid supply chain disruptions.

Three large European freight forwarders also expect a spike of up to 15% in air cargo volumes from Asia in January compared to a year ago. Two U.S. freight companies are anticipating a more moderate 5-8% rise in volumes ahead of the Chinese New Year. Airlines in Asia, including Cathay Pacific, Korean Air and Japan's ANA Holdings, are preparing for a busy period and have added more cargo flights in January. Extra cargo capacity will likely prevent a sharper rise in freight rates next month, capping spot rate gains to around 5%, carriers said. 

Demand for perishables, electronics, luxury goods and e-commerce shipments should drive the pre-holiday cargo movements, the survey showed. Shipments usually start rising sharply in the second and third weeks of January. Volumes then fall quickly after the holiday and remain weak for several weeks. The soft patch following the Chinese New Year, known as the "guo fu" period, could weigh on cargo rates and revenues in February and March, respondents said. 

The year-end holiday cargo spike augurs well for air freight volumes and rates at the start of 2020. But the fast-spreading Wuhan virus is a new risk that threatens to curb consumer demand and industrial activity in China, crippling air freight, survey respondents warned. The virus has already reduced passenger flights in China and this may soon hit cargo capacity and demand.

"A lot will depend on how quickly China can contain the virus outbreak. If it drags on, the cargo market may face a rocky first quarter," said an executive at a global logistics company. But if the outbreak is swiftly brought under control, the air freight sector should continue its gradual recovery this year, helped by restocking demand, a limited boost from trade deal effects and the Chinese government's commitments to boosting domestic consumption, the survey showed.
