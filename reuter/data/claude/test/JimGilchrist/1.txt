TNT Express Worldwide to Double Staff in China and Open Five New Branches

TNT Express Worldwide, one of the world's largest express delivery companies, announced today plans to double its staff in China over the next three years and open five new branch offices across the country. The expansion is aimed at tapping into China's fast-growing e-commerce market and supporting the delivery needs of both Chinese businesses as well as international companies with customers in China.

"China has quickly grown into one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world, and demand for fast, reliable delivery services is surging," said Jenny Wong, CEO of TNT Express Worldwide China. "Our expansion will allow us to better serve the delivery needs of businesses and e-commerce companies throughout China."

TNT Express Worldwide currently has over 5,000 employees in China across 150 locations. Under the expansion plans, the company will hire an additional 5,000 staff to help pick up, transport and deliver up to 2 million packages per day. The new hires will include drivers, warehouse staff, customer service representatives, and managers. 

The company is also launching five new branch offices in the Chinese cities of Chengdu, Nanjing, Shenyang, Shenzhen, and Xi'an. The branch offices will have their own delivery vehicles, warehouses, and customer service teams to transport goods within each city and connect with TNT's nationwide delivery network.

E-commerce companies and other businesses in China are partnering with express delivery firms as demand for fast and efficient shipping services continues to climb. China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, valued at more than $1.5 trillion per year, with most e-commerce companies offering same-day or next-day delivery options.

TNT Express Worldwide sees huge opportunity in China's e-commerce boom and aims to provide domestic delivery services within all major Chinese cities. The company also ships goods from Chinese businesses to customers globally, connecting China's logistics infrastructure to TNT's international delivery operations across 220 countries and territories.

TNT Express Worldwide's expansion plans in China will unfold over the next three years as new staff are hired and branch offices open in phases. The company hopes its larger presence will allow it to become a leader in China's competitive delivery and logistics market. Overall, TNT Express aims to grow its revenue in China by 50-60% over the next five years.
