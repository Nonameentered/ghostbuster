Air Canada Eyes New Asian Destinations Including Tokyo and Singapore 

Air Canada is looking to expand its flight offerings to Asian destinations according to a new report by the airline. The carrier proposed adding new nonstop routes to Tokyo's Narita Airport and Singapore's Changi Airport starting in June 2020. Air Canada currently offers seasonal service to Tokyo and year-round flights to Singapore, but these new routes would increase flight frequency and connect more Canadian cities to these Asian hubs.

The new Tokyo route would fly three times weekly between Vancouver and Narita airport, providing service to Japan's capital city in addition to Air Canada's existing daily Tokyo flights from Toronto and Montreal. Vancouver is a logical choice for this expansion given the city's large Asian population and popularity with Japanese tourists. Air Canada hopes these additional flights will boost traffic between western Canada and Japan. 

In Singapore, Air Canada plans to operate daily flights between Vancouver and Changi Airport. This would mark the first direct route between western Canada and Singapore. Vancouver's appeal to Asian travelers and Singapore's role as a key commercial and transit hub make it an attractive market for Air Canada. The airline expects strong demand for flights to Singapore from Vancouver's sizable Southeast Asian community as well as business travelers and tourists.

Air Canada's proposed expansion in Asia comes as part of the airline's wider strategy to develop its international network. "There is great potential for Air Canada to continue developing its network in the Asia Pacific region, including in new markets such as Tokyo and Singapore," said Mark Galardo, Air Canada's Vice President of Network Planning. Strong economies and a burgeoning middle class in Asia have strengthened demand for air travel, and Air Canada aims to benefit from this growth.

Subject to government approval, tickets for Air Canada's new Vancouver-Tokyo and Vancouver-Singapore routes would go on sale later this year ahead of the planned June 2020 launch date. The new flights are poised to give travelers on the west coast more options to reach prime Asian destinations with the convenience of direct service. For Air Canada, this expansion could bring greater connectivity in a region that promises to be one of the most significant sources of international traffic over the coming decades.
