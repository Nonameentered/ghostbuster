Cathay Pacific's Boeing 747-400 Becomes World's First Cargo Aircraft to Use Revolutionary FANS Routes

Cathay Pacific announced today that one of its Boeing 747-400 cargo aircraft became the world's first cargo plane to operate along Free Route Airspace (FRA) between Hong Kong and Anchorage, enhancing flight efficiency and reducing emissions.

Free Route Airspace allows aircraft to fly freely without the constraints of the predefined network of airways. This allows more direct routes between departure and arrival airports, shortening flying time and saving fuel.

Cathay Pacific collaborated with the Civil Aviation Department, Hong Kong, and the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S., to get approval for cargo flights to leverage Free Route Airspace between Hong Kong and Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. On January 10, one of Cathay Pacific Cargo's Boeing 747-400 freighters completed the first flight utilizing Free Route Airspace, flying directly from Hong Kong to Anchorage. 

"We are delighted to become the world's first cargo airline to operate flights in Free Route Airspace," said Frosti Lau, General Manager Cargo Service Delivery, Cathay Pacific. "The ability to plan and fly the most direct routes will allow us to achieve greater operational efficiencies, reduce fuel burn and emissions, and provide reliable delivery of cargo for our customers."

The flights between Hong Kong and Anchorage can now travel up to 200 nautical miles more directly, shortening flight times by 30-45 minutes. This results in saving approximately 6,000-9,000 kg of fuel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 19,000-28,000 kg per flight. Annually, Cathay Pacific Cargo expects to operate over 1,100 cargo flights through Free Route Airspace between Hong Kong and Anchorage, generating substantial environmental benefits.
