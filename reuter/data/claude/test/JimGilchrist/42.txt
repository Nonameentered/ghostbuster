British Airways World Cargo Raises Ex-Hong Kong Market Rates by HK$1.50 Per Kilo to Account for Rising Fuel Prices   

British Airways World Cargo announced today that it will raise its market rates for cargo shipments out of Hong Kong by HK$1.50 per kilogram. The rate increase will take effect starting August 1 to account for the rising cost of jet fuel.

"The price of fuel has increased nearly 50 percent since the start of the year, significantly impacting our costs," said John Thompson, Commercial Director of British Airways World Cargo. "We have absorbed as much of the additional cost as possible, but the sustained rise in oil prices means we have to pass some of that cost on to customers to continue operating."

The rate increase will apply to all cargo shipments on British Airways flights departing Hong Kong for destinations across the airline's global network. Theadjusted market rates will vary depending on the destination. The airline said it will continue to offer discounts and incentives for key customers and partners. 

Industry analysts expect other air cargo carriers to follow British Airwaysâ€™ lead and increase their rates and fuel surcharges in the coming months. According to IATA, fuel now accounts for almost 50 percent of total airline operating costs, reducing profitability across the aviation sector. Most major carriers have already revised earnings forecasts downwards due to rising costs.

"Unless there is a sharp reversal in oil prices, the pressure is on all airlines to recoup at least some of the additional cost through higher fares and other means," said Peter Cassidy, Chief Economist at Air Cargo Analytics. "Demand for air freight has remained strong so far this year, but these sustained cost increases will ultimately impact shipping volumes if they continue for much longer."

British Airways operates three Boeing 777 freighter flights each week between Hong Kong and London Heathrow, with onward connections to the rest of the world. The airline said the latest rate increase will not impact any existing contract rates for customers. New contract rates, however, will be set at the adjusted market level.
