Hong Kong Air Cargo Workers to Pioneer "Unique" Computerised Rota System for Improved Efficiency 

HONG KONG â€“ Air cargo handlers at Hong Kong International Airport are set to become the first in the world to use an automated rostering system that uses artificial intelligence to optimize work schedules. The new computerized system is expected to greatly improve efficiency and working conditions for the more than 10,000 people at the airport handling air shipments.

The rostering system, developed by Hong Kong-based logistics technology firm OutlogiQ in partnership with airport authorities and major cargo handling companies, will automatically assign shifts and tasks to individual workers based on their qualifications, experience, and employment conditions. The algorithms will consider factors such as avoiding excessively long shifts, granting adequate rest periods, and matching staffing levels to cargo volumes to maximize productivity and resource utilization.

"This innovative rostering tool will be a game-changer for our industry," said Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Air Cargo Industry Forum. "By using advanced AI and optimization algorithms, it can create optimal, personalized shift schedules for all our workers that meet both business needs as well as human needs. This will significantly enhance operational efficiency and also improve job satisfaction and retention."

The system is set to launch next month and will be rolled out to over 1,000 employees across major cargo terminals at the airport, handling almost 5 million tons of cargo annually.  If successful, the technology could potentially be expanded to the airport's other cargo and passenger handling staff.

Some workers initially expressed concern the automated system may reduce overtime opportunities or make the job too rigid. However, the developers stressed that the algorithms are designed to match staffing to actual workload and also provide flexibility to account for unexpected needs. The system will still rely on human managers to oversee final work assignments and make adjustments as needed.
