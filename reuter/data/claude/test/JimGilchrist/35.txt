EVA Air to Launch New Freight Service from Taipei to Brussels and Expand Cargo Fleet  

Taiwan's EVA Air announced today plans to launch direct cargo service between Taipei and Brussels, Belgium starting in July this year. The new route will allow EVA Air Cargo to meet the growing demand for air freight between Asia and Europe. The service will operate three times a week using Boeing 777 freighters.

Along with the new route, EVA Air also announced an expansion of its cargo fleet with the lease of three additional Boeing 777 freighters. This will bring EVA's cargo fleet to a total of 21 aircraft, making it the third largest cargo airline in Asia. The expansion will allow EVA to increase frequency on existing routes as well as launch new cargo routes to high-demand destinations.  

The Taipei-Brussels route is a strategic addition for EVA Air Cargo, connecting two important cargo hubs and commercial centers. "Taiwan and Belgium are major trading partners, exchanging goods like machinery, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. We see a lot of potential for growth on this new cargo route," said Clay Sun, President of EVA Air Cargo.  

EVA Air Cargo currently operates an extensive network covering over 40 major destinations in Asia, Europe, and North America. The cargo carrier is known for transporting high-tech goods and perishable products that require speedy delivery. Thanks to its modern fleet of Boeing 777 freighters, EVA can ensure fast transit times and maintain high quality standards for temperature-controlled shipments on long-haul routes.

The new Brussels route and additional freighters are part of EVA Air Cargo's ambitious expansion plans to capture growing cargo volumes worldwide. "Air cargo demand has picked up significantly as the economy recovers and global trade rebounds. EVA Air Cargo is committed to providing more capacity and connectivity to support our customers and partners," said Sun. The cargo airline aims to launch several new routes to Europe and North America over the next two years.
