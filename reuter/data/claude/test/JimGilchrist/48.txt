Investigation Continues into Cause of Fire on Malaysian Airline System Airbus A330-300 Aircraft at Singapore's Changi Airport  

Singapore's Changi Airport was the scene of a dramatic incident yesterday as a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 caught fire shortly after landing. The plane, carrying 282 passengers and 18 crew, had landed safely after a flight from Kuala Lumpur. Minutes after landing and taxiing to the gate, the crew reported smoke in the cabin and cockpit. The airport's emergency services were immediately activated. 

Passengers were urgently evacuated via emergency slides as smoke began billowing from the plane. Within minutes, the aircraft was engulfed in flames, with photos and videos capturing the plane ablaze at the gate. There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew as a result of the evacuation.

The fire was eventually extinguished by airport firefighters, though the extent of damage to the aircraft is still being assessed. The fire appears to have started in the cockpit area based on initial observations, though the actual cause remains unknown at this time according to investigators.

The aircraft, registered as 9M-MTM, entered service with Malaysia Airlines in June 2016. Malaysia Airlines has advised that the safety of passengers and crew is its top priority and it is cooperating fully with airport authorities and government safety investigators to determine the root cause of the fire. The aircraft's cockpit voice and flight data recorders have been recovered and will be analyzed as part of the investigation.

Changi Airport has resumed normal operations though some flight delays and cancellations continued into the evening due to the earlier runway closure. The aircraft remains on the tarmac at the gate as air safety investigators continue their work. All evidence is being carefully gathered and analyzed to piece together the sequence of events leading to what was ultimately a safe evacuation of all passengers and crew despite the substantial fire and smoke. The investigation is ongoing.
