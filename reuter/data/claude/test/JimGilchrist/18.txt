Polar Air Cargo reduces Hong Kong to US freighter flights during end-of-year lull

Polar Air Cargo, the freight carrier subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, announced it will reduce the number of flights between Hong Kong and the United States during the seasonal end-of-year slowdown in air cargo demand. 

Starting in mid-December, Polar Air Cargo will decrease its weekly roundtrip flights between Hong Kong and key US cargo hubs like Anchorage, Alaska and Cincinnati, Ohio. The schedule reduction will continue through mid-January.

“Air cargo volumes traditionally decline for a few weeks over the Christmas and Chinese New Year holidays as many businesses experience a slowdown,” said Dave Wild, vice president of operations for Polar Air Cargo. “By slightly reducing our flight frequencies during this period, we can better match our capacity to demand.”

Even with the temporary reduction in flights, Polar Air Cargo will still operate nearly 250 cargo flights each week, ensuring robust service for customers shipping goods like perishables, pharmaceuticals, and e-commerce products that require air transport even during the seasonal lull. The carrier’s Boeing 747 freighter aircraft will return to their normal busy-season schedules by the third week of January.

“While there’s a modest slowdown over the next few weeks, the overall trend of solid air freight demand and growth continues,” Wild said. “E-commerce has driven huge volumes year-round now, so the troughs are not as deep as they used to be historically. Polar is committed to serving our customers 365 days a year and meeting the needs of the global supply chain.” 

Polar Air Cargo has served the Hong Kong-US cargo market for over 30 years. In that time, the peak season for air freight leading up to the winter holidays has grown steadily shorter, a signal of the maturing e-commerce sector and popularity of faster shipping options. The carrier’s temporary network changes are designed to maximize efficiency during this abbreviated busy period and ensure resources are focused where demand is strongest.
