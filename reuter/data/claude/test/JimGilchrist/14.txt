Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal Sets New Record Handling 5,700 Tonnes in One Day  

The Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminal Limited (Hactl) set a new record on October 15th by handling 5,700 tonnes of cargo in a single day. This surpasses the previous record of 5,300 tonnes, set in December 2017. 

Hactl, which operates the SuperTerminal 1 facility at Hong Kong International Airport, attributed the new record to strong demand and seasonal airfreight flows before the holiday season. “Our teams were extremely busy but remained focused and handled the massive volumes efficiently and securely,” said Hactl’s CEO.

Hong Kong Airport is the world’s busiest cargo airport, processing over 5 million tonnes of cargo annually. Hactl provides cargo handling services to over 60 airlines at the airport, processing 70% of the total cargo volume. The SuperTerminal 1 facility spans over 2.5 million square feet with state-of-the-art cargo handling systems and security screening equipment.

The new daily record highlights Hong Kong’s strategic importance as an aviation and logistics hub, especially for cargo flows between Mainland China and the rest of the world. October is typically the peak season for air cargo in preparation for the year-end holiday demand in Western markets. Hactl expects continued growth in volumes in the coming months driven by strong consumer appetite for popular gifts like electronics, food items, and luxury goods.

While 5,700 tonnes is an impressive figure, Hactl’s CEO said the terminal still has spare handling capacity. “We have substantial room for growth and continue upgrading our infrastructure and technologies to provide the best services for our airline customers,” he said. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Hactl aims to break the 6,000 tonne level before the end of the year. Overall, optimism remains high for robust growth and new milestones for Hong Kong’s air cargo industry.
