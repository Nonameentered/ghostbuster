Illegal mobile phone use across Chinese border disrupts air traffic control communications with Hong Kong flights

Air traffic control communications with incoming and outgoing flights at Hong Kong International Airport were disrupted for over 30 minutes today due to interference from illegal mobile phone signals across the border in mainland China. According to officials from Hong Kong Airport Authority (HKAA), radio frequency signals from mobile phones transmitting in the 800MHz range in Shenzhen city of China's Guangdong province disrupted VHF radio signals used by air traffic controllers and pilots to communicate with aircraft during arrival and departure.  

The disruption began around 10:15 am Hong Kong local time, when air traffic controllers started experiencing interference on their radio headsets. The interference then also affected VHF radio transmissions between controllers, pilots, and aircraft, making communications patchy and sometimes inaudible. As a precaution, air traffic control directed arriving aircraft to enter holding patterns above the airport and halted aircraft pushback and taxi from departure gates. A total of 37 arriving flights and 12 departing flights were delayed during this period.

Radio frequency interference from illegal or unlicensed mobile phone transmissions is suspected as the source based on initial investigation. The 800MHz range used for 4G mobile networks in Shenzhen city of China happens to be adjacent to the frequency range allocated for aeronautical VHF radio communications. Signals from mobile phones may have inadvertently or illegally overpowered the VHF radio signals, disrupting communications. The HKAA has registered a complaint with telecommunications authorities in Guangdong province to investigate and curb illegal transmissions to prevent reoccurrence. 

Normal airport operations and communications resumed around 10:50 am after the interference subsided. However, the disrupted flights experienced delays up to 50 minutes in arrivals and 25 minutes in departures. Passengers have been advised to check with airlines for any updates to flight schedules. The HKAA has apologized for inconvenience caused to passengers and airlines. Radio frequency interference from illegal mobile phone use in China has been an ongoing issue affecting Hong Kong airport communications, though most past incidents were minor. HKAA has called for closer cross-border coordination on telecommunications regulation and spectrum management to avoid disruptions to critical airport systems from signals beyond their control.
