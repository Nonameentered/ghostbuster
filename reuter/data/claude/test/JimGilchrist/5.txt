Cathay Pacific Increases Air Cargo Rates due to Higher Fuel Costs  

Cathay Pacific Airways announced this week that it will increase air cargo rates for shippers effective July 1st due to substantially higher fuel costs over the last six months. The Hong Kong-based carrier said fuel costs have increased nearly 40% since the beginning of the year and the rate hike is necessary to offset those additional costs.

According to the airline, cargo rates on long-haul routes from Hong Kong and other Asian hubs will increase between 5 to 10%, depending on the route. Short-haul routes within Asia will see smaller rate increases of around 3 to 5%. The rate increases apply to both regular cargo as well as cold-chain and other specialty shipments. 

"Like all airlines, fuel is by far our largest cost component, so significant increases in fuel prices have a major impact on our business," said Ronald Lam, Cathay Pacific's Director of Cargo. "While we have managed to save costs in other areas and increased operational efficiency, the sheer scale of fuel price rises means we must regrettably increase freight rates for customers to keep up."

Cathay Pacific said in a statement it will continue monitoring energy prices and make further rate changes if needed. The International Air Transport Association recently revised its 2019 profitability outlook for global airlines downward by $1 billion due to rising fuel costs. Unlike passenger fares, air cargo rates are not regulated and airlines determine rates based on market conditions and costs. Shippers renewing long-term cargo contracts will also see the higher rates built into their contracts.

The cargo rate hike by Cathay Pacific, while not unexpected, adds further cost pressure on shippers already burdened with higher fuel surcharges from multiple air carriers. However, shippers recognize that the increases are unavoidable for airlines in the current environment of historically high jet fuel prices.
