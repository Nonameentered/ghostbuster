Cathay Pacific Expands Air Cargo Opportunities with Purchase of Airbus A340 Aircraft 

Cathay Pacific Airways today announced the purchase of three Airbus A340 freighter aircraft to expand its cargo operations and meet growing demand for air freight in Asia. The new aircraft will allow Cathay Pacific Cargo to increase cargo capacity and open up new routes to additional destinations.

"Asia's economy continues to grow at an astounding rate, and with it comes increasing demand for the fast and efficient delivery of goods and components between countries in the region," said Ronald Lam, Chief Customer and Commercial Officer at Cathay Pacific. "The acquisition of three Airbus A340 freighters will provide immediate additional cargo capacity to enable new routes and frequencies for our customers."

The Airbus A340 is a long-range, four-engine aircraft that is a popular choice for cargo operations due to its payload capacity, range, and reliability. Cathay Pacific currently operates an all-Boeing fleet of aircraft for both passenger and cargo flights. The A340 freighters will be the first Airbus aircraft in Cathay's fleet and mark a significant expansion of the airline's cargo business.

"We are delighted that Cathay Pacific has selected the A340 freighter for its fleet expansion," said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer at Airbus. "The A340 is the most efficient and reliable freighter aircraft in its size category and has the capability to fulfill Cathay Pacific's ambitious route plans as they grow their cargo operation."

The first A340 freighter aircraft is scheduled for delivery to Cathay Pacific in the fourth quarter of 2020. The additional two freighters will be delivered in 2021. The aircraft will mainly operate within Asia to destinations such as Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, and Seoul before expanding to long-haul routes to Europe and North America. 

Cathay Pacific is headquartered in Hong Kong and operates more than 120 aircraft to over 190 destinations across the world. In addition to passengers, the airline also carries more than 1.6 million tons of cargo annually. The purchase of the A340 freighters is the latest in a series of investments to meet growing demand for cargo capacity and strengthen Hong Kong's position as one of the world's leading air cargo hubs.
