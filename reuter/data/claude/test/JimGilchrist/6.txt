Hong Kong's new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre hits 80% occupancy 

The Hong Kong Airport Authority announced today that its new Airport Freight Forwarding Centre (AFFC) has reached 80% occupancy, just six months after its soft launch. The state-of-the-art cargo handling facility is attracting strong interest from freight forwarders and cargo airlines.

Located within the Hong Kong International Airport cargo precinct, the AFFC provides advanced cargo handling infrastructure and value-added services to facilitate the growing air cargo volume. It offers direct access to the apron and runway, enabling faster turnaround of aircraft. The AFFC is also equipped with temperature-controlled facilities for handling temperature-sensitive cargo.  

Paul Cheng, Chairman of the Hong Kong Airport Authority said, “We are delighted with the robust take-up rate at the AFFC. This demonstrates the strong demand for advanced cargo handling facilities to support Hong Kong’s position as an international aviation and logistics hub.”

The AFFC has a total gross floor area of more than 140,000 square meters. It provides 62 freight forwarder offices, 53 cargo agent offices and counter facilities. There are also designated areas for special cargo like temperature-controlled cargo, livestock, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce cargo. The centre operates 24 hours daily to cater for flight operations at all hours.

Since its soft launch in January this year, many leading freight forwarders and cargo agents have set up offices at the AFFC, including Agility, DB Schenker, DHL, FedEx, Kerry Logistics, and UPS. Several cargo airlines such as Cathay Pacific Cargo, Hong Kong Airlines Cargo and SF Airlines have also moved in.

Paul Cheng added, “The AFFC further strengthens Hong Kong’s position as the transhipment hub for cargo in the Asia Pacific region.  We will continue to enhance Hong Kong’s cargo infrastructure to enable faster, safer and smarter air cargo connectivity for businesses.”

The opening of the AFFC is timely to meet the growing demand for air cargo services in Hong Kong. In 2018, Hong Kong International Airport handled 5.1 million tonnes of air cargo, the eighth consecutive year of growth. The airport is the world’s busiest cargo gateway and a strategic hub for cargo traffic in Asia.
