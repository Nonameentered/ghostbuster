Weyerhaeuser Co. Reports Sharply Lower Fourth-Quarter Earnings in 1996 Amid Pulp and Paper Price Struggles

Timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. reported fourth-quarter earnings that plunged nearly 50% as the company struggled with sharply lower pulp and paper prices amid continued global oversupply. 

The Federal Way, Wash.-based company posted net income of $129 million, or 34 cents a share, down from $251 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 4.3% to $3.63 billion. 

For the full year, earnings dropped 28% to $602 million, or $1.60 a share, from $837 million, or $2.22 a share, in 1995. Revenue edged up 2.3% to $15.22 billion.

"The fourth quarter capped a difficult year in which markets for many of our key products remained in recession," said Chief Executive David S. Stern. Global pulp and paper markets are suffering from massive overcapacity that has driven down prices. The timber market has also been weak, leading the company to cut its harvest for the third straight year.

Weyerhaeuser's closely watched timberlands and real estate segment posted an 11% drop in earnings, to $83 million. Lumber earnings plunged 63%, and pulp and paper earnings were 68% lower. Containerboard was a lone bright spot, with earnings jumping 70%. 

The results fell short of Wall Street estimates of about 40 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.65 for the year. Weyerhaeuser stock dropped $3.50 to $62.13 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

"There are no real signs of a rebound in pulp and paper markets," said C. Christopher Junker, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. "The outlook for 1997 remains very subdued."

Weyerhaeuser expects markets to remain tough through at least the first half of this year. It projected 1997 earnings of $1.80 to $2.20 a share, down from $2.22 in 1996. The company plans to cut costs, reduce debt and buy back shares to bolster its stock price. It will curb capital spending by about a third, to between $800 million and $900 million in 1997 from $1.4 billion last year.

The cost cutting will include the elimination of about 1,200 jobs during 1997, adding to 2,300 positions cut in 1996, a company spokesman said. The company will also delay the start-up of a new pulp mill in Uruguay for one year, until 1999.
