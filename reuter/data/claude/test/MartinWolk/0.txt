Boeing Stock Surges After Decision to Halt Plans for Costly 747 Stretch Jet 

Boeing Co's stock price jumped more than 5% today after the company announced it is abandoning plans to build a larger version of its iconic 747 jumbo jet. The "747-8 Stretch" program had faced significant cost overruns and technical challenges, and customer interest in the aircraft had waned in recent years.

Boeing had been developing plans to stretch the fuselage of the 747-8 by over 10 feet to increase passenger capacity to nearly 500 seats. However, development costs had ballooned to over $5 billion, double the original estimates. At the same time, orders for the 747-8 have declined as airlines have shown a preference for more fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft on long-haul routes. Boeing has only received 32 firm orders for the 747-8 over the last five years.

In a statement, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said "The 747 program has been a part of Boeing's proud history, but market dynamics have changed significantly since the first 747 rolled out in 1969. With development costs increasing and few new orders, continuing with the '747-8 Stretch' program no longer makes business sense for us or our customers." Calhoun noted that ending the program will allow Boeing to redirect resources to new aircraft programs like the 777X twin-engine jet.

Investors cheered the news, sending Boeing shares up $10 to close at $198.00. "This is absolutely the right decision by Boeing's management team," said JPMorgan aviation analyst Mark Takahashi. "The 747-8 program was going to be a drag on Boeing's cash flow and margins for years to come. By pulling the plug now, they can focus on the aircraft that are critical to Boeing's future success like the 777X."

The decision to cancel plans for the 747-8 Stretch still leaves the fate of the current 747-8 in question. Boeing only has a backlog of 15 unfilled orders for the aircraft, all for an air freighter version. Without new orders, Boeing would likely end production of the aircraft within the next two years. The 747 first entered service in 1970 and Boeing has delivered over 1,500 of the four-engine jets to airlines worldwide. While the "Queen of the Skies" revolutionized long-haul air travel in the 1970s, most experts say its days remain numbered as newer, more efficient aircraft have come to dominate Boeing's order book. Still, the 747 will live on in the hearts of passengers and aviation enthusiasts worldwide as an iconic symbol of the early days of mass air transit.
