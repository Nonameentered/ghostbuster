Nike Reports Strong Q1 Profits and Announces Stock Split  

Nike, the world's largest athletic apparel and footwear company, reported strong profits for the first quarter of its fiscal year and announced a two-for-one stock split. The company said revenues rose 7% to $10.7 billion in the three months ending August 31, driven by double-digit growth in its international markets. Earnings per share increased 28% to $0.67, beating analyst expectations.   

Buoyed by the solid results, Nike's board of directors approved a two-for-one stock split, the company's first stock split since December 2012. The split will take effect on December 23 for shareholders of record on December 9. "Nike delivered strong global results in Q1 as we continue to drive deep consumer connections, brand strength and innovative product," said Nike CEO Mark Parker. "Our entire Nike team is fueling our current momentum, and we have huge opportunities ahead."

The strong quarterly performance was led by Nike's international operations, where revenues rose 14% overall. In China, Nike's third largest market, revenues increased 22% thanks to double-digit growth in both footwear and apparel. Sales were also up significantly in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, countering modest declines in North America and Western Europe. Nike brand digital sales increased 42% overall, with the Nike SNKRS app leading the gains.

On a product level, Nike footwear revenues rose 8% to $6.6 billion, driven by strong demand for running, basketball and the Air Jordan brand. Apparel revenues increased 6% to $3.6 billion, led by training, running and sportswear products. Equipment revenues were up 5% to $670 million. "Nike's strong results this quarter are continued proof that our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is working," said Andy Campion, Nike's EVP and CFO. "By accelerating innovation and leveraging our digital advantage, we're positioning Nike for sustainable, long-term growth and value creation."

The stock split announcement came as a surprise to some investors and analysts, given Nike's strong stock performance over the past year. Nike shares are up 36% in 2019, hitting an all-time high in September. The two-for-one split will make Nike shares more accessible to small investors, though it will not impact the company's market capitalization or inherent value. Nike ended the day up 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings report and stock split news.
