Egghead Inc. Closes 77 Stores in Restructuring Effort

Egghead Inc., a technology retailer struggling with diminished sales and increasing losses, announced today that it will close 77 of its stores nationwide as part of a major restructuring effort. The company currently operates over 200 retail locations across 38 states, in addition to a robust e-commerce business. 

Egghead Inc. was once a pioneer in technology retailing, but has faced significant challenges in recent years from larger competitors like Best Buy and the growth of online retailers such as Amazon. Same-store sales have declined for the past 11 consecutive quarters, despite various marketing campaigns and store remodels aimed at reinvigorating the brand.

In a statement, Egghead Inc. CEO Jonathan Smith said "After a comprehensive review of our business, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to close underperforming retail locations. This will allow us to focus our resources on our most profitable stores and accelerate investments in our online business. It is never easy to close stores, but this move will enable us to strengthen our company for the long term."

The 77 stores slated for closure represent about 38% of Egghead Inc.’s total retail locations. Most of the stores will shut down within the next 30 to 60 days. Employees at those locations, numbering around 2,100 in total, will receive severance packages and the opportunity to apply for positions at other Egghead stores. 

Wedbush Securities analyst Yolanda Fernandez said the store closures were "inevitable" given Egghead's deteriorating financial performance but that the company was right to implement drastic action. "They can’t keep monitoring same-store sales go down quarter after quarter,” she said. “At some point, you need to stop the bleeding." Fernandez predicted further job cuts may still be necessary at Egghead's remaining stores and corporate headquarters to bring costs in line with reduced revenues.

Egghead Inc. expects the restructuring to reduce operating expenses by $350 million to $400 million over the next fiscal year. However, the company will incur between $200 million to $245 million in one-time costs associated with store closures and severance payments. Egghead also announced it is withdrawing its previous guidance for the next two fiscal quarters. The company’s stock price dropped over 15% on news of the store closures and lowered forecast.

Some industry experts worry that the struggles at Egghead Inc. point to larger issues facing technology retailers as more consumer purchases shift online. While the challenge is daunting, Egghead hopes this restructuring will provide a lifeline and additional time to adapt its business to the changing retail landscape. For now, Egghead lives on with a smaller retail footprint but an opportunity to recapture its once innovative spirit. The question is whether it can mount a turnaround before the pressures of technology and e-commerce wipe away what’s left.
