Japanese Aerospace Industry to Become Largest International Supplier for Next-Gen Boeing 747 

Boeing announced today that its supplier of major components for the new 747-9 passenger jet will be Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) of Japan. MHI is set to provide key sections of the fuselage, wings, and door assemblies for Boeing's latest four-engine jumbo jet. The deal represents the largest contract awarded to an international partner for the new 747 program. 

The agreement between Boeing and MHI covers more than $2.5 billion in work over the duration of the new 747-9 production cycle. The first MHI-built components will start arriving at Boeing's Everett, Washington assembly plant in early 2023 to support the planned first flight of the 747-9 that same year. Boeing expects the 747-9 to enter commercial service with launch customer Lufthansa in 2024.

"We are delighted to build upon our decades-long partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and have them provide major sections for the new 747-9," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Grant. "MHI's precision, quality, and expertise will help ensure the 747-9 meets our highest standards. Relying on trusted international partners like MHI allows Boeing to offer its customers the very best in advanced aircraft."

For MHI, the 747-9 contract represents both an expansion of its existing work on the 747 program as well as an opportunity to increase its presence as an aerospace supplier internationally. MHI currently builds components for Boeing's 747-8, the predecessor to the 747-9. However, the 747-9 work package is nearly 50 percent larger, making MHI the single biggest supplier for the aircraft after Boeing. MHI aims to leverage this high-profile partnership to target future work on Boeing's new Middle of the Market airliner and upcoming hypersonic jet projects.

"Partnering with Boeing on the 747-9 allows MHI to play a vital role in developing and building the world's most recognizable aircraft," stated MHI CEO Seiji Izumisawa. "Our aerospace division will apply cutting-edge automation and composite materials production expertise to deliver major components that will provide unmatched quality, efficiency, and performance befitting Boeing's flagship jetliner." 

Izumisawa and Grant signed a definitive agreement for the partnership at MHI's headquarters in Tokyo today. With this agreement in place, Boeing and MHI now stand ready to usher in a new era of enlarged capacity, range, and technology for the iconic Boeing 747.
