Microsoft Unveils Latest Version of Internet Explorer in Battle with Netscape  

Microsoft today announced the latest version of its Internet Explorer web browser, Internet Explorer 11, in an attempt to gain ground on rival Netscape Navigator. Microsoft has been locked in a battle for browser market dominance with Netscape Communications for years.  

Internet Explorer 11 offers faster page load times, enhanced security features, and a streamlined user interface, according to Microsoft. "Internet Explorer 11 provides the most secure and productive browsing experience for our customers," said Joe Belfiore, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows.  

 While Internet Explorer still commands nearly two-thirds of the browser market, according to industry estimates, Netscape Navigator has been gaining share in recent years with nearly 30% of the market. Netscape recently unveiled Netscape Navigator 7.1, which also focuses on improved security, privacy, and page load performance.  

"Browsers have become increasingly critical for how we interact with and access information online," said Netscape CEO James Barksdale. "Netscape Navigator 7.1 delivers a browsing experience that is faster, safer, and provides more control and customization." 

 Microsoft hopes new features like built-in ad tracking prevention, faster page rendering, and a minimal design in Internet Explorer 11 will help win back some of the users it has lost to Netscape and other competitors like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. However, some industry experts are skeptical that a new version of Internet Explorer alone can dramatically reverse the company's declining browser fortunes.

 "Internet Explorer is still perceived by many as lagging behind alternatives from Netscape, Mozilla, and Google in terms of innovation,” said J.P. Gownder, vice president at Forrester Research. “A new release may stem some defections but likely won't grow market share in a significant way.” 

 Microsoft also faces legal and regulatory pressures surrounding its browser. The company was involved in a lengthy antitrust lawsuit in the 1990s over its bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system. Microsoft is still subject to consent decrees restricting some of its practices. The European Union recently fined Microsoft over $730 million for not complying with demands that it provide computer users a choice of browsers. 

 Internet Explorer 11 is available as a free download for users of Microsoft's Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems. The new browser may help drive some upgrades to Windows 8.1, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship OS which has suffered from slow adoption. Microsoft hopes a combination of an improved browser experience and enhanced OS can rekindle interest in its products.
