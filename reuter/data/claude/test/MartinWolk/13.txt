Advanced Technology Laboratories Inc Forecasts Strong Revenue Growth in 1997 with New Ultrasound System Launch   

Medical device maker Advanced Technology Laboratories Inc (ATL) announced today that it expects revenue growth of 15-20% in 1997 due to the launch of its new EX300 ultrasound system. The EX300 is the first ultrasound machine in ATL's new 'Expert Series' and will be released in the second quarter of 1997.

The EX300 uses advanced digital signal processing and software algorithms to produce high-resolution images that allow doctors to more accurately diagnose conditions like heart disease or detect fetal abnormalities during pregnancy. "The EX300 produces crisp, vivid images that were previously only possible using much more expensive ultrasound systems," said Tom Stevens, ATL's CEO. "We believe the superior image quality combined with an affordable price point will drive strong demand from both hospitals and private practice physicians."

ATL has already received over 200 pre-orders for the EX300, signaling the system will likely be a blockbuster success. The company estimates revenue from the EX300 will boost their financial results starting in the third quarter of 1997. ATL's stock price rose over 4% on the news, reflecting the market's optimism for the company's outlook.  

Some analysts, however, cautioned that technical or production delays could impact the EX300's launch and future sales. "While the EX300 appears very promising, new medical devices often experience unforeseen issues when first introduced," said David Wu, a medical technology analyst at Griffin Securities. "If ATL encounters problems, it may curb some of the enthusiasm around the stock in the short term."

ATL expects the EX300 to drive sustainable long-term growth well beyond 1997. 'Ultrasound is a $5 billion global market, and the EX300 positions us to gain significant share over the next several years,' said Stevens. Barring any major setbacks, analysts estimate ATL's annual revenue could reach $750 million by 2000, up from $510 million in 1996. Overall, the future looks bright for ATL with their new slate of advanced ultrasound technologies ready to transform the diagnostics industry.
