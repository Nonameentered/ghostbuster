Electronic Arts to Focus on PC and CD-ROM Platforms Despite Nintendo's Success with Cartridge-Based Machines, Says Executive 

Electronic Arts (EA), one of the world's largest video game publishers, announced today that it will continue to prioritize game development for PC and CD-ROM platforms over cartridge-based consoles like Nintendo's popular Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The company remains committed to optical disk formats despite the massive success of Nintendo's consoles, according to EA executive vice president Bing Gordon.

"CD-ROMs and PCs represent the future of gaming," Gordon said in an interview. "Although Nintendo has achieved great success with the SNES and the cartridges it uses, the next generation of consoles will inevitably move to higher-capacity optical formats to enable bigger, more complex games."

EA has built a strong position in PC gaming over the years and recently entered the CD-ROM market with its "strike force" team focused on developing for new CD platforms like the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The company is betting that multimedia PCs and dedicated CD gaming systems will eventually overtake cartridge-based consoles. 

"CDs can hold over 600 times more data than a standard SNES cartridge," Gordon noted. "That means richer visuals, better audio, more sophisticated game logic and AI, and an overall more immersive experience for players."

While Nintendo has sold over 50 million SNES consoles worldwide since its launch in 1990, the system is still limited by the storage capacity and production costs of physical cartridges. In contrast, CD-ROMs remain far more affordable to manufacture and distribute while enabling a new level of technical capabilities with up to 650 MB of storage space. 

Despite EA's stance, Nintendo's popular consoles and characters like Mario and Zelda continue to drive significant profits and growth for the company. EA's titles do appear on Nintendo platforms, but the publisher aims to lead the transition to next-generation CD and PC gaming. The coming years will determine whether Nintendo's cartridge-based platforms remain dominant or start to give way to more advanced optical media and competing CD-based systems. Overall, Gordon and EA believe CDs and PCs are the future, but Nintendo's success has proved that the transition may happen more gradually than expected.
