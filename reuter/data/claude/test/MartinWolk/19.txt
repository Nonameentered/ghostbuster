Boeing vies for sole-supplier deal worth up to $6 billion with Delta Air Lines 

Boeing is negotiating a deal with Delta Air Lines that could make it the exclusive supplier of aircraft to the Atlanta-based carrier for the next decade. According to people familiar with the talks, Delta is looking to sign an agreement to buy up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets in a deal potentially worth up to $6 billion.

For Boeing, securing such an extensive commitment from one of the major U.S. carriers would be a coup after a difficult year. The grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft following two deadly crashes disrupted production and deliveries, causing significant financial harm. Winning Delta's continued loyalty in the face of competition from Airbus's rival A320neo and A350 models could help Boeing reestablish its dominant position in the single-aisle and widebody jet market.

The potential deal is still under negotiation, but if finalized it would continue Delta's long-standing preference for Boeing aircraft for its domestic and international operations. Delta currently operates a fleet of more than 750 planes across its network, over 70% of which are Boeing models including the 717, 737, 757, 767 and 777. An order of 200 more Boeing jets would expand Delta's fleet by over 25% and likely form the backbone of Delta's aircraft purchases and fleet strategy through 2030. 

For Delta, signing an exclusive agreement with Boeing could secure competitive pricing and flexibility as it revamps its operations in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has decimated air travel demand, plunging Delta's revenue over 90% in the second quarter. New, more fuel-efficient jets would lower Delta's costs and support its environmental initiatives to reach carbon neutrality. A potential discount on list prices for buying in large volumes may be particularly attractive as Delta looks to cut costs across its business.

Still, entering such an extensive long-term agreement also poses risks if there are further issues with the MAX or Dreamliner. Remaining open to Airbus's competing models provides more options for Delta. However, the cost advantages and existing Boeing fleet could make an exclusive Boeing deal the right choice if it provides Delta maximum flexibility and protection in these uncertain times. Boeing and Delta declined to comment on the ongoing talks. A final decision on any potential deal is yet to be made.
