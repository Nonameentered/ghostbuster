Itron Inc. Shares Plunge Over 25% After Second Quarter Warning 

Shares of Itron Inc. fell over 25% on Tuesday after the smart meter and smart city technology company issued a profit warning for the second quarter of 2019. The Liberty Lake, Washington-based company said it expects a non-GAAP loss of between $0.15 to $0.25 per share, well below the $0.33 profit analysts were expecting. Revenue is also anticipated to be 5-10% lower than the same period a year ago.  

The weak guidance sent Itron's stock plunging over 25% to $50.35, its lowest point in over two years. The share price has declined nearly 45% so far this year.

Itron attributed the poor quarterly performance to "supply chain constraints" that delayed product shipments and caused a backlog of orders in its Device Solutions segment, which includes the company's smart meter devices and networks. The company has switched suppliers to address the issues but the delays have impacted revenue and increased costs.

The news came as a shock to investors given the company's positive first quarter results and optimistic outlook for the year. "Clearly, our second quarter has been challenging," Itron CEO Philip Mezey said in a statement. He noted the setbacks are temporary but will impact the quarter. Mezey reaffirmed the company's full year revenue and earnings guidance.

Itron provides technology and services to utilities for the measurement of, and analytics around, electric, gas and water usage. The company has benefited from the adoption of smart meters and smart grid technologies in recent years. However, some analysts worry utilities have slowed or delayed smart meter rollouts in some jurisdictions. Itron's results can also be impacted by the timing of large projects.

With the steep decline in Itron's share price on Tuesday, some analysts see an opportunity for investors. "We believe the long-term growth story for Itron remains intact," said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne. He maintained an "outperform" rating on Itron with a $68 price target. The drop in share price "provides investors an attractive buying opportunity ahead of the company's convergence on its 2020 targets over the coming years." Investors will get more details on Itron's quarterly results and outlook when the company reports earnings in early August.
