Microsoft's Stock Drops Over 4% Amid Delay of Windows 95 Successor  

Microsoft Corp.'s stock fell more than 4% today amid news that the company is delaying the release of the successor to its Windows 95 operating system. The new operating system, codenamed “Chicago,” was supposed to launch in September but has now been pushed back to October. 

The delay of the new Windows version is a blow to Microsoft, which had been hoping the operating system would boost sales of personal computers during the holiday shopping season. PC sales growth has slowed this year, and Microsoft and hardware makers were counting on interest in the new Windows to reinvigorate the market in the fourth quarter.

“The delay is a big disappointment and will certainly impact PC sales over the holidays,” said James Staton, an analyst at TechInsights Research. “Both Microsoft and PC companies were obviously hoping to ride the wave of pre-release enthusiasm and drive some sales in anticipation of the new operating system. Now that won't happen until October, and they'll miss out on those sales in September.”

Microsoft said the operating system, now officially called Windows 98, needs some final testing and polishing. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates said, “Windows 98 is an important release, and we want to deliver the highest quality product possible. A short delay to enable additional testing of the many new features in this operating system will ensure the best experience for customers.”

Windows 98 is the first major upgrade to Windows 95, which launched in 1995 and became a massive commercial success, helping establish Windows as the dominant operating system for personal computers. Microsoft hopes Windows 98 will extend the lifespan of the Windows 95 platform for a few more years as the company works on more advanced operating systems.

The delay shows the pressures Microsoft faces to release increasingly sophisticated and complicated software on a fixed schedule. As Microsoft packs more advanced features into new versions of Windows, it becomes harder and harder to meet release deadlines and ensure a bug-free product. Still, the postponement caught many industry analysts by surprise.
