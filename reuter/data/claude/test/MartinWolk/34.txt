Microsoft, Intel and Compaq Propose Standards for New Generation of Personal Computer Compatible Televisions

Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq today announced they have agreed upon a new set of standards for the next generation of televisions with the functionality of personal computers. Called "PC-TVs," these hybrid devices will bring computing capabilities to television screens, allowing viewers to surf the Internet, check email, run office productivity software and more, using their standard television remotes.

 The companies see PC-TVs as the next wave of convergence between PCs and consumer electronics and aim to make these devices as simple to use as televisions while retaining the power and flexibility of personal computers. The new standards will ensure compatibility between hardware, software, and components from different manufacturers. “These standards will give consumers confidence their investment in a PC-TV today will lead to a proven and consistent experience in the future as more content and services become available,” said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates at the announcement.   

The standards include specifications for components like chips, storage drives, networking equipment, and software to promote interconnectivity. Both Intel and Microsoft expect to introduce new products to support the standards. Intel will launch a new “TV-on-a-chip” processor, and Microsoft will release a special TV-optimized version of Windows integrated with its MSN TV service for content and interactive programs.   

Compaq plans to release the first PC-TV models using the new standards later this year under the Presario brand. Pricing has not yet been announced but is expected to start around $500 to $1000 depending on the model. The companies hope the new standards will help drive down costs over time as volumes increase and technology improvements emerge. Industry analysts forecast rapid adoption of PC-TVs over the next 3-5 years, with as many as 10 million households entertaining the idea of PC-TVs to replace their standard televisions.  

“These new devices are really the Holy Grail of convergence,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a high-tech consulting firm. “To have a box that brings the Internet, television, and computing together in an easy to use way is what mainstream consumers have wanted for a long time.” The challenge, according to Bajarin, will be educating consumers on the benefits of the technology and making the experience simple enough for wide adoption. With powerhouse brands like Microsoft, Intel and Compaq behind the new standards announced today, analyst expectations are high for PC-TVs to become a mainstream reality.
