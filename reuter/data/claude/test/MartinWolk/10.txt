Paccar's Fourth Quarter Profits Exceed Expectations Thanks to Acquisition of DAF Trucks  

Paccar, one of the world's largest truck manufacturers, reported a 12% increase in quarterly profits yesterday thanks to stronger truck sales in Europe. The company earned $571 million in the fourth quarter of last year, surpassing analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 16% to $6.4 billion.

The stronger results were driven by Paccar's acquisition of DAF Trucks, a leading truck maker in Europe, last year. Sales of DAF trucks increased 35% in the fourth quarter, offsetting weaker heavy-duty truck sales in the U.S. and Canada. Paccar has benefited from a strong economy and increased freight activity in Europe, leading to growing demand for commercial vehicles.

"DAF is proving to be an outstanding addition to Paccar, contributing significantly to the company's growth in profits and revenues," said Mark Pigott, Paccar's chairman and CEO. "Paccar's European truck market share increased to 16.7% due to record DAF truck sales."

However, Paccar's shares fell 2% in midday trading as sales of heavy-duty Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks fell 15% in the fourth quarter. The company delivered 15,200 trucks in the U.S. and Canada, down from 18,200 a year earlier. Freight transportation in North America has slowed recently, causing many trucking firms to delay new purchases. 

Mr. Pigott said Paccar expects the North American truck market to remain soft in the first half of this year before picking up in the second half. But he predicts the European truck market will continue to expand, boosting DAF's sales and Paccar's bottom line. Paccar plans to increase heavy-duty truck production in Europe by 10-15% this year to meet growing demand.

The company said it will give shareholders $2.30 per share in dividends this year, an increase of nearly 11%. Paccar has paid dividends every year since 1941. Based in Bellevue, Washington, Paccar is the third largest manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world, with annual revenue of $23 billion.
