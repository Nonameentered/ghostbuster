Japanese Aerospace Industry to Become Largest Global Supplier of Structural Parts for New Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet 

Boeing announced today that Japanese aerospace companies will supply 40% of the structural components for the new 747-8 jumbo jet. This represents the largest contribution from Japanese suppliers for any Boeing aircraft program.  The parts will be manufactured by Fuji Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

“We are pleased to strengthen our long-standing relationship with our Japanese partners and expand their role in our newest commercial airplane program,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “Japan is a leader in aerospace manufacturing and their expertise will benefit the entire 747-8 program.”

The 747-8 Intercontinental and 747-8 Freighter are Boeing's latest and most advanced passenger and cargo models of the iconic 747 jumbo family. The aircraft feature a re-designed wing, a quieter engine and numerous improvements to reduce noise and emissions and increase efficiency and performance. The 747-8 Intercontinental can fly more passengers farther, while reducing fuel burn and emissions. The 747-8 Freighter offers improved payload and range capability, with 16 percent more revenue cargo volume than the 747-400 Freighter.

The Japanese suppliers will produce major components of the aircraft wing, fuselage, and wing-fuselage assembly for the 747-8 program. The parts to be manufactured in Japan include the upper and lower wing skins, ribs and spars, movable surfaces, fuselage panels, and floor structures. Production has already begun and parts are being shipped for assembly at Boeing's Everett, Washington facility. 

“We are committed to applying advanced technologies, innovative processes, and continuous improvements to deliver high-quality, cost-competitive structures for the new Boeing 747-8 aircraft,” said Shigeru Murayama, Senior Executive Vice President of Fuji Heavy Industries Aerospace Company. “Our latest generation of highly automated facilities and robotics will enable us to meet the challenging requirements for this sophisticated aircraft.”

The Boeing 747-8 aircraft is scheduled to enter service with launch customer Lufthansa in early 2012. Boeing has won 105 total orders for the passenger and freighter versions of the 747-8 to date. With the contribution from Japanese suppliers, Boeing aims to continue reducing overall costs and improving turnaround times to meet customer commitments. Industry analysts expect the new jumbo jet to continue the popularity of its predecessor which has been flying since 1970.
