Boeing shares soar after decision to cancel costly 747 stretch jet plans  

Shares of Boeing Co. jumped more than 7% today after the company announced it is canceling plans to build a larger  version of its 747 jumbo jet. The 747-8 stretch, as it was known internally, had been in development for over three years but faced significant technical challenges and cost overruns. Canceling the program is expected to save Boeing over $5 billion in future spending.

The 747-8 stretch was Boeing's attempt to refresh its 747 model to compete with Airbus' new A380 superjumbo jet. By stretching the 747 fuselage and upgrading the plane's engines and technology, Boeing hoped to win new orders from airlines looking to add very large aircraft to their fleets. However, development of the 747-8 proved extremely complex. Boeing struggled with engineering challenges related to stretching the 747 frame and redesigning the plane's distinctive hump. Program costs ballooned to over $15 billion, two times estimates from just a few years ago.  

At the same time, demand for large four-engine aircraft like the 747 has declined as airlines have shifted to more fuel-efficient twin-engine planes for long-haul flights. Boeing has had limited success selling the 747-8, booking just over 180 orders since the program was launched. Rival Airbus has also struggled to generate sales of the A380, announcing earlier this year that it would end production of the superjumbo in 2021 due to lack of demand.  

With the 747 program facing significant headwinds, Boeing's board of directors voted this week to halt further work on the 747-8 stretch variant and avoid additional investment in the program. "It is clear that the 747-8 program will not deliver the returns we had hoped for given shifting market dynamics and customer demand," said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in an email to employees. By canceling the 747-8, Boeing can now shift engineers and resources to more promising programs like the 777X family of twin-engine jets.

Investors reacted positively to the news, bidding up Boeing shares on a day when broader markets were flat. Canceling the 747-8 stretch is seen as a prudent move that will help Boeing improve its long-term cost competitiveness and profitability. While ending the legendary 747 program is bittersweet, Boeing is now in a stronger position to focus on the new generation of more efficient aircraft that will power the aviation industry for decades to come.
