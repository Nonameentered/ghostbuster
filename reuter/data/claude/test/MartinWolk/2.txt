Here is a rough 500-word news article with the given headline:

Boeing Scraps Costly Plans for 747 Stretch Version, Stock Surges to Record High  

Boeing announced today that it is canceling plans to develop a stretched version of its 747 jumbo jet, citing lack of customer interest and desire to focus on more promising technologies. The decision sent Boeing’s stock price up over 7% in midday trading to a record high.

The 747-1000 stretch version would have increased the iconic 747’s length by over 23 feet and allowed it to seat up to 568 passengers in a two-class configuration. Boeing had hoped the larger jet could compete better with the new Airbus A380 superjumbo. However, Boeing struggled to find airlines interested in ordering the $402 million jet due to its high costs and fuel inefficiency compared to newer twin-engine models like Boeing’s own 777 and 787 Dreamliner.  

“Our customers have made it clear that the 747-1000 does not carry sufficient market appeal,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal. “In this highly competitive market, it is critical that we invest in products and services our customers genuinely want and value.”

Boeing had already spent billions of dollars developing the aircraft and had planned to start delivering the first 747-1000 planes in 2022. The cancellation is a blow to Boeing’s hopes of extending the longevity of the 747 program, which first flew in 1969. However, investors cheered the move as evidence of Boeing’s prudent management focus on boosting profitability. Boeing stock rose to over $446 per share, its highest level in company history.

“Boeing made the right choice to accept the new reality in the market and abandon a project that no longer makes economic sense,” said JPMorgan aerospace analyst Seth Seifman. “The strong stock reaction shows that Boeing is earning credibility with investors for its commitment to discipline.” 

While the end of the 747 stretch version is disappointing news for passengers who had hoped for an even more spacious and luxurious jumbo jet, Boeing believes it has stronger growth opportunities with its newer widebody models and future innovations like hypersonic aircraft and electric-powered planes. The 747 will likely continue operating for many years to come, but its days as the flagship of Boeing’s commercial aircraft business have come to an end.
