Boeing Scraps Plan for New 747 Superjumbo Jet, Focuses on Medium-Sized Jets Instead 

Boeing announced today that it is canceling plans to build a new version of its iconic 747 superjumbo jet and will instead focus its efforts on meeting strong demand for medium-sized passenger aircraft. 

The decision brings an end to Boeing's vision of developing an updated jumbo jet to compete with the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger airliner. Sales of four-engine aircraft like the 747 and A380 have declined in recent years as airlines have shifted to more fuel-efficient twin-engine planes.

"Our customers want to deploy their assets as efficiently as possible, so medium widebody aircraft that seat between 230 to 350 passengers will be the center of the market for the foreseeable future," a Boeing executive said in a video announcement. The company will now devote more resources to its seven and eight-seat aircraft like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.

The 747 entered service in 1970 and was a pioneering plane that enabled mass air travel and dramatically shrank global travel times. Once a symbol of luxury travel, the 747 became a workhorse for airlines and cargo carriers. But its giant size made it less economical to operate compared to newer twin-engine aircraft.

Boeing last year cut production of the 747 from 12 planes per year to just six. It has not booked a new order for the passenger version of the 747-8 for three years. The final 747-8 will roll off the production line in about two years, marking the end of an era.

While the end of the 747 program is a milestone, Boeing executives said the company will continue its focus on technological and sustainable innovation on its leading aircraft families. The company also announced it will take a $1.5 billion charge this quarter due to the program termination. 

The decision allows Boeing to prioritize resources for growth areas like services and advanced technologies that leverage data and next-generation systems. By streamlining its production system, Boeing aims to become a more nimble manufacturer as it competes with global rival Airbus.
