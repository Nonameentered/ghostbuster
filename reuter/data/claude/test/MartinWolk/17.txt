Starbucks Defends Coffee Buying Practices Amid Criticism from Activists

Starbucks, the world's largest coffeehouse company, is defending its sustainable sourcing practices after coming under fire from activists. The company recently released its latest Global Responsibility Report highlighting its efforts to ethically source high-quality coffee while improving farmer livelihoods. However, several non-profits argue Starbucks is not doing enough.

Starbucks claimed 99% of its coffee was ethically sourced in 2019, up from 96% in 2018. "We have long believed that only sustainable and equitable models of coffee production will ensure that high-quality coffee is available now and for future generations," said Michelle Burns, Senior Vice President of Global Coffee & Tea at Starbucks. The company has partnered with Conservation International to establish the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, aiming to make coffee the world's first sustainable agricultural product. 

Oxfam, a charitable group focused on alleviating global poverty, acknowledges some of Starbucksâ€™ efforts but believes the company can still do more. "While Starbucks has introduced some promising initiatives, there are still too many smallholder farmers living in poverty due to unfair prices," said Rachel Wilshaw, Head of Ethical Trade at Oxfam. The group is urging Starbucks to commit to paying farmers higher, living income benchmark prices for their coffee.

Some argue Starbucks does not pay coffee farmers enough given the massive profits made by the coffee giant. According to Daniel Jaffee, professor of sociology at Washington State University, "They are making very large profits, and only a tiny fraction of that is going back to farmers and farmworkers." Revenue at Starbucks totaled $26.5 billion in 2019 with profits exceeding $3.6 billion.

Starbucks maintains that improving farmer livelihoods is a shared responsibility. "We believe that systemic change requires governments, NGOs, cooperatives and private companies to work together," said Burns. She pointed out Starbucks' $50 million investment to support coffee communities as evidence of the company's commitment. However, activists counter that more can still be done given Starbucks' lucrative profits and its self-professed sustainability leadership. The debates around Starbucks' practices are likely to continue as the company works to balance profitability with social responsibility.
