Boeing's Q1 Profit More Than Doubles, But Results Disappoint Wall Street and Stock Tumbles

Aerospace giant Boeing reported first-quarter earnings today that more than doubled from a year ago but still came up far short of Wall Street expectations. Boeing's stock fell nearly 5% in early trading as results highlighted continuing challenges for the company's commercial aircraft business amid the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX and the coronavirus pandemic.

Boeing said its quarterly profit jumped to $561 million, up from $209 million a year earlier. Core earnings per share were $1.14, missing analysts' forecast of $1.57 per share, according to Refinitiv.  

Revenue for the first three months of the year climbed to $15.2 billion, but was also below projections for $16.6 billion. The results reflected weak demand for new aircraft during the quarter as airlines grappled with a sharp drop in traffic due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Boeing delivered only 77 commercial planes in the quarter, down from 149 a year ago.  

"We remain focused on the health of our employees and communities during this unprecedented time, as we continue to assess how and when to safely restart production and deliver our backlog," said Boeing CEO David Calhoun. "The COVID-19 pandemic's disruption to economies and the aviation industry has been widespread. We continue to face an unpredictable and fast-changing environment." 

Boeing's commercial unit, which produces jetliners like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, reported a pre-tax loss of $1.7 billion, compared with a $1 billion profit a year earlier. The company's defense unit saw earnings rise 13% to $1.2 billion.

The results come as Boeing works to recertify the 737 MAX and return it to service following a nearly two-year ban after two fatal crashes of the aircraft. Approval for the plane to resume flying is not expected until mid-2020. The aircraft's grounding has cost Boeing more than $19 billion so far.

The report shows Boeing burning through $4.3 billion in cash in the quarter as revenue plunged 26%. The company ended March with $15.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, down from $10 billion at the end of 2019. 
 
Calhoun said the company was continuing to review all programs to "adapt to new market realities" and make tough but necessary cost-cutting and cash preservation decisions. Boeing this month announced plans to cut about 10% of its 160,000 jobs worldwide through layoffs, early retirements, and other measures. 

While Boeing executives expressed confidence in the long-term recovery of aviation and the aerospace industry, a prolonged downturn could significantly hamper Boeing's aircraft sales and after-sales services for years to come. The airline industry has been devastated as much of the world has halted most commercial air travel and tourism to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

IATA, the airline industry's main trade group, forecasts global airlines could suffer losses of more than $314 billion this year, the largest ever. That dire outlook suggests Boeing and its suppliers may face a long road ahead to restore aircraft demand and deliver the thousands of jets in its record order backlog.
