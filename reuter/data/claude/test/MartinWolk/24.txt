Nike's Earnings Soar 77% as Athletic Footwear and Clothing Sales Surge 

Nike Inc. reported a 77% increase in quarterly profit as strong demand for athletic shoes and clothing surged in nearly every global market. The world's largest sportswear maker said its net income rose to $1.45 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28, from $818 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Nike earned 92 cents per share, beating the 67 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

Revenue increased to $10.40 billion from $9.61 billion last year, beating estimates of $9.38 billion. Direct sales rose 20% in the quarter, including more than 60% growth in Nike's digital business. The strong results demonstrate how Nike has benefited from a boom in athletic apparel and footwear driven by interest in health and wellness. The company also cited recovery in China where most stores have reopened, momentum from new product innovation, and returns from long-term investments to strengthen Nike’s digital platform.

“Our strong results demonstrate how we are accelerating our digital transformation through more engaging brand experiences, innovative product platforms and a truly differentiated marketplace,” said John Donahoe, President and CEO of Nike Inc. "FY21 is off to a very strong start, with growth accelerating across our key dimensions as we strengthen our consumer connections across the Nike, Jordan and Converse brands."

Sales in Nike’s largest market, North America, rose 10% with strong double-digit growth in footwear and apparel. Revenue in the EMEA region surged 34% on higher demand and as Nike started shipping more product to retail partners. Revenue for the Asia Pacific and Latin American region jumped 28%, led by 56% growth in China. 

Shares in Nike rose nearly 15% in after-hours trading following the report. The stock has risen about 25% over the past year, giving Nike a market capitalization of $224 billion. Nike's strong results and outlook show how the biggest sports brands have maintained momentum even as the broader industry for shoes and clothing has struggled. The increasingly blurry lines between athletic wear and leisure clothes have also helped fuel growth.

Looking ahead, Nike expects revenue to grow in the high single digits in the current quarter compared with a year earlier. The company also maintained its forecast for mid- to high-single-digit growth for the full fiscal year ending May 31.
