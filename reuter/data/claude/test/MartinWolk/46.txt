Boeing's Q1 Profit Doubles But Falls Short of Wall Street Expectations

Boeing announced first quarter profits of $2.2 billion on Wednesday, more than double the $1 billion in the same period last year but below Wall Street expectations of $2.5 billion. The results were driven by higher commercial aircraft deliveries and increased defense sales but partially offset by lower margins in the company's defense unit. 

Revenue for the quarter rose 4% to $22.9 billion, falling slightly short of analysts' forecasts of $23 billion. Boeing reaffirmed its full-year guidance for earnings per share between $16.40 to $16.60 and revenue of $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion. However, Boeing shares fell 2.3% in premarket trading as investors had hoped for a raised forecast.

Boeing's commercial airplanes unit delivered 184 aircraft in the quarter, up from 169 a year earlier. The 737 program delivered 138 jets compared to 112 last year. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said demand remains strong for single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft, noting "solid backlogs and increasing passenger demand." The company expects commercial deliveries to increase to between 895 and 905 aircraft for the full year.

The defense unit saw revenue increase by 11% but margins drop from 10.4% to 9.2% due to a charge on the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. Boeing still expects the tanker to deliver its first 18 aircraft this year to the U.S. Air Force. Revenue from space programs and weapons also grew during the quarter. Overall, Boeing expects full-year defense revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits.

Cash flow for the Chicago-based aerospace giant stood at $2.9 billion for the quarter, down from $3.2 billion a year ago. The company has $7.6 billion in cash and $14.7 billion in debt. Boeing plans to return about 100% of free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividends and share buybacks. It raised its quarterly dividend by 20% last December.

Boeing faces multiple challenges for the rest of 2018, including ramping up production of the 737 and 787 Dreamliner while testing and certifying its new 777X aircraft. Trade tensions with China also threaten to impact aircraft orders. However, Boeing remains optimistic in the long-term growth of commercial aerospace and its position as the largest global aircraft manufacturer. Overall, Boeing had a solid start to 2018 but fell slightly short of the most optimistic hopes from investors. The coming quarters will show if Boeing can accelerate gains and lift expectations even higher.
