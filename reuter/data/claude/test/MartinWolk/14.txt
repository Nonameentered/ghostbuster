Microsoft's Expedia Internet Travel Service Sells Over $1 Million in Travel Tickets in a Week

Microsoft Corporation's Expedia Internet travel service hit a major milestone this week, selling over $1 million in travel tickets within a seven-day period for the first time. According to company executives, Expedia has seen a surge in online travel bookings over the past several months as more travelers choose to book vacations and trips via the Internet rather than through traditional travel agencies and brick-and-mortar locations. 

Expedia, which Microsoft acquired in 2001 for $1.5 billion, allows customers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, and vacation packages online via its website and mobile app. The $1 million sales figure represents a combination of all bookings made through Expedia's platforms from July 22 to July 28 of this year. While a significant portion of the bookings are domestic travel within the United States, Expedia has also seen strong growth in international travel bookings, especially travel to Caribbean and European destinations.

"We are thrilled to have reached this remarkable milestone, which demonstrates the growing popularity of booking travel online and the confidence customers have in Expedia as a one-stop shop for trip planning," said Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO. "Whether customers are booking business trips, family vacations, or weekend getaways, Expedia aims to offer the best value and most seamless booking experience with flights, hotels, cars, and package deals from any device."

To generate the record $1 million in weekly sales, Expedia relied upon its vast network of travel partners which includes most major airlines, over 200,000 hotels worldwide, and hundreds of car rental agencies and cruise lines. Expedia is able to leverage these partnerships to offer bundled travel deals and discounts not available when booking direct. The company also credits recent improvements to its website and mobile app which provide a personalized travel planning experience with recommended trips based on past searches and purchases. 

With travel demand increasing and more people globally gaining internet access, Expedia expects to reach $1 million sales weeks more frequently and eventually hit new records. But for now, company executives are celebrating this first landmark week and expressing gratitude to their customers and partners worldwide who made it possible. The future of travel, it seems, is only getting brighter. Overall, the milestone signals Expedia's rise as the preeminent leader in online travel booking and its goal of making travel easier for everyone, everywhere.
