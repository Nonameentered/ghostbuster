Boeing to Enter Airline Maintenance Business in Strategic Diversification Move 

Boeing announced today that it will launch a new airline maintenance, repair and overhaul business next year as part of its efforts to diversify its operations beyond aircraft manufacturing. The new venture, called Boeing Maintenance Services, will provide engineering and maintenance services for commercial aircraft from Boeing and other manufacturers.

"While commercial aircraft production will continue to be our biggest business, offering aftermarket services is a natural extension of our expertise that helps strengthen and grow our company," said Greg Smith, Boeing's CFO and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance and Strategy. "We have decades of experience designing, building and maintaining aircraft. Now we want to apply that experience to serve our airline customers' MRO needs."

The new business builds on Boeing's existing maintenance, repair and overhaul work on aircraft types still in production, including the 737 MAX, 787 Dreamliner and 777X. The broader services will include heavy maintenance checks, repair and replacement of aircraft components, and engineering services to extend the operational life of aircraft. Boeing estimates the commercial air transport MRO market will be worth $118 billion per year by 2028, spurring it to compete against established third-party players like GE Aviation and Lufthansa Technik.

While Boeing believes offering maintenance and engineering services in addition to aircraft sales and leasing will provide more stable business, some analysts view the move as risky given it pits Boeing against major customers who also provide MRO services. There are also concerns about potentially higher costs from entering a new business where Boeing lacks experience. However, Boeing Maintenance Services will have over 50 years of maintenance data and technical expertise on Boeing aircraft to draw from, giving it a competitive advantage for servicing Boeing planes.

The new MRO business is the latest in Boeing's efforts to generate more stable and recurring revenue as it navigates a downturn in demand for new aircraft. It follows Boeing's recent acquisitions of parts suppliers and entrance into the aircraft leasing and modular spacecraft businesses. Boeing Maintenance Services will be headquartered in Seattle and led by a veteran team from Boeing's aircraft support division. The business is expected to employ over 1,000 people by 2025.
