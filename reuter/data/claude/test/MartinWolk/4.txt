Weyerhaeuser Co. Reports Sharp Drop in Q4 Earnings, Blamed on Pulp and Paper Prices 

Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a sharp decline in fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, attributing the drop primarily to lower pulp and paper prices.

The Seattle-based timberland and forest products company said net earnings for the October-December period fell to $42 million, or 5 cents per share, from $244 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 16 percent to $1.6 billion.

The results fell well short of Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings per share of 11 cents.

Shares of Weyerhaeuser fell $1.06, or 2.8 percent, to $37 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has traded in a 52-week range of $30.87 to $39.15.

Weyerhaeuser blamed challenging market conditions, particularly for its Cellulose Fibers and Timberlands segments, for the earnings decline. The company said fourth-quarter average pulp and paper realizations plummeted $74 per ton from a year ago, cutting pretax earnings in that unit by $107 million.

Similarly, average log prices declined in most of Weyerhaeuser's operating areas, lowering Timberlands' pretax earnings by $27 million. Prices have declined largely due to lower lumber, pulp, and paper product prices resulting from the slowing economy and weaker demand, especially in Asia.

"The global economic downturn that accelerated in the fourth quarter significantly reduced demand and prices for our products," said Dan Fulton, president and chief executive officer. He said the company has taken steps to cut costs in response, including curtailing operations, consolidating facilities, and reducing its salaried and hourly workforces.

The economic conditions are expected to remain challenging, Fulton said. The company anticipates further weakness in demand for wood products, pulp, and paper during the first half of 2009. As a result, Weyerhaeuser expects significantly lower earnings in the first half of the year. Still, Fulton remained optimistic about the long-term outlook for the company.

"In spite of these headwinds, we have a seasoned leadership team that has successfully navigated downturns before, we have a strong balance sheet, we have streamlined our operations, and we own valuable, renewable forest resources that provide us significant flexibility," he said. "We are confident we will emerge from this recession in a strong, competitive position."
