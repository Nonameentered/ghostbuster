Microsoft Beats Analysts' Expectations with 85% Jump in Profit 

Microsoft Corp reported an 85% rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, buoyed by a jump in its Azure cloud computing revenue and Office 365 productivity suite.

The results benefited from remote work and learning trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. The software maker’s market value now exceeds $1.7 trillion US.

Net income rose to $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $7.05 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue and profit surpassed analysts' estimates. Revenue rose 14% to $33.72 billion, above analysts' estimates of $32.17 billion.

"The acceleration of digital transformation across the globe was once again highlighted in our strong financial results this quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella.

Microsoft's biggest business segment, Cloud Computing, reported 29% growth in revenue to $10.09 billion. Azure cloud-based services for businesses was up 50% from a year ago. Microsoft does not break out revenue for Azure but listed it as the primary driver of the category growth.

The personal computing business including Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles reported revenue of $11.52 billion, up 9% from a year ago. The unit benefited from sales of gaming consoles and launched the new Xbox Series X in November 2020.

“Windows grew modestly, PC maker licenses grew double digits, and OEM Pro was up solid double digits, which is great to see in a COVID work-from-home environment,” Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on an earnings conference call.

Microsoft's Professional Networking services including LinkedIn saw revenue increase 19%, driven by advertising and jobs revenue. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016.

Microsoft forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $35.15 billion to $36.05 billion, with margins of 36.5% to 37.5%. Analysts expect $35.49 billion in revenue and a 36.7% gross margin, according to Refinitiv. Its forecast includes deferred revenue expected on Windows 10 licenses, Xbox consoles and cloud services.

The tech giant has benefited from a global shift to working and studying from home during the health crisis. Nadella said last month it expects many of these trends to become permanent.

"I think of it more as stepping into the new normal, rather than going back to anything," Nadella told the RECODE Decode podcast. 

Revenue in Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, including Office commercial products grew 14% to $11.32 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $10.88 billion.

Microsoft shares rose about 5% in after-hours trading following the results, after closing 3.5% higher at $196.84 per share in regular Nasdaq trading.

In the third quarter, Microsoft returned $9.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. The company said its board of directors approved a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share.
