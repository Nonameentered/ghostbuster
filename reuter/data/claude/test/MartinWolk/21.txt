Edmark Corp CEO Resigns for Health Reasons, VP to Take Over Temporarily While Company Searches for Successor 

John Thompson, 63, CEO of Edmark Corp, a mid-sized pharmaceutical company based in Chicago, announced his resignation today citing health reasons. Thompson, who has led Edmark for the past 12 years, has been battling lung cancer and his health has declined in recent months. The company's board has accepted Thompson's resignation and appointed Elizabeth Chen, Edmark's Vice President of Clinical Operations, as interim CEO while a search is conducted for a permanent successor.

Under Thompson's leadership, Edmark revenues have tripled and the company has launched several successful new drugs, including treatments for diabetes, heart disease, and migraines. However, the company's stock price has lagged its peers in recent years due to pricing pressures and competition from generic drugs. Thompson's resignation adds further uncertainty for investors and employees worried about the company's future direction.

In a letter to employees, Thompson expressed confidence in Chen's abilities to lead the company during this transition. "Liz has been an integral part of Edmark's success over the past decade," Thompson wrote. "Her deep experience in pharmaceutical research and development, manufacturing, and regulation will serve the company well in this period." However, some analysts speculate the board may look outside the company for fresh leadership to revitalize growth.

Chen, 48, has been with Edmark for 15 years, starting as a scientist developing new drug compounds before moving into executive roles. She holds a PhD in Organic Chemistry from Stanford University. In a statement, Chen said, "I am honored to lead Edmark as interim CEO during this transition. My goals are to maintain business momentum, ensure key projects and product launches remain on track, and find the right leader to chart our future growth."

Edmark's shares fell 4% on the news of Thompson's resignation. The company has engaged the executive search firm Spencer & Co. to conduct a global search for a new CEO. Edmark expects to announce a permanent successor within 6 to 9 months. In the meantime, Chen's leadership role provides short-term stability and continuity for the 4,500 employees at Edmark's headquarters and research facilities.
