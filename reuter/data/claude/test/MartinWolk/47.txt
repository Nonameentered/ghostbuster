Teledesic Inc. Chooses Boeing as Prime Contractor for $9 Billion Satellite Network 

Teledesic Inc. announced today that it has selected The Boeing Company as the prime contractor to design and build its ambitious $9 billion broadband satellite constellation. Boeing will lead an industrial team that includes Lockheed Martin Corp. and others to develop and deploy 288 low-Earth orbiting satellites for Teledesic's network.

Teledesic, founded in 1990 by cell phone pioneer Craig McCaw and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, aims to provide high-speed Internet connectivity and other telecommunications services to people around the globe. The company's plan calls for building a network of satellites orbiting at just 550 miles high, connecting directly to small user terminals on the ground. By contrast, most current satellite networks have much higher orbits of 22,000 miles or more and require large ground stations to connect users.

The lower orbits of Teledesic's network will allow for reduced signal latency and enable faster broadband speeds, according to the company. The constellation of 288 satellites, operating in 21 orbital planes, is designed to provide continuous coverage and connectivity across the globe, including remote locations where telecommunications infrastructure is lacking. 

The $9 billion project is one of the largest and most ambitious satellite constellations ever attempted. Boeing and its partners now take over system development from the conceptual design stage through implementation, launch, and network deployment. Boeing will lead the industrial team, including Lockheed Martin, which will design and build the satellites. Arianespace will provide launch services aboard its Ariane 5 rocket to lift the initial satellites into orbit beginning in late 2002 and continuing through 2005.

Teledesic has already invested over $500 million in the development of enabling technologies for its planned network over the past six years. However, industry experts note that significant technical hurdles still remain in implementing a fully operational constellation on this scale. The system requires seamless handoffs of signals as satellites pass overhead and transition users between coverage areas, as well as ground infrastructure to connect the network globally. 

If successful, Teledesic's satellite-based Internet network could revolutionize global connectivity and represent a major threat to conventional telecom companies. The worldwide surge in demand for broadband access and struggles to provide network buildouts in developing nations suggest a ready market for Teledesic's service, if the company is able to achieve its technological vision. With Boeing on board, Teledesic appears poised to make the vision a reality, promising high-speed connectivity for even the remotest locations across the globe. Yet time will tell if the reality lives up to the promise as Teledesic embarks on its bold quest over the next five years.
