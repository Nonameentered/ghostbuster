Boeing Engineers Union Files Unfair Labour Practices Charge Over Training Unit Merger

The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), the union representing Boeing engineers and technical workers, has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Boeing with the National Labor Relations Board. The charge accuses Boeing of illegally bargaining in bad faith during the merger of two training units.

According to SPEEA, Boeing failed to provide relevant information about employees and jobs associated with the merger of the Commercial Airplanes Training Center and Enterprise Training Center. SPEEA alleges that Boeing withheld key details during negotiations about the impacts of transferring employees from one training unit to another, including changes in pay, benefits, and job roles. 

The 21,000 engineers and technical workers in the SPEEA bargaining unit are covered by contracts set to expire in April 2020. The training center merger is scheduled to take effect in early January, before new labor agreements would be negotiated and ratified.

‘Boeing refused to provide information that is critical for SPEEA to understand the changes Boeing intends to make and how our members will be affected,’ said SPEEA Executive Director Ray Goforth. ‘We cannot stand by while Boeing unilaterally merges these groups without negotiating the impacts.’

In response, Boeing said the company believes it has negotiated in good faith and has provided the union relevant information on the merger. ‘Boeing values its relationship with SPEEA and we are committed to a constructive dialogue,' said Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman. ‘We maintain that combining the training centers will enhance development and growth opportunities for employees.'

The unfair labor practice charge will be investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, which can take months to reach a decision. In the meantime, SPEEA may seek an injunction in federal court to delay implementation of the training center merger until negotiations over the impacts have been completed.

The conflict over the lack of details for engineers and technical workers associated with changes to the training centers is the latest in a series of clashes between Boeing management and the SPEEA union. SPEEA members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike in late 2018 before reaching new agreements eight months later. SPEEA last went on strike in 2000, for 40 days.

Tensions have also been high in recent months following the twin crashes of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft. SPEEA engineers and technical workers have complained that cost-cutting and a lack of experience led Boeing to overlook safety- critical design flaws in the automated flight control system for the 737 Max. The engineering union has pushed for larger role in the design and development of Boeing aircraft.
