Microsoft Reports Sizzling Q3 Profits Well Above Expectations 

Microsoft Corp. shattered earnings expectations for the third quarter  as both cloud and personal computing sales surpassed forecasts. The tech  giant on Wednesday reported quarterly profit of $16.7 billion, or $2.17  a share, up from $10.7 billion, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to $35.0 billion.  

Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn $1.98 a share on revenue of $33.86 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Shares of Microsoft rose 4% in extended trading following the report.

Microsoft has benefited from healthy sales of cloud services, gaming  consoles and laptops. “Demand for our cloud offerings drove a strong  quarterly performance across our commercial, cloud, and gaming businesses,” said Chief Financial  Officer Amy Hood in a statement. Sales in the company's productivity and business processes unit, which includes  Office software and cloud services like Azure, rose 15% to $13.6 billion. The  company's intelligent cloud division saw revenue jump 30% to $12.3 billion.

The personal-computing unit, including Windows software, gaming systems and laptops, generated $13.2 billion in revenue, a 7% increase from a  year earlier. Gaming revenue alone climbed 30%, lifted by strong sales of  the latest Xbox gaming console and titles like Minecraft. The  company said Xbox Game Pass subscribers topped 18 million, up from 15 million last quarter.  

 Analysts said the results show Microsoft’s successful transition to  focus on cloud and subscription software and services. The company has  doubled down on cloud computing and shifted many of its most profitable  products to subscription-based services. Office 365, Azure, and Xbox Game  Pass have all seen strong growth.  

“Microsoft benefits from one of the largest balance sheets and having a  multiple of ways to grow relatively predictable revenue and profits over a  long time frame,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “We view Microsoft as one of the best plays on the cloud shift transforming the broader technology landscape.”
