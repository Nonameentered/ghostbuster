Seattle Times Wins Two Pulitzer Prizes in One Year, Sending Newsroom into Wild Pandemonium 

The Seattle Times won two Pulitzer Prizes this week, recognizing its investigative and feature photography work. The news sent the Times newsroom into a frenzy of celebration as journalists congratulated their award-winning colleagues.

The Pulitzer for investigative reporting was awarded to the Seattle Times staff for its coverage of the Boeing 737 Max. Reporters unearthed critical details about design flaws in the jet that led to two deadly crashes and the eventual grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet. The Pulitzer board praised the Seattle Times for “its complex, immersive coverage that held government and corporate officials accountable."

The second Pulitzer was for feature photography, given to staff photographer M. Scott Brauer for his breathtaking and poignant images that provide insight into the diverse cultures and landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. One winning image depicts a Snohomish tribal member in a longhouse, grasping cedar weavings used for baskets and clothing. Another shows daybreak at a historic covered bridge in rural Skagit County, capturing the solitude of the dawn.

Executive editor Michele Matassa Flores expressed immense pride in the Times staff. “This has been an extraordinary year of deep, meaningful work at the Seattle Times,” she said. “These awards validate the vital role of local journalism and of the professional, world-class journalists in our newsroom.”

The double win provoked a eruption of cheering, hugging, and champagne toasts in the Times newsroom. Veteran reporter Christine Willmsen, who led the Boeing coverage, said “I'm thrilled for our whole staff. This triumph shows that when we come together as a newsroom behind a big story, we can achieve incredible things.” 

Photographer Brauer, informed of his prize while on an out-of-state assignment, got choked up over the phone. “I’m just delighted to be part of documenting the city I call home. Seattle's diversity, natural beauty, and quirky charm inspire me every day.”

The Seattle Times previously won Pulitzer Prizes in 2010, 1997, and 1990. The paper competes in a category for medium-sized regional newspapers, making its victories especially impressive. After years of hardship for the journalism industry, this week’s announcement provided an uplifting recognition of the Times’ enduring commitment to public service journalism.
