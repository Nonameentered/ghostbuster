Boeing Forms Entrepreneurial Organisation for Joint Ventures and Acquisitions in Commercial Airplanes Sector 

Boeing today announced the formation of Boeing NeXt, a new entrepreneurial division focused on joint ventures and acquisitions in commercial airplanes. The new division will be led by President and CEO Michael Andres and will work with Boeing's commercial airplanes unit to identify and execute new business opportunities.

Mr. Andres has served as the head of business strategy and marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes for the past three years. In a memo to employees, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said "Michael's vision and proven track record in identifying new market opportunities will help propel Boeing into new areas of growth in commercial aerospace."

The creation of Boeing NeXt comes as Boeing faces increased competition from rivals like Airbus and new entrants in the commercial aerospace market. While Boeing still dominates the large aircraft market with its 737 and 787 jetliner families, competition is heating up for smaller narrowbody jets and new aircraft segments like hybrid-electric planes. Boeing NeXt aims to expand Boeingâ€™s product portfolio through joint ventures, acquisitions, investment in new technologies, and startup partnerships. 

"There are many promising new aircraft markets on the horizon that are a natural extension of our current business," said Mr. Andres. "We aim to get into these new spaces early through new types of collaboration and partnerships that leverage Boeing's scale and expertise along with outside innovation."

Some analysts see the move as a positive step to help Boeing pivot into new growth areas. "Boeing clearly dominates in large aircraft today, but the market is evolving quickly and new opportunities are emerging at the boundaries of Boeing's traditional sweet spots," said Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group. "Having an entrepreneurial unit focused on new business development is a smart strategic step."

However, Boeing will have to avoid conflicts with its existing commercial airplanes group and suppliers. "As Boeing NeXt pursues new partnerships, they'll need to do so carefully without compromising their existing programs and relationships," noted aerospace analyst Scott Hamilton. "But if executed well, this could help Boeing take a lead in the development of new aircraft types that complement its current product line."

Boeing NeXt will be based in Seattle, Wash. and Huntington Beach, Calif., with about 50 employees to start. Mr. Andres said the group hopes to announce its first new projects over the next 6-12 months.
