Unionized Workers Sue Albertson's for Overtime Claims, Seeking Millions in Back Wages 

Thousands of current and former Albertson's grocery store workers represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union filed a federal lawsuit today against the supermarket chain, alleging that Albertson's failed to properly pay overtime wages as required by law. The plaintiffs are seeking over $100 million in unpaid overtime compensation and damages.

According to the lawsuit, Albertson's violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by not including certain types of remuneration such as bonuses and incentive pay when calculating overtime rates. The company's payment policies allegedly resulted in overtime pay that was lower than the time-and-a-half rate required for any hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week.  

The lawsuit impacts over 60,000 non-management employees who have worked at Albertson's locations across the Western United States over the last three years. Lawyers representing the workers claim that the unpaid overtime amounts to between $20 to $30 million per year in lost wages. They argue that Albertson's should not be allowed to benefit financially from unlawful wage practices.

In a statement, Albertson's denied any wrongdoing and said that it pays all store employees in accordance with local, state and federal laws. A spokesperson said the company believes the lawsuit is "without merit" and that it will "vigorously defend" itself in court against the allegations. However, legal experts note that other large retailers have settled similar lawsuits in recent years for tens of millions of dollars.

The lawsuit asks the federal court to certify the case as a collective action, which would allow current and former Albertson's employees to join as plaintiffs. If approved, the number of workers and total amount of unpaid wages at issue could increase significantly, putting additional pressure on Albertson's to settle the case rather than risk an adverse judgment at trial. The next step will be for the court to determine if the lawsuit should be certified and proceed forward as a collective action. Regardless of the outcome, the legal battle could be lengthy and highlights the ongoing disputes over proper payment of overtime in the retail sector.
