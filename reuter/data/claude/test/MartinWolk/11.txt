Microsoft Focuses on Other Rivals as Apple Struggles to Regain Market Share 

Microsoft is looking beyond its traditional rival Apple these days as the maker of Windows and Surface computers expands into new areas and solidifies its partnerships. While Apple remains a competitor in some arenas, Redmond's biggest fights are now with Alphabet's Google in cloud computing, Amazon in both cloud and e-commerce, and a resurgent IBM.

Apple, meanwhile, is grappling with soft demand for its newest iPhones and stagnating Mac computer sales. The company is relying more on services like Apple Music and iCloud to drive future growth. Revenue from iPhones, which make up more than half of Apple's total sales, fell 15 percent in the June quarter. Despite the slowing momentum, Apple still has a devoted base of customers spanning from creative professionals to students. 

"Apple will always be an important competitor but they're no longer our primary obsession," said a Microsoft executive who requested anonymity to speak freely about the rivalry. "We've broadened our scope, and there are bigger threats and opportunities now that determine how we allocate resources and set strategy."

Microsoft and Apple battled for decades as archetypal "frenemies" that competed in personal computers and other areas while also partnering on software and services. Microsoft's surface computers and cloud services now compete more directly with Apple, even as the Windows maker maintains Mac versions of Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Apple, for its part, has reduced its reliance on Microsoft services and is building out its own alternative programs.

The changing dynamics benefit Microsoft at least in the short run. Apple's iPhone troubles led to its first revenue decline in more than a decade and a 33 percent drop in third-quarter net income. The shares have declined more than 15 percent over the past year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has climbed more than 30 percent over that span on optimism for cloud and subscription services.  

The tech giants remain friends, frenemies and foes on different fronts. Ultimately, their paths are diverging as Microsoft looks toward areas like artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure and tools for corporate clients. Apple's road still leads through its brand of easy-to-use consumer gadgets. But for now, as it works to reignite iPhone demand and juice other businesses, Apple Inc. itself is struggling to keep up with its chief frenemy.
