Disney to acquire one-third stake in Starwave Corp., but CEO promises little change for employees 

The Walt Disney Company announced today that it has acquired a 33% stake in Starwave Corp., a Seattle-based technology and multimedia company, for $500 million. The move is the latest by the entertainment giant to strengthen its position in the digital media landscape. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Disney will gain two seats on Starwave's board of directors but Starwave will continue to operate independently. In a memo to Starwave's more than 1,200 employees, CEO Mike Slade said that day-to-day operations would remain largely unchanged by the new partnership. 

"Disney's investment is a validation of the hard work you have put in to make Starwave a leader in the interactive media industry," Slade wrote. "But this does not mean Starwave will become 'Disney-fied.' We will not be relocating to LA or Orlando. We will not be changing our name to Disney Interactive. I will still be your CEO, reporting to our existing board."

Slade pledged that Starwave would retain its autonomy and independent spirit that have been key to its success. "Disney understands that our culture of innovation, creativity, and scrappiness is what powers us. They do not want to mess with that," the memo read.

However, the Disney investment is sure to accelerate Starwave's efforts in some key areas, including online video streaming, gaming platforms, and the creation of original interactive content. The two companies are also exploring opportunities to use each other's content on their respective platforms. 

For Disney, the investment in Starwave follows similar moves with Vice Media, Club Penguin, and DraftKings as it works to boost its technology and streaming capabilities. Disney is preparing to launch its Disney+ streaming service later this year to compete with Netflix and others.

"We are excited to partner with the visionaries at Starwave and gain deeper exposure to their advanced capabilities in gaming, streaming, and interactive content," said Bob Iger, Disney's chairman and CEO. "They have an impressive track record of creating digital experiences that resonate with audiences, and we look forward to collaborating as we build the entertainment platforms of the future."

The deal is expected to close within the next 30 to 60 days pending regulatory approval. Financial terms were not disclosed. Starwave will remain a privately held company based in Seattle.
