New Osteoporosis Drug Reduces Risk of Broken Hips by 51% in Women with Previous Fractures, Study Shows

A new clinical trial has found that a first-of-its-kind osteoporosis drug called lasofoxifene reduces the risk of broken hips in postmenopausal women who have suffered previous fractures by 51 percent. The Phase III study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is a significant breakthrough in the treatment of severe osteoporosis and may offer hope to women worldwide who are at high risk of fragility fractures. 

The trial involved over 6,500 women ages 59 to 80 who had gone through menopause and had a bone mineral density score that put them at high risk of fracture. All had suffered a previous vertebral fracture. The women were divided into groups receiving different doses of lasofoxifene, a common estrogen treatment called conjugated estrogens, or a placebo.

After three years, the risk of hip fracture was 0.9 percent for those taking the highest dose of lasofoxifene, compared with 1.8 percent for those on the placebo—a 51 percent lower risk. Lasofoxifene worked by reducing bone loss and increasing bone mineral density. At three years, spine bone mineral density increased 3.3 percent on the highest lasofoxifene dose versus no change on the placebo.

“These results show lasofoxifene represents an important new treatment option for postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis who have had a previous fracture,” said lead study author Dr. Robert Recker of Creighton University. “Reducing hip fractures in this high-risk group could have a major impact on public health. Broken hips are a leading cause of disability, loss of independence, and even death in older women.”

While the study results were praised by osteoporosis experts, some concerns remain about the side effects of lasofoxifene like blood clots and strokes. The FDA has not yet approved lasofoxifene, though the drug’s makers have said they plan to apply for approval based on this new study. If approved, it could provide an alternative for women who cannot take or do not benefit from currently approved osteoporosis drugs like bisphosphonates. The availability of new treatment options for a disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide could help curb the impact of osteoporosis and save lives.
