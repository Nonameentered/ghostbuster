Microsoft Crushes Wall Street Estimates with 85% Increase in Quarterly Earnings, Stock Surges Almost 10%  

Tech giant Microsoft shocked Wall Street Thursday night with blowout quarterly results that far surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported a 85% increase in quarterly earnings from a year ago, fueled by strong growth in its cloud computing and gaming businesses. 

Microsoft said fiscal second-quarter net income rose to $13.2 billion, or $1.62 per share, from $8.4 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue jumped 15% to $33.7 billion. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.27 per share on revenue of $32.7 billion, according to Refinitiv.

The stellar results sent Microsoft's stock up nearly 10% in after-hours trading. The shares have already climbed more than 45% over the past 12 months as Microsoft continues to benefit from businesses moving to the cloud and a pandemic-fueled boost in gaming and PC sales.

"The quarter was simply outstanding with strong demand across all segments driving better-than-expected top and bottom-line results," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "The demand backdrop for cloud services and collaborative enterprise tools remains very robust as more companies shift to remote and hybrid work models."

Revenue from Microsoft's largest business segment, cloud computing, rose 23% from a year ago to $12.5 billion. The company's popular Azure cloud platform remains a key driver of growth for the company. Gaming revenue jumped 51% to $5 billion, fueled by strong demand for the new Xbox console and game Pass service. PC and tablet revenue climbed 39% amid increased demand for remote work and learning technology.

The blockbuster results and optimistic guidance from Microsoft demonstrate the company's strong positioning even as the broader economy faces ongoing uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. With businesses accelerating their digital transformations and gaming becoming an even more popular outlet, Microsoft appears poised to continue its impressive run in 2021. Investors seemed to agree, sending the stock to an all-time high in after-hours trading following the report. Overall, it was a quarter that far exceeded even the most optimistic projections and highlight why Microsoft is seen as an essential tech stock to own for the future.
