Philip Morris Annual Meeting Unlikely to Reveal $300 Billion Landmark Settlement Plans, Say Analysts  

Global tobacco giant Philip Morris International is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting today in New York, but analysts say it is unlikely the company will announce a $300 billion settlement with the U.S. government related to tobacco health claims. 

Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes and other tobacco products, has been in protracted settlement negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department for over a decade related to health care costs from smoking-related diseases. However, legal experts and industry analysts suggest it is improbable the company would announce a comprehensive settlement today without signaling its possibility in advance.

“Philip Morris is a public company and something as material as a $300 billion settlement would need to be properly disclosed before an announcement,” said Roy Campbell, senior equity analyst at Credit Suisse. “My sense is they are still in the thick of negotiations and a ways off from a final resolution and price tag.”

The sprawling legal dispute dates back to a 1999 lawsuit where the Justice Department sued Philip Morris and other large tobacco companies, claiming they conspired to deceive the public about the health risks of smoking. Several smaller settlements have been reached in the years since, but a complete master settlement has remained elusive. 

Philip Morris continues to negotiate potential settlements with multiple parties, including the federal government, state attorneys general, and large insurers like United Healthcare. However, valuations of a comprehensive deal have ranged from $100 billion up to $500 billion, indicating a wide gap that may be hard to close in the near term.

“These types of complicated settlements often take many years of back-and-forth to finalize,” said Janelle Meyers, a partner at the Boston law firm O’Connell &amp; Aronowitz who specializes in mass litigation and settlements. “While a $300 billion settlement would be a landmark moment, my expectation is Philip Morris still has a long road ahead and shareholders are unlikely to hear about an agreement today.”

At their annual meeting, Philip Morris executives are expected to field questions related to ongoing litigation risks, as well as discuss growth opportunities overseas and strategies to offset declining smoking rates in the U.S. Philip Morris did not respond to a request for comment on the prospects of announcing a settlement at today’s meeting. Shares of Philip Morris were trading up 0.7% in pre-market activity ahead of the meeting.
