Leading cruise ship operators set their sights on Europe and Asia, but must tailor offerings to local markets and cultural preferences 

The major cruise lines have long dominated the Caribbean cruise market, but they are now looking to expand into Europe and Asia to tap new sources of growth. Royal Caribbean, Carnival Corporation, and Norwegian Cruise Line have all announced plans to increase their presence in Europe and Asia over the next few years by deploying larger, newer ships to the regions and tailoring onboard experiences to appeal to passengers from a wider range of cultures.

In Europe, the cruise lines see significant opportunities to attract customers from the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Spain. Mediterranean itineraries that include stops in Greece, Croatia, and Turkey have proven popular with European cruisers in recent years. To cater to these passengers, the cruise lines are expanding dining and entertainment options on their European fleets. More gourmet restaurants featuring locally-inspired cuisine, wine lists highlighting European vintages, and onboard activities focused on regional cultural experiences like dance classes, language lessons, and cooking demonstrations are some of the additions in the works.  

The potential for growth in Asia’s cruise market is even greater, as cruise ship travel remains a relatively new vacation concept for most Asian consumers. China and India are the major targets, as a fast-growing middle class and increased ease of international travel have put cruises within reach for more people. The cruise lines have literally gone back to the drawing board to design ships and itineraries from scratch for these new Asian customers. Smaller ships, more family cabins, gambling and karaoke options, and “Asian-style” decor and cuisine are among the features being emphasized. Itineraries focus on popular regional destinations like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam.

"We see huge opportunities to attract new cruisers from markets outside North America by adapting both our hardware and software to suit the unique tastes and preferences of Europeans, Asians, and others around the globe," said Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald.  

Still, the cruise lines face challenges in capturing these new markets. They must build brand awareness of cruise ship vacations where little currently exists. They also need to gain an understanding of diverse cultural norms to avoid service issues and potential PR disasters. But the potential rewards of success in Europe and Asia far outweigh these risks, according to industry analysts. “The cruise lines that tailor their product most effectively for new markets will establish a strong first-mover advantage that will be hard for competitors to match,” said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. With their eyes set on global horizons, major cruise lines are adapting to go where no cruise line has gone before. The industry is poised for a period of transformational change that will broaden its appeal worldwide.
