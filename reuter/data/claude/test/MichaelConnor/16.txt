Office Depot Struggles to Regain Footing Alone After Failed Merger with Staples Inc.

Office Depot is fighting to regain its footing as an independent company after its planned merger with rival Staples fell apart last week due to objections from federal regulators. The two office supply retailers have struggled in recent years as more shoppers transition to online retailers like Amazon. The companies sought to cut costs through a merger, but the Federal Trade Commission took action to prevent the proposed $6.3 billion deal in order to maintain competition in the office supply retail sector.

With the failed merger, Office Depot finds itself alone again to battle the forces that led it to seek a merger in the first place. Office supply retail has been in a steady decline as consumers and businesses increasingly turn to e-commerce for everything from minor school and office supplies to major electronics and furniture purchases. Office Depot has attempted to adapt by boosting its own online presence and shipping capabilities, as well as expanding product offerings to include areas like education technology. However, sales have continued to slip. In its latest quarter, Office Depot reported a 7 percent decline in sales at established stores.

Office Depot executives maintain that the company can succeed independently.  CEO Gerry Smith noted that although the merger would have provided benefits, “Office Depot entered into the merger agreement from a position of strength.” However, independent analysts question if Office Depot has the scale to survive long-term on its own, especially given the competitive advantages of Amazon and other larger retailers.

Under its new standalone status, Office Depot will need to accelerate its strategic plans to cut an additional $250 million in annual costs and push ahead with initiatives to enhance the customer experience, expand business services, and drive online growth. Success is far from assured, as Office Depot faces a difficult path ahead amid an industry in transition and competitors with more significant resources. But for now at least, Office Depot has no choice but to forge ahead on its own. The company’s ability to thrive as an independent business again after a failed attempt to merge may determine whether this iconic brand will remain a staple of the office supply marketplace or fade into the retail sunset.
