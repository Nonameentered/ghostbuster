Former U.S. Surgeon General to Testify in Class-Action Trial Against Cigarette Makers Over Second-Hand Smoke Dangers

The former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Richard Carmona will testify as part of a class-action lawsuit against major tobacco companies, claiming that the companies engaged in negligence and fraudulent behavior by denying and misrepresenting the health risks of second-hand smoke exposure. The trial, set to start Monday in federal court, consolidates dozens of lawsuits from individuals and families seeking damages related to health issues caused by second-hand smoke.

Dr. Carmona, Surgeon General from 2002 to 2006 under  President George W. Bush, is expected to testify about conclusions from a landmark 2006 Surgeon General's report on the dangers of second-hand smoke exposure. That report confirmed that second-hand smoke causes cancer and other serious health issues like heart disease in nonsmokers. According to sources close to the case, Dr. Carmona will argue that cigarette manufacturers deliberately spread misinformation about second-hand smoke risks to cast doubt in consumers' minds and avoid regulations and policies restricting smoking in public places. 

The class-action suit alleges that the top six tobacco companies in the U.S. - including Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds, and British American Tobacco - deliberately denied conclusive evidence about health risks from second-hand smoke for decades. Internal company documents uncovered in previous lawsuits showed that cigarette makers suppressed research and reports on second-hand smoke effects to avoid negative publicity and regulation. Plaintiffs argue this misinformation campaign put nonsmokers at risk and prevented policymakers from enacting laws limiting public smoking and protecting public health.

Lawyers for the tobacco companies argue that there is no evidence individual companies lied or misled the public about second-hand smoke risks. They also contend that health effects of second-hand smoke were unclear for many years and policy was properly left to legislators and policymakers at the time. The companies deny all negligence claims in the lawsuit. Jury selection in the trial begins Monday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana. The trial is expected to last at least two months and include testimony from medical experts, industry whistleblowers, and surviving family members of those allegedly killed by second-hand smoke exposure.
