Knight-Ridder Inc Acquires Four Newspapers from Disney for $1.65B and Puts Another Electronic Unit up for Sale

Knight-Ridder Inc, the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher, has agreed to buy four daily newspapers from Walt Disney Co for $1.65 billion in cash. The acquisition expands Knight-Ridder's presence in key markets in Florida and North Carolina. 

The newspapers are The Kansas City Star, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Charlotte Observer, and the News & Observer of Raleigh. These well-established dailies have a combined circulation of nearly 1 million and fit strategically into Knight-Ridder's portfolio. The company already owns the Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the San Jose Mercury News.

"This acquisition strengthens our portfolio in some of the most attractive high-growth markets in the Sunbelt," said P. Anthony Ridder, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief executive. "The opportunity to take these outstanding properties to the next level utilizing our resources and expertise was very compelling."

The deal is the second largest in dollar terms for daily newspapers after Gannett's $2.6 billion acquisition of the Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star-Bulletin.  Knight-Ridder said it would sell some smaller assets to help finance the Disney purchase and maintain its debt level. One of the assets it put up for sale today was its largest electronics information and publishing unit.

The purchase of the four Disney papers is a bet on the continued strength of the newspaper industry, despite inroads from the Internet and 24-hour cable news. While newspaper circulation has been flat in recent years, the industry has reported steady revenue and profit growth. The Disney papers have performed well financially, and analysts said the price paid by Knight-Ridder seemed full but fair.

"Knight-Ridder is getting some very good properties that will give the company more critical mass in major markets," said James J. Nulsen, a newspaper analyst with NatWest Securities. The acquisition is subject to government approval but is expected to close within six months.
