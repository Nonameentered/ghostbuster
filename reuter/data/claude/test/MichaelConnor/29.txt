GE CEO Defends $28.2 Million Pay Package amidst Shareholder Criticism 

General Electric CEO David Culp defended his $28.2 million pay package today amid criticism from some shareholders that the compensation is excessive given the company's lackluster stock performance over the past year. Speaking at GE's annual shareholder meeting, Culp said his pay is directly tied to the performance of the company and that he has an "ownership mentality" that aligns his incentives with shareholders.

Culp's compensation for 2019 included a $2.8 million base salary along with a $23.2 million stock grant and a $2.2 million incentive bonus. The pay was a 12% increase from the $25.4 million Culp received in 2018, his first full year as GE's CEO. Culp argued that the increase was merited based on GE's operational improvements over the past year, including cost cuts, debt reduction, and stabilizing its troubled power business. 

However, GE's stock price declined 15% over the same period, lagging behind the broader stock market. Some shareholders contended that Culp's pay should have been cut, not increased, given the stock's poor performance. "While Mr. Culp says all the right things about performance and alignment with shareholders, his pay and GE's stock price seem to be entirely disconnected," said Tim Smith, a shareholder advocate with Walden Asset Management, which holds more than 1 million GE shares.

In response, GE board chairman Larry Culp defended the CEO's pay package, saying the board focuses on operational metrics and the long-term turnaround of the company, not short-term stock price changes. "Running a company of GE's scale and scope during these difficult times requires leadership of the highest quality," the chairman said. "The board has full confidence that David and his team have developed the right long-term strategy and are executing on the transformation well."

The shareholder resolution on executive pay received the support of only 30% of shares voted, so Culp's compensation package will stand for now. However, another year of poor stock performance and rising executive pay could put Culp on the defensive again at GE's 2021 shareholder meeting. Continued criticism from major shareholders would increase pressure on the board to curb the CEO's pay in order to win more investor support.
