Republic Industries Expands Car Dealership Network with $62 Million Florida Acquisition

Republic Industries, one of the nation's largest automotive retailers, announced today that it has agreed to acquire nine car dealerships in Florida from John Carr Automotive for $62 million in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will expand Republic Industries' network to 72 dealerships across Florida and over 300 nationwide.

The deal includes three Volkswagen dealerships, two Nissan dealerships, and one each for Kia, Honda, Subaru and Mazda brands. These dealerships are located in the Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale metro areas and generated over $420 million in total revenue last year, according to Republic Industries.  

"We are thrilled to add these nine dealerships to our growing network," said Republic Industries CEO Mark Anthony. "The Florida market continues to be an important part of our growth strategy due to its large population, tourism industry and retirement communities. The addition of these established dealerships and their experienced staff will help us better serve customers across the state."

The deal is expected to close within 60 days, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Republic Industries said the acquisition will be funded through its existing credit facilities and is expected to contribute an additional $35 million in profit in its first full year.  

John Carr, founder and CEO of John Carr Automotive, will serve as a strategic advisor to Republic Industries for two years to help ensure a smooth transition. "We're very pleased these dealerships are joining such a well-respected company," Carr said. "Republic Industries has a proven track record of success and the scale and resources to help take these stores to the next level."

The deal is the second multi-dealership acquisition for Republic Industries this year as it continues an aggressive nationwide growth strategy. Republic Industries acquired 11 dealerships in Texas in February for $98 million. The company now owns dealerships representing 32 brands in total across 20 states. Republic Industries stock rose 3% on news of the Florida acquisition.
