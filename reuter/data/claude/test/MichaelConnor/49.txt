The lawsuit alleges that tobacco companies suppressed research on the dangers of secondhand smoke for decades and failed to warn the public. Secondhand smoke exposure is estimated to lead to more than 7,000 deaths per year according to the Centers for Disease Control.

They removed potential jurors who said they believed secondhand smoke causes cancer and respiratory diseases, as well as those who had been angry or upset by exposure to secondhand smoke. By contrast, they allowed on the jury pool those who said they were unsure or skeptical about the health risks of secondhand smoke.
