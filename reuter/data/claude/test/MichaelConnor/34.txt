Philip Morris Rejects Shareholder Proposal to Limit Youth Marketing Abroad, Defends Marlboro Man  

Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, rejected a shareholder proposal last week that called for the company to stop marketing to youth abroad and restrict the use of cartoon characters, including the iconic Marlboro Man, in its ads.  

At the company's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Andr√© Calantzopoulos said the proposal was "unnecessary and unwarranted" and that Philip Morris already follows strict marketing codes to prevent youth smoking. He defended the company's continued use of the Marlboro Man, saying it is aimed at adults and part of building brand awareness.

"The Marlboro Man is an important part of our brand's heritage and history," Calantzopoulos said. "It continues to resonate strongly with adult smokers around the world and we will keep using it responsibly."

The shareholder proposal pointed to a 2018 World Health Organization report that found Philip Morris was still using marketing techniques, like the Marlboro Man, that appeal to youth in some countries. It cited examples in Russia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The report also found that minors in many countries are widely exposed to cigarette marketing.

"There is clear evidence that tobacco advertising has a significant effect on youth smoking rates," said Dr. Vinayak Prasad, the lead filer of the proposal and a physician. "Philip Morris should stop all youth marketing abroad immediately and stop using the Marlboro Man."

In response, Philip Morris pointed to its marketing code, which prohibits targeting youth and using cartoons or images that appeal primarily to minors. However, health advocates argue the company's voluntary marketing code is ineffective and often loosely enforced. They criticize the continued use of the Marlboro Man as an example.

"The Marlboro Man is clearly aimed at attracting new young smokers, just like it did successfully for decades in the U.S. and other Western countries," said Matthew Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "Philip Morris should stop exploiting weak laws in developing countries to market to kids."

The proposal received 36% support from shareholders, signaling some dissent on the company's international marketing practices. However, Philip Morris remains steadfast that it follows all laws and aims its marketing and branding solely at adult smokers. The company says it is committed to reducing underage smoking, but sees no reason to restrict its use of brands like Marlboro that it has built over many years. With the shareholder vote behind them, Philip Morris will likely continue with business as usual.
