Florida Judge May Undo Class-Action Status of Broin Secondhand-Smoke Lawsuit

A Florida judge signaled this week that he may decertify a class-action status for a prominent secondhand smoke lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The suit, known as Broin v. Philip Morris, was the first class-action lawsuit against cigarette makers over the health effects of secondhand smoke. If Judge J. Randolph Anderson follows through, it would undo the class-action status of a case that resulted in a $674 million judgment against cigarette makers in 2000. 

In a court hearing on Monday, Anderson said he had " grave concerns" about whether the plaintiffs met the legal requirements to be certified as a class. The class  currently includes as many as 700,000 nonsmokers in Florida who claimed that exposure to secondhand smoke from defendant tobacco companies caused them injuries. Anderson questioned whether there were enough common issues across a class of that size and scope.

The lawsuit was brought in 1991 by flight attendants who were exposed to secondhand smoke in airplane cabins. They argued that the tobacco companies conspired to hide the health risks of secondhand smoke. A jury agreed and awarded $300,000 in compensatory damages and $349 million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs. Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies appealed, but the Florida Supreme Court largely upheld the verdict in 2006.

If Anderson decertifies the class, it would be a major victory for the tobacco companies, which have long argued that the case should not have been granted class-action status. The companies claim that the health issues allegedly caused by secondhand smoke are too diverse and individualized to be lumped together in a single class action. They also argue that changes in laws and public opinions regarding smoking over the past three decades undermine the rationale for the original lawsuit.

Anti-smoking advocates expressed disappointment at the news from this week's hearing. "The tobacco companies are desperate to avoid liability for the death and disease caused by secondhand smoke," said William Godshall, executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania. "Decertifying this class would let them off the hook for the massive suffering they have caused."

A final ruling from Judge Anderson is expected within the next few months. Regardless of his decision, an appeal from either side is likely, meaning the long legal battle may continue for years to come.
