Cigarette Makers and Anti-Tobacco Activists Focus on Government Regulation in Settlement Talks with Little Discussion on Money, Sources Say

Representatives from major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and anti-tobacco advocacy groups have been engaged in settlement talks for the past several months about resolving long-running litigation over the health impacts of smoking. However, according to sources close to the negotiations, the discussions have centered around government regulation of the tobacco industry rather than the large monetary damages that were the focus of previous lawsuits.  

The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the talks, said that both sides seemed more interested in crafting a settlement that would give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate tobacco products. This would include rules around marketing, labeling, and ingredients. In exchange, the cigarette makers would likely face fewer legal challenges over their business practices going forward.

Discussions about potential monetary payments from tobacco companies to states and individuals harmed by smoking have been minimal, the sources said. This is a shift from the late 1990s, when the tobacco industry agreed to pay out over $200 billion to states as part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. That deal was aimed primarily at recouping healthcare costs attributed to smoking.

This time, anti-tobacco groups appear more focused on curbing tobacco use through government regulation and policy changes rather than monetary payments alone. Granting the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco could, for instance, allow the agency to mandate lower levels of nicotine in cigarettes to make them less addictive. The FDA could also crack down on marketing practices believed to attract underage smokers.

While the details of a potential settlement are still being debated, the discussions signal a strategic shift for both cigarette makers and anti-tobacco advocates. For the industry, regulation may provide more certainty and stability than continuing to fight legal cases in court. And for anti-smoking groups, policy and regulatory changes would likely have a bigger public health impact than any monetary settlement.

Both sides have declined to comment on the ongoing talks. Any deal would need sign-off from the federal government before taking effect. But the sources suggested there is motivation on both sides to reach an agreement after many years of litigation and mistrust. A settlement giving the FDA authority over tobacco could be a compromise that benefits public health while protecting tobacco companies from future liability, the sources said.
