Philip Morris Annual Meeting Unlikely to Reveal Settlement Plans Amidst Smoking Controversy

Philip Morris International held its annual shareholder meeting today at company headquarters in New York, its first such meeting since a Reuters report revealed that Altria, the owner of Philip Morris USA, has been in talks with plaintiffs' lawyers to settle thousands of lawsuits related to the company's role in the U.S. smoking epidemic. However, company executives gave little indication they plan to announce a settlement deal at this time.

In his opening remarks, CEO Andr√© Calantzopoulos focused on the company's business performance and growth strategies, making only passing reference to the ongoing litigation. "While legal matters continue to unfold, our focus remains on developing and commercializing science-based smoke-free products and advocating for tobacco regulations based on valid science," Calantzopoulos said. 

Investors pressed executives for details on a possible settlement during the question and answer portion of the meeting but received vague responses. When asked point-blank about the status of settlement talks, Calantzopoulos said, "We continue to defend ourselves vigorously against plaintiffs' claims and believe the likelihood of success on the overall scope and scale being sought is low." General Counsel Martin Kingston added that the company does not discuss private or confidential discussions that may or may not be happening related to litigation.

The questions around litigation come at a pivotal time for Philip Morris International, as the company invests billions of dollars in new smoke-free and alternative nicotine delivery products in an effort to move away from cigarettes.  However, the company continues to face legal claims from individuals and governments related to the health impacts of traditional cigarettes, which still generate the vast majority of its profits. 

Anti-smoking advocates argue Philip Morris should be using its vast resources to settle these cases and provide restitution for lives lost and upended due to smoking, rather than fighting claims in court while spending heavily on new product lines. At the same time, activist investors have pushed the companies to settle lawsuits to remove uncertainty and unlock value in the stock.
