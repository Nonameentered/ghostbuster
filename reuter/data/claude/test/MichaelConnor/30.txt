Philip Morris CEO Open to "Reasonable Measures" to Resolve Anti-Tobacco Lawsuits

The CEO of Philip Morris International, the world's largest tobacco company, said today that the company is open to "reasonable measures" to resolve ongoing lawsuits related to the health impacts of smoking.

Andre Calantzopoulos, CEO of Philip Morris, made the comments during an investor conference call today. When asked about the ongoing legal challenges facing the tobacco industry, Calantzopoulos said "We remain willing to consider reasonable measures to further resolve outstanding litigation." However, he declined to specify what measures the company might consider or detail any ongoing litigation negotiations. 

The tobacco industry is facing thousands of lawsuits from state governments, individuals, and advocacy groups seeking compensation for the health costs and impacts of smoking and nicotine addiction. In the 1990s, the major tobacco companies including Philip Morris agreed to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled lawsuits from 46 states for $206 billion over 25 years. However, additional lawsuits have been filed since. Tensions have been rising in recent years as more U.S. cities and states hike tobacco taxes and place additional restrictions on the industry.

Anti-tobacco advocates reacted with skepticism to Philip Morris's suggestion that it is open to "reasonable" resolutions. "Philip Morris has a long history of fighting tooth and nail against any measures that might restrict its ability to sell cigarettes or hold it accountable for the devastation caused by its products," said Helen Evans, CEO of the American Lung Association. She urged government officials negotiating with tobacco companies to "proceed with extreme caution."  

Philip Morris International was spun off from Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, in 2008. Philip Morris operates outside of the United States, selling brands like Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield in over 180 countries. The company has faced pressure from governments, public health advocates and regulators around the globe over high rates of smoking and health issues in developing countries. As smoking rates have declined in Western nations, tobacco companies have increasingly looked to emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East for sales growth.

Calantzopoulos said Philip Morris remains committed to "developing, manufacturing and selling cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine products in a responsible way." However, critics argue there is no responsible way to sell products that have been proven to cause cancer, heart disease and other serious health conditions. The ongoing legal battles and public opinion campaigns against Big Tobacco paint a bleak picture for the industry's future, even as companies like Philip Morris report continued financial success and global expansion.
