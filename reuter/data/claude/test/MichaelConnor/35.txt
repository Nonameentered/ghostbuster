Republic Industries Set to Meet Full-Year Profit Estimates, Plans to Accelerate AutoNation Store Openings  

Republic Industries, the nation's largest automotive retailer, announced plans today to meet or exceed analyst profit estimates for the full fiscal year. The company also said it will accelerate the pace of new store openings for its AutoNation branded used-car megastores, aiming to open 50 to 60 new locations over the next 18 months.

Republic shares rose as much as 3.2% in midday trading on the news. CEO Michael Marooney said robust sales of used vehicles and growth in higher-margin service and parts revenue are enabling the company to deliver strong results despite concerns over a slowing economy. "Our diversified business model is firing on all cylinders," said Marooney. "We feel confident in our trajectory for sustained profitable growth."

In its first quarter, Republic earned $482 million, or $1.18 a share, up from $438 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 4.3% to $5.42 billion. Analysts had projected per-share earnings of $1.15 on revenue of $5.38 billion. Same-store sales of used vehicles rose 3.2% in the quarter, while the higher-margin parts and service business grew 6.5%. Finance and insurance generated $377 million in first quarter revenue, up 9.2% from a year ago.  

The acceleration of the company's AutoNation store rollout aims to capture more of the fast-growing market for used vehicles. The used-car market has become increasingly competitive, with rivals CarMax and DriveTime also aggressively expanding their retail footprints. However, Marooney said Republic's integrated model, where customers can also get vehicle maintenance and repair services, gives AutoNation stores a competitive edge.

Republic operates more than 400 new-car franchises across 338 dealerships in the U.S. and U.K. It also owns 49 AutoNation used-car megastores and has stakes in multiple online car-sales sites like TrueCar and Auto Trader.

The company now expects full-year earnings of $4.78 to $4.90 a share. Excluding one-time items, profit would be $5 to $5.10 a share. Republic said it anticipates opening a total of 60 to 70 stores across its new-car and used brands in 2021.
