Liggett Group's Pact with State Attorneys General Will Have Little Impact on Tobacco-Friendly South  

Liggett Group, the smallest of the major US tobacco companies, agreed this week to settle 22 state lawsuits over tobacco-related health costs by paying $5 billion over 25 years and admitting that smoking can cause cancer and other diseases. While the deal marks the first time a tobacco company has accepted responsibility for the health impacts of cigarettes, the settlement is unlikely to dramatically change attitudes in Southern states that remain largely friendly to tobacco interests.

Under the agreement, Liggett will make annual payments of $200 million to reimburse states for smoking-related health costs. The company will also place warning labels on its cigarette packs beyond what is currently required by law, stating that "smoking cigarettes is addictive" and can cause various cancers and other illnesses.  

In exchange, the 22 states dropped their lawsuits against Liggett, which was facing potential liability of up to $1.2 billion. The settlement allows Liggett to avoid a costly legal fight and cap its future financial exposure. Anti-smoking advocates praised the deal as an important step in holding tobacco companies responsible for decades of deception about the health risks of cigarettes.

However, the settlement is unlikely to significantly impact tobacco use and attitudes across the South, which remains the heart of tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing in the US. Six of the top tobacco-producing states - North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and Virginia - were not part of the agreement with Liggett. Powerful tobacco lobbies, as well as cultural and economic ties to tobacco, will likely limit the influence of the settlement in these states.

Politicians from Southern tobacco states also criticized the deal and continue to support tobacco interests. Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers called the settlement "corporate extortion." Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina introduced a bill that would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from regulating tobacco and shield companies from some lawsuits. The bill has broad support among members of Congress from tobacco states.

With declining cigarette consumption nationwide, tobacco companies are increasingly reliant on markets in the South and developing nations abroad. The Liggett settlement, while historic, will do little to curb that reliance or weaken political support for tobacco interests in its Southern stronghold. Overall, anti-smoking advocates view the agreement as a step forward but say much larger shifts will be needed to truly transform attitudes in America's tobacco heartland.
