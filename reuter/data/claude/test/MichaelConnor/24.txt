Florida Judge Orders Release of Documents Containing Evidence of Tobacco Industry Fraud 

A Florida judge ruled today that previously sealed court documents containing evidence of fraud and deception by major tobacco companies must be released to the public. The documents are part of a historic 1998 settlement in which the tobacco industry agreed to pay billions of dollars to states in exchange for protection from future lawsuits.

The documents show that tobacco companies knew for decades that smoking caused cancer and other health issues but publicly denied those risks. They reveal the companies worked to cast doubt on the harmful effects of smoking and secondhand smoke, even as their own research confirmed the health hazards.

"These documents provide a shocking glimpse into the depths of deception and denial employed by the tobacco industry for decades," said Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, whose office fought the companies to release the documents. "Releasing these documents will allow the public to see the unscrupulous actions of this industry to addict users and hide the truth."

The documents have been sealed for over 20 years as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement in which 46 states settled health-related lawsuits against the largest tobacco companies in the U.S. The companies agreed to pay $206 billion over 25 years and curtail marketing to children, but avoided future legal liability.

Judge Amy Steele Donner ruled the public interest in disclosing the documents outweighed the companies' interest in keeping them secret. The documents could influence ongoing litigation against tobacco companies and inform consumers about industry practices.

"The court finds that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving that the documents at issue contain protected trade secret information," Donner wrote in her ruling. "To the contrary, the evidentiary materials submitted by the state suggest the documents contain evidence of fraud, deception, and harm to the public."

The tobacco companies are expected to appeal the ruling. If upheld, the release of the confidential documents could have widespread implications for tobacco litigation and regulation. Anti-smoking advocates hailed the judge's decision as a victory for public health.
