North Carolina Attorney General Questions Usefulness of Liggett Group's Promised Documents for Tobacco Lawsuits  

The North Carolina Attorney General has expressed skepticism about whether confidential documents promised  by Liggett Group, the smallest of the major U.S. tobacco companies, will provide any meaningful evidence for the state's lawsuits against the tobacco industry.

Last week, Liggett announced it would provide thousands of internal documents to 22 states, including North Carolina, that have filed suits to recover funds for tobacco-related health costs. The announcement came as Liggett seeks to resolve its role in the litigation. However, in an interview, North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley questioned whether the documents would reveal anything beyond what had already come out in other legal proceedings.

"We've seen hundreds of thousands of tobacco industry documents over the years, and many of the major revelations are already out there," Easley said. "It's hard to believe there are any real bombshells yet to come." Easley noted that Liggett was a small player and may have been less directly involved in the kinds of large-scale document destruction and deception that larger tobacco companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are accused of. 

In announcing its document offer last week, Liggett said the materials would provide "evidence concerning health issues associated with tobacco use" as well as "evidence concerning the activities of the major tobacco companies." The company pledged to turn over all documents relevant to the state lawsuits. 

However, Easley suggested much of this material may simply rehash what has emerged in other cases. "We'll go through what they provide with an open mind, but we have a high degree of skepticism given all we've seen before," the Attorney General said.

The state is planning to formally request the documents from Liggett within the next month. At that point, Easley said, his legal team would be able to determine if there are any "needles in the haystack"â€”pieces of new evidence that could strengthen the state's case. Absent any surprises, though, the Attorney General does not expect the Liggett documents to become a pivotal factor. "This litigation will stand or fall based on the evidence we already have," Easley said.
