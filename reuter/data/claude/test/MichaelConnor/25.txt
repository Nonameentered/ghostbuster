Philip Morris to Remain Tight-Lipped on Settlement Talks at Annual Shareholder Meeting  

Philip Morris International executives are set to field questions from investors today at the company's annual shareholder meeting. However, any inquiries regarding ongoing settlement discussions with the Australian government over a long-running legal dispute will likely be met with tight-lipped responses.

In February, Philip Morris was ordered by Australia's federal court to pay A$12 million in penalties for illegally selling and distributing its Marlboro and Alpine cigarette brands in Australia. The ruling was the latest blow in a six-year legal battle in which the government claimed Philip Morris engaged in illicit cigarette smuggling during the 1990s.   

Philip Morris has appealed the decision and continues negotiating a potential settlement with government officials. However, the company has declined to disclose any details while talks are still ongoing. At today's meeting, executives are expected to stick to that position if pressed for updates by shareholders, citing the sensitivity of the negotiations.

Outside the meeting venue, public health advocates plan to stage a protest urging Philip Morris to drop its appeal and pay the full $12 million penalty. They argue that the company has already dragged out the legal process for too long through various appeals and that a settlement at this point would only serve to reduce the penalty amount, sending the wrong message about illegal corporate behavior.  

For its part, Philip Morris maintains that "discussions are continuing confidentially and in good faith." Company CEO Andre Calantzopoulos will likely reiterate that position during introductory remarks at the start of today's shareholder meeting. Attendees can then submit questions during a 30-minute Q&A session, though follow-ups on the topic of settlement talks seem destined to yield few, if any, substantive answers from Philip Morris officials.
