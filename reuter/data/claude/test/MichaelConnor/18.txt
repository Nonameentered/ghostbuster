John Grisham's "Runaway Jury" Haunts Cigarette Companies in Florida Courtrooms   

The fictitious tale of tobacco companies rigging a trial depicted in John Grisham's 1996 legal thriller "Runaway Jury" is haunting real-life cigarette makers in Florida courtrooms. In Grisham's book turned movie, a lone juror seeks to punish cigarette companies for the health impacts of smoking. Now, it seems life is imitating art.   

This month, tobacco companies have paid out over $40 million in verdicts to just two plaintiffs in Florida who claimed that smoking caused their cancer. The verdicts came from juries in counties just miles from the setting of Grisham's book, New Orleans. 

On Wednesday, a jury in Escambia County awarded $28.7 million to Ashley Dutchess, whose lung cancer spread to her brain at the age of 36 after years of smoking Marlboro Reds and Pall Mall cigarettes. Dutchess said Philip Morris, the maker of those brands, knowingly withheld information about health risks and got her addicted at a young age through targeted marketing.  Philip Morris denies those claims, but the jury disagreed.

Just one week earlier, a Duval County jury awarded $13.9 million to Rosie Freeman, who started smoking at age 13 and was diagnosed with lung cancer at age 54. Freeman sued R.J Reynolds, the maker of Winston and Kool cigarettes. Like Dutchess, Freeman alleged the company deliberately marketed to children and hid health risks. R.J. Reynolds also denies those claims, but the jury sided with Freeman.

The back-to-back verdicts have spooked tobacco companies, which face over 2,000 similar lawsuits in Florida alone. "The facts were against them in these cases," said Morgan Pietz, a tobacco litigation expert. "But the 'Runaway Jury' effect is also real. Jurors have seen for decades how deceptive and harmful smoking is, and they want to punish these companies."

Anti-smoking advocates applauded the verdicts and said tobacco litigation can achieve what government regulation has not. "Lawsuits force these companies to pay a price, often in a very public way, for past and ongoing wrongdoing," said Matthew Myers of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 

Tobacco companies voiced disappointment in the verdicts and plan to appeal, asserting that rehashing old conspiracy theories is unfair and that individuals are responsible for their own choice to smoke. But as cigarettes continue to kill more than 400,000 Americans each year, "Runaway Jury" and real jurors in Florida courtrooms are determined to make someone pay the price.
