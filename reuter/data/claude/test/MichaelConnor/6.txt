Florida's Anti-Tobacco Activists Brace for Legislative Assault on Innovative Law

Anti-tobacco advocates in Florida are preparing for a fight as the state legislature considers rolling back parts of a landmark anti-smoking law passed last year. The 2019 Tobacco 21 law raised the minimum age for purchasing tobacco and e-cigarette products from 18 to 21, making Florida one of the first states to adopt such strict controls. 

Now some lawmakers want to make exceptions for military members, arguing those over 18 should have the right to make their own health decisions. Tobacco control groups counter that Tobacco 21 is having a major impact on underage smoking and any changes would undermine that progress. "This law is saving lives by making it harder for teenagers to access tobacco products," said Kristin Englund of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "We cannot afford to go backwards."

When the law took effect in October, Florida joined a growing national movement to curb teen vaping and smoking. By raising the minimum age to 21, the state aligned tobacco regulations with laws prohibiting underage alcohol sales. State health officials say the policy is already achieving its goal. In 2019, smoking among Florida high school students dropped to just 5.8% - the lowest rate ever recorded, according to the Florida Department of Health.

However, the law has also sparked criticism from some libertarian-minded lawmakers and tobacco industry advocates. They argue that if 18-year-olds can vote, marry and join the military, they should be free to make their own choices about tobacco use. A bill introduced in the state House of Representatives would exempt military members from the age requirement. Its sponsor said he wants to "support the rights of young adults serving our country."

Anti-tobacco groups counter that the military exemption is misguided and would severely damage the effectiveness of Tobacco 21. "When we make exceptions, we make loopholes," Englund said. "Any weakening of this policy will lead to more addiction and disease." With the legislative session now underway, both sides are mobilizing for a high-stakes battle over the future of Florida's hard-won anti-tobacco victory.
