Tobacco Industry Lawyers Accuse Judge of Failing to Reject Potential Jurors with Anti-Cigarette Prejudices

Lawyers representing major tobacco companies accused the judge presiding over a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit of failing to properly disqualify jury members with views prejudiced against the industry. During jury selection for the trial, the lawyers alleged Judge Tomas Rivera did not sufficiently deny potential jurors who expressed anti-tobacco sentiments. 

The class action suit filed on behalf of former smokers in New York seeks $800 million in damages from several tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, claiming they knowingly misled consumers about the addictive nature of cigarettes and their health hazards. With jury selection beginning this week, the lawyers argued that denial of jurors prejudiced against big tobacco was necessary for their clients to receive a fair trial.

In a brief filed with the court, the lawyers wrote that Judge Rivera approved several jurors who voiced negative views of tobacco companies during the jury screening process. "It is unacceptable and unjust that members of the jury were allowed to remain who had clearly and expressly stated their distaste for tobacco companies and their belief in their malfeasance before the trial has even begun," the lawyers stated. 

They cited examples of two jurors who were eventually dismissed but not initially rejected by Judge Rivera despite expressing strong anti-industry opinions. One stated that cigarette makers knowingly sold a "defective product" while another said they have a "long, long history of evil." The lawyers argued these statements reveal prejudice that would prevent fair consideration of the evidence, but Judge Rivera allowed the jurors to continue with the screening.

Judge Rivera has declined to comment on the allegations as the trial is ongoing. However, in the brief the tobacco lawyers also noted that the judge had made comments during the proceedings describing big tobacco companies as being part of a "conspiracy of deceit." They argued such comments contribute to prejudicing the jury pool against their clients, though Judge Rivera said they were taken out of context.

The trial, expected to last eight weeks, will continue at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Should the judge not take corrective action, the lawyers warned they would file an appeal to push for a mistrial and a new jury selection overseen by a different judge. For now, the tobacco giants face a jury of six men and six women who were ultimately approved after a lengthy screening process, though whether that jury went in with views skewed against the tobacco industry remains in dispute.
