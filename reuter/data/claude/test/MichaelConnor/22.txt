Tobacco companies brace for double-digit U.S. sales drop with possible $300 billion settlement deal  

The major tobacco companies in the U.S. are preparing for a significant decline in cigarette sales over the next decade as a result of a landmark settlement with state attorneys general. The proposed $300 billion agreement, which still needs to be approved, would require the companies to pay states for health care costs related to smoking-related illnesses.  

The settlement terms call for an immediate 10% price increase on all cigarettes to help fund the payments to states. Industry analysts expect this sharp price hike to accelerate the decline in U.S. smoking rates and cut cigarette sales volume by at least 2-3% a year over the next 10 years. This would amount to a loss of at least 25-30% in sales for the companies over the decade, compared to the 2% average annual decline in recent years.

“This will be a body blow to the tobacco industry in the U.S.,” said David Adelman, an industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. “The price increases will mean millions of smokers cut back or quit, and fewer young people start smoking regularly. The settlement effectively hamstrings the industry from using price cuts and discounts to stave off volume losses.”  

The three largest tobacco companies in the U.S.—Altria, Reynolds American and Imperial Brands—derive nearly all their U.S. revenue from cigarette sales, so steep sales declines pose an existential threat. They have lobbied to spread the settlement payments over more years to mitigate the impact, but state officials insist the bulk of the payments must be made in the early years of the deal.  

To offset the upcoming sales drop, the companies plan to accelerate cost-cutting measures and invest more in alternative products like e-cigarettes and oral nicotine pouches. Some analysts argue they should have diversified into non-nicotine categories years ago instead of remaining so heavily dependent on cigarette sales. They also note that the companies could face further legal and regulatory headwinds as anti-smoking advocates use the settlement deal as momentum to push for a ban on menthol cigarettes and other policy changes.

While declining cigarette sales will hurt U.S tobacco company revenues in the years ahead, the settlement may give their shares a short-term boost due to clarity on their legal liabilities. But the outlook for the companies in a post-settlement world remains hazy as they grapple for ways to stay viable amid a shrinking market for their once highly profitable core product. The next decade may determine whether these companies can outlive the deadly industry they helped build.
