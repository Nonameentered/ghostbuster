Knight-Ridder to buy four daily newspapers from ABC Inc for $1.65 billion

Knight-Ridder Inc, the second-largest U.S. newspaper publisher, has agreed to purchase four major daily newspapers from ABC Inc for $1.65 billion in cash. The sale includes The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Oregonian of Portland, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, and The Fresno Bee in California. 

The transaction will make Knight Ridder the publisher of 32 daily newspapers in 28 US markets with a combined circulation of 3.4 million. The acquisition significantly expands Knight Ridder's presence on the West Coast and reinforces its strategy of owning dominant newspapers in fast-growing markets. "This acquisition strengthens our portfolio of newspapers in major markets and affirms our confidence in the long-term future of newspapers as an advertising medium," said Tony Ridder, chairman and CEO of Knight Ridder.

The $1.65 billion purchase price represents a multiple of approximately 10 times the operating cash flow of the publications. The market value of publicly traded newspaper companies currently averages a multiple of about 11 times cash flow. ABC Inc put the newspapers up for sale earlier this year to focus on its core entertainment TV and radio businesses.

For Knight Ridder, the deal provides an opportunity to cut costs at the ABC newspapers by consolidating operations. The company believes it can achieve $50 million in annual pre-tax savings from reduced staffing in production, sales, and administration. The planned job cuts would amount to nearly 10% of the 6,000 employees currently working at the four newspapers. However, Knight Ridder said no major changes are planned for the newspapers' newsrooms.

The acquisition is subject to review by the U.S. Justice Department for any anti-competitive effects. However, analysts believe the deal is likely to be approved as Knight Ridder does not currently own any newspapers in those markets. The transaction is expected to close by the end of next month.
