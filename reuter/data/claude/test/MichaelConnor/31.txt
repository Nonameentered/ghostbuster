Philip Morris CEO Open to Reasonable Measures to Resolve Anti-Tobacco Lawsuits in the US 

The CEO of Philip Morris International, Andre Calantzopoulos, today signaled the company's openness to negotiating resolutions to ongoing tobacco-related litigation in the US. In remarks at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference, Calantzopoulos said "we remain open to discussing reasonable settlement measures with parties to resolve ongoing anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States." 

Philip Morris International was spun off from Altria Group in 2008 to focus on sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products outside the US. However, Philip Morris continues to face substantial legal claims related to health issues from smoking in the US, dating back decades. Calantzopoulos estimated the company still faces around 400 ongoing tobacco-related legal cases in the US.

The most prominent of these is a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice in 1999 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The government claimed major tobacco companies engaged in a decades-long conspiracy to mislead the public about the health risks of smoking. A federal judge found Philip Morris and other companies liable for racketeering in 2006. However, the financial penalties resulting from that verdict are still being litigated.

Philip Morris also remains exposed to class action lawsuits from individuals seeking damages for health issues related to tobacco use. While some major class action suits have been settled, others remain ongoing. Calantzopoulos said these represent "significant outstanding litigation risks" for the company in the US.

Calantzopoulos comments suggest Philip Morris may be more willing now to negotiate resolutions to at least some of these long-running disputes, rather than continuing to wage protracted legal battles. Any settlement deals would likely still result in substantial payouts by Philip Morris but would provide more certainty over legal liabilities. They may also help to continue improving Philip Morris's public image, which has been damaged for decades by revelations about the health impacts of smoking.

Continued litigation also represents ongoing legal costs for Philip Morris at a time when the company's US and overall sales and profits are under pressure. Philip Morris's shipment volumes fell nearly 5% last year in the US, accelerating a long-term trend of declining smoking rates.  Commenting on the company's 2019 results last month, Calantzopoulos cited "soft industry volume in the US" as a key challenge. Resolving even some ongoing lawsuits could free up resources to focus on new product initiatives and other strategies to counter declining cigarette sales over time.

The potential for settlement deals with some of its adversaries signals that Philip Morris may be reaching a point of seeking to turn the page on its history of disputes over the impact of smoking, even as it continues to face broader challenges remaking its business for the future. For anti-tobacco advocates, any deals may feel unsatisfactory but still represent an acknowledgment by Philip Morris of the real harms of its products after years of denials and legal defenses. The coming months will determine whether Calantzopoulos's openness to settlement translates into actual agreements and how far they go to resolving the company's remaining legal battles stemming from its tobacco legacy.
