General Electric CEO Defends $28.2 Million Salary in Face of Shareholder Criticism

General Electric CEO Larry Culp vigorously defended his $28.2 million compensation package as shareholders voiced some frustration at the size of executive pay at the struggling industrial conglomerate. At GE's annual shareholder meeting, Culp's pay proposal drew opposition from 26% of shareholders, a higher level than in past years. 

Culp, who took over as CEO in October 2018, argued that his high pay was necessary to lure executive talent to one of the most challenging turnaround situations in corporate America. GE has been working to slash costs and reduce debt after years of financial troubles and underperformance. But Culp's pay in 2019, which includes a $15 million bonus, still seemed excessive to some investors given the company's ongoing struggles.

"We understand the frustration with executive pay overall, but we structured this compensation to be fair and aligned with the performance of GE under enormously difficult circumstances," Culp said in response to criticism during the shareholder meeting. He noted that nearly 90% of his pay is at risk based on GE's performance. "My pay will only be realized if we achieve key milestones and create value for investors."

GE's board of directors defended Culp's pay in a proxy statement, saying his compensation was in line with peers and necessary to "attract and retain a world-class CEO to drive GE's transformation and turnaround." But several large institutional shareholders argued Culp's pay was still too high given GE's slumping stock price and financial challenges.

"While we support Mr. Culp, this level of compensation remains inappropriate relative to performance," said a representative from T. Rowe Price, which holds nearly 1% of GE's stock. The pay criticism underscores the balancing act around executive compensation, especially at companies needing a financial and operational overhaul. GE must pay enough to lure in top talent, but not so much that it fuels a perception of excess.

Culp's pay will likely remain an issue for investors if he is unable to engineer a turnaround and boost GE's stock price, revenue, and profits over the coming year. At a company long associated with lavish pay and perks, investors want to see performance recover before providing endorsements of top management salaries. GE's ability to regain investor trust may depend on Culp's success - and whether that success is matched by more reasonable pay in the eyes of shareholders.
