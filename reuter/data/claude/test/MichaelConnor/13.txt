Florida Judge Orders Liggett Group to Release Industry Documents for State Lawsuit Against Tobacco Companies 

A Florida judge ruled today that Liggett Group, one of the five major US tobacco companies, must release millions of internal documents for use in Florida's lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Circuit Judge Harold Cohen ordered Liggett to produce almost all of its documents requested by the state, including confidential memos discussing the manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes, marketing to teens, and the health impacts of smoking.

The ruling is a major win for Florida and other states seeking to recover damages from tobacco companies for smoking-related health costs. The documents are expected to provide damning evidence showing that tobacco companies conspired to hide the addictive nature and health risks of smoking for decades. "These documents will prove to be a treasure trove of evidence revealing the egregious wrongdoing of the tobacco industry," said Florida Attorney General Peter Antorino in a statement.

Liggett had fought aggressively to keep the documents private, arguing that they contained legally privileged trade secrets. However, Judge Cohen rejected that argument, noting that any privileged information could be redacted. He ordered Liggett to start turning over documents to Florida attorneys next week on a rolling basis. Liggett is expected to appeal the ruling to a higher court.

The Florida lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in January. The state is seeking $33 billion in damages from the major tobacco companies, including Liggett's parent company Vector Group, to recover healthcare costs attributed to smoking over the past two decades. Four other states - Minnesota, Mississippi, Massachusetts and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida - have already won settlements totaling over $150 billion from the industry. 

Anti-smoking advocates applauded Judge Cohen's ruling, saying it could help Florida clinch its own substantial settlement. "This decision will make it much harder for the tobacco companies to hide the truth in court," said John Bloom of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. Investors, meanwhile, worried that Liggett may face significant legal and financial exposure, driving Vector Group's stock down over 4% in trading today. The broader tobacco industry also declined on the news.

In a statement, Liggett said it was "disappointed" in Judge Cohen's ruling but would comply with the court order. The company reiterated that it has changed its practices since the documents in question were produced, and argued that it should not be liable for the actions of the tobacco industry as a whole. However, anti-smoking groups claim Liggett continues to market cigarettes to vulnerable groups like low-income and minority communities.

The high-stakes Florida case is being closely watched as yet another "tobacco trial of the century." The documents and testimony in the trial could reshape public opinion on smoking and have major financial ramifications for cigarette makers, which face continuing pressure in the US and abroad.
