Judge Accuses Tobacco-Industry Lawyers of 'Playing with Their Heads' During Jury Selection for Secondhand Smoke Case

Opening statements are scheduled to begin today in the lawsuit against three major tobacco companies accusing them of deliberately misleading the public about the health effects of secondhand smoke. However, jury selection in the case hit an unexpected roadblock yesterday when the presiding judge harshly criticized defense attorneys for their line of questioning to potential jurors.

Judge Ernestine Wright of the Suffolk County Superior Court admonished lawyers for Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Lorillard for "playing mind games" with jurors during voir dire, the process of questioning potential jurors to assess their suitability and impartiality. Judge Wright reprimanded the tobacco companies' counsel for asking questions clearly aimed at swaying jury members' views in favor of the defense before the trial has even started.  

"You are playing with their heads right now and I don't appreciate it," Judge Wright told the defense attorneys. She cited several examples of objectionable questions, including asking jurors whether they believe "people should take personal responsibility for their choices and decisions regarding potentially harmful products." The judge said such a question implied that secondhand smoke is merely a matter of personal choice, a central argument of the tobacco companies that has not yet been debated in court. 

Other questions Judge Wright took issue with included asking potential jurors whether they believe lawsuits should primarily aim to punish companies for wrongdoing or whether the primary goal should be to compensate injured parties. The judge said these types of questions were "blatant attempts" to nudge jurors toward an opinion when they are supposed to enter the case with an open mind.

The lawsuit was brought by the family of a woman who died of lung cancer in 2015 at age 53. The family claims she was exposed to hazardous levels of secondhand smoke in the restaurant where she worked as a waitress for over 30 years. They argue the tobacco companies conspired to hide the dangers of secondhand smoke and are liable for the medical costs and other damages resulting from her illness and death.

Attorneys for the tobacco companies defend their jury selection tactics as intended to " uncover any preexisting biases." They argue an impartial jury is central to their clients' right to a fair trial but maintain their questions were not meant to be prejudicial. The defense lawyers also emphasized that both sides were given equal opportunity to question jurors. 

With a jury now seated, opening arguments are set to commence this morning in the case which is expected to last 6 to 8 weeks. Regardless of the impending trial, Judge Wright's reprimand of the defense counsel signals an early victory for the plaintiffs in the high-stakes case. Her condemnation of the tobacco companies' aggressive jury screening tactics suggests their efforts may have backfired. The ultimate verdict of the jury remains to be seen.
