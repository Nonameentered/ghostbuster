Miami TV Producer Removed from Standby Jurors in Florida's $5 Billion Secondhand Smoke Trial 

Miami, FL - A Miami television producer was removed from the pool of standby jurors in Florida's landmark $5 billion class-action lawsuit against big tobacco companies. The trial, which began last month, aims to determine whether tobacco companies conspired to hide the dangers of secondhand smoke.

Jorge Estevez, an executive producer at WSVN Channel 7 News, was originally selected to be on call as an alternate juror for the trial that is expected to last two months. However, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, two of the largest tobacco companies in the U.S., requested Estevez be dismissed after discovering his profession. Lawyers for the tobacco companies argued that as a journalist, Estevez may not be able to be impartial in a trial of this prominence and scope.

Circuit Judge David Miller granted the motion to strike Estevez from the standby jury pool. "There is a possibility his experience as a journalist could influence his ability to be an impartial juror, or at least give that appearance," Judge Miller said. Estevez did not challenge his removal from the jury.

The class-action lawsuit was brought by Cynthia Robinson and her family, who are suing the tobacco companies for conspiracy and fraud. Robinson's mother died in 1996 from lung cancer after being exposed to secondhand smoke for over 40 years. The Robinsons argue that tobacco companies engaged in a coordinated campaign to hide health risks associated with secondhand smoke and target children to become new smokers.

Lawyers for Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds deny any conspiracy or fraud occurred. In opening statements, attorneys for the tobacco companies said that while secondhand smoke exposure is harmful, the companies never conspired to hide information or mislead the public about its dangers. The tobacco companies also argue that public knowledge about health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke has been widespread since the 1950s.

The outcome of this trial could have huge implications for the tobacco industry. A verdict in favor of the plaintiffs could open up tobacco companies to a flood of similar lawsuits from victims of secondhand smoke exposure across Florida and the United States. The $5 billion in punitive damages the Robinsons are seeking would also be the largest financial penalty ever placed on the tobacco industry for a single lawsuit.
