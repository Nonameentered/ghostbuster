Former U.S. Surgeon General Testifies Against Cigarette Makers in Class-Action Trial 

The former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy testified today as an expert witness in a class-action lawsuit against two major tobacco companies, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Philip Morris USA. Dr. Murthy, who served as Surgeon General under President Obama from 2014 to 2017, said cigarette smoking remains an ongoing public health threat that was the direct result of efforts by tobacco companies to mislead the public about the risks and addictiveness of their products.

The lawsuit was brought by a group of individuals and families of deceased smokers, alleging that R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris deliberately made their cigarettes as addictive as possible while marketing to children and hiding the true health impacts of smoking from the public. In his testimony, Dr. Murthy said at least 480,000 deaths in the U.S. each year are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. He cited evidence that the majority of smokers in the U.S. want to quit but struggle with addiction to nicotine, calling it one of the hardest addictions to break.

Dr. Murthy told the court that as early as the 1950s, tobacco companies were aware that nicotine in cigarettes was addictive, but publicly denied that fact for decades. Internal company documents revealed cigarette makers deliberately manipulated nicotine levels to keep smokers addicted. "Through careful research and testing, these companies identified the precise combination and levels of nicotine that would be most effective at creating and sustaining addiction," Dr. Murthy said. "They weaponized nicotine in the form of cigarettes to keep people smoking every day."

The companies' marketing to children and lies about health impacts amounted to "a multi-generational campaign of deception that continues today," Dr. Murthy testified. He said e-cigarettes and vaping devices introduced new types of health risks and addicted a new generation to nicotine. "The tobacco industry has demonstrated time and again that they will stop at nothing to increase the number of smokers and maximize profits," Dr. Murthy told the jury. 

Lawyers for the tobacco companies are scheduled to cross-examine Dr. Murthy tomorrow. In filings, the companies denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said smokers made an informed choice to start and continue smoking. The trial in Miami, Florida which began two weeks ago is expected to last several more months. If found liable, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris could face tens of billions of dollars in damages.
