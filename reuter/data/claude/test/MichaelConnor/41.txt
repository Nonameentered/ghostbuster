First Anti-Smoking Class-Action Lawsuit Against Tobacco Industry Goes to Trial in Florida With Flight Attendants as Plaintiffs

A landmark class-action lawsuit claiming the tobacco industry knowingly endangered the health of flight attendants by forcing them to work in a smoke-filled environment went to trial Tuesday in Florida before a judge. The lawsuit is considered a potential bellwether case for thousands of similar claims that could cost the industry billions if decided in favor of the plaintiffs.

The trial in federal court in Miami centers on 5,000 former and current flight attendants who allege their health was harmed after years of exposure to secondhand smoke while working in aircraft cabins that allowed smoking in the 1970s and 1980s. The attendants say tobacco companies knew of the health risks of secondhand smoke but took no action to protect workers or passengers.

The class-action lawsuit consolidates claims filed by multiple plaintiffs starting in the 1990s against major tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; Philip Morris USA, Inc.; and Lorillard Tobacco Company. The lawsuit alleges claims of negligence, conspiracy to defraud, and fraudulent misrepresentation. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. 

Attorneys for the flight attendants told the jury in opening statements that their clients suffered higher rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, and throat cancer â€” all linked to secondhand smoke exposure. They plan to present scientific studies showing the risks of environmental tobacco smoke in confined spaces like aircraft. 

Defense attorneys countered that the risks of secondhand smoke were not conclusively proven at the time. They argued that ventilation systems on planes mitigated health risks and said the flight attendants were aware of potential risks when they took the job. They also claimed tobacco companies could not control how airlines designed cabins or set policy.

The outcome of the trial is being closely watched by major U.S. airlines, which could face their own lawsuits if the case is decided in favor of the plaintiffs. Several large airlines banned smoking on domestic flights in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But many international airlines and airlines in Asia continued to allow smoking into the 2000s.

The trial is expected to last three to four weeks. Both sides have lined up medical experts to testify about the health effects of secondhand smoke and what was known about risks at the time. The jury's decision could have far-reaching consequences on future litigation against the powerful tobacco industry.
