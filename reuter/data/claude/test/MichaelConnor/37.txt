AutoNation Faces Lawsuits From Toyota and Honda Over Dealership Acquisitions

AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the U.S., is facing lawsuits from Toyota and Honda over its attempts to acquire their dealerships in several states. The auto giants argue that AutoNation's purchase of the dealerships violates state franchise laws and threatens competition.

Toyota filed a lawsuit this week in California alleging that AutoNation's purchase of two Toyota dealerships in the Los Angeles area would substantially reduce competition and limit consumer choice. The lawsuit seeks to block the acquisitions, which would give AutoNation control over 8 out of the 31 Toyota dealerships in the Greater Los Angeles market.  

"These transactions pose a serious threat to competition in the Los Angeles area and will lead to higher prices and reduced services for customers," Toyota said in a statement. "AutoNation has a history of aggressively consolidating local markets in a way that limits consumer options."

Honda filed a similar lawsuit in Texas last month, contending that AutoNation's proposed purchase of Honda dealerships in Houston and Dallas would dominate those markets and hurt consumers. Honda claims the acquisitions would give AutoNation control of 30% of Honda's dealerships in the Dallas area and 50% in Houston.  

AutoNation rejected the automakers' arguments. "These lawsuits are baseless and anticompetitive," said AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson in a statement. "AutoNation's goal is to better serve customers through operational efficiencies, and we intend to fight to preserve consumer choice and fair competition."

AutoNation has acquired dozens of dealerships across the country over the last decade, making it a formidable force. Critics argue this aggressive strategy has given it near-monopoly power in some markets, though AutoNation says it lowers costs through economies of scale and passes savings to customers. 

The lawsuits threaten to curb AutoNation's ambitions as it looks to expand further in major cities. They also signal that automakers may take a tougher stance against large dealer groups that dominate local markets. How the cases proceed could have an impact on the ongoing power balance between automakers and national dealer chains.
