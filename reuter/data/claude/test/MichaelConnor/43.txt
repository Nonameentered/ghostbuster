Tiny Family-Owned Tobacco Company Swept Up in Legal Battle of Century Against Tobacco Giants and State of Florida  

The Reynolds Family Tobacco Company has been making premium hand-rolled cigars and pipe tobacco for five generations in Central Florida. Founded in 1926 by Timothy Reynolds, the small family business employs just 28 people and generates $4.2 million in annual revenue selling to a loyal base of customers around the state.

But now the tiny company finds itself caught in the midst of a sprawling legal battle between major tobacco companies and the State of Florida, which is seeking to recover health care costs from tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses. Because Reynolds Family Tobacco is also in the tobacco business, it has been named as a defendant in the case, even though it produces only cigars and pipe tobacco, not cigarettes.

"We're a speck of dust compared to the big tobacco companies, but we've gotten swept up in the same broom," said current owner Mark Reynolds, the founder's great-grandson. "Our products have nothing to do with the health issues from cigarette smoking, but that hasn't stopped the lawyers and the state from including us."

The case is the largest in Florida's history, with major companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds facing a potential verdict of up to $200 billion. While those giant firms can withstand long, complex litigation, the legal fees and time demands may crush Reynolds Family Tobacco. At a preliminary hearing last month, a circuit judge denied a motion to dismiss the family business from the case.

"It's ridiculous that a company like ours, that produces traditional cigars and pipe tobacco, is being put in the same category as those that made and advertised cigarettes for decades," said LeeAnn Reynolds, the company's longtime production manager. "We don't mass produce anything. We have a small factory with craftspeople who hand roll cigars the same way our great-grandfather did. This is going to bankrupt us before we even have our day in court."

The State of Florida argues that all tobacco companies should share in the health care costs for smoking-related illnesses, regardless of their size or primary products. While cigars and pipe tobacco may have lower health risks than cigarettes, the state maintains they are not risk-free and tobacco companies knew of the addictive nature of nicotine. However, some legal observers argue the state has overreached by including small businesses like Reynolds Family Tobacco in such a sprawling, complicated case.

With legal bills already over $100,000 and climbing each month, Mark and LeeAnn Reynolds have started a crowdfunding campaign to help save a company they describe as "a family legacy and an irreplaceable part of Florida history." They are appealing to customers, history buffs, and "anyone who believes in protecting small family businesses" to make contributions. The Reynolds are also meeting with state legislators to propose exempting small companies that produce only cigars and pipe tobacco from litigation meant primarily for major cigarette producers. But time is running out, as the landmark trial against Big Tobacco is set to begin in just six months.
