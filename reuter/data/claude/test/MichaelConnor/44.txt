Dosal Tobacco Co., a small family-owned cigarette maker, faces lawsuits alongside tobacco giants such as RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris

Dosal Tobacco Co., a small, third-generation family business based in Richmond, Virginia, is facing a spate of lawsuits related to the health effects of its tobacco products. Although the company is dwarfed in size by tobacco giants such as RJR Nabisco, Philip Morris, and British American Tobacco, attorneys general in five states have named Dosal in lawsuits targeting the industry. 

The attorneys general argue that Dosal, like the major tobacco companies, marketed cigarettes to young people and misled consumers about the addictive nature of nicotine and health risks of smoking. “Big Tobacco isn't the only culprit here. Smaller companies like Dosal have also been complicit in targeting underage smokers and obscuring the truth about the dangers of their products,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who filed suit last week.

Dosal produces 10 million cigarettes annually, a tiny fraction of the overall market. However, the company has been family-run for three generations and employs over 200 people, making it an institution in Richmond. “My grandfather started this business, and we have always followed the rules and done things the right way,” said CEO Mike Dosal. “It's unfair and wrong to lump us in with companies that marketed to children." Dosal's cigarette brands are smoked primarily in Virginia and three other Southern states.

The legal scrutiny comes at a difficult time for the small company. Revenue has declined over 50% in the past decade as anti-smoking campaigns have reduced the number of U.S. smokers. Mike Dosal said the lawsuits have further strained resources and threatened jobs. "We're struggling as it is, and these lawsuits could put us out of business," he said. "Is that really the goal here, shutting down companies that provide jobs and economic benefit to their communities?"

However, attorneys general argue that Dosal's small size does not exempt it from responsibility. “Dosal has been producing and selling addictive and deadly tobacco products for decades, just like the bigger companies,” Healey said. “Size and local ownership don't matter when lives are at stake.” Anti-smoking advocates argue that the only way to curb the public health impacts of tobacco is for companies of all sizes, including small ones like Dosal, to be held accountable.

The legal battles ahead are likely to be lengthy and complex, as similar cases against major tobacco companies have spanned years and even decades. For now, Dosal Tobacco's fate hangs in the balance as both sides make their cases in the courts of law and public opinion.
