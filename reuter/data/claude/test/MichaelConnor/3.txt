Disney's Entry into Cruise Industry Sparks Competition Among U.S. Vacation Market Leaders 

The Walt Disney Company made a splash this week with the announcement that it will enter the cruise industry in 2022. The company unveiled plans for two new cruise ships that will set sail in 2022 and 2024, taking families on voyages to the Bahamas and Caribbean. 

The move is a major expansion for Disney into the broader vacation and travel market. The company has dominated theme park tourism for decades but has not operated a cruise line until now. Disney Cruise Line will offer entertainment, dining, and recreation options themed around popular Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars characters and stories.

Disney's entry into the fast-growing cruise market poses a new threat to major players like Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Line. These companies have competed for the family and group vacation market for years but now face the prospect of battling the beloved Mickey and Minnie Mouse characters for customers.  

In response to Disney's announcement, shares of major cruise operators initially dropped as much as 4 percent before recovering some losses. Analysts said Disney's brand power and devoted customer following will make it a formidable competitor, despite being a late entrant into the market. Disney could leverage its popular theme parks to drive traffic to its new cruise ships.

Carnival and Royal Caribbean released statements welcoming the competition from Disney but also touting their experience and larger fleet of ships. “We offer itineraries around the world from short getaways to epic adventures, giving our guests a wide range of memorable experiences,” Carnival said in a statement. Royal Caribbean emphasized its variety of entertainment, dining and activity options for multi-generational families.

Norwegian Cruise Line had the most spirited response. “While Disney is a formidable competitor, Norwegian Cruise Line has been at the forefront of family cruise vacations for over 55 years. No one knows family cruising like we do,” said CEO Frank Del Rio. 

Travel industry experts predicted consumers will benefit from the competition with cruise fares and entertainment options rising while service quality is spurred upward. Multi-generational travel and family vacations are a fast-growing segment of the broader tourism market, so the industry newcomer and old hands are poised to battle it out for the next generation of customers seeking an unforgettable cruise experience.

The cruise industry overall continues to expand rapidly by drawing in new customers and earning high satisfaction rates from those who embark on voyages. Cruise operators have never had a more promising ocean ahead, now with another major player in Disney steering a course into the mix. Rough waters may lay ahead as competitors vie for position, but fair winds and following seas appear likely for the whole cruise sector with more families setting sail for adventure.
