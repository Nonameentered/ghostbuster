Florida Judge Denies Tobacco Companies' Request to Delay Flight Attendants' Class-Action Lawsuit Trial

A Florida judge refused a request by major tobacco companies to delay the start of a trial in a class-action lawsuit brought by flight attendants exposed to secondhand smoke in airplanes. The trial is set to begin on February 3 in Miami and tobacco companies sought to push back the start date by at least six months.

In a January 10 ruling, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beatrice Butchko denied the request by Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and Lorillard LLC,  subsidiaries of Altria, British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands. The tobacco companies claimed they needed more time to prepare their defense given what they called "recently disclosed evidence." However, Judge Butchko was unpersuaded by the companies' arguments and ruled the trial will proceed as scheduled.

The class-action lawsuit was first filed in 1998 on behalf of flight attendants who claimed exposure to toxic secondhand smoke in airplane cabins made them ill and put them at higher risk of disease. Despite bans on smoking on domestic flights and most international flights, flight attendants were still exposed to lingering secondhand smoke for years. The lawsuit argues tobacco companies should have taken action to reduce health risks from secondhand smoke exposure. 

"After 20 years of legal maneuvering by the tobacco companies, we are thrilled the flight attendants will finally have their day in court," said lead attorney Steven Marks of Podhurst Orseck. "The flight attendants deserve justice for the health impacts from constant exposure to secondhand smoke."

Representatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, and Imperial Brands declined to comment on pending litigation. If found liable, the companies could face billions of dollars in damages. Closing arguments in the trial are expected in early April. 

The outcome of the trial is being closely watched as it could set a precedent for similar secondhand smoke claims from others in the transportation industry like casino workers. The flight attendants' lawsuit is one of the first to make it to trial out of thousands of similar claims filed against major tobacco companies over the health impacts of secondhand smoke.
