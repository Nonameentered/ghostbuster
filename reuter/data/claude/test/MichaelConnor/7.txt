Florida anti-tobacco activists face legislative assault on lawsuit law  

Anti-tobacco activists in Florida are scrambling to defeat legislation aimed at undercutting a constitutional amendment approved by voters that enables lawsuits against the tobacco industry.

The amendment, known as Amendment 7, granted the legislature the authority to allow lawsuits seeking damages related to the health impacts of smoking. It was approved by nearly 70% of Florida voters in 2006. Amendment 7 opened the door for individuals and government entities to sue tobacco companies to recoup the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.

However, the Florida legislature is now moving two bills—House Bill 747 and Senate Bill 1890—that would drastically limit lawsuits under Amendment 7. The bills would bar lawsuits for conduct that occurred before the current 20-year statute of limitations, even if damages were incurred later. The legislation would also force local governments to use any damages won to fund additional healthcare costs rather than general funds. 

Anti-smoking advocates argue this violates the will of voters and the intent of Amendment 7. “The people of Florida wanted to hold Big Tobacco accountable for the devastation from smoking, and now the legislature is trying to let them off the hook,” said John Jordan, a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.

Tobacco companies and their legislative allies counter that the bills curb “abusive lawsuits” and ensure any damages are used properly. “We need to protect Florida businesses from predatory lawsuits while also responsibly funding healthcare,” said Rep. Cindy Trumbull, a sponsor of HB 747. “Our legislation strikes a fair balance.”

With control of both houses of the legislature and the governorship, Republicans are likely to pass the bills despite staunch Democratic opposition. However, anti-tobacco groups are urging Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto the legislation and respect the will of voters. If signed into law, the new restrictions would take effect July 1. But more legal battles are sure to follow in the years-long saga of Florida's fight against Big Tobacco.
