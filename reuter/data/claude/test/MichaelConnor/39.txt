Anti-smoking lawsuits continue despite potential settlement with tobacco companies

Tobacco companies are close to finalizing a settlement worth $140 billion to resolve thousands of state lawsuits over the health effects of smoking. However, the potential settlement is not stopping individual smokers and their families from filing new lawsuits alleging that tobacco companies knowingly sold dangerous and addictive products.

On Monday, a Florida jury awarded $21 million in compensatory damages to Victor Capriati, who started smoking at age 13 and was diagnosed with lung cancer at age 30. The jury found R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, makers of Camel cigarettes, liable for fraud, conspiracy, and negligence. The jury decided that R.J. Reynolds deliberately targeted underage smokers like Capriati with their marketing and introduction of flavored cigarettes, while falsely claiming that smoking was cool and posed little health risk.

The case is one of over 1,000 pending lawsuits in Florida alone against tobacco companies. Lawyers for smokers say the potential multi-state settlement, which has not yet received final approval, will have no impact on these individual claims. "The master settlement agreement was never designed to compensate individual smokers for the human toll of this industry's callous and deadly practices," said William Kelly, an attorney representing Capriati. 

Tobacco companies argue that they cannot be held liable for the choices individual adults made to smoke, even if they were underage when first taking up the habit. But anti-smoking advocates argue that tobacco marketing has long been targeted at teenagers and children. "If they didn't get kids to start smoking, they wouldn't have the adult customers that they now have," said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Legal experts expect more cases like Capriati's to go before juries in the coming years. While the potential multi-billion-dollar settlement may face legal challenges of its own, individual smokers and families are still seeking their day in court. "The tobacco companies should not be allowed to just write a big check and consider this over," said Kelly. "They still have to face the real human toll of what they have done." For smokers like Capriati, the lawsuits come too late, but they see them as a way to find justice and hold the tobacco industry accountable for decades of what they call wrongdoing and deception.
