Kodak Sells Copier-Marketing and Service Operations for $684 Million 
to Danka Business Systems Plc, Retains Manufacturing and Development Operations

Eastman Kodak Company announced today that it has sold its copier-marketing and service operations to Danka Business Systems PLC for $684 million in cash. The deal includes Kodak's U.S. and Canada Business Equipment Services, which provides hardware and software installation, as well as consulting and product support services for Kodak copiers and printers. However, Kodak will retain its core manufacturing and copier technology development operations as part of its refocused business strategy. 

The sale of the service arm is part of Kodak's ongoing transformation into a digital company focused on photography and imaging. Kodak views copier-marketing and service as a non-core activity that does not fully leverage its digital imaging capabilities. The company has found the business field overpopulated with many competitors and low profit margins, making it difficult to achieve sustainable operational scale and efficiency. Under the terms of the deal, Danka, a U.K.-based office technology services firm, will gain about $400 million in annual revenues and 3,600 Kodak employees who currently work in copier services.

Kodak's chief executive officer, Daniel Carp, stated: "This sale sharpens our business focus and strengthens our balance sheet. At the same time, customers will benefit from Danka's commitment to providing high quality, responsive service." Danka's chief executive officer, Clifton S. Robbins, noted: "We are tremendously enthusiastic about the opportunity to add Kodak's exceptional people, customers, and on-site service capabilities to our U.S. organization."

The sale is expected to close in the next 60 days pending regulatory approval. Kodak expects net proceeds of about $600 million after taxes and fees are deducted. Kodak plans to use the funds to pay down debt and invest in its core digital technology development. The sale is unlikely to significantly affect Kodak's manufacturing operations and copier products in the short term. However, long term, Kodak is likely to narrow its focus to higher-end copiers and printers that best showcase its proprietary technology innovations for businesses and commercial customers.
