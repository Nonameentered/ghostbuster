Top Citicorp Managers Testify in Grand Jury Probe of Possible Money Laundering Involving Mexican President's Brother 

Several top executives from Citicorp, the Latin America arm of Citibank NA, testified this week before a federal grand jury in New York investigating possible money laundering involving Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas. According to sources close to the investigation, the grand jury is probing allegations that Raul Salinas laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drug profits through Citibank accounts during his brother's presidency.

The New York Times reported today that among those testifying were Eduardo Baez Pena, chairman of Citicorp Latin America, and Manuel Friedmann, head of Citibank in Mexico. They were joined by Citicorp compliance officials responsible for ensuring the bank followed laws concerning money laundering. The executives were reportedly questioned for several hours about Citibank's relationship with Raul Salinas, who is currently imprisoned in Mexico on charges of masterminding a series of murders.

Prosecutors are investigating whether Citicorp officials ignored warning signs that the many millions of dollars moving through Salinas's accounts were the proceeds of criminal activity. Mexican officials previously estimated that Raul Salinas accumulated as much as $500 million during his brother's term as president from 1988 to 1994. Swiss officials found $100 million in Swiss bank accounts linked to Salinas after Carlos Salinas left office. The Mexican government claims much of the money originally came from drug traffickers in Mexico and Latin America.

If indicted and convicted, Citicorp could face heavy fines and penalties for failing to detect and report suspicious activity in the Salinas accounts. The case is being closely watched by banking regulators and law enforcement as a test of how well banks have complied with laws cracking down money laundering through the global financial system. Citicorp and Citibank have previously paid large fines for violating banking laws, though they denied any systematic failure or willful wrongdoing in their handling of the Salinas accounts.

In a statement, Citicorp reiterated that it has “robust procedures” for detecting illegal money laundering and works diligently with law enforcement to identify and stamp out financial crimes. However, prosecutors believe the Salinas case highlights the broader challenges facing large global banks in monitoring for and curtailing money laundering by wealthy and politically-connected clients. The investigation is continuing and further indictments could be issued in coming months, according to the sources.
