Failure of Liggett Group's Pact to Shake Confidence of North Carolina Tobacco Growers  

The collapse of Liggett Group's 10-year deal to buy most of North Carolina's tobacco crop threatens to shake the confidence of tobacco growers in the state. For years, Liggett's agreement had provided price stability and income security for farmers in North Carolina, which remains the largest tobacco-producing state in the U.S.

Last week, Liggett Group, the fifth-largest U.S. tobacco company, announced it was terminating the agreement and would not renew its annual contract with the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina. The contract was set to expire at the end of this year's harvest. Liggett cited declining cigarette sales and profit pressures as reasons for abandoning the long-term deal.

The news sent shockwaves through North Carolina's tobacco farming communities. "We were blindsided by this," said Andy Jordan, a tobacco grower from Smithfield, N.C., who has sold more than half his crop to Liggett each year under the agreement. "Liggett's contract was a lifeline for many family farms, and now that lifeline has been cut."

Without the Liggett deal, North Carolina tobacco farmers will now have to sell their crops on the open market each year and hope for the best. Prices could fluctuate wildly from year to year, jeopardizing the economic stability of farms. Farm advocates worry some small family farms may go under, accelerating the broader decline of tobacco farming in the state.

The lost Liggett pact could also have ripple effects beyond North Carolina as tobacco growers in other Southeastern states may face more price uncertainty and competition from North Carolina farmers. Roughly 60% of U.S. tobacco is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

State political leaders are urging tobacco farmers not to panic and have promised to help find new purchasers for their crops. But replacing a long-term deal like the Liggett pact will be difficult, and few think a deal that provides the same level of security and stable income can be achieved quickly. For now, the future of North Carolina's tobacco farms looks foggier without the once-dependable Liggett Group in the picture.
