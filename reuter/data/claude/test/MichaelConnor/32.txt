Philip Morris Shareholders Reject Proposal to Extend Youth Marketing Standards to Overseas Markets

Shareholders of tobacco giant Philip Morris International rejected a proposal that would have extended the company's youth marketing restrictions to overseas markets at its annual meeting today. The proposal, put forward by the advocacy group Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund, aimed to prevent Philip Morris from marketing tobacco products to young people under the age of 21 in countries outside the United States. 

However, the proposal failed to gain majority support from shareholders. Philip Morris has strict rules against marketing to youth in the U.S. but does not apply those same standards in many markets abroad, where the bulk of its sales and profits come from. Supporters of the proposal argued that youth tobacco use is a global issue and Philip Morris should enact consistent policies across all the countries it operates in.

"It is deeply troubling that Philip Morris refuses to protect kids from tobacco marketing, no matter where they live," said Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "By failing to extend its U.S. marketing restrictions globally, Philip Morris is operating with a dangerous double standard that threatens the health of youth around the world."

Philip Morris executives opposed the proposal, saying that tobacco regulation differs significantly between countries and is the role of government authorities, not the company itself. Chairman Louis Camilleri defended the company's marketing practices as "responsible and compliant" with all laws. He argued that an inconsistent patchwork of voluntary restrictions could disadvantage Philip Morris compared to competitors in some markets.

The rejection of the proposal deals a blow to anti-smoking advocates working to curb youth tobacco use on a global scale. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Preventing tobacco companies from marketing to youth is seen as vital to long-term health initiatives. However, extending restrictions into diverse, emerging markets has proven challenging.

The vote at today's meeting suggests Philip Morris and its shareholders are not yet willing to take that step voluntarily. Anti-smoking groups pledged to continue putting public pressure on the company while also working to strengthen laws against youth tobacco marketing around the world. But for now, Philip Morris will not be applying the standards it maintains in the U.S. to its vast global network of overseas operations.
