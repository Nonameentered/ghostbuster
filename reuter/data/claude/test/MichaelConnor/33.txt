GE CEO Defends $28.2 Million Salary, Bonuses and Incentives for 1996

General Electric CEO Jack Welch defended his $28.2 million compensation package for 1996 at the company's annual shareholder meeting today. Welch's salary, bonuses, and long-term incentive awards made him the second-highest-paid executive in the U.S. last year, according to an Associated Press analysis. 

Welch argued that his pay was fair given GE's strong performance under his leadership. "My compensation directly links how I do and how all GE employees do," Welch said. "So if the company has a good year, I have a good year. If the company has a bad year, I have a bad year."

GE's stock price rose 35% last year and profits were up 15% from the previous year. Welch also highlighted GE's success in growing foreign markets during a period when the U.S. economy was sluggish. "The results we produced were among the best of my career at GE," Welch said. "The pay I received was directly tied to those measurable results."

However, some shareholders argued that Welch's compensation package was too generous given the average pay of GE workers. According to recent U.S. census data, the median household income in the U.S. is around $50,000 per year. "The gap between what our CEO makes and what our employees make is outrageous and unfair," said Shareholders for Ethics and Fairness, a group that owns GE stock. They introduced a proposal to cap executive pay at 20 times the pay of the company's average worker, but it was voted down at the meeting.

Welch countered that his salary has little bearing on the pay GE offers other employees. "My compensation is set to attract and retain the leadership this complex global enterprise requires," Welch said. "Compensation for our production workers has to be competitive in the markets we operate in." GE says the average production worker at the company earned $48,000 in pay and benefits last year.

The debate over excessive executive pay has been raging since the early 1990s, but some experts argue that as long as shareholders approve, CEO pay should be left to the free market. GE's directors say Welch earned every dollar and has created more than $400 billion in shareholder value during his tenure. But critics argue the pay gap exacerbates economic inequality and could damage corporate culture. The controversy seems likely to continue as executive pay rises while middle-class wages stagnate.
