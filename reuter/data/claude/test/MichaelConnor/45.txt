Judge Rules to Question Jurors Separately in Groundbreaking $5 Billion Secondhand-Smoke Trial 

In a surprising move, the judge in the landmark $5 billion secondhand-smoke trial against Big Tobacco Inc. ruled today that jurors will be questioned individually during the jury selection process. Judge Margaret Chen announced her decision after two days of heated arguments between prosecutors and the tobacco company's defense team. Prosecutors had pushed for individual questioning, arguing that it would allow jurors to speak more freely about their views without influence from other potential jurors. Big Tobacco's lawyers objected, calling the move unnecessary and claiming it could bias the jury pool.

The trial, brought by the family of lung cancer victim Betty Simmons, accuses Big Tobacco of negligence and deceptive marketing that led to Simmons' illness and wrongful death from exposure to secondhand smoke. If Big Tobacco is found liable, it would be the largest verdict ever against a tobacco company. Simmons' family is seeking $5 billion in damages to fund anti-smoking advocacy and research. 

Jury selection was already expected to be a complex process, given the high-profile nature of the case and the polarized views on smoking and health in the broader public. Legal experts say individual questioning will allow lawyers on both sides to probe more deeply into jurors' opinions and uncover any prejudices. "There are many hot-button issues here, from views on corporate responsibility to personal freedoms to health care costs," said Alison Green, a former prosecutor turned legal commentator. "You can't always get to the root of those opinions when people are answering in a group setting."

However, critics argue that individual questioning introduces greater opportunities for bias since lawyers can tailor their questions to specific people based on demographic background and other factors. "This is an open invitation for the attorneys to discriminate however they see fit," said Gregory Damon, a representative of the Washington Legal Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing free enterprise and individual rights. Damon argued that group questioning provides peer influence that yields more balanced views. 

The trial is being closely watched as the largest and most significant legal challenge to Big Tobacco in over 20 years. Simmons' case aims to build on the findings of earlier lawsuits, producing new revelations about corporate actions and setting an even larger punitive amount intended to deal a harsh blow to the tobacco industry. Jury selection is expected to last several weeks, with testimony from health experts, former industry executives and others beginning in October. In ruling for individual questioning today, Judge Chen has indicated she will allow extensive probing into jurors' opinions, which is likely to lengthen an already monumental trial.
