Cruise Ship Operators to Tailor Their Offerings for European and Asian Markets  

The major cruise ship operators are planning to tailor their offerings to better match the preferences of passengers in Europe and Asia. The traditional Caribbean and Bahamas itineraries that have been popular with North American cruisers for decades are not resonating as strongly with travelers from other parts of the world.

The cruise industry is booming globally, especially in fast-growing markets like China and other parts of Asia. But operators are finding that the types of cruise experiences in demand vary significantly based on cultural and regional interests. European and Asian travelers tend to prefer longer voyages that include stops at multiple ports of call where there are opportunities for shore excursions and immersive cultural experiences.  

The major U.S.-based cruise lines are adapting their itineraries and onboard offerings to cater to these tastes. Royal Caribbean, for example, offers cruises in Asia that sail from ports in China, Singapore, and Hong Kong and include stops in Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan. The activities, dining options, and entertainment on these cruises highlight the local culture and cuisine. Royal Caribbean has even retrained crews and staff on its Asia-based ships to make sure service and hospitality match regional preferences.   

In Europe, Norwegian Cruise Line has launched ships like the Norwegian Getaway and Norwegian Escape with itineraries that allow for in-depth exploration of the Baltic and Mediterranean. Onboard, the décor, art, and cuisine all reflect European styles and specialties. The longer sailings and more time in port have been well received by European travelers seeking a more immersive experience.  

Carnival Corporation, the world’s largest leisure travel and cruise company, is also diversifying its offerings to accommodate cultural tastes across different source markets. According to company executives, experiences on Carnival ships in Asia will be tailored to fit the interests of Asian guests. Things like décor, entertainment, amenities, dining, and service levels will all take cues from regional customer preferences. The programming and itineraries will also highlight destinations most attractive to Asian travelers. 

The major cruise lines see diversification across markets as key to their growth and prosperity. In 2018, almost 40 new ocean liners will take to the seas, and cruise lines want to make sure they are strategically deploying ships in areas of maximum demand and tweaking offerings for cultural relevance to travelers in those regions. With more first-time cruisers coming from Europe and Asia, the lines that are most adept at tapping into tastes from each local market will find the most success. Tailoring experiences to match passenger interests and expectations across the globe is proving to be the ticket to gaining and retaining lifelong cruise customers, no matter what region they call home.
