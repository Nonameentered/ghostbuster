New York State Approves $23 Billion Nynex and Bell Atlantic Merger, Despite Consumer Group Protests and Conditions 

The New York State Public Service Commission today approved the $23 billion merger between telephone companies Nynex Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp., clearing the way for the creation of one of the nation's largest telecommunications firms. However, the approval came with conditions to address concerns around loss of consumer choice and higher prices.

The merger, first announced in April 1997, will combine Nynex's network in the Northeast with Bell Atlantic's mid-Atlantic operations. The new company, to be called Bell Atlantic-Nynex, will serve 25 million phone lines and have annual revenues of $23 billion, trailing only AT&T and GTE among U.S. telephone carriers.

Supporters argue the merger will drive cost savings that will benefit both companies and consumers, while also positioning the new company to invest in new technologies like high-speed internet and wireless services. However, consumer groups have protested the deal, arguing it will reduce competition and lead to higher prices.

To address these concerns, the Public Service Commission approved the merger on the condition that Bell Atlantic-Nynex take steps to maintain affordable phone service, especially for low-income and elderly customers. The conditions also aim to prevent anti-competitive behavior by the new telecom giant. Specifically, the merged company must:

•Not raise basic residential phone rates for at least 2 years. Price increases after that must not exceed the rate of inflation.

•Continue offering discounted phone service for low-income households for at least 5 years.  

•Refrain from unfair competition against rival phone carriers and allow competitors access to its network.

•Maintain high quality of service and network reliability. Outages and service disruptions must not increase from today's levels.

Consumer advocates argue the conditions do not go far enough. "This merger will still mean fewer choices and higher prices for most phone customers in New York," said John Smith of the Consumer Federation of America. However, state regulators believe the requirements strike a balance between promoting competition and allowing the efficiencies of a merger. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending approval from regulators in other states.
