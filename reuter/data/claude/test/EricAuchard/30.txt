Shares of 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp Fall as Prospects for New Suitor Diminish

Shares of network equipment makers 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp fell sharply today as hopes for a buyout diminished. 3Com stock dropped 12% to $19.32, while U.S. Robotics shares declined 8% to $32.41.

The companies had been in talks over the past several weeks about a possible merger deal. However, sources close to the negotiations say those discussions have stalled and the prospect of an agreement appears unlikely. 

3Com and U.S. Robotics were exploring joining forces to better compete in the networking market dominated by Cisco Systems. A merger would provide scale and help cut costs as growth of network infrastructure sales slow. However, the companies could not agree on key deal terms like executive leadership roles, allocation of equity in the new entity, and licensing of technology patents.

"It's unfortunate the companies could not come together in a way that unlocked real synergy and value creation," said John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems. "Consolidation in the tech sector is inevitable and those players that fail to gain scale will struggle."

3Com pioneered Ethernet networking but has lost considerable ground to Cisco over the past decade. U.S. Robotics is best known for modems but has branched into other connectivity equipment and software. A combined 3Com and U.S. Robotics would have revenue of $7 billion and a market value of $22 billion, still a distant second to Cisco's $24 billion in revenue and $100 billion market capitalization.  

Analysts had warned a deal may be difficult to achieve given mismatches in corporate culture and product lines. However, without a merger, 3Com and U.S. Robotics must now plot their own course in an industry that increasingly favors size and scope. Their smaller size leaves them vulnerable as customers gravitate to "one-stop shops" like Cisco that can supply a full range of networking products.

Shares in 3Com and U.S. Robotics may take time to recover from today's disappointment. Investors had bid up the stocks in recent weeks hoping a buyout would deliver a premium. Absent an agreement, the companies must now work to revive growth and margins to appease shareholders on their own.
