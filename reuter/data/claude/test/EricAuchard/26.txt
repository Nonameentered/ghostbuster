3Com to Acquire Modem Giant U.S. Robotics in $6.6 Billion Deal to Challenge Cisco Systems Inc. 

3Com Corp. announced plans today to acquire modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. for $6.6 billion in stock, a move intended to boost 3Com's presence in the small-to-midsize business market and intensify its rivalry with Cisco Systems Inc.

The deal would give 3Com control of U.S. Robotics' popular line of modems, which enable personal computers to connect to the Internet via telephone lines. U.S. Robotics has been a market leader for years and currently has about 60% of the U.S. modem market. The company has a particularly strong presence among small and medium-size companies that 3Com is eager to tap.

By acquiring U.S. Robotics, 3Com would gain not only its product line and customer base but also its network of value-added resellers and distributors. 3Com could market U.S. Robotics modems along with its own networking equipment that links computers, printers and other devices. The partnership is intended to provide small businesses with a one-stop shop for their networking needs.

3Com has been under pressure to keep up with fast-growing rival Cisco Systems, the dominant player in the market for equipment that powers corporate computer networks and the Internet. Cisco's sales have more than doubled over the past two years, while 3Com's revenue growth has slowed. The U.S. Robotics acquisition is 3Com's biggest move yet to recharge its business. 

3Com has bid $76 a share for U.S. Robotics, a 15% premium over its closing stock price of $66 on Friday. The deal includes $6 billion in 3Com stock and the assumption of $600 million in U.S. Robotics debt. The agreement has been approved by both companies' boards of directors but still requires regulatory and shareholder approval. The sale is expected to close in three to six months.

Wall Street reacted favorably to the news, boosting shares of U.S. Robotics 30% to $86.25 on heavy volume. 3Com's stock gained 4% to $36.50. Analysts said the deal appears to make strategic sense, allowing 3Com to expand into new markets and gain technical expertise. But some cautioned that 3Com will have to work hard to integrate U.S. Robotics and leverage its product offerings.

The acquisition is the latest sign of consolidation in the technology industry, as companies seek to expand into new product lines and gain scale. Just last week, Lucent Technologies Inc. agreed to buy networking equipment maker Prominet Corp. for $1.5 billion. Other recent deals include Compaq Computer Corp.'s $4 billion purchase of Digital Equipment Corp. and WorldCom Inc.'s $37 billion takeover of MCI Communications Corp.
