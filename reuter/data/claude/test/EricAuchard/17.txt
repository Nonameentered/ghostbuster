Novell Outlines Five-Year Plan to Reduce Dependence on Mainstay Network Operating System Business

Novell Inc. announced a new strategic five-year plan to diversify its business and reduce its dependence on network operating systems, its historical mainstay product. The plan aims to accelerate growth through focus on emerging technologies such as cloud computing, collaboration, and security software.

Novell's network operating systems, including NetWare and Open Enterprise Server, accounted for $422 million of its $967 million total revenue in its last fiscal year. However, revenue from this segment has declined in recent years due to competition from free and low-cost networking technologies. Novell intends to shift focus to faster-growing segments to transform its business, targeting a compound annual growth rate of more than 10% over the next 5 years.

A key part of the new strategy is Novell's cloud computing solutions, which allow enterprise customers to run their own cloud computing environments. Novell's Cloud Manager, an enterprise-class solution for managing private and hybrid clouds, has seen early customer success and will be expanded with additional security and workload management features. Partnerships with public cloud providers will also allow Novell to offer hybrid public-private cloud solutions.

In the collaboration software space, Novell plans to aggressively develop and market its GroupWise collaboration suite, which includes solutions for document management, project management, and real-time communication. New features including enhanced mobility support, social networking integration, and SaaS delivery are planned for future GroupWise releases. A version of GroupWise for smaller businesses will also be launched to reach new customers.

For security, Novell will continue advancing its Sentinel and SecureLogin product lines, which provide identity and access management and security information and event management. To expand its security footprint, Novell announced plans to acquire a risk and compliance management company, though no details were provided about an acquisition target.  

Novell's new strategy is a bold move to overcome challenges in its legacy business by diversifying into high-growth software markets. However, the company faces strong competitors in areas like cloud computing, collaboration, and security software. The success of its strategic shift will depend on effective new product innovation and how well it can scale up and sell these new solutions to its existing customer base. Overall, Novell's new path forward could set the stage for a return to revenue and profit growth after years of stagnation, but not without overcoming some significant risks and obstacles, according to industry analysts.
