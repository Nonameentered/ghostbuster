Lucent Technologies Reports $66 Million Net Income in Q1 1997, Completing Successful First Year as Independent Company

Lucent Technologies, the former AT&T subsidiary spun off as an independent company last year, reported its first quarterly earnings as a publicly traded company today. Lucent posted net income of $66 million on revenues of $5.04 billion for the quarter ending December 31, 1996. 

The results cap a successful fiscal year for Lucent since it became independent from AT&T on September 30, 1996. Over the past year, Lucent’s stock price has risen sharply, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company’s ability to flourish on its own. Lucent’s shares rose 4 percent today after the earnings announcement.

“We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and over the past year,” said Chairman and CEO Rich McGinn. “Lucent has established itself as a leader in communications networking, software, and systems, and we are well positioned for continued growth in 1997 and beyond.”

In the first quarter, Lucent’s revenues grew 9 percent compared to the same quarter last year when it was still part of AT&T. Revenue growth was driven by expanding sales of data and wireless networking systems, as well as optical fiber products. Sales of data networking equipment grew 23 percent, wireless networking gear climbed 32 percent, and optical systems jumped 17 percent compared to a year ago. 

While revenue growth was solid, Lucent’s profits declined slightly from $73 million in the year-ago quarter. The dip in earnings was attributed to costs associated with becoming an independent company. Lucent spent $31 million on items related to the spin-off, including establishing its own accounting systems, recruiting executives, and building its own sales and marketing teams separate from AT&T. The company said those costs are now largely behind it.

Looking ahead, McGinn expressed optimism that Lucent is poised for strong and consistent earnings growth. “We have a robust pipeline of innovative new products, we are expanding into fast-growing markets, and our partnerships with service providers around the world are fueling opportunities globally,” McGinn said. “The trajectory is upward, and we look forward to steadily improving results over the course of 1997.”

The positive results and outlook is welcome news for investors who bet on Lucent after its spin-off. Lucent’s successful first year on its own looks to have justified the company’s confidence that it could thrive as an independent entity from AT&T. With a solid first quarter now behind it, Lucent seems ready to continue making good on that promise of growth and success.
