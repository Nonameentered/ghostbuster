NCR Corp. Unveils Do-It-Yourself Retail Checkout System to Revolutionize Supermarket Shopping  

NCR Corporation, a leading provider of retail software and tools, today announced the launch of a self-service checkout system aimed at transforming the grocery shopping experience. The new system, called NCR FastLane SelfServ Checkout, allows shoppers to scan, bag, and pay for their items without interacting with a cashier.  

The NCR FastLane system uses advanced computer vision technology to scan items as customers put them into their bags or carts. RFID tags on each product provide additional information to ensure all items are scanned properly. Customers then pay using a credit or debit card at the self-service kiosk, with the option to pay in cash as well. The entire transaction typically takes less than a minute.

“Retailers are looking for ways to reduce costs while also improving the customer experience,” said Mike Webster, Senior Vice President of NCR Retail. “Self-service options have become popular with shoppers who want to get in and out of stores quickly. The NCR FastLane SelfServ Checkout delivers on both of these key goals—lowering labor costs for retailers while speeding up the checkout process for customers.”  

NCR is piloting the FastLane system with several major supermarket chains and grocery retailers in North America, including Kroger, Albertsons, and Publix. The first public trials are scheduled to begin in October at select Kroger and Publix locations. NCR plans to roll out the FastLane system to more than 2,000 stores over the next year.

While some industry observers are concerned self-service technology may lead to job losses for cashiers, NCR claims the system will allow retailers to redeploy staff to assist customers in other areas of the store. Self-service options are also popular with younger shoppers who tend to favor speed and convenience. NCR is betting that the widespread adoption of their FastLane system could revolutionize the way we shop for groceries. Critics argue that human interaction and customer service are still an integral part of the overall shopping experience. NCR’s new system is likely to receive a mix of both positive and negative reactions from retailers and their customers.
