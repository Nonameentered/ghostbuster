Cisco Stock Falls Despite Strong Growth in Revenues and Earnings

Cisco Systems reported strong revenue and earnings growth for the quarter ended July 28, but the networking giant's stock fell in after-hours trading. Cisco earnings were up 33% to 71 cents a share excluding some items, topping Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate for 67 cents. Revenue rose 5.6% to $13.13 billion, beating the $12.73 billion expected by analysts. 

However, Cisco's stock dropped more than 4% in extended trading as investors appear concerned about signs of weakness in the company's core networking business. Revenue from switches — Cisco's biggest business — fell 3% from a year earlier. Worsening U.S.-China trade tensions may also be weighing on the stock, as China represents about 10% of Cisco's business.

"We delivered a strong quarter against a challenging macro environment," said CEO Chuck Robbins. "Our execution was solid, and we made great progress shifting the business to more software and subscriptions." Software revenue rose 10% from a year ago, while deferred revenue — an indicator of future sales — jumped 12%.

The results show Cisco is navigating headwinds like slowing economic growth and trade disputes better than some rivals. But the company still faces risks from rising geopolitical tensions and a protracted trade war with China. Cisco gets about 30% of its revenue from operations outside the U.S. and Canada.

Cisco has been pushing into cybersecurity software and services to reduce its reliance on networking equipment. It agreed last month to buy cybersecurity firm Duo Security Inc. for $2.35 billion. The acquisition, due to close in the current quarter, will boost Cisco's recurring revenue from subscriptions.

Analysts said the quarterly results were solid given the challenges and keep Cisco on track to return to sales growth in 2019 after two years of declines. But the drop in switching revenue is a concern and shows Cisco still has more work to do transforming into more of a software company.Investors are keen to see stronger growth in areas like security, wireless technology and subscriptions to provide more stable revenue streams.

"They're in a transition from hardware to software and subscription model, and that's a multi-year journey," said Shannon Cross of Cross Research. "As long as they can continue to show progress, the stock can work higher over time." But in the short term, shares may remain volatile amid broader trade and economic worries, she said.
