America Online Plans to Place Advertising in Company-Sponsored Chat Rooms, Expanding Revenue Streams Beyond Subscription Fees  

America Online, the largest online service provider, announced today that it will begin placing advertisements and sponsored listings within its popular chat rooms and messaging platforms. The move is an effort to generate new sources of revenue beyond the company's traditional subscription fees.

AOL operates thousands of chat rooms and online communities covering a wide range of topics and interests. The chat rooms have been a popular feature for many of AOL's over 20 million subscribers but have not previously contained any advertising. Under the new plan, AOL will sell text-based ads and sponsored placements to appear alongside chat rooms, especially those focused on highly commercial topics like travel destinations, automobiles, and technology products.

"We have an opportunity to match relevant ads with the interests of our members in their favorite AOL chat rooms and communities," said David Johnson, AOL's Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce. "Members will receive ads tailored to their specific interests, while we open up a new line of revenue to support and enhance our services."

AOL expects the in-chat advertising program to generate over $200 million in additional revenue over the next two years. However, some analysts warn the plan could backfire and upset loyal subscribers who have come to expect an ad-free experience in the chat rooms. "AOL risks damaging the goodwill it has built up over many years by inserting intrusive ads into such an intimate space," said Shelly Palmer, publisher of The Palmer Report on Internet business models. "Yes, they have a huge audience, but that audience has choices -- and they may choose to go elsewhere."  

In response to concerns, AOL said subscribers will have the option to disable the in-chat ads if they prefer an ad-free experience. The company also vowed that the ads would be clearly distinguished from regular chat messages and will comply with consumer privacy laws. AOL plans to test the new chat room ads over the next few months before deploying them broadly in the fall to both free and paid AOL members.

The planned in-chat advertising program is the latest in a series of initiatives by AOL to diversify beyond its traditional dial-up internet access and subscription packages. Last year, AOL acquired several digital media and advertising technology companies and has put more emphasis on its content brands like HuffPost, TechCrunch, and Engadget. Advertising now accounts for nearly half of AOL's total revenues as it looks to new sources of growth in the face of declining subscriptions.
