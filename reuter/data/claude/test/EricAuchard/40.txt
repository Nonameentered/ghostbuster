Bell Atlantic Corp. Reports Strong First Quarter Earnings Boosted by Telephone and Cellular Businesses  

Bell Atlantic Corp., one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, today reported a 28% increase in first quarter net income, boosted by growth in its core telephone business and its fast-growing cellular division.   

Net income for the three months ended March 31 rose to $583 million, or 95 cents a share, from $456 million, or 76 cents, a year earlier. Revenues increased 10% to $7.08 billion from $6.42 billion. 

The results handily beat Wall Street analysts' estimates, who had expected Bell Atlantic to earn 91 cents a share in the first quarter. The company's stock rose $2.50 a share to $52.25 in morning trading on the news.

"We had an outstanding quarter with double-digit growth in revenues, net income and earnings per share," said Bell Atlantic Chairman and CEO Raymond W. Smith. "Our core telephone operations continued to perform well, and our wireless business had another quarter of strong customer and revenue growth."

Local telephone revenues grew 5.4% to $3.64 billion as Bell Atlantic added 304,000 new access lines in the quarter, up from 259,000 a year ago. Average monthly billings for residential customers rose to $52.83 from $48.67.

Bell Atlantic's fast-growing cellular business saw revenues climb 37% to $830 million from $606 million. The company added 274,000 subscribers, ending the quarter with 5.6 million customers. Cellular penetration in Bell Atlantic's markets has reached nearly 25% of the population but still has room to grow, indicating strong future potential, the company said.

Revenues in Bell Atlantic's business services, including data, internet and web hosting services, grew 15% to $630 million. The company added 37,000 digital wireless data customers, reaching 482,000, and 149,000 dial-up internet customers, reaching 2.8 million.  

Bell Atlantic reaffirmed its outlook for low double-digit growth in revenues and earnings per share for the full year 2000. The company highlighted “substantial opportunities for continued growth and profitability in our core telecom businesses.”   

Bell Atlantic provides local telephone and wireless services in 13 states from New Jersey to Virginia and serves about 60 million business and residential customers.
