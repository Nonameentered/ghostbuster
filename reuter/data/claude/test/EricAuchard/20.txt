3Com and U.S. Robotics Merger Creates Data Networking Powerhouse Capable of Competing with Cisco in Internet Access Business  

In a move that will reshape the data networking equipment industry, 3Com Corp. announced Tuesday that it will acquire rival U.S. Robotics Corp. for $6.6 billion in stock. The combined company will be a formidable competitor to industry leader Cisco Systems Inc., especially in the fast-growing internet access segment. 

The merger brings together 3Com, a pioneer in computer networking technology and the leader in Ethernet connectivity used in corporate networks, with Skokie, Illinois-based U.S. Robotics, the top producer of modems used by consumers and businesses to connect to the internet via phone lines. Executives of the companies said the complementary nature of their businesses and the increasing overlap of corporate and home networking needs fueled the deal.

"This merger will give us the size, scale, and product reach to accelerate growth in the face of increasing competition," said Bruce Claflin, 3Com's president and chief executive. "By bringing together 3Com and U.S. Robotics, we are now well positioned with a complete end-to-end solution."

The combination is expected to generate cost efficiencies of $150 million in the first year by streamlining sales, marketing, and manufacturing operations. But the real motivation for the merger is to gain technical and marketing muscle that can challenge Cisco, which dominates the $50 billion market for switches, routers, and other equipment used to link personal computers and networks. 

3Com and U.S. Robotics are betting that the lines between the corporate office network and home office network will blur. They expect that technology managers will be looking for easy, plug-and-play networking equipment and software to accommodate telecommuters and the increasing use of laptops. The goal is to provide phone modems, Ethernet cards, and the networking equipment and software to allow seamless connectivity between local area networks and remote users dialing in from home offices or on the road.

However, some analysts are skeptical about 3Com's ability to seriously challenge Cisco even with the U.S. Robotics acquisition. Cisco controls three-quarters of the market for data networking equipment and continues to expand at a fast clip through acquisitions and new product introductions. 3Com currently holds about a 10 percent market share in the enterprise segment and the addition of U.S. Robotics would bump that up to around 15 percent. The merger is a clear endorsement that scale and comprehensive product lines are necessary to compete with Cisco going forward, but there are still questions as to whether 3Com and U.S. Robotics together are big enough and can innovate fast enough.

The deal still requires approval by shareholders and regulators, but executives said they expect it to be completed in the third quarter of this year. As a result of the acquisition, 3Com will have annual revenues of about $5 billion and a product line that spans from $50 modems to $50,000 network switches.
