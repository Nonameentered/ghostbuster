Computer Associates International Shares Fall 6% on Concerns of Secular Decline in Mainframe Revenues

Shares of Computer Associates International (CA), a provider of software tools for mainframe computers and enterprise systems, fell 6% in trading today amid concerns that revenue from its mainframe software business could face a long-term decline. CA attributed the fall in share price to comments made by technology analyst firm Gartner about the future of mainframe computers.

In a research note published today, Gartner analysts predicted a decline in global mainframe revenue and capacity over the next five years as corporations transition more of their IT operations to cloud-based systems and away from mainframe data centers. Mainframe revenue currently accounts for 46% of CA's total revenue, so a significant drop in mainframe sales could pose a risk to CA's business. “We see risks to CA's mainframe tools business as enterprise CIOs rebalance their IT budgets away from mainframes and toward cloud platforms,” noted Gartner analysts.

In response, CA emphasized its efforts to expand into growth areas like cloud services, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence software that are less dependent on mainframe sales. “While mainframes remain an important platform for our customers, especially for high-volume and mission-critical applications, CA's strategy has been focused on developing solutions to help companies optimize their technology investments across mainframe and distributed platforms, from mobile to cloud,” said CA Chief Product Officer Ayman Sayed.

Nonetheless, analysts expressed concerns about CA's ability to offset a decline in mainframe revenue, which still makes up the majority of the company's business. “CA has been trying to remake itself as an enterprise software vendor for years, but mainframes remain stubbornly central to its sales and strategy,” said James Staten, an analyst with Forrester Research. “If global mainframe capacity starts to decline in earnest, it may be difficult for CA to pivot fast enough to counter the effect on its top and bottom line.”

CA's shares were down $1.83 to $28.17 at market close. The company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on October 24, where revenue and guidance around its mainframe and enterprise businesses will be closely scrutinized. With mainframe software facing cyclical ups and downs, CA's strategy to lessen its dependence on mainframe revenue seems more critical to the long-term growth of the company. However, transitioning a company with over $4 billion in annual revenue will likely take time, and CA's success in evolving beyond its mainframe tools roots remains uncertain. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can overcome concerns about secular decline in its mainframe business.
