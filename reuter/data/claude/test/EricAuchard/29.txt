America Online to Place Advertising on Company-Sponsored Chat Rooms, Aims to Expand Revenue Base  

America Online, Inc. (AOL) announced today that it will begin placing advertising banners and promotions within some of the company-sponsored chat rooms on its service. The move represents AOL's first major step towards generating advertising revenue from its interactive chat features. 

AOL currently hosts hundreds of chat rooms on a wide range of topics, which are sponsored and moderated in part by AOL employees. These rooms have long been an attraction for many of AOL's 22 million subscribers, enabling them to connect and discuss shared interests in real time. However, AOL has not yet found a way to effectively monetize the chat room experience or translate the activity and traffic within the rooms into revenue.

"Our chat rooms provide a tremendous opportunity to match relevant marketing messages with people's interests and conversations," said AOL Marketing Director Sandra Thompson in a statement. "We believe we've found a balance that will allow us to offer targeted advertising to chat room users while maintaining the user experience."

AOL will begin a testing phase by placing static image advertising and promotions in a select number of its most popular chat rooms. The initial set of advertised brands and companies will include major technology, automotive, and consumer goods marketers that already advertise on AOL. However, no user data or chat room conversations will be shared with advertisers or used for targeting purposes during this test, according to Thompson. 

AOL plans to analyze how users interact with the advertising, the overall impact on the chat experience, and the revenue potential of chat room ads over the next few months before deciding whether to roll out advertising to other rooms. Competitors such as Yahoo currently do not allow any advertising within their chat rooms and messaging services. If successful, AOL's move could open up a significant new source of ad revenue and greater marketing opportunities for brands looking to reach AOL's captive chat room audiences. However, the strategy also risks annoying some users if the ads become too intrusive.

There were some initial negative reactions to the news on AOL member message boards, with several posters threatening to cancel their subscriptions if more ads appear in the chat rooms. "I pay $24.95 a month so I don't have to deal with these kinds of ads all over the place," wrote one longtime user. AOL has not currently announced any plans to lower or credit subscription fees in light of the new advertising initiative. Overall, the coming months will reveal whether AOL's chat room members are willing to accept some advertising in exchange for continued access to the service.
