MCI seeks to impose sanctions on Nynex for failing to sign agreement allowing entry in New York market

MCI Communications Corp. said today it will ask regulators to impose sanctions on Nynex Corp. for failing to sign an agreement allowing MCI to enter the New York telecommunications market.

MCI had hoped to sign a so-called "interconnection agreement" with Nynex by today to comply with a New York Public Service Commission order last month granting MCI the right to operate in New York. But Nynex, one of the Bell operating companies created in the breakup of AT&T, has so far refused to sign an agreement, MCI said.

Without an interconnection agreement, MCI cannot begin offering phone services to businesses and consumers in New York. MCI said Nynex's "refusal to negotiate in good faith and execute an interconnection agreement is an unlawful restraint of trade and harmful to competition."

In a petition filed with state regulators, MCI asked the commission to impose penalties and sanctions to force Nynex to comply with last month's order and sign an interconnection pact "without further delay." MCI wants regulators to set a deadline for completing an agreement and to limit Nynex's profit margins and other measures if it fails to comply.

Nynex denied the allegations, saying it has negotiated with MCI "in good faith" but the two sides remain apart on certain issues. "There are a number of very complex technical, operational and economic issues associated with achieving interconnection, and they are not resolved overnight," Nynex said.

The war of words is the latest skirmish in the battle over opening local phone markets to competition. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the regional Bell companies to open their local networks to rivals, but the rollout has been slow as companies wrangle over the details of interconnection agreements. MCI and other long-distance carriers want a quick, inexpensive way to offer local and long-distance service in a single package to business and residential customers. But the Bells have been reluctant to give up their local monopolies and see new entrants as a competitive threat.
