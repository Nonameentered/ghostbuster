MCI Shareholders Expected to Overwhelmingly Approve Merger with British Telecom at Annual Meeting  

MCI Communications Corp. shareholders are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the company's proposed $21 billion merger with British Telecommunications PLC at MCI's annual shareholder meeting today in Washington, DC. The merger, announced in November, would create one of the world's largest telecommunications companies with a market value of more than $100 billion.

MCI and BT have positioned the merger as a way to gain scale and cost efficiencies that will allow them to compete more effectively, especially as the telecom industry consolidates globally. The companies expect to achieve $2 billion in annual cost savings within three years of the merger by eliminating duplicate functions and integrating operations. The savings are key to overcoming any revenue shortfalls from increased competition.

The merger has received widespread support from shareholders and industry analysts. MCI's stock price has risen more than 30% since the merger was announced late last year. Analysts point out that the companies have little overlap geographically or in product offerings, so the merger poses few regulatory hurdles and will not reduce competition. MCI shareholders will receive 1.083 shares of the combined company for each MCI share they own. BT shareholders will own 54% of the merged entity.

However, the merger is not without risks, especially around integration of the two companies. Differing corporate cultures and management styles could slow the realization of projected cost savings and efficiencies. The increased debt required to finance the merger could also pose a risk if revenue growth slows substantially due to competition. Leadership of the combined company is still being determined, adding another layer of uncertainty.

Nonetheless, with the potential benefits far outweighing the risks in the view of most shareholders and analysts, approval of the merger at today's MCI shareholder meeting is considered a near certainty. The merger is expected to close by the end of the year, pending final regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe, where BT has significant operations. The deal marks one of the largest trans-Atlantic mergers ever between two telecommunications companies and promises to have major implications for the industry's competitive landscape. Shareholders are poised today to give it an emphatic stamp of approval.
