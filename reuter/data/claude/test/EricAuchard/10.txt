IBM Announces 2-for-1 Stock Split to Halt Decline in Stock Price, Fuels Wall Street Rally 

Tech giant IBM announced a 2-for-1 stock split after the closing bell on Thursday in an effort to make its shares more affordable to individual investors and halt the recent decline in its stock price. IBM shares rose over 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

IBM's stock price has dropped over 25% over the past year as the company has struggled to keep up with trends toward cloud computing and AI. The stock split is IBM's first since 1999 and will make its shares more accessible to retail investors hoping to get in on a potential rebound.

"We believe the stock split will make our shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and increase liquidity," said James Kavanaugh, IBM's chief financial officer. "At the same time, it highlights our confidence in IBM's long-term performance and commitment to returning value to shareholders."

After the 2-for-1 split, IBM shareholders will receive an additional share of stock for each share they own, with fractional shares paid in cash. The split will double the number of IBM shares outstanding but will not change the company's overall market capitalization or financial objectives. The split is subject to shareholder approval at IBM's annual meeting on April 28. If approved, IBM shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on May 6.

The stock split announcement fueled a rally on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closing up over 1% on Thursday. Tech stocks, in particular, saw strong gains following the IBM news, suggesting investors see it as a sign of confidence in the sector. Shares of Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco were all up over 2% in after-hours trading.

Some analysts, however, remain skeptical about IBM's longer-term prospects, even with a more affordable stock price. "While a stock split may generate short-term interest, IBM still faces real challenges around growth that won't be solved by a lower share price alone," said Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. "They need to show real traction in their strategic imperatives around cloud, AI, and blockchain to turn sentiment around for the long haul."

IBM is scheduled to report its first quarter earnings on April 20, which will provide an important look at how its new business focuses are performing. Investors will be watching closely to see if IBM can back up its confidence in the stock split with better than expected results. The company will need to show that its evolution to higher-growth sectors is producing real revenue and profits to prove the doubters wrong.
