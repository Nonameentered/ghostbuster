AT&T Corp. Q1 profits fall 17% due to competition and new investments, warns of potential weak Q2 results. Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp. reports strong growth in customer lines and wireless operations with an 11% rise in operating earnings.

AT&T Corp. reported weaker than expected first quarter earnings today as competition from cable companies and required investments in technology upgrades led to a 17% decline in net income for the quarter. The nation's largest telecommunications company earned $1.79 billion, or 52 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, down from $2.16 billion, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Revenues rose 2.9% to $13.1 billion, but AT&T spent heavily on marketing new local and wireless phone services and upgrading networks. The company also cut fees it charges to other phone companies for connecting calls in certain areas. AT&T warned that second quarter results may fall short of expectations as well due to continuing investment costs and price competition. The stock dropped over 4% in afternoon trading on the news.

In contrast, BellSouth Corp. reported an 11% rise in first quarter operating earnings, buoyed by continuing strong growth in wireless operations and the addition of 266,000 retail phone lines. BellSouth earned $851 million, or 46 cents a share, up from $768 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6.2% to $8.10 billion. BellSouth added 359,000 cellular subscribers in the first quarter and average revenue per wireless user rose over 4% as customers upgraded to more advanced phone plans. 

BellSouth executives were optimistic about future growth and maintaining momentum, though the company faces the same competitive factors as AT&T from cable and wireless companies. BellSouth stock rose 3% on the quarterly report, recovering some of the losses suffered earlier in the week.

The contrasting results and outlooks from the two telecom industry leaders highlighted the pressures of a rapidly changing marketplace. While demand remains strong for telecom services, companies are scrambling to keep up with new technologies and competitors. AT&T and BellSouth executives vowed to accelerate investments in key growth areas like high-speed Internet access and wireless data transmission to retain and gain customers in the coming years. But shareholders are clearly nervous about the short term effects on the bottom line and stock prices remain depressed from highs reached during the 1990s telecom boom.
