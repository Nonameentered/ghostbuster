WavePhore Unveils WaveTop: Wireless TV Signals to Broadcast Programming to PCs  

WavePhore, an innovative wireless technology startup, announced the launch of WaveTop, a new service that will broadcast television signals to personal computers with no physical connection needed. WaveTop uses proprietary wireless technology to stream live TV channels to PCs from local TV broadcast stations in major cities across the country. 

 "WaveTop eliminates the need for a TV tuner card or set-top box to tune in TV content on your computer," said Dave Chen, CEO of WavePhore. "Using our wireless network, viewers can enjoy live local TV on laptops, desktops and tablets with just an internet connection and the WaveTop app."

The WaveTop service offers both standard definition and high definition programming options, with over 50 channels available at launch. The service is initially available in 10 markets: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta, Houston and Seattle. WavePhore plans to expand to 25 cities within the first year of service.

Viewers can download the free WaveTop app to access content on computers running Windows, MacOS and Chrome OS, as well iOS and Android tablets. No additional hardware like an antenna or TV tuner is required. The WaveTop app provides an on-screen channel guide, DVR controls and the ability to watch previously aired content on-demand.  

"We're harnessing the power of live local broadcasting and seamlessly merging it with on-demand internet delivery," said Chen. "Viewers want options, so we're providing the best of both worlds: the live channel experience for news, sports and events along with a programming library for binge-watching shows whenever you want."

WavePhore has licensing agreements in place with major broadcast networks including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox to retransmit their owned-and-operated stations in each city. The company is still negotiating carriage deals with other local stations and programmers to expand its channel lineup.
