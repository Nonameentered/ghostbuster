America Online to Launch National Internet Service in Japan, Aiming to Make it Their Biggest International Market

America Online Inc. announced today that it will launch a full Internet service in Japan, marking AOL's biggest international expansion to date. The new service, called AOL Japan, will provide localized content and services aimed at Japanese consumers and businesses beginning early next year.

AOL has partnered with several major Japanese companies to launch and market the service, including SoftBank Corp., Sony Corp., and Cable and Wireless plc's Cable & Wireless IDC. These partnerships will give AOL immediate brand visibility and access to SoftBank's extensive telecommunications infrastructure and Sony's consumer electronics distribution channels. AOL Japan will be bundled with new Compaq computers sold in Japan and will also have a presence on Japanese web portals.

"Japan represents an enormous opportunity for AOL to expand internationally," said Barry Schuler, president of AOL International. "It is the second largest Internet market in the world, with a technologically-sophisticated population and major growth potential." According to International Data Corp., Japan will have over 38 million Internet users by 2003, with double-digit annual growth rates continuing over the next several years. 

AOL Japan will provide localized content and services aimed at the Japanese market, including a Japanese-language interface, search engine, and shopping areas. AOL Japan will have access to Sony's music, movies, and game content to provide an engaging interactive experience for Japanese consumers. The new service will also allow business users to tap into AOL's expertise in business tools, e-commerce functionality and high-speed connectivity options.

"We realize that we need to understand the unique characteristics of the Japanese market," said Schuler. "Our goal is to develop services and content that match the interests and lifestyles of mainstream Japanese consumers and businesses." AOL Japan hopes to gain one million subscribers within the first two years of operation. If successful, that would make Japan AOL's largest market outside the United States.

AOL's expansion into Japan is part of the company's broader international growth strategy. AOL currently offers localized content and services in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Canada. The company aims to roll out additional services in key markets, including China, over the coming year. By tapping into new members and markets overseas, AOL hopes to spur future growth as the U.S. Internet industry becomes more mature.

The launch of AOL Japan will mark the biggest test yet of AOL's ability to thrive internationally. If AOL can gain a strong subscriber base by providing localized services that resonate in the Japanese market, it may signal that the company has found a formula for success abroad. But if AOL Japan struggles, the company may have to rethink its ambitious international expansion plans. Either way, AOL's performance in Japan is sure to be closely watched as a barometer of its prospects outside of the United States.
