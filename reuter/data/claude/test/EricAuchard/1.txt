VLSI Technology Inc. Stock Takes a 25% Dive After Projecting Decline in Revenues 

Shares of VLSI Technology Inc. plunged 25% in early trading today after the semiconductor equipment maker said it expects revenues and earnings to decline in the current quarter. The announcement rattled investors and analysts who have become accustomed to steady growth from the Silicon Valley company.

In its quarterly earnings report released after the market closed yesterday, VLSI projected revenues of between $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion for the third quarter, which would mark a decline of 5% from a year earlier at the midpoint of the range. The company attributed the slowdown to "temporarily reduced demand" from three major customers and excess inventory levels. VLSI also forecast earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per share, below Wall Street's expectation of $1.15 per share.

"We are disappointed to provide guidance below our normal targets," said CEO Jane Cooper in the earnings statement.  "We view this as a short-term disruption and not an indication of a longer-term downturn." However, analysts were skeptical the company would rebound quickly. "Demand seems to be slowing across the board for chip equipment makers," said Morris Chang, a senior analyst atJP Stanley. "VLSI has long relied on a small number of key customers so when one of them sneezes, the company catches a cold. This may be more than a temporary blip."

The bleak forecast and analyst reaction put significant pressure on VLSI's stock price today. Shares fell $15.20, or 25%, to $45.80 in midday trading. The decline wiped out more than $3 billion in market capitalization and dragged down other stocks in the semiconductor sector as well. At its current level, VLSI's stock price is at its lowest point in 18 months. The company's shares have now declined 30% from their 52-week high in March amid a broader downturn in technology stocks. 

Founded in 1980, VLSI Technology is a pioneering semiconductor equipment supplier with over 3,000 employees. The company has posted consistent profits and revenue growth over the past decade as demand for its etching and processing tools rose in line with increasing chip production worldwide. However, VLSI's heavy reliance on a few large manufacturers appears to be backfiring as the industry encounters a slowdown, at least for now. Investors will look for signs of improving demand when management holds a call with analysts tonight to discuss the quarterly results and outlook in more detail.
