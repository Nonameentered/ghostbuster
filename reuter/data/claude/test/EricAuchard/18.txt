New Device Turns Personal Computer into an ATM for Dispensing Electronic Cash 

A new USB device is allowing anyone with a personal computer to dispense electronic cash and make small transactions. The startup company CashNow developed a thumb-drive-sized gadget that plugs into a computer's USB port and allows users to withdraw and deposit digital cash anonymously outside of the traditional banking system.

The CashNow device, about the size of an average person's thumb, enables individuals to convert dollars from their bank account into electronic cash with the click of a few buttons. Once converted, the digital cash is stored on the user's device and can be dispensed from the connected computer to make anonymous peer-to-peer payments and transactions. The electronic funds can be used to pay friends, donate to charities, or purchase goods and services from merchants who accept this new form of payment.

 "We wanted to give people a way to move money around electronically without going through the banks," said Jane Smith, co-founder of CashNow. "This device eliminates the friction and fees typically associated with electronic payments and allows people more freedom with how they choose to spend and share their money."

To get started with CashNow, users deposit funds from their bank account into an online CashNow account. For a small fee, currently 1.5 percent, CashNow then converts the dollar amount into electronic cash stored on the USB device. The digital cash can be dispensed in various denominationsâ€”from as little as $1 up to $500. Each time a user makes a payment or transaction, the amount is deducted from their device's total balance. When the balance reaches zero, the user can easily recharge their device with another deposit from their bank account. 

CashNow encrypts each user's account and device to ensure security and says no personal information is shared when making anonymous transactions. The company earns revenue through the 1.5 percent conversion fee on all deposits. CashNow has raised over $500,000 in seed funding to support the development and launch of their electronic cash devices, which became available for pre-order on their website today. The company expects to start shipping the first CashNow devices to users next month.
