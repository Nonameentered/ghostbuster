NCR CFO Addresses Tax Issues and Profit Goals in Conference Call with Analysts 

NCR Corporation's Chief Financial Officer Michael D. Hayford fielded questions from analysts today on the company's fiscal third-quarter conference call. During the call, Hayford addressed issues related to recent U.S. Tax Reform, as well as the company's profit goals.

To start, Hayford told analysts the company does not expect to incur any significant charges resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recently passed by Congress. The new tax law will lower the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which NCR believes will have a positive impact on profits going forward. "We anticipate the lower corporate tax rate will reduce our ongoing effective tax rate and provide additional cash flow benefits starting in 2018," Hayford said. 

Despite the more favorable tax environment, Hayford stood by NCR's previous full-year earnings guidance for 2017. The company still expects revenue growth of 3% to 4% and free cash flow of $275 million to $325 million for fiscal 2017. "We will provide updated guidance on our Q4 conference call that will reflect any impacts from tax reform and our 2018 business outlook," Hayford noted.

Looking ahead, Hayford reiterated NCR's target of 8% to 10% growth in free cash flow over the next 3 to 5 years. This outlook is based on low- to mid-single digit growth in its hardware revenue and high-single digit growth in software and services. NCR's transformation into a software and services-led company is aimed at driving higher-margin recurring revenue streams over the long run.

Hayford acknowledged NCR still has "more work to do" to achieve its profit goals, but he believes the company is making progress. "We have taken actions to simplify our business, reduce costs, and reinvest in key growth initiatives, all of which helped drive improved bottom-line results this quarter," he said. NCR reported Q3 revenue of $1.7 billion, up 1% from a year ago, while earnings jumped 13% to $0.62 per share.

In response to an analyst's question, Hayford said NCR will look to deploy excess cash from tax reform and operations to fund internal investments, acquisitions that boost its software portfolio, dividends, and share repurchases. NCR's stock was up 3% in mid-day trading following the conference call.
