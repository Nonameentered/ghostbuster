New York State regulators set to approve Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger with conditions

New York State regulators are poised to approve the merger between Bell Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp., clearing the way for the nation's second-largest telecommunications company. However, the Public Service Commission is expected to impose several conditions on the deal to ensure that consumers benefit. 

The commission's vote on Thursday will be the final regulatory hurdle for the $23 billion merger, which has already been approved by federal regulators and the companiesâ€™ shareholders. The marriage of Bell Atlantic, the dominant phone company in the Mid-Atlantic, and NYNEX, which provides local phone service to New York and much of New England, will create a telecom giant second only to AT&T Corp. in size.

While regulators aim to spur competition in the telecom industry, consumer advocates have raised concerns that the merger could negatively impact customers, especially in areas still dominated by the local "Baby Bells." The conditions imposed by the PSC seek to address issues such as guaranteeing rate stability, network quality, and consumer choice.

Specifically, the PSC will require the combined Bell Atlantic/NYNEX company to freeze basic residential phone rates for two years after the merger closes. The commission is also expected to demand that the company meet minimum standards for basic phone service, including limits on the number of service interruptions and response times for repairs. In addition, Bell Atlantic would be required to continue offering certain phone plans with basic features to ensure low-income and older customers have affordable options.

Consumer advocates say these conditions provide important safeguards but do not go far enough. "While phone companies merge to become media conglomerates, consumers are at risk of being left behind," said Trish Vincent of the New York Public Interest Research Group. She argues the PSC should have mandated rate decreases for customers, not just freezes, and more low-cost alternatives, especially in light of the new company's massive size and reach.
