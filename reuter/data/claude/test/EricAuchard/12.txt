Xylan Corp drops 27% as earnings fall short, with warning of delayed rebound until fall 

Shares of Xylan Corp plunged 27% on Tuesday after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings and warned investors that a rebound in demand may be delayed until the fall.

Xylan said revenue in the second quarter declined 12% from a year earlier to $1.2 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $1.4 billion. Net income dropped 23% to $210 million, or $1.30 a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.55 a share.

The weak results reflected a steep decline in orders from hotels, restaurants, and other clients that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Xylan is a leading supplier of industrial equipment and parts used in ventilation, air purification, and temperature control systems.

"The economic lockdowns and social distancing measures enacted in response to COVID-19 have significantly disrupted many of the industries we serve," said Xylan CEO Megan Smith. "While we expect conditions to gradually improve over the coming months, the recovery of some sectors may be delayed until the fall."

Smith warned that revenue and earnings are likely to remain under pressure in the current quarter as well. Xylan withdrew its guidance for full-year 2020 results, citing ongoing uncertainty.

The shares fell $24.50 to $66.25 in afternoon trading Tuesday, putting them on track for the biggest one-day percentage drop since the early 1990s. Before Tuesday's decline, Xylan's stock price had fallen about 13% this year, compared with a 2% gain in the S&P 500 index.

Some analysts said the weak quarterly results weren't surprising given the broader economic turmoil but that Xylan's murky outlook adds to concerns about the timing and strength of a recovery. 

"Xylan has exposure to some of the hardest-hit areas of the economy, so a steep downturn in revenue and earnings this quarter was expected," said Jenny Li of Baird Equity Research. "However, management's warnings about demand remaining weak into the fall raise questions about the pace of the reopening and macro recovery."

In response to the weak results and outlook, Baird and RBC Capital Markets lowered their ratings on Xylan to "neutral" from "outperform." But others see opportunity for patient investors, arguing Xylan will eventually benefit from economic improvement. Citigroup reiterated a "buy" rating, noting the company's "strong competitive position and balance sheet."
