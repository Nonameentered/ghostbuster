U S West Communications Group reports better-than-expected earnings in Q1  

U S West Communications Group, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the Western United States, reported earnings for the first quarter of the year today that beat analysts' expectations. The company earned $0.43 per share in the quarter, up 3% from the same period last year and higher than the $0.41 per share expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.

Revenue rose 2% to $5.1 billion, also topping estimates of $5 billion. The strong results were driven by continued customer growth in the company's wireless business as well as higher demand for data services across its residential and business segments. U S West added 43,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter, up from 30,000 additions in the same quarter last year. The company also saw a 7% increase in residential broadband subscribers and a 13% rise in Ethernet circuits for business customers.

"We had an excellent start to the year with solid operational and financial results across our entire business," said CEO Brian Simpson on a call with analysts. "Our consistent investments in network infrastructure and innovation are enabling us to attract and retain wireless, broadband and business customers with premium services that are reshaping how people live, work and learn."

The results indicate U S West continues to benefit from favorable industry trends, even as competition intensifies from cable companies on the broadband side and rival wireless carriers. The company reaffirmed its forecast for earnings growth, revenue gains, and customer additions for the full year, signaling its continued momentum. Investors reacted positively to the report, sending U S West shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

The quarterly results continue a string of successes for U S West as Simpson executes on a strategy focused on wireless services, high-speed internet, and business connectivity. While risks remain in the form of potential interest rate hikes and an uneven economy, U S West appears poised to continue its steady growth for the rest of the year and beyond. Overall, it was a solid quarter that validated the company's strategic direction.
