Lucent Technologies Expects Substantial Profit Gains and Revenue Growth in Consumer Products Unit in 1997   

Lucent Technologies Inc. announced today that it expects substantial profit gains and revenue growth in its consumer products division in 1997. The company reported that profits in the unit that makes telephones, audio equipment, and computer accessories for home use should rise by at least 25% from 1996 levels. Revenues are projected to increase by 15-20% over the same period. 

The rosy outlook comes as Lucent prepares to spin off its consumer products division into an independent, publicly traded company. The move, announced last month, is aimed at allowing each company to focus on its core businesses. Lucent will concentrate on telecommunications equipment for business and network operators, while the consumer products unit will focus on residential customers.

“The consumer products division has tremendous potential for growth, but our business models and key customer bases are quite different,” said Lucent CEO Richard McGinn. “As independent companies, each business will be better positioned to pursue its own strategic priorities and opportunities for growth.”

The strong performance expected this year reflects the success of several new product releases, including advanced cordless telephones, wireless headphones, and ergonomic computer mice and keyboards. Sales of digital satellite systems and personal communications devices are also contributing to growth.  

Revenues from sales outside the U.S. are projected to make up over 35% of the total this year, up from 32% in 1996. International markets, especially in Latin America and Asia, represent a major opportunity, the company said.  

The rosy projections contrast with lackluster performance in recent years. From 1994 to 1996, revenue growth averaged just 5% annually as the company struggled with a weak product lineup and soft demand. Profits declined in 1995 amid pricing pressures and high research and marketing costs.

To revive growth, Lucent revamped the management team, slashed costs, and accelerated new product introductions. Under the leadership of William H. Weisz, who took over as division head in late 1995, the unit released over 40 new products last year and cut operating expenses by 12%.

Analysts hailed the turnaround and expressed optimism about the prospects for an independent consumer products company. “These updates suggest potentially attractive growth and relative financial stability ahead of the planned spin-off,” said Joyce Snyder of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. However, she warned that competitive pressures could intensify as rivals try to make inroads in Lucent’s core residential telephone business. 

Lucent's shares rose $2.63 to $104.50 in heavy trading following the announcement. The consumer products division represents about 15% of Lucent's total revenue and operating profit. The spin-off is expected to be complete by October 1.
