AT&T Withdraws License Application for Next-Gen Communications Satellites  

AT&T announced today that it is withdrawing its application with the FCC for licenses to deploy and operate a network of next-generation satellites for broadband internet connectivity. The proposed network, called Project AirGig, aimed to provide ultra-fast internet service to unserved and underserved parts of the U.S.  and internationally using a network of low-Earth orbit satellites. 

In a statement, AT&T said "After further review, we have decided to withdraw our FCC license applications for Project AirGig. We will instead focus our efforts on technologies and solutions that can be deployed more quickly to serve more people with fiber and fixed wireless broadband connections." The company did not give any specific reasons for withdrawing the satellite project but said its resources would be better spent on proven technologies it already has in market.

The AirGig project was announced with much fanfare in 2016 as a novel way to provide cost-effective broadband internet to remote locations by using millimeter wave wireless signals delivered via small cube satellites in low-Earth orbit. The company had conducted trials of the technology and applied for experimental licenses from the FCC in 2017 to conduct wider tests. However, the project had faced delays and skepticism about its technical and financial viability. Satellite-based broadband remains a challenging and capital-intensive endeavor.

Industry analysts said AT&T's decision was unsurprising given the significant technical hurdles still to be overcome with satellite connectivity and the availability of other options to achieve broadband access through wireless and fixed wireless technologies. "While innovative, Project AirGig was likely many years away and highly risky," said Timothy Horan of Oppenheimer & Co. "AT&T has better options to gain broadband connectivity in the next few years.” 

The withdrawal of Project AirGig is a setback in the quest for technologies to solve the digital divide and provide universal broadband access. However, with continued progress in terrestrial wireless and investments in fiber, widespread rural broadband may still be within reach. AT&T said it remains committed to “expanding connectivity and bridging the digital divide” using its other network platforms.
