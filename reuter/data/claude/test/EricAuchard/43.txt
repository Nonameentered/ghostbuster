AT&T Profits Fall 17% in Q1, Warns of Weak Q2 Results; BellSouth Shows Strong Q1 Growth  

AT&T Inc. saw its first-quarter net income decline 17% from a year earlier due to a drop in business customer spending and costs related to growth initiatives. The company also warned that second-quarter results are tracking below its expectations.

The telecom giant reported net income of $3.47 billion, or $0.56 a share, down from $4.17 billion, or $0.66 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $32.6 billion. Excluding items, per-share earnings were 61 cents. Analysts had expected earnings of 61 cents a share on revenue of $32.8 billion.

AT&T said business customers, especially large corporations, curtailed spending in the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns. It also incurred higher costs related to new customer growth initiatives like its fiber broadband buildout and promotions to attract wireless subscribers. The company added 61,000 postpaid phone subscribers, missing analysts’ estimates of 108,000.

“Business momentum slowed in the first quarter due to macroeconomic pressures and some temporary impacts from recent growth investments, but we remain confident in our strategy and expect to pick up the pace over the balance of the year,” said Chief Executive John Stankey.

AT&T shares fell 3.7% to $29.75 in after-hours trading. The stock is down 16% so far this year.

For the second quarter, AT&T said it expects earnings in the range of $0.73 to $0.77 a share on revenue growth of 2%. Analysts had forecast per-share earnings of $0.80 on revenue growth of 3.4%. Mr. Stankey said the quarter has been weaker than anticipated but the company still expects to meet its target of stabilizing 2022 earnings.

In contrast, BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based telecommunications company that AT&T is acquiring, posted strong first-quarter results, fueled by growth in its wireless and broadband Internet services. BellSouth said net income rose 12% to $814 million, or 44 cents a share, from $730 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier. Revenue grew 6.3% to $5.3 billion.

BellSouth added 358,000 net new wireless customers in the first quarter, its best quarterly performance in three years. It ended the period with just under 54 million total wireless subscribers. The company also saw continued strong demand for its high-speed Internet service, adding 249,000 new broadband connections.

The quarterly results highlight the strong regional performance of BellSouth in the southeastern U.S. relative to the larger pressures faced by AT&T nationally. The $67 billion takeover of BellSouth by AT&T is expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approval. The deal will make AT&T the dominant phone company across much of the country.
