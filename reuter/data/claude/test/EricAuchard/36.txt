Cisco to Acquire Telesend Inc. to Boost High-Speed Internet Access Technology  

Cisco Systems announced today that it has agreed to acquire Telesend Inc., a privately held company based in San Jose, for $4.5 billion in cash and stock. Telesend is a leader in fixed wireless access technology that provides high-speed internet connectivity in rural and suburban areas.  

The deal represents Cisco's largest acquisition since its $6.8 billion purchase of Acacia Communications in 2019. The purchase will help Cisco expand its reach into wireless access networks and boost its technology for providing broadband internet connectivity in underserved communities with limited connectivity options.

According to Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, "Telesend has developed groundbreaking fixed wireless access technology that complements our existing portfolio and will allow us to extend broadband connectivity to new areas around the globe. Combining Telesend's wireless expertise with Cisco's networking and cloud technologies will enable new innovations to accelerate digital inclusion for communities worldwide."

 Telesend's fixed wireless access technology uses millimeter wave spectrum to deliver gigabit per second internet speeds over distances of several miles. The company has deployed over 50 networks across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, providing broadband access to more than 15 million people in rural and suburban areas.  

"Cisco is the ideal partner to help us scale our innovative wireless access solutions on a global basis," said Telesend CEO Magnus Bergman. "By combining forces, we will be able to connect many more unserved and underserved communities with transformational high-speed internet access."

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of Cisco's 2020 fiscal year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon closing, Bergman and about 500 Telesend employees will join Cisco's Service Provider Networking Group.
