Shareholders Expected to Overwhelmingly Approve Merger of MCI and British Telecom, Creating Multi-Billion Dollar Giant in Communications Industry

The shareholders of MCI Communications and British Telecommunications are expected to approve the proposed merger between the two telecommunications giants at meetings later this week. If approved, the $52 billion merger would create one of the largest telecom companies in the world, providing local and long-distance phone service, Internet, data and wireless communications to customers in 65 countries.  

MCI, the second largest long-distance carrier in the United States, and British Telecom, the dominant telecom firm in the United Kingdom, announced plans to merge last October. The deal has already received regulatory approval from antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Europe after a lengthy review process. Shareholder approval is the final step to complete the merger.

The new company, which would be called MCI BT, will have more than 65 million customers worldwide and annual revenues of over $40 billion. The companies tout the merger as an opportunity to accelerate growth by expanding into new global markets and bundling services for business and residential customers. However, critics argue that the new telecom colossus could lead to fewer choices and higher prices for consumers.  

If approved, the merger is expected to lead to job losses as the companies consolidate operations. MCI BT plans to cut its workforce by 15,000 employees, or about 6 percent of the combined staff, to save $2 billion per year. The cuts and other savings from combining infrastructure are key to achieving the financial benefits projected from the deal.

MCI shareholders will vote on Tuesday, while British Telecom investors will vote on Friday. Analysts say approval by wide margins is likely given the significant premium offered in the acquisition and the potential benefits of scale and global reach as the telecom industry consolidates. The merger of MCI and British Telecom would be the second largest transatlantic business combination in history and promises to reshape the international telecommunications landscape. After this weekâ€™s votes, the companies can finalize the merger and begin operating as a combined entity.
