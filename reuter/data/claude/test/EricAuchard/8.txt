Xerox Reports Higher Fourth-Quarter Profits Boosted by Digital Product Sales and Talegen Deal

Xerox Corp posted a higher fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates, helped by strong sales of digital color copiers and printers as well as newly acquired software services.

The printer and copier maker earned $1.52 billion, or $1.95 per share, in the quarter, up from $192 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Xerox earned $1.67 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.61, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue rose 4.1% to $2.53 billion, beating the analysts' average estimate of $2.49 billion. Sales were boosted by last year's acquisition of Talegen Holdings, a health insurance third-party administrator that contributed $182 million in revenue.

Revenue from Xerox's printing systems, which includes sales and rentals of copiers and printers, rose 4.3% to $1.42 billion in the quarter. The company said sales of color devices grew 15% from a year ago, driven in part by demand for high-end color products that can print on extra-large sheets of paper. Black-and-white printer and copier sales were flat.

Services revenue, which includes services for copiers and printers as well as Talegen, rose 3.9% to $1.11 billion. Excluding the impact of Talegen, services revenue was up 1.2%. Margins for the services business contracted 1 percentage point to 13.3%.

The results point to the success of Xerox's efforts to pivot to digital services and inkjet printing as it seeks new sources of revenue to offset declining demand for paper documents. The company has launched new high-speed color printers that produce marketing materials and books on demand in a bid to grab a share of the digital print market.

Xerox reiterated its full-year 2023 earnings guidance and said it expects adjusted earnings of at least $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Analysts on average expect $3.18.

The company reported a full-year profit of $7.17 billion or $9.35 per share, compared with $539 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue in 2021 fell 0.8% to $9.23 billion.

Xerox stock closed at $21 on Tuesday, up 4.8%. The shares have risen 15% this year.
