New York State Approves $23 Billion Nynex-Bell Atlantic Merger, Despite Consumer Group Outrage and Regulator Conditions

New York state regulators approved the $23 billion merger between telecommunications companies Nynex and Bell Atlantic today, but imposed conditions aimed at protecting consumers and preventing anti-competitive practices. The approval comes over objections from consumer advocacy groups that argue the deal will lead to higher prices and reduced choice for telephone and cellular service in New York.

The New York Public Service Commission voted 4 to 1 to approve the merger after a 16-month review process, but insisted the combined company follow regulations intended to keep costs down and maintain a competitive marketplace. The companies agreed to freeze basic residential phone rates for two years, continue Lifeline programs for low-income consumers, invest $300 million in broadband infrastructure upgrades, and not increase prices for unbundled network elements used by other carriers.

“While mergers of this scale inevitably present risks, we believe the conditions established in today’s order will help ensure that benefits are realized, and potential harms are mitigated,” said Commission Chairman John F. O’Mara. “This should not be seen as a rubber stamp.”

But consumer groups argue the conditions are insufficient and the merger will still lead to reduced competition and innovation. “No amount of regulatory conditions can compensate for the lost possibility of future competition between these companies,” said Trish Eckert, policy director for the Consumer Federation of America. The group predicts costs for basic phone service will rise by as much as 38% over the next few years if the deal is allowed to proceed. 

Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, and Nynex, based in White Plains, N.Y., announced plans to merge in April 1996 in a deal that would make the combined company the second-largest local phone company in the U.S. behind AT&T. The company will operate in a region from Maine to Virginia and have an estimated 25 million phone lines. Federal regulators approved the merger in August 1997 but state-level reviews were still pending until today. With New York's approval, the last major hurdle has been cleared. The companies expect to complete the merger by mid-1998.

Consumer advocates maintain that further mergers and continued consolidation in the telecom industry will undermine competition and reduce incentives for companies to innovate. But Bell Atlantic and Nynex argue the merger will allow them to operate more efficiently and accelerate investments in new technology like broadband, translating into more affordable and advanced services for customers. The debate around telecom competition and regulation is sure to continue as more mergers are proposed in coming years. But for now, it appears this controversial deal will move forward, for better and for worse.
