Computer Associates International Inc Sees North American Revenue Growth of 33% in December Quarter

Computer Associates International Inc reported strong revenue growth in North America for the quarter ending December 31, 2020. Revenue from North American operations grew 33% compared to the same quarter last year. 

The company attributed the significant increase to higher demand for its cybersecurity and cloud management software and services. With the rapid shift to remote work and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for software and services to enable cloud computing, secure remote networks and protect against cyber threats has surged.

Computer Associates, known as CA Technologies, provides software and solutions to over 10,000 enterprise customers worldwide to manage and secure IT environments. Its North American business comprises about 60% of total company revenue.

For the December quarter, total revenue from North American customers rose to $1.2 billion, up from $900 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from its enterprise solutions segment that includes security and automation software grew 37%, while mainframe and infrastructure software segment revenue climbed 30%.

“The acceleration in our North American business is being fueled by the imperative for companies to harness the cloud, automate processes and defend against an elevated threat environment,” said Mike Gregoire, CEO of CA Technologies. “Our software provides the mission-critical solutions that companies rely on to navigate these transformational times.”

The company reported an 18% increase in new customer signings in North America, as companies rapidly adopted more digital and cloud-based IT infrastructure. CA Technologies also expanded strategic partnerships with cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud to deliver its software and services to more customers.

For the full fiscal year, Computer Associates anticipates North American revenue growth will continue at a strong double-digit pace given the tailwinds from digital transformation and cybersecurity trends. With a solid footprint in the region and trusted solutions for mission-critical needs, CA Technologies is poised to benefit from resilient demand even as economic conditions start to improve. Overall, the company expects total revenue for the 2021 fiscal year to increase in the range of 12% to 15% year over year.
