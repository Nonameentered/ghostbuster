VLSI Technology Expects Lower Revenues for Q1 1997, Stock Plummets on Concerns 

VLSI Technology, a leading semiconductor company, announced today that it expects revenues for the first quarter of 1997 to be 5 to 10 percent lower than the previous quarter. The company cited weaker than expected demand and excess inventory as reasons for the revenue shortfall. 

VLSI develops and manufactures integrated circuits for electronics companies in a range of markets, including computing, networking, and wireless communications. The company has seen strong growth over the past several years as demand for mobile phones, networking equipment, and other electronics has surged. However, VLSI and other chipmakers now face a slowdown in key markets that is putting pressure on growth.

“The entire semiconductor industry is experiencing a cyclical downturn right now due to excess inventory and slower demand in some segments,” said Brian Halla, VLSI’s CEO. “Although we expect this to be a short-term challenge, we are taking necessary actions to manage costs while continuing to invest in key strategic programs to drive our future growth.”

VLSI expects revenues of between $475 million and $495 million for the first quarter, down from $518 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. The company also warned that earnings would fall short of analysts’ expectations. VLSI cited weak demand for chips used in desktop PCs and networking equipment as well as high inventory levels across the consumer electronics industry. 

Investors reacted strongly to the negative news, sending VLSI’s shares plunging over 25% in midday trading. The stock decline wiped out over $2.5 billion in market value for the company. Analysts also downgraded their ratings and estimates for VLSI following the announcement. “This is a major disappointment and setback for VLSI,” said David Wong, an analyst with A.G. Edwards. “The magnitude of the revenue shortfall suggests the downturn in demand is quite severe, and recovery may take a few quarters.”

The revenue warning from VLSI adds to concerns about the near-term outlook for technology companies and the overall economy. Several other chipmakers and PC companies have recently reported weaker demand and falling profits. The industry slowdown is putting pressure on technology stocks, which have seen a sharp sell-off over the past month. While many analysts still expect demand to pick up later in the year, VLSI’s announcement signals that a turnaround may take longer than expected.
