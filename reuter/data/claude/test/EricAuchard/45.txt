MCI Communications Corp Reports Flat Earnings Despite Rise in Revenues, Warns of Slow Growth Ahead

MCI Communications Corp reported flat earnings in the second quarter despite higher revenues, warning that economic uncertainty and technological change would likely curb growth for the rest of the year.

The telecommunications giant said net income was unchanged at $453 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with the second quarter of last year. Excluding some charges, earnings per share were 56 cents, matching analysts’ expectations according to a survey by Refinitiv.  

Revenue rose 6% to $5.65 billion, slightly above estimates. The results reflect double-digit growth at MCI’s consumer division but slowing demand from corporate customers.

“While we continued to see solid revenue gains this quarter, earnings remained under pressure due to higher costs and diminished demand from our largest enterprise accounts,” said MCI Chief Executive Carl Greene in a statement.  “The macroeconomic environment is creating uncertainty, and new technologies like 5G wireless and software-defined networking present both opportunities and challenges.”

MCI said it expected low single-digit revenue growth for 2019, down from earlier projections of 4-6% growth. The company also cut its forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to a range of $22 billion to $22.5 billion, from $22.5 billion to $23 billion previously.  MCI blamed “a worsening macro backdrop, less robust capital spending among major customers, and ongoing pricing pressures.”

Shares in MCI fell 3.7% in after-hours trading following the results. The stock is down 15% from a year high in April.

MCI provides local and long-distance telephone service, data networking, and wireless services to residential and business customers across the U.S. The company has invested billions of dollars in fiber optic networks and new technology like 5G wireless to enable faster internet speeds and enhanced connectivity. However, competition from cable companies and tech giants like Amazon and Google pose threats, while an economic downturn could slow investments by corporate clients.

The results add to concerns that large telecom companies face slowing growth amid industry upheaval. Last month, rival Verizon Communications Inc cut its 2019 revenue outlook due to lower demand for some of its legacy wireline services. AT&T Inc reports second quarter results next week, with analysts also expecting muted subscriber additions and profit pressure.
