AT&T Faces New Threats to International Strategy as Telefonica Defects to Rival Camp  

AT&T's ambition to become a global telecommunications giant suffered a major setback today as Telefonica, one of Europe's largest phone carriers, announced a strategic partnership with AT&T's rival Verizon Communications. The deal threatens AT&T's international expansion plans and casts doubt on its strategy of acquiring foreign assets to gain scale and reach new customers abroad.

For years, AT&T has pursued an aggressive growth strategy overseas, buying up wireless operators in Mexico, Brazil, and across Latin America. The company spent billions to acquire assets from Telefonica and other rivals, aiming to create a seamless network that serves millions of customers across borders. Yet with consumer markets now largely saturated, the key to future growth in telecoms is offering corporate clients integrated network solutions and digital services that span the globe.  

Telefonica's decision to join forces with Verizon on such enterprise offerings deals a blow to AT&T's global ambitions. Verizon, the largest wireless operator in the U.S., has faced limitations expanding internationally, so a pact with Telefonica plugs a key gap in its network coverage. Together, the telcos will provide multinational companies communications and digital services in over 50 countries across the Americas and Europe.  

For Telefonica, the deal provides an outlet for its business-facing operations at a time when revenues from traditional telecom services are stagnating. The partnership will also give the Madrid-based company exposure to Verizon's advanced wireless and fiberoptic networks in the U.S., which still produces a significant share of global economic growth.

The agreement between Verizon and Telefonica lasts for five years and will include co-developing new digital products as well as sharing infrastructure and resources to reduce costs. For AT&T, the prospect of its two closest competitors collaborating so closely poses a serious threat, both to its position in international markets and its bottom line at home. After falling nearly 5% on today's news, AT&T's share price is down over 25% from its summer peak, reflecting investor concerns over its global strategy and declining cellphone customers. With its largest rivals joining forces, AT&T may need to rethink its approach to conquering new markets abroad if it hopes to reignite growth.
