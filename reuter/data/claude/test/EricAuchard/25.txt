3Com Plans to Expand into Small Business and Home Markets through Merger with U.S. Robotics Corp.  

3Com Corp., a leading provider of enterprise networking solutions, announced today plans to acquire U.S. Robotics Corp. in an all-stock transaction valued at $6.6 billion. The combination of 3Com and U.S. Robotics will allow 3Com to expand beyond its traditional large enterprise customer base into small business and home networking markets.

3Com is best known for its network switches and routers used by large corporations and technology companies. U.S. Robotics is a major supplier of modems and manufactures the popular Palm Pilot personal digital assistants. By merging, the two companies aim to become a "one-stop shop" for both business and consumer networking needs. 

"This merger provides an opportunity for us to accelerate 3Com's growth by offering customers a complete set of solutions from the desktop to the data center," said Eric Benhamou, chairman and CEO of 3Com. The combined company will have more than 9,000 employees and annual revenue of $5 billion, making it the second largest public networking company behind Cisco Systems.

Under the terms of the agreement, 3Com will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of U.S. Robotics stock. 3Com stock rose 12% today on the news while U.S. Robotics shares were up 16%. The deal is expected to close by the end of 3Com's fiscal year ending in August.

Analysts are optimistic that the merger makes strategic sense but warn that integration challenges lie ahead. "3Com will need to effectively sell and support U.S. Robotics' consumer products through its primarily direct sales force and resellers focused on large enterprises. That will require significant operational changes," said Ashok Kumar of Piper Jaffray in a research note. However, the opportunity to cross-sell 3Com switches and routers to U.S. Robotics' two million Palm Pilot users is seen as a major benefit of the deal.

The transaction further consolidates the networking industry, leaving Cisco with one less major competitor. However, Benhamou argued that the merger positions the new 3Com to better compete over the long run. "By broadening our portfolio, we will meet the future needs of customers for end-to-end networking solutions," he said.
