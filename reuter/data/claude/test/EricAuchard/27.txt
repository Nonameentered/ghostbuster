3Com-U.S. Robotics acquisition causes stocks of major network companies to drop 

3Com Corp. announced yesterday that it would acquire rival U.S. Robotics Corp. for $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that would combine two of the largest suppliers of networking equipment for corporate networks and the Internet. Investors reacted negatively to the news, fearing the merger would lead to price wars that could hurt profits, and stocks of major networking companies declined.

3Com shares fell $4.625 to close at $36.50, down 11.3% for the day, while U.S. Robotics shares plummeted $6.50 to close at $57.125, a 10.2% drop. Other companies were pulled down in the turmoil, including Cisco Systems Inc., which fell $4.875 to $63; Bay Networks Inc., down $2 to $26.50; and Ascend Communications Inc., off $2.50 at $49.25.

The acquisition, which would value U.S. Robotics at about $6.6 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices, is aimed at helping 3Com compete more aggressively with Cisco Systems, the leader in the fast-growing market for equipment used to link networks and route data traffic. By buying U.S. Robotics, 3Com would gain U.S. Robotics' popular modems and access equipment used by both businesses and Internet service providers to link to the network. The deal also gives 3Com important Internet-related technology and the means to develop more comprehensive network solutions.

However, many analysts were skeptical about the strategic rationale for the deal and worried that a marriage of the two companies could lead to sharp price cuts as they try to take market share from Cisco. "This is a very defensive acquisition by 3Com to protect its business from erosion by Cisco," said Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Tim Luke. "But frankly, I'm not sure this does much more than buy them time." The price war and margin pressure that may result will likely hurt other players in the networking equipment market as well. 

 "Prices are going to come crashing down," said Needham & Co. analyst Charlie Glavin. "3Com and U.S. Robotics together still don't have the product breadth that Cisco has, so a price war may be an attempt to halt Cisco's momentum. But it's going to create a lot of chaos." The deal intensifies the competition in the networking equipment market, raising concerns that more acquisitions or partnerships may be needed for companies to keep up.

Many analysts predict that other acquisitions are now more likely in the industry. However, the drop in stock prices of networking companies may make it more difficult for them to become takeover targets or use their stock to acquire other firms. The turbulence from the 3Com-U.S. Robotics deal and worries over price wars and earnings impact are likely to weigh on networking stocks for some time.
