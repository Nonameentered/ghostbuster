Proposed $6.6 Billion Acquisition of U.S. Robotics Causes Stock Drop for 3Com and Other Network Companies 

3Com Corporation announced yesterday that it has agreed to acquire U.S. Robotics for $6.6 billion in stock, a move that would combine two major suppliers of networking equipment and services. However, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending 3Com's stock price down over 25% in heavy trading and causing related drops in other networking companies.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, calls for 3Com to exchange 0.8 of a share for each share of U.S. Robotics. That values U.S. Robotics stock at $63.125 per share, a 15% premium over its closing price before the announcement. The merger would create a company with over $8 billion in annual revenue, making it a more formidable competitor to industry leaders like Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies.

3Com CEO Eric Benhamou said the acquisition "will accelerate our growth and market leadership in small and mid-sized networks and will position us to capture additional opportunities in high-speed remote access." U.S. Robotics CEO Casey Powell added that the move will allow the company to expand further into global markets and new product areas like broadband and wireless technologies. 

However, investors and analysts voiced concerns about the high price of the acquisition, the challenges of combining the two companies, and increased competition from other players. "It seems like an awfully big bite for them to take at this point in time," said William Becklean, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. The drop in 3Com's stock price reflected worries that it may have overpaid for U.S. Robotics and taken on more than it could handle. Shares in other networking companies like Cabletron Systems and Ascend Communications also declined on fears of intensified competition and industry consolidation.

If completed, the merger would be among the largest in the networking sector's history. It is indicative of the pressures that even mid-sized technology companies now face to gain scale and market power. The network equipment industry in particular has experienced massive changes over the past several years with the rapid growth of the Internet and commercial demand for high-speed data and voice networks. For two rivals like 3Com and U.S. Robotics, teaming up may be the only way to stay ahead in this fast-evolving environment. The coming months will reveal whether this blockbuster deal was the right strategy and whether the rewards ultimately outweigh the risks and costs for both companies and their shareholders.
