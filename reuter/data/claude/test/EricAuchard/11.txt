IBM Gives Stock a Cosmetic Boost With Two-for-One Split But Faces Pressure to Revive Core  Growth

International Business Machines Corp. announced a two-for-one stock split this week in an effort to make its shares more appealing to individual investors. The split will make IBM's stock price more affordable by halving the number of shares and doubling the number of shares outstanding. 

The move is largely cosmetic, however, and does not impact IBM's market capitalization or intrinsic value. IBM faces significant challenges in reviving growth in its core businesses like infrastructure services and software. The company's revenue has declined for the past five consecutive years as IBM has struggled to pivot to new high-growth areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

IBM's share price has lagged the broader stock market over the past decade, gaining just 36% in that period compared to over 300% for the S&P 500 index. The company hopes the stock split will broaden its investor base by making shares more accessible to smaller investors and increase liquidity in the stock. However, IBM will need to deliver improving financial results and stronger growth to truly boost its stock price over the long run.

Analysts are skeptical that a stock split alone will achieve that goal. "IBM's challenges are not connected to its stock price but rather to its business fundamentals," said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research. "A stock split does not fix revenue declines or business model issues."

IBM faces pricing pressure in its legacy businesses and has been slow to adopt new technologies like the cloud. The company's cloud computing unit grew just 5% last quarter, far behind the 50% or higher growth rates of market leaders Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google. IBM has made progress in artificial intelligence software and the high-margin cybersecurity market but competitive pressures remain.
