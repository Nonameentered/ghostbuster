Debt restructuring deal for Eurotunnel leaves little value for shareholders, say experts

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, has agreed to a debt restructuring deal with its creditors that will see €6.8 billion ($7.5 billion) of debt cut in half. However, financial experts warn the agreement will significantly dilute existing shareholders.  

Under the terms of the deal, Eurotunnel's debt will be cut from €6.8 billion to €3.2 billion, giving the company more financial breathing room as it struggles with lower traffic and revenue due to Brexit uncertainty and the COVID-19 pandemic. The restructuring involves the main shareholders, Goldman Sachs and Eiffage, injecting €200 million in new cash into the company. In exchange, however, the ownership stakes of existing shareholders will drop from 49% to 2%.

The deal must still be approved by a French commercial court in a process that could take several months. If approved, it would help Eurotunnel avoid defaulting on its loans and note repayments due over the next two years. But shareholders, who have already seen the value of their stakes decimated, will be left with little value or influence under the restructured company.

"While bondholders and the company itself benefit from reduced debt and more financial security, shareholders have been utterly marginalized in this process," said Henri Temple, a credit analyst at Francoise Credit in Paris. "Their stakes have been severely diluted, and they will have almost no say in Eurotunnel's future direction or strategy."

Eurotunnel has been struggling financially for years due to lower cross-Channel traffic from trucking and car shuttles. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a broader economic slowdown in Britain and continental Europe led to a 7% drop in shuttle traffic last year, according to company figures.The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated its troubles, with a 95% plunge in crossings in April and May.  

The Channel Tunnel, a 50-kilometer long underwater rail tunnel, opened in 1994 at a cost of £9.5 billion (€10.5 billion), making it one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever undertaken. Once a symbol of European unity, the tunnel now highlights the economic fragility posed by Britain's departure from the EU single market and threats like the coronavirus crisis."
