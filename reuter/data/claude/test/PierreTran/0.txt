Eurotunnel Releases Uncertain First-Half Results as Debt Talks Continue 

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, reported mixed first-half results today as it continues negotiations with lenders to restructure its debt. Revenue increased 3% to €534 million, but net profit dropped 27% to €24 million compared to the same period last year. 

The drop in profit was attributed to higher financing costs related to Eurotunnel’s €9.7 billion debt, which the company has been attempting to restructure over the past year. Interest payments in the first half totaled €97 million, an increase of €10 million from a year earlier. Eurotunnel said it remains in “constructive discussions” with its creditors and hopes to finalize a restructuring agreement by the end of the year.

“These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model, despite the continuing challenges of the economic environment and competitive pressures,” said Eurotunnel CEO Jacques Gounon. “We have delivered growth in revenue and operating profit before special items. At the same time, we have maintained tight control of our costs.”

Eurotunnel’s core shuttle service, which transports passenger and freight trains through the 30-mile Channel Tunnel, saw a 4% increase in volume to over 2.6 million vehicles in the first half. Revenue from the shuttle service grew 3% to €507 million. The company benefited from a higher load factor, with an average of 58 vehicles per shuttle crossing.

The freight shuttle service had a strong first half, with a 7% rise in truck volume and an 11% revenue increase. Eurotunnel said freight traffic growth was boosted by increasing trade flows between Britain and mainland Europe.

While the shuttle business has remained stable, Eurotunnel’s wider retail and passenger service segments have struggled in the past year. These segments, which rely more on discretionary customer spending, saw revenue decline in the first half. The drop highlights the company’s heavy dependence on the core shuttle operations.

Looking ahead, Eurotunnel said it expects full-year traffic volume and revenue to show continued growth. But profitability remains closely tied to the outcome of debt restructuring talks. If a comprehensive deal can be reached, Eurotunnel’s financing costs would decrease significantly, providing a boost to net earnings. However, failure to reach an agreement could put further strain on the company’s balance sheet.

Eurotunnel shares rose 4% in early trading on the Paris stock exchange following the first-half results announcement. But the stock remains down over 30% from a year ago, reflecting ongoing investor concerns about Eurotunnel’s debt burden and uncertain outlook.
