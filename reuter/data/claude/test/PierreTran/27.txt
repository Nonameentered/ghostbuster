Air France Aims to Break Even in 1997 Despite Labour Strife and Increased Competition  

Air France, France's national carrier, is aiming to break even in 1997 despite facing  strong headwinds, including ongoing labor tensions, increased competition from budget carriers, and a flat economic outlook for the region's aviation industry. The state-owned airline is hoping to reach profitability this year through continued cost-cutting measures, efficiency gains, and modest fare increases.

The carrier posted a net loss of $321 million in 1996, an improvement over the $568 million loss in 1995 but still in the red. Management hopes that a new round of productivity improvements in 2017 can help put the company on track to reach breakeven results. The company's restructuring plan aims to cut operating costs by 4 percent each year, a move that has been met with strong opposition from labor unions. Strikes by pilots, flight attendants, and ground staff have disrupted operations in recent months and are expected to continue to weigh on the carrier's performance going forward.

Air France also faces intensifying competition, especially for short-haul and regional flights within Europe. Low-cost carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair have gained market share on these routes, forcing Air France to cut prices and lose revenue. The company is streamlining its short-haul operations and rebranded them under the Hop brand to better compete with the budget airlines. On longer international routes, Air France remains the dominant carrier and has seen less impact from competition. But overall passenger yields have declined slightly, putting pressure on profit margins.

Despite the headwinds, Air France executives remain cautiously optimistic about achieving breakeven results this year. Passenger traffic grew 3.6 percent in 2016 and is forecast to rise 2 to 3 percent in 2017. Air France is also benefiting from lower jet fuel prices, which remain well below 2014 levels. The airline expects to reduce its fuel bill by over $300 million this year. The company has also cut debt levels in recent years, reducing interest expenses.

Air France acknowledges that an uptick in economic growth in France and across Europe would greatly help its ability to reach sustained profitability. France's GDP grew by just 1.2 percent in 2016. Forecasters expect similarly lackluster growth this year, which could continue to weigh on demand for air travel. But with aggressive cost cutting, efficiency gains, and stable passenger traffic, Air France is hoping that breakeven results for 2017 are within its reach, despite the significant challenges. The carrier's long-term goal remains achieving consistent profitability and a 5 percent operating margin, though that still looks to be some years away based on the competitive pressures and economic uncertainties facing the airline industry.
