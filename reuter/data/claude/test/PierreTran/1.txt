Rival bidders in race for French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF must woo state-owned Aerospatiale to clinch deal, say analysts

French defence electronics giant Thomson-CSF has been put up for sale, sparking a bidding war between European rivals eager to expand their aerospace and military technology capabilities. However, analysts say the key to clinching a deal will be winning over Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft maker that holds a 30% stake in Thomson-CSF. 

Thomson-CSF, a leader in radar, missile guidance systems and other military electronics, was partially privatized in 1998 but the French government retained a "golden share" giving it veto power over ownership changes. With defence budgets under pressure, the government is now open to consolidating the industry through mergers and acquisitions.

Aerospatiale is seen as unlikely to keep its Thomson-CSF stake and is looking for a deal that would boost its own profits and help fund new aircraft projects. Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Lagardere Group, a French media company with defence interests, have both announced interest in Thomson-CSF. 

However, the front-runner is considered to be Italy's Finmeccanica, Europe's fourth largest defence company. Finmeccanica is eager to catch up to larger rivals like BAE Systems and Boeing Co, and an acquisition of Thomson-CSF, along with its ally Dassault Aviation, would vault it into the top ranks of global arms makers. Finmeccanica has pledged to maintain Thomson-CSF as a distinctly French company to allay nationalist concerns.

Britain's BAE is also seen as a potential suitor, though its recent takeover of GEC Marconi may require a prolonged antitrust review before another major deal. DaimlerChrysler, meanwhile, is still integrating aerospace firms from Germany and Spain and may have its hands full with that process.  

With multiple bidders vying for their support, Aerospatiale is in a strong position to negotiate guarantees of investment in next-generation aircraft like the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet and Rafale fighter. By backing the bidder that offers the strongest commitments to French facilities and programs, analysts say Aerospatiale can maximize the benefits to its own business as well as the nation's military and aerospace sectors.

The sale of Thomson-CSF is seen closing by mid-2001 if a deal with Aerospatiale can be reached, though complex negotiations around competition, security and job implications may still prolong the process. The solution that emerges will reveal much about the future shape of Europe's fragmented but rapidly consolidating military industry.
