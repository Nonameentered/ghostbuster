France rejects General Electric bid for state stake in Thomson-CSF, cites national security concerns

The French government has rejected General Electric’s bid to acquire the state’s stake in defense electronics group Thomson-CSF, citing concerns over national security and sovereignty. Economy Minister Nicole Bricq said allowing the US conglomerate to take control of such a strategically important company would pose unacceptable risks. 

“The government has a responsibility to guarantee the independence and continuity of strategic activities on French territory,” Ms. Bricq said in a statement. She added that Thomson-CSF, which specializes in aerospace, defense, and security technologies, “must remain in French hands.”

General Electric had offered $12 billion to purchase the French state’s 46% stake in Thomson-CSF. The move would have given GE a controlling interest in one of France’s leading defense contractors and allowed it to consolidate Thomson-CSF’s business with its own aviation and power divisions. However, the bid ran into fierce opposition from French politicians, trade unions, and military officials.

Critics argued that allowing an American company to take over Thomson-CSF would compromise sensitive technologies and make France overly dependent on foreign partners for critical defense capabilities. They pointed to GE’s history of cutting costs through restructuring, outsourcing, and job reductions, which could threaten thousands of high-skilled jobs in France’s industrial base. Supporters of the GE deal, on the other hand, said an infusion of private capital and GE’s management expertise could benefit Thomson-CSF and help make its aerospace and electronics businesses more globally competitive.

The rejection of GE’s bid highlights enduring concerns about foreign investment in key national assets. While France has slowly opened more of its economy to international competition, its defense, media, and utilities sectors remain largely protected over fears that outside control could undermine French interests. For GE, the decision is a setback for its ambitions to expand further into the European aerospace and defense market through acquisitions. However, the company said it respects France’s move to safeguard its national security. GE will now have to look for other partnership or investment opportunities to build up its defense portfolio on the continent.

The collapse of the deal leaves unresolved questions over the future of Thomson-CSF, including how it will raise capital to maintain its position as a leader in defense electronics. The state, as the largest shareholder, will have a key role to play in charting a new course for the company that balances national priorities with the demands of an increasingly competitive global marketplace. Overall, the rejection of GE’s bid demonstrates France’s desire to protect one of the crown jewels in its industrial sector from foreign control, even at a cost of possible lost opportunity.
