French Government Prepares to Relaunch Privatisation of Thomson-CSF with Key Executive Appointments

The French government is gearing up for another attempt at privatizing defense electronics group Thomson-CSF, according to sources close to the matter. Plans are underway to restructure the executive team and board of directors ahead of an expected share offer in early 2001. 

Thomson-CSF, one of France's largest state-owned companies, went through a failed privatization attempt in 1999. The government's hopes of selling a large minority stake in the company were dashed by market turbulence and political opposition. However, with the company's finances stabilized and equity markets recovering, the government of President Jacques Chirac is determined to push ahead with plans to partially privatize Thomson-CSF over the coming year.

Key to this new effort will be the appointment of a new chief executive to replace current CEO Alain Gomez, who will retire at the end of the year. Names floated as possible successors include senior Thomson executives Louis Pick and Henri Proglio, as well as external candidates such as Jean-Bernard Levy, former CEO of mobile operator SFR Cegetel. Whoever is chosen will be tasked with preparing the company for a successful share listing and improving its performance to attract investor interest.

The government is also reconstituting Thomson's board of directors, with plans to add independent directors and reduce the number of government representatives. The aim is to improve corporate governance and oversight ahead of privatization. Despite controlling Thomson-CSF, the French state has at times struggled to curb losses, control spending, and increase accountability within the sprawling company. A revamped board is seen as key to providing more effective guidance and oversight.

While the government is keen to divest itself of Thomson-CSF, officials insist that any share sale will be gradual and the state will initially maintain a controlling stake. The government views Thomson-CSF as a strategically important company, but hopes private capital can help improve performance and competitiveness. After a lengthy stay, partial privatization may finally be in sight for one of France's industrial icons. Overall, the moves suggest the end of an era for Thomson-CSF as it prepares to accelerate reforms and enter the public markets.
