Rival Bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere Group Set to Make Final Offers for Thomson-CSF Privatization 

The French government is expected to receive final takeover offers this week from two rival bidders for Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled electronics and defense group. Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications equipment maker, and Lagardere Group, the media conglomerate, are both keen to acquire Thomson-CSF as part of the French government’s privatization program.

Thomson-CSF is a leading military electronics company that supplies radar, missiles, telecommunications, and other systems to the French military. It has seen significant revenue and profit growth over the past decade thanks to increasing defense budgets in France and export contracts to developing nations. The company is 63% owned by the French government, with the remaining shares trading on the Paris stock exchange.

Alcatel Alsthom bid 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for Thomson-CSF in December but was promptly outbid by Lagardere, which offered 3.2 billion euros. The offers were rejected by the French government as too low. The government is hoping for offers of at least 3.5 billion to 4 billion euros to sell its controlling stake. Alcatel views acquiring Thomson-CSF as a way to expand into the growing market for military and defense electronics. For Lagardere, Thomson-CSF would boost its aerospace and defense business and reduce its reliance on media.

The privatization of Thomson-CSF is part of a wider program by the French government to sell state-owned companies to reduce France’s budget deficit ahead of adopting the euro common currency. However, the government faces opposition from labor unions concerned about potential job losses. The government has promised to retain jobs and keep Thomson-CSF's headquarters in Paris. Bidders will also be judged based on their commitment to invest in Thomson-CSF's research and keep its technology in France.

The final round of bidding comes amid a broader consolidation of Europe's aerospace and defense sectors. The merger earlier this year of the space and missile units of Aerospatiale Matra and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace created the largest space company in the world and a powerful competitor for Thomson-CSF. By gaining control of Thomson-CSF, either Alcatel or Lagardere would have a platform for further expansion in this sector. The French government's decision on the winning bid for Thomson-CSF is expected within two weeks, although further negotiations may be required before a deal is completed.
