Club Med Shares Surge 20% on Appointment of Euro Disney Head as Chairman  

Shares of Club Med, the popular all-inclusive resort company, jumped more than 20% today following the announcement that Philippe Gas will become the new chairman of the company. Gas is currently the CEO of Euro Disney, the theme park operator that runs Disneyland Paris. 

Investors reacted positively to the news, bidding up Club Med shares in hopes that Gas will help revitalize the resort company and drive more visitors to its properties around the globe. Club Med operates over 70 resorts in countries ranging from the Maldives to Mexico. While still a leader in the all-inclusive resort space, Club Med has faced increasing competition from rivals offering similar packages in exotic locations. 

Gas brings over 30 years of experience in the leisure and tourism industry to Club Med. During his time at Euro Disney, he oversaw major expansions of the Disneyland Paris theme park, including new Star Wars and Marvel attractions. He is credited with boosting attendance at the park and improving the guest experience. Club Med is hoping Gas can bring some of the same magic to help attract more high-spending customers to its resorts.

"Philippe Gas is a world-class leader in global leisure tourism and hospitality," said Henri Giscard d'Estaing, CEO of Club Med. "His experience and vision will be invaluable as we embark on a new phase of growth at Club Med. We are delighted to welcome Philippe as our new Chairman."

In a statement, Gas said, "I am very excited to join the Club Med family. Club Med has established itself as the undisputed leader in premium all-inclusive vacations and experiences. I look forward to working with the team to build on this legacy and accelerate the company's strategic growth initiatives."

Gas's appointment comes at a crucial time for Club Med, which was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International in 2015. Fosun has invested heavily in upgrades at many Club Med resorts but is looking for a strong leader to guide the brand globally. With a surging Chinese middle class interested in international leisure travel, Club Med sees enormous potential in the coming decades if it can capture the interest of this new generation of global explorers. By naming a veteran leader like Philippe Gas as chairman, the resort company appears ready to embark on its next chapter of transformation and growth.
