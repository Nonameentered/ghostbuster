Pratt & Whitney Opens Paris Office to Spearhead New Market Strategy  

Pratt & Whitney, the Connecticut-based aerospace manufacturer, announced today the opening of a new regional headquarters in Paris, France. The new office will lead Pratt & Whitney's marketing and business development efforts across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The move is part of a broader market strategy to gain new airline customers for the company's latest generation jet engines.

"Paris is the center of the aviation industry in our region, so it's the obvious location for our new headquarters," said Jean-Christophe Menne, managing director of Pratt & Whitney's Paris office. "This move allows us to be closer to our customers and partners, understand their needs better, and build long-term relationships as we market new engine models like the GTF."

The GTF, or Geared Turbofan, is Pratt & Whitney's latest commercial aircraft engine. It promises double-digit improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions reductions compared to today's standard engines. The GTF powers new aircraft like the Airbus A220 and A320neo, as well as Embraer's E190-E2. Pratt & Whitney hopes the Paris office will spearhead sales of the GTF to other European, Middle Eastern, and African airlines looking to reduce costs and meet environmental regulations.  

Pratt & Whitney faces stiff competition in the region from CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines. CFM manufactures the LEAP series of jet engines, which also power versions of the A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The race for new engine sales in this single-aisle jet market is fierce.

The Paris office currently has a staff of 25 but aims to grow to over 50 employees by next year. Pratt & Whitney executives and sales leaders from company headquarters in Connecticut will also frequently visit the Paris office to liaise with customers and attend air shows. The office will be located in central Paris near the Champs-Élysées.  

Pratt & Whitney's new Paris presence is the latest in a series of strategic moves to adapt to shifts in the global aviation market. The company set up an office in Beijing, China last year and recently opened a $50 million manufacturing facility in Singapore. Through overseas expansion and new product innovation, Pratt & Whitney aims to build on its position as one of the world's leading aircraft engine suppliers. The opening of the Paris regional headquarters is a significant step toward meeting that long-term goal.
