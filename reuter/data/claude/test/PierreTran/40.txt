Analysts Warn Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux Must Prove Benefit to Shareholders in Planned Merger 

Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux, two major French utilities, announced plans this week to merge into a single company in a deal valued at $50 billion. However, analysts warn the companies must clearly demonstrate the benefits to shareholders and address concerns about potential job losses if they want to gain regulatory and shareholder approval.

The proposed merger would combine Cie de Suez, one of the world's largest water and waste utilities, with Lyonnaise des Eaux, a major provider of water and sanitation services in France and other parts of Europe and the Middle East. The new company would have combined annual revenue of $67 billion and operations in 70 countries.

In a statement, the companies touted the merger as an opportunity to gain scale, cut costs, and accelerate investments in new technologies like smart water meters and waste-to-energy plants. They project $780 million in cost savings within three years of the merger.  

However, analysts note the companies have little overlap in their operations, so cost savings may be difficult to achieve. They also point out that previous large mergers in the utility sector have often failed to provide economic benefits to shareholders.  “There is no evidence these types of megamergers provide more benefits than risks for utility companies,” said Gauthier Blanchet, an analyst at Oddo BHF Securities in Paris. 

Unions representing workers at the two companies also criticized the lack of detail on potential job cuts, though the companies promised in a joint statement there would be no layoffs as a result of the merger. With a combined workforce of 140,000 people, there are fears the companies may look to trim costs through staff reductions over the long run.

The merger requires approval from shareholders at both companies as well as French regulators. Shareholders may be tempted by a short-term gain from any premium in the share offer, but according to Blanchet, they should demand a clearer rationale on the strategic benefits before approving the deal.  “A megamerger of this size and complexity should not be taken lightly and needs to be thoroughly justified,” he said.

With a strong case and guarantees to limit job losses, the deal stands a chance of success, but the companies must provide a “convincing long-term vision” to receive final regulatory and shareholder consent, Blanchet concluded. Without that, analysts warn this merger of French utilities could face a turbulent road ahead.
