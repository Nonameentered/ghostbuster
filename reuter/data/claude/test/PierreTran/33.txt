French Concerns over Strategic Industries Highlighted in Second Rejection of General Electric Co Plc's Nuclear Merger Talks  

The French government has blocked merger talks between General Electric Co Plc and French nuclear powerhouses Framatome SA and Alstom SA for the second time in less than a year, citing concerns over national security and strategic interests. The move highlights tensions between open global markets and protectionism of key domestic industries, especially in sectors directly tied to national security such as energy and transportation.

In a statement, the French finance ministry said it would not approve a full takeover of Framatome and Alstom SA's nuclear operations by GE as it could hand control of France's nuclear industrial base to a foreign company. Framatome and Alstom design and build nuclear reactors, turbines, and other critical components for France's fleet of 56 nuclear power plants which generate over 70% of the country's electricity. 

GE has sought to expand its presence in the lucrative global nuclear energy market through mergers and acquisitions. It took control of Alstom's power and grid business in 2015, but was rebuffed by French authorities last year in its bid to fully acquire Alstom's nuclear turbine operations. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire has been vocal about the need to protect French companies involved in strategic industries from foreign takeovers.

While France is a champion of global free trade and open markets as a member of the European Union, it has invoked national security interests at times to protect major companies such as energy giant EDF, aircraft maker Airbus, and telecoms firm Orange from foreign control. However, critics argue such moves hamper competition, raise costs for consumers, and deter much-needed foreign investment in French companies. They see it as a slippery slope towards broader protectionism.

For GE, the latest rejection casts further uncertainty over its growth ambitions in nuclear power and access to the French market which it sees as key to expanding its energy operations in Europe. However, with competition growing from Chinese, Russian and Korean nuclear firms, France also risks its champions falling behind without partnerships to help fund innovation. The situation highlights the difficult balancing act nations face in today's global economy between openness and protectionism in strategic sectors. Overall, there are no easy answers and tensions are likely to continue.
