French Government Announces Terms for Privatisation of Thomson-CSF Igniting Battle for Control Among Rival Companies 

The French government yesterday announced the specific terms around the privatization of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF, sparking a battle for control of the company between rival bidders. According to the government's plan, just over 50 percent of Thomson-CSF's shares will be sold, with a goal of raising around $3 billion from the sale. However, the remaining government shares will come with "golden shares" that give the state veto power over any ownership changes for the first five years.

The partial privatization and golden shares are designed to balance the government's need to raise funds with a desire to protect Thomson-CSF's strategic military technologies from falling into foreign ownership. The company is a leader in radar, missiles, and other defence electronics and is considered by the French government to be integral to national security interests. However, critics argue the golden shares will deter some bidders and reduce the sale price.

No sooner had the terms been announced than two consortia announced rival bids for the company. One group includes France's Alcatel together with Italy's Finmeccanica and US defence contractor Raytheon. The second group pairs France's Thales with the European aerospace consortium EADS. A third potential bid could come from US-based Litton Industries, partnering with French defence firm Dassault Aviation. The battle lines highlight both the commercial and strategic value seen in gaining control of Thomson-CSF's technologies and expertise.

The bidding process will likely lead to a complex set of negotiations around national security interests, given the advanced military technologies at the heart of Thomson-CSF's business. The French government is expected to favour a bid that combines French and European companies and helps strengthen a nascent European defence industry, as long as it also meets their price expectations. However, US companies are eager to gain greater access to Thomson-CSF's capabilities, which could benefit transatlantic defence co-operation. The coming months will prove pivotal in shaping the future ownership and direction of Thomson-CSF, with major implications for the global defence industry landscape.
