Appointment of Euro Disney Head Boosts Club Med Shares by 20%

Shares of Club Med, the French resort and cruise operator, rose 20% today following the announcement that Philippe Gas will become the company's new CEO. Gas is moving to Club Med from his current role as CEO of Disneyland Paris, the operator of Euro Disney resort. 

Investors are upbeat about Gas's appointment and experience leading a major tourism and hospitality business. As CEO of Disneyland Paris since 2015, Gas oversaw double-digit growth in revenue and visitors. He brings over 25 years of experience in the travel and leisure industry to Club Med.

"We are thrilled to appoint Philippe as Club Med's new CEO," said Henri Giscard d'Estaing, son of former French president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and chairman of Club Med. "His proven track record of growth and innovation at Disneyland Paris will be invaluable as Club Med expands our resort and cruise offerings around the world."

Club Med is in the midst of a revitalization plan under current owner Fosun Tourism Group, a Chinese conglomerate. The plan includes upgrading existing resorts, opening 20 new resorts by 2020, and launching five new cruise ships. Fosun believes Club Med can tap into rising demand for experiential luxury travel, especially from Chinese tourists.  

Gas replaces former CEO Xavier Mufraggi, who will take on a newly created position as CEO of Club Med's Europe and Africa division. Gas will officially start as global CEO on September 2 when Mufraggi steps down.  

Investors see Gas as the right leader to accelerate Club Med's growth strategy given his experience driving innovation and premium experiences at Disneyland Paris. Shares of Club Med have gained over 70% in the past two years as Fosun's investments have buoyed profits and paid off. Gas's appointment is a sign that Fosun aims to continue the momentum. Overall, analysts view Gas's move to Club Med and the company's growth plans positively, believing strong prospects lie ahead for the iconic French resort company under new leadership.
