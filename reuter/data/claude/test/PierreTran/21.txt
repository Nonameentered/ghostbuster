Boeing eyes expansion into aerospace services with foreign partners: CEO Phil Condit

Boeing Co's chief executive Phil Condit said the company is looking to expand into aerospace services and partner with foreign companies as a way to fuel growth. Speaking at the Paris Air Show, Condit said Boeing wants to build up its services business, which provides repairs, maintenance and upgrades for aircraft. He sees opportunities to provide more services for the large installed base of Boeing planes with airlines and leasing companies around the world.

"We have been largely a manufacturer of products, and now we want to enhance our role in providing services to our customers to extend the life and utility of our products," Condit said. Boeing currently gets about 15% of its revenue from services but wants to significantly grow that percentage over time. Aerospace services is seen as a stable and growing business, even as demand for new planes can fluctuate from year to year.

To aid in its expansion, Boeing will look to partner with foreign companies that have expertise and connections in services, according to Condit. He said Boeing will not try to build up the services business on its own and will look for strategic teaming agreements and even potential acquisitions with key partners. Condit did not name any specific companies Boeing is talking to but said discussions are active in several countries.

Any deals or partnerships would mirror Boeing's increasing focus on global collaboration. Condit pointed to partnerships with companies in Italy, Japan and China as examples of working with overseas suppliers and technology providers. The company's key rival, Airbus, also gets a significant portion of its work and revenue from countries other than just France and Germany, where it is headquartered. Boeing believes increased global partnering will be crucial to its future success. 

At the air show, Boeing expects to unveil orders and commitments for its planes, including the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. The event is seen as an early gauge of demand for new commercial aircraft. Boeing and Airbus often secure a significant portion of plane orders for the year at the Paris show.
