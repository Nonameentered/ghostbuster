France Blocks General Electric's Bid for Thomson-CSF Due to National Security Concerns 

The French government has rejected General Electric's $5.4 billion bid to acquire Thomson-CSF, a major French defense and aerospace electronics company. The decision comes amid rising economic nationalism in France and concerns over foreign control of strategic French companies.

Thomson-CSF is best known for its radar, missile systems, and other military technologies used by France's armed forces. By acquiring Thomson-CSF, General Electric aimed to expand its aviation and aerospace divisions, which manufacture aircraft engines and aerospace components. However, the French Finance Ministry said the deal posed “risks for essential national interests regarding defense that require the government to oppose this transaction.”  

The move highlights the growing tensions between open investment policies favored by the United States and increased restrictions by major European countries seeking to shield domestic companies from foreign control. Under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, France has strengthened reviews of foreign acquisitions of French companies, especially those involving critical infrastructure or technology. The rejection of General Electric’s bid for Thomson-CSF shows France’s willingness to block deals that threaten its national security and economic independence.

For General Electric, the rebuff is a setback to its expansion in France and limits its ability to compete with aerospace rivals like Boeing that have been making acquisitions across Europe. The company expressed disappointment with the French government’s decision, saying its offer represented an opportunity to strengthen Thomson-CSF and support jobs in France. However, officials argued that General Electric’s assurances were not enough given Thomson-CSF’s crucial role in supplying equipment for France’s military.

The squandered deal for Thomson-CSF comes at a difficult time for General Electric, which has been undertaking restructuring efforts to improve its financial performance. Acquiring Thomson-CSF could have provided technological assets to help General Electric reduce costs and gain a foothold in growing aerospace and defense markets in Europe. While General Electric will likely look for other acquisition targets, France has signaled its intent to closely scrutinize foreign takeovers of nationally significant companies. The collapse of General Electric’s bid highlights the political and regulatory hurdles facing cross-border mergers and acquisitions in a time of rising economic nationalism.
