Renault workers call for one-hour strike at plants in France, Belgium and Spain

Thousands of workers at Renault factories in France, Belgium and Spain have called for a one-hour strike today to protest against job cuts announced by the French automaker last week. The workers organized the limited strike to express their frustration with Renault's plans to reduce salaried positions across Europe by 4,600. 

According to Renault union representatives, the strike started at 11 am local time and affected assembly lines at Renault's largest factories, including plants in Flins and Le Mans in France, Palencia and Valladolid in Spain, and Brussels and Charleroi in Belgium. Normal operations resumed after the one-hour work stoppage.

"This limited strike action sends a clear message to Renault management that we will not accept these job cuts without a fight," said Jean-François Pibouleau, a representative for the French Democratic Confederation of Labour union. "Workers made sacrifices to help the company during the financial crisis and this is how they are repaid - with more job insecurity and cuts to wages and benefits. It is unacceptable."

Renault announced last Thursday that it aimed to generate €2 billion in savings over the next three years, including reducing its workforce by about 14,000 jobs globally. The job cuts are part of a major cost-cutting plan led by new CEO Luca de Meo, who took over in July with a mandate to boost Renault's profitability. The company has been struggling in recent years and was further weakened by a downturn in sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. It posted a record €8 billion loss last year.

In response to the strike, a Renault spokesman said: "We understand the concerns of our employees. However, these competitiveness measures are vital to ensure the sustainability of the company and its ability to continue investing in innovative technology." Renault shares were trading slightly lower following news reports of the temporary strike.

The limited work stoppages did not significantly disrupt production and only resulted in a small loss of output at the affected plants, according to Renault. However, union leaders said further strikes could be called if their demands to reduce job cuts were not met during ongoing negotiations with management. Renault employs about 180,000 workers worldwide, including over 90,000 in Europe. Nearly half of its European workforce is based in France.
