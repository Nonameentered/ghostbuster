Lagardere confirms bid for Thomson-CSF in French industry rationalisation effort

Paris-based media and aerospace group Lagardère confirmed today that it has made a bid for Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics company, as part of efforts to rationalise France’s aerospace and defence industry. The potential acquisition of Thomson-CSF, which has struggled recently with technical difficulties and cost overruns in key military programs, raises the prospect of consolidation with Lagardère’s own defence assets to create a stronger national champion. 

If successful, the takeover would mark a new chapter for Thomson-CSF, one of France's oldest technology companies which now ranks as the fifth biggest European defence group. Jean-Luc Lagardère, chairman of Lagardère's supervisory board, said the approach for Thomson was "friendly" but at this stage talks were "very preliminary". However, analysts suggested a deal could value Thomson at up to €5 billion ($5.5 billion). News of the bid sent Thomson’s shares soaring 16 per cent to €81 in Paris.

The move highlights efforts by the centre-right French government to engineer tie-ups in the fragmented defence industry to reduce costs and compete on an increasingly global stage. President Jacques Chirac last year called for the creation of a unified European defence industry, with cross-border mergers to compete with the US. Lagardère's play for Thomson will now place pressure on other defence companies to consolidate.

Thomson, which employs 34,000 staff worldwide and has operations spanning radars and missiles to avionics and satellites, is an attractive target. Despite its recent troubles, it has a strong portfolio of proprietary technologies and a foothold in emerging defence markets in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. For Lagardère, acquiring Thomson would boost its own defence arm Aerospatiale Matra Missiles, which produces missile systems and light armaments, and allow it to compete on larger and more complex projects.

However, there are significant obstacles to any deal. The French government has veto power over changes of control at strategic defence groups like Thomson and will need to approve any sale. Rival bidders may also emerge, including aerospace companies EADS, Thales or Safran. Powerful French unions are wary of job cuts from mergers and have already voiced concerns over Lagardère’s bid. And regulators will examine how to address anti-trust issues and potential loss of competition.

With talks at an early stage, there is no certainty a deal can be reached. But if Lagardère can navigate the hurdles and persuade Thomson and the government to back its offer, it would be left with a commanding position in France's defence landscape. The acquisition could reshape not just the country's defence industry but also its broader aerospace sector. The next few months will prove crucial as the battle for this bastion of French industry unfolds.
