Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux to Merge and Create Global Utilities Heavyweight  

The French utilities firms Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux announced plans today to merge and create Europe's second largest water and wastewater company and one of the world's leading utilities firms. The all-share deal will result in a combined company with a market capitalization of $57 billion and annual revenue of over $22 billion.

The merger brings together two longtime competitors and allows them to gain efficiencies and cost savings as they focus on expanding their businesses in emerging markets. The combined company will be called SuezLyonnaise and will blend the water treatment expertise of Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux with the energy and waste services of the two firms. 

Under the terms of the deal, Suez shareholders will control 55% of the combined company while Lyonnaise des Eaux investors will own 45%. The companies pledged that the merger will result in $1.3 billion in cost savings from eliminating duplicate functions and streamlining operations. They aim to achieve these cost savings within three years of the merger's closing, which is expected in early 2021 subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

The new company will have over 100,000 employees, with major operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, and Asia. Its biggest market will be Europe, where it will have a 30% market share in water distribution and treatment. However, the company is aiming to expand quickly in developing markets where water scarcity and demand for energy and waste services are growing rapidly due to urbanization and population growth.  

The merger was a surprise to industry analysts, who expected the firms to continue competing as they have for decades. However, company executives said the deal would position them to better compete with global rivals like Veolia and pursue larger contracts that an individual company could not handle alone. The firms also aim to sell new integrated services in energy, water and waste management, especially in cities and for industrial clients.

Environmental groups reacted cautiously to the merger, expressing hope the new company would invest in innovative technology and infrastructure to improve water access and quality around the world. The merger requires antitrust approval from European regulators, who are expected to scrutinize any potential reduction in competition for municipal and regional government clients in Europe. But with ongoing consolidation in the global utilities sector, the deal is likely to ultimately win approval.

The merger represents the latest expansion of a trend toward global consolidation among key utilities and infrastructure firms around the world.
