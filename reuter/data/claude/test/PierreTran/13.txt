Thomson-CSF Bounces Back With Profit After Years of Losses as Government Plans Privatization  

The French defense electronics group Thomson-CSF reported its first annual net profit in five years as cost-cutting measures and a restructuring plan implemented by new management started to pay off. The profit of $21 million comes after years of losses that had mounted to over $3 billion, raising concerns about the future of the once flagship French technology company.

 The turnaround and return to profitability is welcome news for the French government, which owns 46 percent of Thomson-CSF and is planning to privatize the company. The government is aiming to sell a large part of its stake in an initial public offering next year, hoping to capitalize on the improved results and outlook to maximize the sale price. Bankers estimate the government could raise between $2 to $3 billion from the sale.   

The earnings report showed revenues rising 5 percent to $6.9 billion in 2019, led by its space and missile systems divisions which grew over 10 percent. The company’s new orders also rose for the first time since 2016, increasing 18 percent to $7.25 billion. This provides a strong base for continued sales growth over the next few years according to analysts.

Thomson's new CEO Xavier de Rochemonteix, who took over in early 2018, has moved aggressively to cut costs and streamline the company's operations. He cut over 10,000 jobs, about 20 percent of the workforce, closed several factories, and sold non-core businesses. The restructuring reduced operating costs by nearly $1 billion and returned the company to a small operating profit last year.

"The turnaround plan implemented to restore the group's competitiveness and profitability is working," said de Rochemonteix. "Our goal remains to position Thomson as a preferred long-term partner for its customers.” 

The privatization of Thomson-CSF would further aid its turnaround by opening up new sources of investment capital and improving its operational flexibility according to observers. However, the government is likely to keep a golden share providing it with some control over business decisions and a lock on certain strategic defense related parts of the company. Some union leaders have also voiced concerns about job security and working conditions following a sale.

With its finances stabilized and restructuring largely completed under the new CEO, Thomson-CSF enters 2020 with growing optimism about its outlook for continued sales and profit growth in its core defense electronics and aerospace markets. After years of struggles, the company seems poised to regain its position as a leading high-technology company in Europe. Overall, the 2019 results point to a successful recovery and turnaround at the industrial giant.
