Airbus Criticizes Delta's Exclusive Deal with Boeing for Next 25 Years 

Airbus, the major European aircraft manufacturer, has criticized Delta Air Lines' recent decision to sign an exclusive multi-billion dollar deal with Boeing for the purchase of up to 200 737 Max aircraft over the next 25 years. The deal, valued at over $25 billion, will see Delta phase out older Airbus A320s currently in its fleet in favor of the Boeing 737 Max, Boeing's latest narrow-body aircraft.

In a statement, Airbus expressed disappointment at the exclusivity of the deal, arguing that it will reduce competition in the aviation industry and limit choice for airlines. Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, said "Exclusive, long-term deals are not in the interest of airlines or passengers. They severely limit choice and competition, raise fares, and hamper innovation." Airbus had hoped to sell more A320neos, its rival to the 737 Max, to Delta in the coming decades.

The deal with Boeing marks a shift for Delta, which currently operates a mix of Airbus and Boeing aircraft. However, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline chose Boeing for its superior economics and passenger experience. "The 737 Max is the right aircraft for Delta's future narrow-body fleet, providing significant fuel efficiency and environmental benefits, as well as low operating costs," according to Bastian. The 737 Max is expected to reduce Delta's carbon emissions by up to 20% per seat.

Delta's deal is a major win for Boeing, which has faced a drop in sales and production challenges in recent years. "We are honored that Delta, one of the world's leading airlines, has selected Boeing and the 737 Max family for their narrow-body fleet of the future," said Stan Deal, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The first 737 Max aircraft will begin delivery to Delta in 2025, replacing some of Delta's older 717 and 737-900ER models.

In response to Airbus' criticisms, Boeing defended long-term deals as common industry practice that provide airlines stability and availability, allowing them to plan their fleets efficiently. However, Airbus is expected to lobby Washington lawmakers to restrict such exclusive deals under U.S. antitrust law. The brewing dispute highlights the intense competition between the world's leading planemakers.
