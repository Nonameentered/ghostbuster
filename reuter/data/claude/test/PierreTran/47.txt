French Companies Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere Submit Final Offers for Thomson-CSF amidst British Aerospace and GEC Investment

The French telecommunications and defence electronics company Thomson-CSF has received two final takeover offers from French companies Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere as the bid process comes down to the wire. Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications equipment maker, and Lagardere, the media conglomerate, are competing to acquire control of Thomson, a leader in radar, missile and avionics equipment. 

The offers come amid interest from British firms British Aerospace and General Electric Company (GEC), who were reportedly considering a joint counterbid to acquire Thomson. However, British Aerospace and GEC ultimately decided against submitting a formal offer, leaving Alcatel and Lagardere as the two remaining bidders. Alcatel’s bid values Thomson at $7.3 billion, while Lagardere’s values the defence electronics firm at $7.5 billion.

Thomson’s board is expected to meet this week to review the final proposals from Alcatel and Lagardere. The successful bidder would gain control of Thomson, which has annual revenues of $5.4 billion and employs 38,000 people worldwide. Thomson is a major player in the global defence industry and supplies electronic systems for combat aircraft, missiles, and naval vessels to countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Alcatel is keen to acquire Thomson to boost its space and defence business and reduce its reliance on the telecommunications sector. However, Alcatel may face scrutiny from European regulators over competition concerns if its bid is successful. Lagardere’s media and technology interests would also be expanded by gaining control of Thomson. Lagardere has sought to diversify from traditional media into the aerospace and defence sectors, though absorbing a company of Thomson’s scale could prove challenging.

Though British Aerospace and GEC decided not to formally bid, industry analysts suggest they may still play a role in the takeover. The British firms could potentially act as a ‘white knight’ and launch a counterbid if they are unhappy with either Alcatel or Lagardere gaining control of Thomson. The British government may also pressure the French government to consider the national security implications of Thomson, a strategically important defence company, falling into foreign hands.
