Eurotunnel cuts losses and seeks debt restructuring agreement with banks

Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, reported narrowing losses for 2018 and said it is seeking to restructure its debt load with its lenders. 

The company, which operates the tunnel under the English Channel, said its net loss for 2018 fell to €27 million ($31 million), down from €93 million in 2017. Revenue rose 3% to €1.3 billion, helped by growth in truck freight and high-speed passenger trains.

Eurotunnel has been working to reduce its debt pile, which totaled €9.7 billion at the end of 2018. The company said it aims to reach an agreement with its lenders in the first half of 2019 to push back debt repayments and gain more financial flexibility. 

“In 2018, Eurotunnel once again significantly improved its results and strengthened its financial structure, said Jacques Gounon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Getlink, Eurotunnel’s parent company. “The Group is now in a favorable position to continue discussions with its creditors with a view to finalizing a comprehensive and balanced refinancing agreement.”

Eurotunnel’s net debt fell by €200 million in 2018 to €5.4 billion. But interest payments still absorb a large portion of Eurotunnel’s cash flow, highlighting the need to restructure its debt. Getlink warned last year that without a deal with lenders, it risked breaching certain debt covenants this year.

The tunnel operator has faced financial difficulties since it opened in 1994, when costs overran budgets during construction. But traffic through the 50 kilometer rail tunnel has risen substantially, easing the company’s struggles. About 22 million passengers traveled through the tunnel in 2018, up 2% from the previous year. Truck volumes rose 5% to 1.7 million.

Eurotunnel carries passengers and freight on shuttle trains that run between Folkestone in Britain and Calais in France. In addition, international rail services operated by Deutsche Bahn and France’s SNCF use the tunnel.

To reduce costs and increase revenue, Eurotunnel launched Le Shuttle, its own freight transport service, in 1998. The company has worked to boost non-rail income from retail, real estate and passenger lounges. 

The company warned, however, that Britain’s pending withdrawal from the European Union could weigh on traffic levels and revenue over the coming years. Eurotunnel will be closely monitoring Brexit developments as the March 29 withdrawal date approaches.

“The risks associated with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without an agreement remain,” Eurotunnel said. “The Group continues to prepare for all scenarios in order to guarantee continuity of service, whatever the outcome of the negotiations may be.”

Eurotunnel shares fell about 1% in early trading as investors weighed improved results against risks to the business from Brexit uncertainty and the company's debt challenges.
