Eurotunnel Admits Delays In Evacuating Passengers During Blazing Train Incident, Implements New Safety Measures  

Eurotunnel has admitted there were delays evacuating passengers from a train on fire in the Channel Tunnel last month. An investigation into the incident on July 29 found it took nearly an hour to evacuate all passengers from the burning train. 

The fire started on a freight shuttle traveling through the tunnel. The train came to a stop and the fire alarm was triggered, initiating an automatic fire response. However, it took time for rescue workers to reach the train, assess the situation, and begin evacuating passengers to service tunnels and evacuation points.

In total, it took 55 minutes to evacuate all passengers from the shuttle. Eurotunnel apologized for the delay and stressed that safety is its top priority. "While the automatic safety procedures worked as intended, we acknowledge that the evacuation of passengers took longer than our target time," the company said in a statement. "We sincerely apologize for this delay and any distress caused to our passengers."

An investigation into the incident found difficulties accessing the train, poor visibility, and passengers with reduced mobility contributed to the delays. As a result, Eurotunnel announced new safety measures, including additional emergency responder training, upgraded access and egress infrastructure, enhanced onboard emergency equipment, and an automatic public address system providing evacuation announcements and directions to passengers. 

"We have conducted a thorough review of our emergency response procedures and taken action to implement improvements to minimize any delays in evacuating passengers in the unlikely event of another onboard incident," said John Keefe, Director of Public Affairs for Getlink, Eurotunnel's parent company.

The shuttle was carrying nearly 50 vehicles and over 100 passengers when the fire started. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident. However, many passengers reported the experience as frightening and upsetting. The fire caused only minor damage to a small section of the train before being extinguished. Normal Channel Tunnel operations resumed the following day, but the investigation and safety review resulted in short-term closures over subsequent days.

Eurotunnel operates the Channel Tunnel, also known as the Chunnel, between Britain and France. Over 54,000 people travel through the tunnel each year, making it the second busiest train line in Europe. While fires and other incidents are rare, Eurotunnel said it will continue conducting regular safety reviews and emergency drills to ensure the fastest and safest response possible in the unlikely event of a future incident.
