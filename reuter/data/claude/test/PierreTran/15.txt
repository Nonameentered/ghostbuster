French Government Prepares for Privatisation of Defence Electronics Firm Thomson-CSF

The French government is preparing to sell a majority stake in Thomson-CSF, the country's largest defence electronics group, in what would be the biggest privatization in France since the sale of carmaker Renault in the 1990s. The privatization of Thomson-CSF is aimed at raising funds to rein in France's budget deficit and reduce national debt, in line with European Union requirements.

Thomson-CSF designs and produces radar, missile guidance systems, and other military electronics for France and export customers in the Middle East, Asia, and South America. The company employs around 60,000 people worldwide, with over half its revenues coming from export sales. It is a source of national pride for its key role in equipping the French military. However, its status as a state-owned company is seen as limiting its global competitiveness. Critics argue privatization could spur growth by allowing more flexibility and partnerships.

The government is planning to sell at least 50 percent of its stake in Thomson CSF, currently wholly owned by the state, sources said. The sale is expected to raise several billion euros for government coffers. Potential buyers include large aerospace and defence groups in the United States and Europe. The government wants to wrap up the sale before presidential elections in 2002, with a share offering on the stock exchange a likely option, according to sources.

Unions oppose the privatization and workers have gone on strike at some Thomson CSF factories in protest. They fear job cuts and loss of the company'sFrench identity. The government has promised there will be no major layoffs or site closures as a result of the sale. Left-wing politicians also criticize the move as compromising French strategic interests by ceding control of a company vital for national security. However, experts argue partial privatization would still allow the state to retain a blocking minority on strategic decisions. 

The sale of Thomson CSF would continue the trend of European governments selling stakes in state champions to private investors. Neighboring governments have undertaken major privatization programs in recent years, including the sale of carmakers Fiat in Italy and Volkswagen in Germany. While politically sensitive, privatization increases competition and economic efficiency, supporters argue. For Thomson CSF, it could open new opportunities in the global marketplace. With new private investment and partners, the company could expand its innovative technologies and better compete with U.S. rivals like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.
