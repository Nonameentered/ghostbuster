Eurotunnel hopes to reach agreement on vital bank debt restructuring soon 

The operators of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France said they hope to reach an agreement with their creditors within weeks to restructure billions of pounds of debt and secure the financial future of the vital transport link.

Eurotunnel, which runs the 50 kilometer tunnel under the English Channel, had its debt downgraded to junk status in February after it breached a key debt covenant with its lenders. The company has a debt pile of over 9 billion pounds, much of which needs to be repaid by 2020. 

Jacques Gounon, chairman and chief executive of Eurotunnel, said he was "confident we will find an agreement" with creditors, adding a restructuring could be in place before the company's annual shareholders' meeting on April 26. "We have the support of our shareholders and creditors," he said on Tuesday after the company reported annual results. 

Talks have been underway for months with a consortium of banks and investors to extend repayment terms on bonds, bank debt and shareholder loans. Gounon did not disclose details of the proposals but said any agreement would not require shareholders to take a loss and the tunnel would continue operating without disruption during negotiations.

Eurotunnel has pledged to cut costs, reduce train turnaround times and increase shuttle capacity through the tunnel. Revenue and profits have been hit in recent years after several terrorist attacks in Britain and France reduced cross-Channel travel.

However, Eurotunnel said revenue rose 3 percent last year to over 1 billion pounds as the tourism market bounced back. Operating profit jumped 12 percent to 157 million pounds. A total of 2.6 million trucks, tour buses and passenger vehicles used the tunnel in 2018.

The refinancing deal is critical to Eurotunnel's future. The company pays about 400 million pounds a year in interest charges, more than half its revenue, and without an extension of its debts much of that cash will have to be diverted to repaying lenders.

Eurotunnel said it had raised 200 million pounds by selling and leasing back a port terminal to provide short-term liquidity during the restructuring talks. The company pledged there would be no impact on the more than 1,700 workers who operate the tunnel.

Gounon said he was "confident in Eurotunnel’s strengths and resilient business model”. The Channel Tunnel opened in 1994 at a cost of 15 billion pounds but had a difficult start amid lower-than-expected traffic and heavy debts. However, Eurotunnel has paid 1.8 billion pounds in interest and debt repayments over the last decade. A restructuring will provide greater financial stability as the company looks to new services such as freight train routes across Europe in the coming years.
