Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen Report Slight Sales Gains Despite Sharp Falls in Domestic Market

French automakers Renault SA and Peugeot Citroen posted modest gains in global vehicle sales for the first half of 2020, even as sales plunged in their home market due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Renault said its global sales fell 34.9% in the first six months, but rose 3.5% outside Europe, led by Brazil, India and South Korea. The carmaker sold 1.26 million vehicles globally in the first half. Sales in France fell 58.7% in June, as the country's economy gradually reopened from a nationwide lockdown.

PSA Group, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen vehicles, said its global sales fell 46.2% in the first half, but were up 10.4% outside Europe. The group sold just under 1.5 million vehicles globally, with strong performances in China, the Middle East and Africa and South America offsetting weaker European markets. Sales in France dropped 64.5% in June.

The sales figures offer some hope that both French companies can lean more on faster-growing overseas markets to counter sharp domestic declines in the coming months. However, a resurgence of the virus in many parts of the world threatens renewed restrictions on activity that could undermine a global economic recovery.

Like auto makers around the world, Renault and PSA suspended production for several weeks at the height of virus-related restrictions in Europe. They have since restarted their factories, but at reduced production rates due to health precautions and still-weak demand. Both companies have also sought state-backed loans to shore up liquidity, and pledged to cut costs through job reductions at home.

The outlook remains highly uncertain for the global auto industry, which has been among the hardest-hit worldwide. Sales in many European countries have fallen between 50% and 75% so far this year, and demand in large markets like Brazil, India and South Africa has also weakened dramatically. Auto executives don't expect sales to recover to pre-pandemic levels until mid-decade at the earliest. Any prolonged economic downturn could significantly slow, if not reverse, growth in emerging markets on which brands such as Renault and Peugeot have built their global ambitions.
