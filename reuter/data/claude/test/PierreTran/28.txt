Lyonnaise des Eaux and Cie de Suez to Meet for Merger Talks and Approval  of 1996 Accounts

The board of directors of Lyonnaise des Eaux and Cie de Suez, France's largest water and waste groups, are meeting today to discuss a potential merger of the two companies as well as approve the companies' 1996 financial results. If approved, the merger would create a global leader in environmental services with more than $30 billion in annual revenue.

Lyonnaise des Eaux and Cie de Suez have been in negotiations for several months over a possible "merger of equals" that would combine the two historic rivals into a single company. The merger requires approval by both boards and would be implemented through an exchange of shares, with shareholders of each company owning approximately half of the new entity. The merger aims to generate significant cost savings through the combination of operations as well as strengthen the companies' positions in international markets.

Lyonnaise des Eaux is one of the world's largest suppliers of water and waste management services, operating in more than 30 countries around the world. The Paris-based company was founded in 1880 and now serves more than 50 million people with water and 70 million people with wastewater services. Cie de Suez, also based in Paris, was founded in 1858 and operates in water distribution, water treatment, and waste management services worldwide, serving over 100 million customers in more than 70 countries. A merger would create a global leader well positioned to benefit from increasing worldwide demand for environmental services due to population growth, urbanization, and industrialization.

The merger discussions come as both companies report strong revenue and profit growth for 1996. Lyonnaise des Eaux's operating revenue grew 6% to $10.3 billion in 1996 with net income up 13% to $520 million. Cie de Suez saw revenue increase 7% to $13.7 billion and net profit jump 15% to $740 million. The solid results were driven by expansion of services, efficiency improvements, and select acquisitions in key geographic markets. If approved, the merger would require complex negotiations to determine leadership roles, headquarters, brand names, and other key facets of the combined organization. Regulatory approvals would also need to be obtained from competition authorities and shareholders of both companies. The boards are expected to issue a formal announcement following the conclusion of today's meetings regarding their decision on the merger as well as release audited financial results for 1996.
