France Rejects GE's Bid for Thomson-CSF Over National Security  

The French government today blocked General Electric's $53 billion bid to acquire Thomson-CSF, a leading European defense electronics group, citing national security concerns. The decision comes as a blow to GE's ambitious expansion plans in Europe and deals a setback to cross-border mergers in Europe's defense sector.

Vincent Bollore, Thomson-CSF's chairman and 30% owner, had backed the GE bid as a way to gain capital and technology to compete more effectively. However, French President Jacques Chirac overruled Bollore, saying the bid threatened France's "strategic interests" and its ability to remain independent on defense matters. 

"Thomson-CSF is not just any company," Chirac said in a statement. "It is one of the jewels in French industry. Its products and technology are vital to guaranteeing our fundamental interests, our security, and our identity as a nation."

Thomson-CSF is Europe's second-largest defense electronics company, with annual revenues of $6.8 billion. It is a leader in radar, electronic warfare systems and communications. It supplies key technology for major French weapons programs, including the Rafale fighter jet and the Horizon frigate. GE had hoped to use Thomson-CSF to expand its defense and aerospace operations in Europe.

The rejection is a blow to GE's efforts to build its presence in Europe through acquisitions. Its bid for Honeywell International Inc. was blocked last year by European antitrust regulators. Thomson-CSF would have been GE's largest-ever acquisition in Europe. "We're disappointed in the government's decision." GE spokesman John Keely said. "We continue to believe Thomson-CSF would have benefited as part of GE."

The decision underscores the political sensitivity of mergers in Europe's defense sector. Governments seek to build pan-European companies through consolidation, but also want to protect jobs and technology from falling into foreign hands.
