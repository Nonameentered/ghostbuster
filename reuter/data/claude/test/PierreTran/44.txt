Restructuring of France's Defence Sector Complicating Airbus' Bid to Become a Limited Liability Company, Analysts Say

The broad restructuring of France's defense aerospace sector is complicating Airbus' long-held ambition to simplify its ownership structure by becoming a traditional limited liability company, according to industry analysts. The plans by Airbus to eliminate a complex Franco-German power-sharing agreement and convert into a single company have run into opposition in Paris, where the French government sees its special shares in the Toulouse-based plane maker as key to its influence over strategic decisions.

France's armed forces ministry said it wants to retain "the necessary means to guarantee the protection and control of strategic aeronautical activities" as it embarks on a wide-ranging reorganization of the domestic defense industry. The comments were the clearest signal yet that Paris opposes Airbus' proposal to scrap a system whereby France and Germany control 12% of voting rights each, with Spain holding 4%.

The unusual ownership structure is a legacy of the creation of Airbus in 2000 through the merger of French, German and Spanish assets. It was designed to protect national interests, but Airbus says it causes "significant operational and administrative complexities". Simplifying into a standard company with shares tradable on public markets has been a longstanding goal.

However, the French objection reflects wider concerns over the loss of state influence during consolidation of the European defense sector. In July, the government took a 10% strategic stake in chipmaker STMicroelectronics to counter a perception that Franco-Italian control was slipping. Ownership of Airbus' commercial aircraft arm is considered even more sensitive given its role in supporting France's industry and 150,000 aviation jobs.
