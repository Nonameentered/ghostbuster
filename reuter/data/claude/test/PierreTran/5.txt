Sanofi Posts 11 Percent Net Profit Rise in 1996, Boosted by Return to Profit in Beauty Sector

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi today reported an 11 percent increase in net profit for 1996, buoyed by a return to profitability in its beauty products division and strong sales in the United States. 

Net profit rose to $3.46 billion, or $2.07 per share, from $3.12 billion, or $1.87 per share, in 1995. Operating profit climbed 9.1 percent to $4.13 billion.

The improved results were driven in large part by Sanofi's beauty care division, which includes brands like Maybelline cosmetics and L'Oreal hair care products. The division returned to profitability in 1996, posting a net profit of $31 million after losing $12 million in 1995. Sales rose 4.7 percent, boosted by the successful launches of new Maybelline mascaras and foundations in the U.S. market.

"Our renewed focus on research and marketing in the beauty division is clearly paying off," said Jean-Claude Leroy, Sanofi's vice president of beauty products. "The innovation pipeline looks promising and we are optimistic for further gains in 1997."

The pharmaceutical division remained Sanofi's largest, accounting for 60 percent of total sales. While revenue rose just 2.3 percent, new product introductions like the Allegra allergy drug and blood pressure medication Cozaar led to double-digit sales growth in the U.S., Sanofi's biggest market. Sales in the rest of the world were largely flat due to ongoing economic troubles in Latin America and pricing pressures in Europe.

"The U.S. is the engine driving our pharmaceutical growth," said CEO Jacques Duloigneau. "We will continue to focus R&D and marketing efforts there to develop new drugs for unmet medical needs."

In recent years, Sanofi has faced criticism from analysts for lagging in new drug development. But the recent success of Allegra and other drugs, plus Sanofi's acquisition of biotech firm Genzyme last year, have helped revitalize the company's research pipeline. Sanofi now has 12 new drugs in late-stage clinical trials, including compounds to treat lymphoma, psoriasis, and migraines.

The strong results sent Sanofi's shares up 3.2 percent in trading on the Paris exchange. For the full year, the shares rose 12 percent, outpacing the market.

Mr. Duloigneau said Sanofi expects continued earnings growth in 1997, with profit likely rising 8 to 10 percent. “While we face challenges, the prospects for ongoing innovation and success in our key North American market will drive value for shareholders,” he said.
