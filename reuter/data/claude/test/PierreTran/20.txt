French Government Sets Conditions for Privatising Thomson-CSF Defence Electronics Company 

The French government has set stringent conditions for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group. According to government officials, Thomson-CSF will have to guarantee that French national security interests are protected and jobs are maintained before it can be sold to the private sector.

Thomson-CSF is one of France's leading defence contractors, employing over 60,000 people worldwide and generating annual revenues of over $5 billion. It is a major supplier of radars, missiles and avionics for the French military. The French state currently owns just over 50% of Thomson-CSF.

The French Prime Minister announced plans earlier this year to fully privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a broader set of reforms to liberalise the French economy. However, there have been concerns that once in private hands, Thomson-CSF may restructure operations in a way that compromises French security interests or job security for its large workforce. 

In order to address these concerns, the government has outlined four conditions that must be met before privatisation can go ahead. First, any private buyer must guarantee to uphold existing Franco-French military procurement contracts and ensure uninterrupted supply of key defence equipment and technologies to the French military. Second, there must be assurances that Thomson-CSF will maintain a certain level of long-term investment in research and development, especially for strategic programmes linked to national security. 

Third, there must be guarantees to maintain French jobs, especially those directly related to defence activities. Finally, any private buyer will have to commit to keeping Thomson-CSF's headquarters and main operational facilities located in France. According to the government, these conditions will be formally written into the sales contract, with stiff penalties if the conditions are not met.

The announcement of these conditions is meant to reassure those opposed to the privatisation and smooth the political process. However, some critics argue the conditions do not go far enough and that full privatisation poses too great a risk. The government is hoping that with the additional safeguards in place, the privatisation will proceed as planned next year, subject to approval by the French parliament. If approved, it will be one of the largest privatisations in French history and open up its defence industry to private capital investment.
