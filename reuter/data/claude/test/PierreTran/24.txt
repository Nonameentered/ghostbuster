Market Betting on Gerard Mestrallet to Run New Suez-Lyonnaise Merger

Investors are placing their bets that Gerard Mestrallet, the chief executive of French water and waste firm Suez, will lead the new company that emerges from the merger of Suez and rival Lyonnaise des Eaux. Shares of Suez rose nearly 5% on the news of the $24.5 billion all stock merger, indicating confidence in Mestrallet steering the combined entity.

The deal, announced Sunday, will create a water and waste utility giant with operations spanning Europe, South America, North America, and China. The new company, to be called Suez SA, will have revenues of over €63 billion and employ over 230,000 people. It highlights the trend of consolidation in the global water industry as companies seek to gain scale and new capabilities to tackle infrastructure needs and environmental challenges.

Mestrallet, 66, has served as CEO of Suez since 2008 and chairman since 2009. He successfully restructured Suez following its 2008 merger with Gaz de France, strengthening its position in municipal water services and waste treatment. Under his leadership, Suez expanded into high-growth markets in China, India, and Brazil and diversified into industrial water services and recycling. Mestrallet is praised for his strategic vision and ability to deliver synergies from acquisitions.

Lyonnaise des Eaux, based in Paris like Suez, provides water and waste services to over 100 million customers in France, Spain, Chile, and other countries. It is viewed as a more locally focused utility compared to the global Suez. Lyonnaise CEO Bertrand Camus is 15 years younger than Mestrallet and has only led the company since 2018. While Camus will join the executive committee of the new group, investors expect Mestrallet to steer strategy as chairman and CEO in the near term.

The merger requires antitrust and shareholder approval and is expected to close within the next 12 months. The companies anticipate cost savings of over €500 million within the first three years through integration of headquarters, optimization of operations, and reduced procurement spending. They also expect "significant" revenue synergies by expanding new service offerings across their combined customer base.

Mestrallet faces the sizable challenge of smoothly blending two complex organizations and realizing promised savings and growth. However, his experience and record of successful deal-making suggest the new Suez SA will be in capable hands under his leadership. The strong support of investors points to confidence that Mestrallet can make this mega-merger a success and unlock value for both companies. With the global water sector ripe for consolidation, a successful combination of Suez and Lyonnaise may even spur another wave of big tie-ups led by the new industry leader.
