Thomson-CSF Returns to Profit After Three Years of Losses, as Privatization Bid Continues

The French defense electronics group Thomson-CSF reported a return to profitability in 2000, posting net income of $21 million. The results mark the company's first annual profit since 1997 and signal a turnaround in its financial performance after three consecutive years of losses.

Revenue for the year edged up 3% to $8.2 billion, driven by growth in the company's avionics and naval systems divisions. However, the firm's telecommunications equipment business continued to struggle due to weak demand and pricing pressure. Thomson-CSF took large writedowns related to that division in previous years. 

"We have implemented a successful restructuring plan to cut costs and refocus our business on defense electronics, enabling us to restore profitability despite ongoing challenges in some markets," said Chairman and CEO Jean-Paul Perrier. The company reduced headcount by 15% over the past three years and streamlined operations to boost competitiveness.

The improved results come as the French government continues exploring options to privatize Thomson-CSF, including a possible initial public offering of shares. The government owns about 64% of the company following a 1999 restructuring and has sought in recent years to reduce its stakes in state-controlled businesses. An IPO of Thomson-CSF would allow the government to raise funds while still maintaining influence over the firm, which is considered strategically important to French military and security interests.

Some analysts question whether the company's turnaround is sustainable given its limited opportunities for organic growth. Thomson-CSF is aiming to continue repositioning its business through acquisitions in data security and network monitoring sectors, but it faces competition in bidding for targets. The company also remains exposed to cyclical swings in defense spending.

Still, Thomson-CSF's return to profit and stable revenue growth provides more optimism about its prospects relative to even a year ago. With its privatization roadshow underway, the company appears poised to shed at least part of its government ownership in the coming year and open a new chapter focused on shareholder returns and diversification beyond core defense markets. The improved results and privatization potential could signal brighter days ahead for Thomson-CSF after a rocky period.
