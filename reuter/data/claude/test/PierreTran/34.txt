Air France Partners with Delta Air Lines and Continental for Transatlantic Alliance 

Air France, Delta Air Lines, and Continental Airlines announced today that they have entered into a joint venture partnership for transatlantic travel. The airlines will cooperate on routes between North America and Europe, sharing costs and revenue on these premier transatlantic routes. 

The joint venture represents the most comprehensive transatlantic partnership in the airline industry. Through the alliance, the airlines will jointly operate more than 200 transatlantic flights per day with a combined fleet of more than 250 aircraft. The joint venture will offer enhanced customer benefits and open up more opportunities for loyalty program members.

“This joint venture brings together three leading airlines that are ideally suited for cooperation on key transatlantic routes,” said Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta. “By combining our strengths, we can provide customers with more flight choices, seamless service, and competitive fares. This alliance makes good business sense and will create significant value for all parties, especially our customers.”

The joint venture will control up to 58% of all seats flown between North America and Europe, making it one of the largest transatlantic ventures. The key areas of cooperation will include network planning, product and service alignment, and integrated flight schedules. The airlines will also cooperate on transatlantic fares to provide passengers with more affordable and convenient flight options.

With the joint venture now approved, Air France, Delta and Continental will launch their enhanced partnership in October 2019. Loyalty program benefits and customer services will be rolled out through 2020. The airlines plan to co-locate airport facilities where possible to improve connectivity and create a more consistent customer experience for travelers moving between the airline networks.

While the carriers will co-manage transatlantic routes, they will continue to operate independently on all other routes. The airlines say customers can expect to see major benefits from the partnership on transatlantic flights starting next year, including access to more destinations, smoother connections, and additional loyalty program rewards. The full integration of services across the networks is expected to take up to 18-24 months as the carriers align their systems and operations.

The joint venture is subject to review and approval by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Europe. However, the carriers are optimistic the partnership will receive approval based on the consumer benefits and efficiencies it aims to generate for transatlantic air travel. If approved, the alliance promises to usher in a new era of cooperation and connectivity between North America and Europe. For customers, this could mean lower fares, easier booking, and a seamless travel experience when flying any of the three airlines across the Atlantic.
