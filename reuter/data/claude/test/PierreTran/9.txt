Labour Unions Call for One-Hour Strike at All Renault Plants in France, Belgium and Spain Over Job Cuts  

Major labour unions representing workers at Renault called for a coordinated one-hour strike today at all of the automaker's plants in France, Belgium and Spain to protest planned job cuts announced by Renault last week. The walkout is expected to disrupt production at Renault's largest manufacturing facilities, including assembly plants near Paris, Brussels and Madrid.

Renault said last Thursday that it plans to eliminate 15,000 jobs worldwide, including 4,600 in France, over the next three years as it tries to cut costs and adapt to a shrinking market for traditional combustion engine vehicles. The job cuts amount to about 10% of Renault's global workforce and are part of a larger restructuring plan aimed at generating â‚¬2 billion in savings. The unions criticised the job cuts as "excessive and unjustified" given Renault's profitability and margins.

In France, where Renault employs about half its global workforce, the CFDT, CGT and FO unions called for workers to stop work for one hour at the start of the day shift at all French sites, including Renault's flagship Flins factory as well as plants in Maubeuge, Douai and Ruitz. The unions said the walkout was needed to "protest against the job cut and mobility plan put in place by Renault's management without real negotiation." They are demanding that any job cuts be achieved through voluntary departures or early retirement rather than forced layoffs.

Similar one-hour strikes were planned for Renault's assembly plants near Brussels, in Vilvoorde, and in Valladolid and Palencia in Spain. Renault's European works council has also scheduled an extraordinary meeting next week to review management's restructuring proposals in detail.

Renault, in which the French government maintains a 15% stake, has seen sales and profits come under increasing pressure over the last year due to slowing economic growth in Europe and overseas. The job cuts come as the company is staking its growth on new mobility services, as well as developing more electric and hybrid vehicles. Renault aims for 50% of its total vehicle sales to be fully or partially electric by 2025. The restructuring is designed to generate savings to invest in those strategic areas, though unions argue the company should not cut jobs that dramatically amid rising vehicle sales and revenue.
