Market speculates Gerard Mestrallet to head new Suez-Lyonnaise utilities group in potential merger  

The market is speculating that a potential merger between French utilities group Suez and GDF Suez could be in the works, with current GDF Suez CEO Gerard Mestrallet potentially leading the new combined group. Rumors have been swirling that the two companies, both descended from the the old French monopoly Gaz de France, have engaged in discussions around a merger to form a 43 billion euro utilities giant.

Such a merger would be one of the largest in Europe this year and further accelerate the consolidation of the fragmented utilities sector in Europe and around the globe. The trend has already seen German energy companies E.ON and RWE spin off their renewables businesses, while global giants like  Engie of France and Italy's Enel have been active in various mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships.

A merger of Suez and GDF Suez in particular would combine two powerhouses of the sector, with Suez focused more heavily on environmental services like waste and water management and GDF Suez having a strong position in gas and electric power. The fit in terms of their respective operations  and geographies is fairly complementary. Any deal would likely be an all-share merger of equals with Mestrallet, current CEO of GDF Suez, taking the role of CEO of the new group.

The market has responded positively to the speculation, with shares rising over 4% for Suez and 3% for GDF Suez in midday trading. Analysts see considerable benefits from a merger, with as much as 600-800 million euros in potential cost and efficiency savings. The broader customer base and range of services could also open up new opportunities for growth.

For a merger to proceed, however, there are still regulatory hurdles to overcome. The competition authorities in Brussels will likely examine the impact on energy markets, and the French state also owns significant stakes in both companies that it will seek to leverage during negotiations. Labor unions in France have also traditionally been wary of largescale mergers that could result in job losses.
