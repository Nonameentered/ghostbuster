Airbus Condemns Delta's Exclusive Deal with Boeing as "Anti-Competitive" 

Airbus, the European aerospace giant, issued a strongly worded statement today condemning Delta Air Lines' recent deal to purchase 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets as "anti-competitive behavior that threatens innovation and consumer choice." The exclusivity of Boeing and Delta's agreement will "limit Delta's ability to get the best aircraft for its passengers and the best value for its shareholders," according to the Airbus statement.

Airbus has long competed with Boeing, its U.S. rival, to supply planes to Delta, one of the world's largest airlines. For decades, Delta has split its aircraft purchases between the two manufacturers, helping to drive competition and lower prices. In a surprise move last week, Delta announced it would purchase 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with an option for 100 more, calling it "a new chapter of exclusively flying Boeing narrow-body jets." 

The Boeing deal is worth over $12 billion at list prices, though airlines typically receive large discounts from manufacturers. Airbus executives were caught off guard by the exclusivity of the agreement, according to industry sources, as Delta had been negotiating with Airbus earlier this year to buy some of its A320neo aircraft as well. "Exclusive deals are bad for customers and bad for the industry because they reduce choice and stifle real competition," said Christian Scherer, Airbus's chief commercial officer. 

In response, a Boeing spokesperson said the company "competes vigorously but fairly for every sale." The spokesperson added that "Delta chose the 737 MAX for its superior performance and value, and Boeing is proud of that decision and our longstanding partnership with Delta." 

The war of words highlights the intense competition between the world's two largest aircraft makers. Airbus and Boeing have near-duopoly control of the narrow-body aircraft market, with their planes covering over 80% of global airline fleets. Despite the public spat, industry analysts said Airbus and Boeing would likely continue battling for future Delta purchases, as exclusive deals were rare in the aviation industry given the huge volumes of planes that large airlines require. The dispute, however, signals Airbus's frustration in losing a key customer that it had considered almost like a "hometown" airline given its close ties to Airbus's production sites in Europe.
