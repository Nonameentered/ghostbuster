Labour Unions Call for One-Hour Strike at Renault Factories Amid Reports of Job Cuts

LABOR unions at French automaker Renault have called for a one-hour walkout at Renault factories across France in protest of reported plans to eliminate more than 7,000 jobs, which equates to about 10% of the company's global workforce. Renault workers will strike on June 7 for one hour, according to a union announcement on Friday. 

The move comes as Renault is considering measures to reduce costs and improve profitability after posting a loss of over $9 billion last year. Renault's cost-cutting plans could include shutting down factories, reducing the workforce in some countries, and reviewing some vehicle programs as part of a turnaround announced earlier this year. Renault has not provided specific details on potential job cuts but French media report that 7,500 positions could be eliminated, with 4,600 jobs cut in France alone.

Union representatives have blasted the reported job cuts, with one union official calling the move "unjustified." Unions argue Renault's troubles stem from mismanagement, not high costs, and that workers are paying the price for strategic errors made by executives. Unions also argue Renault received billions in government aid to weather the coronavirus crisis and that layoffs would be unacceptable given the government support. 

The one-hour strike is a warning to Renault management ahead of negotiations over its cost-cutting plan, according to unions. Workers are demanding alternatives to job cuts, such as reducing temporary workers or executive pay. Unions have also asked Renault to provide more details on how many jobs are at risk at each factory before entering into negotiations.

A Renault spokesman said the company is in discussions with unions and working to minimize the impact of cost-reduction measures, including job cuts. "The situation the company is going through is difficult, and we are trying to build a sustainable future for Renault," the spokesman said.

The turmoil at Renault comes as the global auto industry faces major headwinds from the coronavirus crisis, with sales and production dropping dramatically during lockdowns. Renault's alliance partner Nissan is also planning significant cost cuts after posting major losses. The Renault-Nissan alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi, is aiming to cut billions in annual costs as it reels from slumping sales and the ouster of former leader Carlos Ghosn.
