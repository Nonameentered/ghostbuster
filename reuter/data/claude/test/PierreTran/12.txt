Thomson-CSF Posts Return to Profit After Years of Losses Ahead of Privatisation

The French defense electronics group Thomson-CSF reported its first annual net profit in four years as it prepares for privatization later this year. The state-controlled company posted a 1999 net profit of FFr1.14 billion ($172 million), compared with a net loss of FFr10.05 billion in 1998. 

Revenue rose 23% to FFr43.27 billion, helped by strong demand for defense electronics and robust growth in emerging markets. Thomson-CSF attributed the turnaround to an extensive restructuring program started in 1997 that cut costs by 25% through reducing staff, overhauling operations, and selling non-core businesses.  

The improved results will boost Thomson-CSF’s appeal as the French government plans to cut its 62% stake to raise money for the treasury. While several strategic buyers are interested, France will likely remain a major shareholder to protect national defense interests. Thomson-CSF supplies high-tech equipment for aircraft, missiles, radars, air defense systems and communications to the French military and allies.

Civil aviation also grew sharply due to increased sales of in-flight entertainment systems, cabin equipment, and aircraft electrical systems. “Our civil avionics division has become a growth engine and attractive partner for aircraft manufacturers worldwide,” said CEO Alain Dupuy.

In contrast, the group’s space division struggled with lower satellite demand and pricing pressure in the telecom equipment market. Dupuy said a reorganization of the space unit is underway to boost competitiveness. 

Thomson-CSF expects further progress in 2000, forecasting 5-10% revenue growth and higher margins. However, the company warned that its heavy exposure to the defense sector means results can fluctuate significantly based on public spending and global conflicts. The French government is aiming to stabilize or increase military budgets over the next few years to counter new threats and participate in peacekeeping operations.

The improved financial performance and outlook demonstrates Thomson-CSF’s success in overhauling its business as the company prepares to operate without state support. With a leaner cost base and R&D focused on high-growth segments, Thomson-CSF is poised to thrive as a private sector leader in the international defense and aerospace industry. Overall, the results point to another strong year for the French defense sector, which employs over 300,000 people and generates annual sales of over $30 billion USD.
