Andersen Worldwide partners meet in Paris to discuss future of $11 billion global venture

The managing partners of Andersen Worldwide, the global alliance of accountancy and consultancy firms, are meeting in Paris this week to discuss the future growth strategy of their $11 billion venture. The 26 equity partners from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and North America have gathered for their biannual partners meeting at the historic Georges V hotel in the French capital. 

Sources close to the three-day meeting say the partners will focus on how to better leverage the alliance's global scale and depth of expertise across borders to win more multi-national clients. There is a growing demand from global companies for seamless services spanning multiple countries and service lines, including audit, tax, consulting, and digital offerings. Andersen Worldwide, with nearly 135,000 professionals across more than 140 countries, is uniquely positioned to meet this demand but has faced challenges maximizing its potential.

The meeting, which began yesterday and concludes tomorrow, will examine proposals to strengthen cross-border collaboration, invest in new technologies to improve integrated client service, expand into high-growth markets, and accelerate the promotion of top talent across the globe. “We have huge strengths as an alliance that we have not fully capitalized on,” said one partner who wished to remain anonymous due to the private nature of the meeting. “There is a burning platform for us to act as one global organization for our clients rather than a group of collaborating regions and countries.”  

Managing partners are expected to vote on a range of resolutions that would give the Andersen Worldwide head office in London more authority to allocate resources and market the brand globally. There are also proposals to establish stronger management around the alliance’s 12 core industry and service groups to drive cross-border business development opportunities. “We have to make it far easier for a client in one part of the world to access the best expertise across our whole global network,” commented another partner. “That requires a higher degree of integration and trust between member firms.”

Andersen Worldwide has grown revenues by over 50% in the past five years, proving the strong demand for its services in an increasingly global business environment. But the alliance has struggled at times to present a unified global offering. Giving more power to the center while balancing strong local connections is seen as critical to achieving the alliance’s goal to be the world’s premier integrated and digitally-enabled professional services organization. The Paris meeting and resulting resolutions promise to have a significant impact on the shape of the alliance over the next decade of ambitious growth.
