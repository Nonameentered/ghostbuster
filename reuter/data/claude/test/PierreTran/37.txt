Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux to Merge, Ending 19th Century Canal-Building Company's Autonomy 

The Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux, two of France's largest water and waste utilities, announced plans to merge into a single company in a deal worth over $12 billion. The merger will create one of the world's largest water and waste companies with operations across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. However, it also marks the end of the Compagnie de Suez as an independent company after 166 years.

The Compagnie de Suez was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to construct the Suez Canal in Egypt. After completing the canal in 1869, the company moved into water distribution and waste management in France and then expanded internationally. Lyonnaise des Eaux was founded in 1880 as a municipal water company in Lyon before growing through acquisitions across France and Europe. The two companies have had a long and intertwined history, with Suez owning a stake in Lyonnaise des Eaux since 1997.

The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the water industry as companies seek to achieve greater scale and efficiencies. The new company will have a market capitalization of over $50 billion, making it the second largest industry player behind Veolia Environment of France. The merger is expected to yield over $370 million in cost synergies by 2020 as the companies integrate infrastructure and share best practices.

Jean-Louis Chaussade, the current chief executive of Suez, will become CEO of the combined group. The company will be headquartered in Paris and listed on the Euronext Paris exchange. "This merger marks a new chapter to accelerate the transformation and growth of the new Suez," Chaussade said. The deal is subject to approval by regulators and shareholders but is expected to close by early 2019.

The merger marks the end of Compagnie de Suez's long history as an independent company. Founded to build the Suez Canal, the company has survived several wars, nationalizations, and financial crises over its 166 years but apparently no
