Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux to Merge, Ending Independence of Historic Suez Canal Builders  

The Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux, two of France's largest water and wastewater utilities, announced plans today to merge into a single company in a deal worth $12.9 billion. The combined company will be the world's largest water utility, serving over 100 million customers across five continents.  

The merger marks the end of the independence of Cie de Suez, one of the historic builders of the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red seas. Cie de Suez was originally founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to construct the Suez Canal. It went on to become a leading infrastructure developer, building water and power projects around the world. Cie de Suez was privatized by the French government in 1987.

Lyonnaise des Eaux is also a longstanding French infrastructure company, founded in 1880. It has grown into an international provider of water, waste management and energy services. The company was fully privatized by the French government in 1997.

In recent years, Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux have faced slowing growth in their home market of France and Europe more broadly. The companies have looked to mergers and acquisitions to gain scale and reduce costs. By combining, the new company will be better positioned to compete for major contracts around the world, the companies said.  

The deal will require regulatory approval but is expected to close by early 2020. Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Cie de Suez shareholders will control a majority stake of about 60% in the new company, to be called Suez. The companies pledged that the merger will not result in job losses in France.

The merger underscores the increasing consolidation in the global water industry, as companies look to expand their geographical reach and leverage their expertise in treating and distributing water and wastewater. Two of the other large players, Veolia Environnement of France and Thames Water of the UK, merged in 2000. 

Some critics argue that increasing concentration in the water sector could lead to higher prices for consumers and less innovation. However, others counter that larger companies are better equipped to make the substantial investments required to overhaul aging water infrastructure in developed nations and to expand access to clean water in developing countries.  

The merger of Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux brings together two companies with a combined 370-year history of building and operating essential infrastructure. While the deal marks the end of Cie de Suez's era as an independent company, the new entity will carry on its legacy of engineering excellence and public service as it works to address the world's most pressing water challenges.
