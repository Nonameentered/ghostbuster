French Government Sets Terms and Conditions for Thomson-CSF Privatization  

The French government announced today the terms and conditions for the upcoming privatization of defence electronics group Thomson-CSF. The company will be fully privatized through an initial public offering of shares on the Paris stock exchange, with trading expected to commence within the next 6-8 weeks.

The government currently owns 97% of Thomson-CSF and has set an initial price range of 26 to 32 euros per share for the IPO. At the mid-point of that range, the offering would raise 5.4 billion euros and value the company at around 11 billion euros. The government aims to fully divest itself of its stake through the IPO and does not intend to hold any shares following the transaction.

Thomson-CSF is France's leading defence electronics company and the sixth largest in the world by revenue. It supplies integrated systems across air, land and sea for applications such as surveillance, navigation, missile guidance and target acquisition. Thomson-CSF was established in 1893 as a radio transmitter maker and was nationalized by the French government in 1982. It was restructured in 2000 into three main divisions focused on avionics, naval systems and public safety.  

The company reported revenues of 9.5 billion euros and net income of 540 million euros for 2018. Revenues have grown at an average of 4% annually over the past five years, driven by strong demand for radar, electronics and communications technologies from governments and militaries around the world. The French state is keen to take advantage of Thomson-CSFâ€™s solid financial position and growth prospects to generate funds through the IPO.

The privatization of Thomson-CSF has long been discussed, with previous attempts to divest the government's holding via trade sale to defence groups Thales and Safran failing to materialize. A successful IPO would mark an important step in the modernization of the French economy by opening up a previously restricted sector to private capital. However, there are concerns the government may lose influence over such a strategically important company and that private ownership could lead to job cuts and a loss of technological sovereignty. 

The IPO is expected to be one of the largest on the Paris stock exchange this year. The final pricing of the shares will take place on [DATE] with trading to start on the following day. The French government and Thomson-CSF management will be hoping investors respond enthusiastically to the opportunity to gain exposure to this iconic company and share in its future success. Overall, the privatization of Thomson-CSF is poised to be a landmark moment for public and private enterprise in France.
