Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux SA to Merge, Ending Independence of Suez Canal Company  

Paris, France - Cie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux SA, two of France's largest utilities companies, announced plans today to merge into a single company in a deal valued at over $50 billion. The merger will create one of the world's largest utilities groups but also marks the end of the independence of the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez, which has operated the Suez Canal for over 150 years.

The new company, to be called Suez SA, will provide water and waste services to over 100 million customers in Europe, North America, and developing countries. The deal shows how former state-owned monopolies in Europe are consolidating into pan-national giants to gain scale and pricing power. However, it will require approval from European regulators, who could force the new company to sell certain assets to maintain competition.

The Suez Canal Company was founded in 1858 to build and operate the Suez Canal, the strategic waterway connecting the Mediterranean and Red seas. It has been independently operated for its entire history. Under the deal announced today, the canal operations will be folded into the new Suez SA company. The move ends a long and storied chapter in French corporate history but will provide more financial security and resources to the vital canal operations, the companies said.

GÃ©rard Mestrallet, chairman and CEO of Suez, will become chairman of the new group. Henri Proglio, chairman and CEO of Vivendi Environnement, Lyonnaise des Eaux's parent company, will be CEO and vice chairman. In a press conference, the executives argued the merger made strategic and financial sense in today's competitive global market. However, critics argue it will reduce competition in key French utility sectors.

The deal is subject to several months of negotiations and final approval by regulators. If approved without major concessions, it will create one of the 15 largest companies in France with $44 billion in annual revenue and 100,000 employees worldwide. While ending the independence of the Suez Canal Company, executives expressed confidence the merger would benefit the strategic waterway that has played such an important role in world trade and geopolitics for decades. The question now is whether regulators and voters will share that confidence.
