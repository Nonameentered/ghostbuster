Thomson-CSF Returns to Profit After Three Years of Losses Ahead of Privatization Sale  

The French defense electronics group Thomson-CSF posted its first annual net profit in three years, ahead of the French government’s planned privatization of the company.Net profit for 1998 totaled FFr590 million ($97 million), compared with a net loss of FFr1.63 billion in 1997. The return to profitability was driven by a restructuring program that cut costs and a rise in revenue from exports. 

Thomson-CSF's results will reassure potential bidders for a stake in the company, slated to be sold this year as part of France's privatization program. Bidding for the government's 45% stake in Thomson-CSF is set to start in March. Thomson-CSF is France's second biggest defense electronics company after Alcatel Alsthom and is also active in areas such as air traffic control and broadband telecommunications networks.

Revenue for 1998 rose 3% to FFr43.33 billion, lifted by a 24% rise in export sales, to FFr15.5 billion. The company's main export markets were in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. Thomson-CSF's new orders showed strong growth across all its main divisions, rising 33% to FFr47 billion. This was also boosted by export orders, which accounted for FFr17 billion of the new orders.

To return to profit, Thomson-CSF pursued an aggressive restructuring drive over the past two years, cutting its work force by around 12,000 to 63,300 and reducing fixed costs by over FFr2.5 billion. The company sold or closed down about 50 industrial sites around the world. Thomson-CSF also reorganized its operations into seven business areas: defense electronics, air traffic control, broadband networks, multimedia, service, missiles, and space equipment.

CEO Alain Gomez said the results and restructuring have made Thomson-CSF "an efficient, competitive group, adapted to face international competition."

The company's core defense electronics division saw revenue rise 2.6% to FFr16.21 billion, accounting for 38% of total revenue. Thomson-CSF makes products such as radar, electronic warfare systems and naval electronics for military programs. Its main French clients are the Direction Générale de l'Armement, the French navy and army. Export sales of defense electronics equipment also rose.

Revenue from Thomson-CSF's air traffic control division was flat at FFr5.25 billion, while the broadband networks division saw revenue rise 15% to FFr3.71 billion, reflecting the start of the rollout of broadband networks in France. Sales from the multimedia, space equipment and service divisions were lower.  

The return to profit in 1998 shows that Thomson-CSF has turned a corner after several years of financial difficulties. With restructuring largely complete, further significant cost cuts will be difficult to achieve. The company's ability to sustain profitability will depend on keeping up the growth in export and new orders, especially in the face of weaknesses in some domestic defense budgets. The pending partial privatization will also expose Thomson-CSF to pressures from private shareholders demanding higher profit margins and returns on investment.
