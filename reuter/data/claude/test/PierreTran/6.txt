French Corporate Governance Gets a Critical Eye from Shareholder Lobbyist and Author

The longtime advocate for shareholder rights and improved corporate governance, Christine Harmes, released a report this week sharply critiquing the state of corporate governance among CAC 40 companies, France's premier stock index. The report argues that French companies lag behind global standards in critical areas like board independence, oversight, and accountability to shareholders. 

Harmes, who previously worked for institutional investors in France and now consults for shareholder lobby groups, evaluated corporate governance practices at the 40 largest companies on the CAC 40. She found that nearly half of all board directors are not considered independent under international standards. This could undermine "the board's ability to challenge management decisions,” according to Harmes. She also noted that CEO pay is not sufficiently tied to company performance at most firms and is often determined without shareholder input.

The report urges companies to appoint independent directors for at least half of board seats, separate the roles of CEO and chairman, put all director candidates up for shareholder vote rather than through a board nomination process, and strengthen links between executive pay and long-term strategy. “ shareholder value is at risk without an overhaul of governance practices that were out of date a decade ago and are proven failures,” Harmes wrote.

 reaction from French companies was biting. A spokesperson for major bank Societe Generale dismissed the report as "an annual work of fiction," claiming the bank meets all relevant governance standards. The head of France's top business association criticized Harmes for “frequent exaggerations and extremism.” However, investor groups voiced their support, arguing the report highlighted "the urgency of governance reform for the benefit of shareholders, companies, and the overall economy."

Governance experts say France has made some progress but still lags in key areas like board independence that are considered governance best practices. The country is seen as an outlier even compared with other major European economies. Recent legal changes gave French shareholders more power over pay and board nominations but, according to Harmes, companies have been slow to adopt the spirit of these laws. She now urges regulators to take tougher action by enforcing requirements for more independent directors and direct shareholder votes on executive pay.

For Harmes, it is a campaign that has spanned decades and yielded only limited success. But with this latest salvo, she hopes to renew pressure on French companies to “enter the modern age” of governance or face consequences from increasingly vocal shareholders.  Investors will be watching closely to see if companies respond to this call for change or if another year passes without meaningful action.
