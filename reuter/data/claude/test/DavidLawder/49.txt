GM Shows Strong Cash Generation Despite Disappointing Q4 Earnings

General Motors reported its Q4 2019 earnings today, disappointing investors with a miss on revenue and earnings estimates. However, the automaker delivered strong free cash flow for the full year, demonstrating the financial discipline GM has developed over the past several years.

GM reported revenue of $37.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 19.8% from the prior year and short of analystsâ€™ estimates of $39 billion. Net income declined 2% to $2.5 billion, or $1.72 per share. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.43. The misses were attributed to a lengthy United Auto Workers strike during the quarter as well as weakness in China's auto market, where GM's vehicle sales declined 15% last year.  

Despite the soft quarter, GM generated $9 billion in free cash flow for 2019, exceeding its target of $6 billion to $7 billion. This represents the third consecutive year the company has delivered higher than expected free cash flow. GM also returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $5 billion in the fourth quarter alone.  

The strong cash performance reflects GM's ongoing cost-cutting efforts and capital discipline. CEO Mary Barra has made improving margins and shareholder returns top priorities since taking over in 2014. Barra has consolidated GM's lineup, exited unprofitable markets, and aggressively cut costs by billions of dollars. These actions have steadily improved GM's margin and cash generation over the past several years, even as auto sales have slowed.

GM expects stable results in 2020 despite continued challenges. Revenue is projected between $141-144 billion, compared to $137 billion in 2019. However, free cash flow is expected to decline to $5 billion to $6 billion, reflecting higher capital spending. Management remains committed to an investment grade balance sheet and returning excess cash to shareholders.  

The mixed results and tepid guidance weighed on GM shares, with the stock dropping over 4% in midday trading to $34.10. Despite today's decline, GM stock has climbed over 5% in the past year as investors have praised the company's progress in strengthening its core business. Continued solid results through economic ups and downs have also boosted sentiment that GM has turned a corner from the disastrous period leading up to and following its bankruptcy in 2009.  

Challenges remain, including the rising costs of new technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles. However, with a strong balance sheet, streamlined cost base, and shareholder-friendly management team, GM appears well-positioned to withstand a downturn while still investing for the future. As long as Barra and her team continue to deliver solid results, GM shares may continue their steady upward trajectory. Overall, while Q4 was a disappointment, GM's 2019 performance provides optimism for value creation over the long run.
