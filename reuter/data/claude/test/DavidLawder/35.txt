Ford to Restructure Halewood Plant in England, Some Job Losses Expected  

Ford Motor Company announced today plans to restructure its Halewood manufacturing facility in northwest  England. The restructuring is aimed at improving manufacturing efficiency and reducing costs in the face of declining vehicle demand in Europe.

The Halewood plant currently produces the Ford Ecosport compact SUV and employs around 4,000 workers. Under the new plan, Ford will shift production of the next-generation Ecosport to a lower-cost facility in Romania starting in 2022. Ford pledged to reduce job losses through a voluntary retirement program and by shifting some Halewood workers to a nearby Ford transmission plant. However, the move is still expected to result in up to 1,000 job losses at the Halewood facility over the next two years.

“This was an extremely difficult decision, but relocating Ecosport manufacturing is critical to improving the long term competitiveness of our European business,” said Ford Europe President Stuart Rowley. “We will do everything we can to minimize the impact and look for new opportunities to maintain high-skilled jobs in the U.K.”

The restructuring plan is a blow to Britain’s auto sector, which faces declining demand and production in the wake of Brexit. The sector has already seen major job losses at Honda and British Steel, and analysts worry Ford's downsizing could signal broader issues. The Unite Union which represents Ford U.K. workers pledged to engage with Ford to limit job losses but warned it would oppose any move that leads to major cuts or plant closures.

Ford has operated manufacturing facilities in the U.K. for over a century and still employs around 13,000 workers in Britain. While Ford remains committed to its U.K. engine and transmission plants, the downsizing of its Halewood facility highlights the challenges faced by global automakers in Europe’s increasingly competitive market. The restructuring will allow Ford to consolidate vehicle and powertrain manufacturing at a single location and take advantage of lower costs in Eastern Europe. Despite the expected job losses, Ford aims for its European operations achieve consistent profitability by mid-decade.
