General Motors Corp. Workers Approve New Labor Contract With Overwhelming Majority, Ending Contentious Bargaining Season

Members of the United Auto Workers union voted decisively today to ratify a new four-year labor contract with General Motors Corp., ending a 40-day strike that crippled the automaker’s U.S. production. 

The votes by some 49,000 union members were tallied at centers across the country this weekend. When the final results were announced today, members approved the agreement by a vote of 57% to 43%, according to union officials. The new contract provides an $11,000 signing bonus for veteran GM employees, pay raises for long-term workers, and a path for temporary workers to become permanent employees.

“With today’s ratification vote, we have achieved major wins that will improve the lives of UAW-GM members for years to come,” said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes. The vice president led the union’s negotiating team during talks with GM representatives.

The new contract will take effect immediately, and GM workers are expected to return to plants and resume vehicle production starting Tuesday. The strike had halted work at 33 U.S. GM manufacturing plants and 22 parts warehouses, costing the company an estimated $1.2 billion according to analysts. The lost production and continued fixed costs during the work stoppage depleted GM’s cash flow at a rate of more than $100 million per day.

GM expressed gratitude to employees for ratifying the agreement and optimism about the future. "We delivered a contract that recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of this company," said General Motors CEO Mary Barra. "GM is proud to provide good-paying manufacturing jobs with excellent benefits and job security." 

The UAW called the nearly six-week strike on September 16 after talks broke down over issues including wages, health care costs, job security, and the use of temporary employees. The strike was the union’s first against GM since 2007 and the longest automotive strike in decades. Union leaders were determined to win meaningful pay raises and job protections for both new and veteran union members after workers had sacrificed during GM’s  bankruptcy and federal bailout in 2008 and 2009. 

The negotiations were also a first test for UAW President Gary Jones, who took over leadership of the 400,000-member union in June 2018. The weeks-long strike applied pressure to both sides and occasionally turnedcontentious before a tentative agreement was struck on October 16.

The ratified contract is seen as a victory for the UAW after a corruption scandal shook confidence in the union’s leadership earlier this year. The deal should boost morale for members who walked picket lines for nearly six weeks.

For GM, the agreement allows the company and its workers to refocus on building vehicles for customers in a highly competitive U.S. market. Together, GM and the UAW aim to continue a partnership that has spanned decades and build a more secure future for American autoworkers.
