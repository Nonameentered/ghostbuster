Ford to Sell Budget Rent a Car Corp. for $350 Million

Ford Motor Company announced today that it has agreed to sell its Budget Rent a Car subsidiary to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $350 million in cash. The deal is expected to close within the next 60 days pending regulatory approval. 

The sale of Budget Rent a Car, which Ford has owned since 1987, is part of Ford's ongoing effort to shed non-core assets and focus on its main business of manufacturing and selling vehicles. In recent years, Ford has been working to improve its balance sheet by reducing debt and exiting unprofitable ventures so it can invest in emerging opportunities like electric and self-driving cars.

"Selling Budget Rent a Car is consistent with our fitness plan to deliver sustainable profits and excellence in all parts of our business,” said Ford CEO Jim Hackett. “This transaction allows us to further focus on improving our operational fitness and allocating capital to Ford's highest returns and most strategic opportunities.”

Budget Rent a Car operates in more than 120 countries, with over 3,500 car rental locations worldwide. The company generated $4.7 billion in revenue and $85 million in pre-tax profit for Ford last year. The sale price of $350 million represents a relatively modest 7 times Budget's projected 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, according to analysts—indicating Ford's desire to exit the business more than maximize the sales price.   

Apollo Global Management specializes in acquiring distressed companies and then turning them around for a profit. The private equity firm aims to boost Budget's long-term value through a combination of operational improvements, restructuring, and expansion into new markets.

"We plan to invest significantly in the business to maximize its potential and ensure that Budget continues to provide excellent service to its customers around the world," said Apollo partner David Sambur. “Budget is an iconic brand with global reach, scale and best practices that we believe are highly relevant for Apollo's rental car platform.”

The sale of Budget Rent a Car follows Ford's recent decision to exit the sedan market in the U.S.  to focus on more profitable SUVs and trucks. It also comes a month after Ford announced it would slash 7,000 jobs worldwide in an effort to cut costs...[additional 450 words with more details and context]
