General Motors Consolidates All Commercial Truck Production in Flint, Michigan, Cutting Some Engineering Work in Other Areas  

General Motors announced today that it will consolidate all engineering and manufacturing operations for its commercial truck business to its Flint Assembly plant in Flint, Michigan. The move is aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs for the automaker's truck division.

GM's commercial truck segment, which produces vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups as well as Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans, is currently spread across three locations: Flint Assembly, GM's heavy-duty truck plant; Wentzville Assembly in Missouri, which builds Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans; and GM’s commercial and specialty vehicles headquarters in Pontiac, Michigan.  

Under the consolidation plan, GM will shift van production from Wentzville to Flint by the end of 2020. The Pontiac facility, which employs around 1,000 engineers and designers focused on commercial trucks, will close completely. Some of those jobs will move to Flint, but GM said “hundreds” of positions will be cut as the company aims to save $120 million per year from the restructuring.

“By consolidating our commercial truck engineering and manufacturing at Flint Assembly, we gain efficiencies that will strengthen our competitive position in this important market segment,” said Phil Kienle, vice president of GM North America manufacturing and labor relations. “While this move positions us for future success, it is difficult because some of our Pontiac employees will not make the move to Flint.”  

The Flint Assembly plant, which opened in 1947, already employs nearly 5,000 people on its heavy-duty truck line. GM recently invested $1.5 billion to upgrade the facility. The additional work from Pontiac and Wentzville will boost jobs in Flint, though GM did not specify how many new positions will be added. The company said it aims to provide opportunities for most displaced employees at other GM locations.
