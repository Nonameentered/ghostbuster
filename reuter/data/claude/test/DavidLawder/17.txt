Chrysler names Robert Lutz vice chairman, plans new generation of managers

Chrysler announced today that it has named Robert A. Lutz as vice chairman of the company and head of global product development. Mr. Lutz will oversee all of Chrysler's automotive design, advance vehicle engineering, product planning and powertrain operations.

In a move signaling a fresh start for the struggling automaker, Chrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche said the 76-year-old Lutz will help lead a new generation of leadership at the company. "Bob is a proven product guy and a real car enthusiast," Zetsche said. "He knows what it takes to develop outstanding vehicles that customers want to buy."

Lutz joins Chrysler after a 47-year career that included top positions at BMW, Ford, and General Motors. He was most recently vice chairman of product development at GM, where he helped revitalize that company's product lineup with vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu, Cadillac CTS and Buick Enclave. Known as an outspoken "car czar," Lutz is admired for his instincts on the types of stylish, high-performance cars that resonate with buyers.

At Chrysler, Lutz will work with a new team of executives in their 30s and 40s, aiming to overhaul the company's slow-selling fleet of sedans, hatchbacks and minivans. "The era where Chrysler could survive by selling boxy, forgettable cars with low sticker prices is over," Lutz said. "We need eye-catching design, world-class quality, and powertrains that deliver outstanding performance and fuel economy. Everything in our product pipeline will need to be best-in-class."

Chrysler's U.S. sales have declined for 13 straight months as models like the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Charger have struggled against competitors from Toyota, Ford and Honda.  The company recently announced plans to lay off 1,200 employees at an engine plant in Mexico as profits remain elusive.   

Zetsche has warned that Chrysler may stop investing in new products altogether if its performance doesn’t improve. The hiring of Lutz signals the company will go in the opposite direction, using new vehicles to woo back buyers. "The board and I decided that the best chance for long-term success is to revitalize our product portfolio," Zetsche said. "Bringing in someone with Bob's credentials and experience is the surest way to do that."

For his part, Lutz said he sees opportunities for quick progress at Chrysler. "There are already some fantastic designs on the drawing board here," he said. "We just need to get them into production, fast." Lutz, who will split time between Chrysler’s headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. and product design offices in Europe and Asia, added that his goals are modest. "Even gaining a point or two of market share with each new model introduction would make a huge difference," he said.

The news of Lutz's appointment sent Chrysler shares up 3.8% in late trading. Auto analysts applauded the move, with Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas calling Lutz "the perfect choice" to help Chrysler return to its roots as an innovative styling leader. "If anyone can make Chrysler cool again," he said, "it's Bob Lutz."
