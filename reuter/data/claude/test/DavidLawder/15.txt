GM November Sales Drop Almost 12 Percent Due to Strikes and Model Changeovers  

General Motors reported Tuesday that its sales in November dropped 11.8 percent from the previous year due to ongoing strikes by the United Auto Workers union and the changeover to new model vehicles. The Detroit-based automaker said it sold 195,116 vehicles last month, down from 217,639 in November 2018. 

The double-digit decline comes as the UAW strike against GM stretched into late October before ending on Oct. 25. The 40-day strike was the longest automotive work stoppage in 50 years and cost GM more than $3 billion and forced it to idle all of its U.S. factories. The lost production led to few 2019 model vehicles on dealer lots, forcing GM to boost incentives and discounts to try to prop up sales. 

GM executives said they knew the strikes would significantly impact sales in October and November. "The strike affected our inventories and sales, but our leadership team took strong action to minimize the impact," said CEO Mary Barra. "Now, we have a growing number of employees returning to work and our dealers are again receiving shipments of the most in-demand products."

The decline was worse than analysts had expected, with sales dropping about 9 percent. The results hurt GM's sales numbers for 2019 so far, with sales now down about 6 percent for the first 11 months of the year. The company would need a very strong December to meet last year's sales total. 

Every GM brand lost ground in November, led by a nearly 29 percent decline in Cadillac sales. Buick sales dropped 27 percent and GMC sales fell 18 percent. Chevrolet, GM's largest brand, saw sales decline 7.5 percent. The Chevrolet Silverado, GM's top-selling model, saw sales drop nearly 16 percent to just over 44,000 pickups.

GM is counting on new pickup trucks and SUVs, including revamped Chevrolet Tahoes, Suburbans and GMC Yukons, to help drive a rebound in US sales next year. The company has deals with factory workers that limit layoffs and closures, so GM needs sales to recover for new labor contracts to pencil out.

The United Auto Workers union called the November sales drop "expected" due to the recent strike. "For the long-term success of General Motors and its employees, we must build a stronger partnership with management that values the contributions of all employees and recognizes that GM would not be where they are without the commitment of a highly skilled and dedicated workforce," said UAW President Rory Gamble.

GM's declining sales results came as most other major automakers also reported weaker November numbers. Ford sales dropped nearly 2 percent, while Toyota sales slipped 4.4 percent and Honda sales fell 4.4 percent. Nissan was a bright spot, gaining 9.8 percent. Overall, according to forecasts, the auto industry likely saw only a small decrease in November, helped by a strong economy and solid consumer confidence heading into the holiday shopping season.
