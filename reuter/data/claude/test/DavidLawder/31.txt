Chrysler to Report Record Earnings For 1996 Year Based on Worldwide Sales Over 2.97 Million Vehicles   

Detroit, Michigan - Chrysler Corporation announced today that it expects to report record earnings for the 1996 calendar year based on worldwide vehicle sales of over 2.97 million units. The strong sales, combined with continued cost-cutting measures, will allow Chrysler to exceed its previous record earnings from 1994. 

Chrysler attributed the improved sales and earnings to strong consumer demand for its new lineup of sedans, including the redesigned Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid. Minivan sales also remained robust, with the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager capturing well over 50% of the US minivan market for the tenth straight year. Jeep brand sales were up nearly 20% for the year thanks to the successful launch of the all-new Jeep Wrangler.

"This has been an incredible year for Chrysler and our brands," said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton. "The dedication and hard work of our employees have allowed us to accelerate our product renewal plan while improving quality and productivity. We are well on our way to meeting our long-term goal of boosting sales to over 3 million units annually."

The company's US market share increased to nearly 15% in 1996 according to industry estimates, placing Chrysler in a solid third place in its home market behind rivals Ford and General Motors. Chrysler credited innovative marketing, improved vehicle quality, and new or redesigned models in 7 of its vehicle segments for enabling it to gain US market share for the third straight year. 

Internationally, Chrysler's sales in Mexico, Latin America, and key Asian markets grew substantially in 1996. The company began exporting the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus mid-size sedans from its Mexican assembly plant to the South American market, helping to boost volumes in that region. Expanded distribution of Jeep vehicles also aided the company's growth in Asia and Latin America.

Chrysler expects to report its official 1996 financial results, including final sales and earnings figures, on February 5, 1997. The company's stock price has risen over 30% in the past year based on the improved outlook. Analysts predict Chrysler's earnings could exceed $5 billion for the year if the fourth quarter results match expectations. The year-end results would demonstrate that Chrysler's 1990's turnaround is sustainable for the long term.
