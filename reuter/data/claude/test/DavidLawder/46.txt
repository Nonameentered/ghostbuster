General Motors Corp. Stock Expected to Rise with Dividend Increase and Stock Buyback Program

General Motors Corp. announced plans this week to boost shareholder returns through an increase in its quarterly dividend and a new multi-year stock buyback program. The moves are aimed at boosting GM's stock price, which has lagged the broader market in recent months.

GM said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 20% to 36 cents a share, marking the first increase since the company reinstated the payout in 2016. GM had suspended its dividend for several years during its bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. The higher dividend will cost the company about $500 million more per year.

In addition, GM's board authorized a new $5 billion stock repurchase program to buy back up to 60 million shares over the next few years. Stock buybacks are a popular way for companies to return cash to shareholders while also supporting their stock price. When companies repurchase shares, the shares remaining in the market become more valuable. 

GM CEO Mary Barra said the moves reflect the company's strong financial position and confidence in its long-term outlook. "Building a safe, just and equitable world and earning customers for life will drive GM's long-term success," Barra said in announcing the plans.

Investors cheered the news, sending GM shares up over 5% in morning trading following the announcement. GM stock had declined about 18% over the past six months amid concerns over trade tensions, a slowing global economy, and an auto industry that's past its peak sales levels. The dividend increase and buyback program signal to investors that GM's leadership believes the stock is undervalued.

GM employs over 160,000 people worldwide and its vehicles are sold in more than 100 countries. While the U.S. and China remain its largest markets, GM is working to boost its presence in emerging markets such as India, South America, and its home continent of Africa. The company's stable of brands includes Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick. 

Analysts said the stock buyback and dividend boost demonstrate GM's financial discipline and its willingness to reward shareholders. "A lot of companies rush to do these kinds of programs when they're doing well, but GM has been very judicious and waited until the time was right," said Jeremy Acevedo, an analyst with Edmunds. He added that the moves likely make GM stock more attractive to investors, especially those seeking income. With the higher dividend, GM shares now yield about 4% annually, higher than the average for S&P 500 companies.

GM said it willbegin repurchasing shares in the July-September quarter. It expects the moves to boost 2021 EPS by about 5 to 15 cents. Both the dividend increase and new stock buyback program are subject to approval by the board of GM's largest shareholder, SoftBank, which owns about 20% of GM shares. But analysts expect routine approval of the proposals by SoftBank. Overall, GM seems poised for a solid year ahead with these shareholder-friendly moves likely to drive momentum for its stock price.
