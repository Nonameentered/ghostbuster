Chrysler Unveils Five Concept Cars, Including Two New Jeep Wrangler Versions, at Detroit Auto Show 

Chrysler debuted five new concept vehicles this week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, demonstrating the potential future styling of some of its brands. Two of the concepts were rugged off-road variants of the popular Jeep Wrangler.

The Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 Concept is a V8-powered Wrangler with 450 horsepower. It features Dana 44 axles, a full-time 4WD system, electronic-locking differentials, and a 2-inch lift kit. The performance-oriented concept can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 5 seconds. The Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel Concept has a 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6 that produces 260 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. It can achieve 29 miles per gallon on the highway while still maintaining solid off-road capability. 

Chrysler also unveiled a Dodge Challenger Concept and Chrysler Voyager and Pacifica Concepts. The Challenger Concept has an aluminum body and a high-performance all-electric powertrain producing all-wheel drive and more than 800 horsepower. The futuristic Voyager Concept is a fully autonomous electric vehicle with seating for six. The Pacifica Concept is a plug-in hybrid minivan with an estimated 80 MPGe.

“Our new concept vehicles highlight the potential future styling of our brands and showcase powertrains that we are exploring for possible use in our vehicles,” said Tim Kuniskis, head of passenger cars for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles North America. “We have an opportunity to greatly expand the reach of our brands with new powertrains and technologies to meet the needs of the changing marketplace.”

The unveiling of the concepts at the Detroit show comes as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles seeks a merger partner to help invest in new powertrains and technologies. A merger would provide additional resources for the company to more quickly develop and produce new hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric powertrains, as well as advanced driver assistance systems and other technologies showcased across the five new concepts. The Wrangler concepts in particular show the potential for FCA to develop more advanced, efficient and high-performance powertrains for its most valuable brands.

Overall, the collection of concept vehicles displayed the innovation and style that Chrysler's brands aspire to, even as the company's future remains uncertain given its search for a merger partner. The concepts generated significant buzz among media and analysts at the Detroit Auto Show and offered a glimpse of what could be ahead for the automaker if it is able to gain additional investment and resources through a merger or partnership. The possibilities for new powertrains and the advancement of Jeep's most iconic model were highlights of Chrysler's display in Detroit.
