Manufactured Home Industry Sees Merger Activity as Communities Help Revamp Image of Mobile Homes 

The manufactured home industry is experiencing increasing merger and acquisition activity as large players look to gain more scale and efficiency. At the same time, the industry is working to revamp the image of mobile homes through the development of manufactured home communities that provide an amenity-rich lifestyle at an affordable price.

Clayton Homes, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, recently acquired two smaller manufactured home builders, expanding its already substantial market share. “Consolidation will help strengthen our operations, gain manufacturing efficiencies, and position us to better weather economic downturns,” said Kevin T. Clayton, CEO of Clayton Homes. The company now commands nearly 50% of new manufactured home placements in the U.S.

Other large manufactured home builders like Cavco Industries and Skyline Champion are also growing through smaller acquisitions. “Scale is increasingly important in our industry to gain purchasing power, spread costs, and boost profits,” said Joe Stegmayer, Chairman and CEO of Cavco Industries. The company recently purchased two smaller builders in Texas and Arizona.  

At the same time, the manufactured home industry is working to transform the image of mobile homes through manufactured home communities that provide an attractive, affordable lifestyle. “Manufactured homes placed in communities with features like clubhouses, pools, and recreational activities are worlds away from the trailer parks of the past,” said Richard Genz, CEO of the Manufactured Housing Institute.

Sunshine Homes is developing manufactured home communities, like its new Sunrise Village community in Florida, that rival site-built home neighborhoods. “We’re providing spacious homes with design features like front porches, garages, and green space that resonate with homebuyers looking for an appealing yet budget-friendly living option,” said Jill Marotta, VP of Marketing and Sales at Sunshine Homes.
