Auto Industry Unveils New SUV Models at North American International Auto Show in Detroit 

The North American International Auto Show kicked off this week in Detroit, with automakers from around the world showcasing their latest models. A clear theme of this year's show is the proliferation of new sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossovers. With gas prices remaining low and demand for larger vehicles high, automakers are responding with many new options for consumers in the SUV and crossover segment.

Ford unveiled its new Explorer SUV, a complete redesign of the iconic model that has been the best-selling SUV in the U.S. for years. The new 2020 Explorer features a more rugged exterior design, a range of engine options including a fuel-efficient hybrid variant, and the latest advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. “Our customers want exploration-enabling technologies, exciting performance and a vehicle that makes you feel deeply connected from the moment you get inside,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford's president of The Americas and International Markets Group. The new Explorer will go on sale later this year. 

General Motors showed off three new SUVs across its Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC brands. The new Chevrolet Trailblazer, a small crossover, makes its North American debut after being sold in other global markets. Cadillac unveiled its new XT6 three-row luxury crossover, which slots between the XT5 and Escalade in Cadillac's lineup. And GMC took the wraps off the new Yukon, a full-size SUV that shares a platform and powertrains with the Chevrolet Tahoe but features more premium styling and materials. “We’re strengthening and revitalizing GMC's range of premium SUVs, with the all-new Yukon as the flagship,” said Duncan Aldred, vice president of GMC.

Toyota introduced significant updates to two of its largest SUV models. The new Sequoia SUV, which competes with the GMC Yukon, receives a restyled grille, headlights, and other exterior design changes along with upgraded technology and safety features inside the cabin. Toyota also rolled out a refreshed version of the venerable Land Cruiser, including a new off-road oriented Heritage Edition model. Despite their large sizes, Toyota has managed to improve fuel economy for both the Sequoia and the Land Cruiser thanks to powertrain enhancements and weight reductions.

Not to be left out, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles showcased an all-new SUV under its Jeep brand. The new Jeep Gladiator pickup truck, which goes on sale later this year, is Jeep’s first truck model in nearly 30 years. Based on the popular Wrangler SUV, the Gladiator combines solid axles, removable doors, fold-down windshield, and cargo pickup bed, bound to attract both truck buyers and diehard Jeep enthusiasts.  

From Detroit makers like Ford and GM to international brands like Toyota, nearly every automaker with a presence in North America has new or refreshed SUV and crossover models on display at this year's auto show.  With an array of sizes, styles, and price points across brands, consumers have no shortage of new SUV options to choose from in showrooms this year.
