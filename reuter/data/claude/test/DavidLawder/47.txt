Ford Chosen Again to Lead UAW Labor Contract Negotiations with Big Three Automakers 

The United Auto Workers union announced today that Ford Motor Company will again take the lead in negotiating the union's next labor contract with Detroit's Big Three automakers. The UAW selected Ford to be the "target company" in the negotiations, meaning Ford will be the first to bargain a tentative agreement that will then likely serve as a template for General Motors and Fiat Chrysler.

The selection of Ford came as no surprise, given that Ford was also chosen as the target company for the current four-year contract negotiated in 2019. Ford and the UAW have a long history of achieving labor deals without the drama and conflict that has accompanied negotiations with GM and Chrysler in the past. UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement, "We have a proven track record of working with Ford to achieve win-win solutions for both the company and our hardworking members."  

The current UAW contract with Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler expires on September 14, 2023. Among the key issues likely to be addressed in the negotiations are wage increases, health care benefits, use of temporary workers, and job security commitments around new technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles. The automakers will be pushing to keep fixed costs low in an era of massive investments in new technologies, while the union will aim to share in the profits from recent robust sales of highly profitable pickup trucks and SUVs in the US market.

Both Ford and the UAW expressed confidence in achieving a deal ahead of the contract deadline. Ford executive chairman Bill Ford said, "We have always maintained a cooperative and collaborative relationship with the UAW, and I expect this round of talks to be no different." The target company strategy has proved effective for the Big Three and UAW in the past, enabling them to reach agreements without the drama and expense of strikes. The selection of Ford reflects the cooperative nature of the relationship and positions the sides well for productive talks over the next 18 months. With both sides aiming for stability, the chances of a deal without a major confrontation appear good.
