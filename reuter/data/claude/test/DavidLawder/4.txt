Kellogg Co. to Acquire Lender's Bagels Business from Kraft Foods for $455 Million 

Kellogg Company, the maker of popular cereal and snack brands like Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, and Pringles chips, announced today that it will acquire the Lender's bagel business from Kraft Foods Group for $455 million in cash. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals.

The Lender's bagel brand generates about $150 million in annual net revenue and includes a range of refrigerated and frozen bagels, bagel chips, mini bagels, and bagel flatbreads. Kellogg said the acquisition of the Lender's brand will expand its presence in the frozen foods category and strengthen its breakfast portfolio. 

“Bagels are an attractive, high-growth category and Lender’s is the number one bagel brand in the U.S.,” said Steve Cahillane, Chairman and CEO of Kellogg Company. “This acquisition allows us to continue diversifying our portfolio into spaces that have significant growth opportunities for Kellogg.”

The bagel category has been growing steadily over the past few years, especially in times of stay-at-home restrictions and social distancing due to COVID-19. More people have been eating breakfast at home and seeking out convenient, easy meal options. Bagels can be a popular choice, as they are shelf-stable, filling, and versatile.  

For Kraft Heinz, selling the Lender's brand is part of its ongoing effort to reshape its portfolio by shedding non-core assets to reduce debt and invest in key categories that have the strongest growth prospects. Kraft Heinz has been struggling recently and in February reported weaker than expected quarterly earnings. The company has gone through multiple rounds of job cuts, write-downs, and restructuring.

The deal between Kellogg and Kraft Heinz is expected to provide benefits for both companies. Kellogg gains an established brand in a fast-growing category, while Kraft Heinz is able to generate cash to pay down debt and focus on reviving its most promising brands like Heinz ketchup and Kraft mac and cheese.

Upon completion of the acquisition, Kellogg plans to run the Lender's business from its headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan. Lender's employees at Kraft Heinz will transfer to Kellogg. Financial advisors Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP acted as advisors to Kellogg.
