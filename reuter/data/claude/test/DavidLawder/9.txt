Chrysler Breaks Ground on $10 Million Museum to its Rich Automotive History  

The Chrysler automaker announced today that it has broken ground on a $10 million museum dedicated to the rich history of the company. Called the Walter P. Chrysler Museum, the 25,000-square-foot facility will be located in Auburn Hills, Michigan, adjacent to Chrysler's headquarters and main assembly plant.

The museum will feature historic Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram vehicles spanning the company's nearly 100-year history. It will include notable models such as a 1924 Chrysler Model B-70, a 1931 Chrysler Imperial CG, the iconic 1960 Chrysler 300 and one of the original Dodge Vipers from 1991. Interactive exhibits will highlight Chrysler's design, innovation and technological firsts over the decades. 

"Chrysler has an incredibly deep heritage of designing, engineering and building vehicles in America," said James D’Emilio, Director of the Chrysler Museum. "This facility will offer visitors a chance to see how the Chrysler brand revolutionized the automotive industry with bold designs, advanced engineering, and a commitment to accessibility, value, and performance."

The museum is set to open in late 2021. When completed, it will be open six days a week to the public for self-guided tours. There will also be spaces available for private events and educational programs for local schools. Admission to the museum will be free of charge.

"We want this museum to be a gift to our devoted fans, owners, employees and community," said Chrysler CEO Mike Manley. "It is because of their passion for our brands that we have achieved so much over the generations. This is a small way to say thank you for their support as we embark on our next 100 years of pioneering automotive excellence."

The groundbreaking ceremony featured Manley driving up in a 1955 Chrysler C-300, the first of the Chrysler 300 "letter series" high-performance luxury cars. The event was attended by local government officials, automotive journalists, and long-time Chrysler employees, some spanning four decades with the company. Retirees shared their memories of working at Chrysler over the years, underscoring the personal connections many still feel to the automaker’s storied history.
