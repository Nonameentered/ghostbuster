General Motors to Sell Hughes Electronics Corp.'s Defence Businesses 

General Motors Corp. announced today that it will sell the defense-related units of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary in a move to focus on its core automotive business. The Hughes defense businesses, which include missile systems, military satellites, and defense electronics, will be sold to private equity firms Veritas Capital and General Atlantic in a deal valued at $5.2 billion.

"This transaction allows us to concentrate on our core automotive operations while providing Hughes defense businesses an opportunity to further grow as an independent company with strong private equity partners," said GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending customary regulatory approvals.

The Hughes defense units employ about 16,000 people and generate approximately $6 billion in annual revenue. The businesses have been part of GM since the company acquired Hughes Aircraft in 1985. The non-defense parts of Hughes Electronics, including DIRECTV, the nation's top satellite television service, will remain under GM ownership.  

Veritas Capital and General Atlantic won over several other private equity bidders for the defense units. The equity firms specialize in buying and selling companies in the aerospace/defense, technology, and industrial sectors. “We fully support management’s vision to expand the company through investments in key strategic areas, and we look forward to helping take the business to the next level,” said Veritas founder and CEO Robert B. McKeon.

GM has been overhauling its operations over the past several years to concentrate on building vehicles. The company has faced falling profits, rising costs, and loss of market share to foreign competitors. The sale of the Hughes defense businesses is the latest in a series of divestitures that GM has made to raise cash and reduce expenditures in non-automotive areas. The company hopes to raise up to $15 billion total through asset sales and cost cutting. GM shares rose 2 percent on news of the sale.

The sale allows Hughes defense businesses to emerge from GM's restrictive control and opens new opportunities for growth through investments and acquisitions, said industry analysts. However, the units also face risks from reduced access to GM's financial support and resources. The private equity buyers will need to invest significant amounts of capital to fund new programs and products to ensure the long-term viability of the defense companies.

Overall, GM's decision to sell its defense electronics division signals the company's determination to remake itself into a leaner organization focused on manufacturing popular cars and trucks. While the sale will provide a financial boost, GM must now deliver on its promise to fix its ailing automotive operations. The future remains uncertain, but GM appears committed to overcoming its challenges and realizing its goal to design, build, and sell the world's best vehicles.
