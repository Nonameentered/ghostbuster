Automakers Close 1996 with Weaker December Sales Despite Record-Breaking Year for Chrysler 

The nation's automakers closed out 1996 with mixed results in December as most reported weaker sales for the month, though the industry overall still expects a record sales year. Chrysler Corp. was a bright spot, posting its best December sales in history.

Chrysler said its December U.S. sales rose 2.4% to 153,375 cars and trucks, pushing its total 1996 sales to a record 2.5 million vehicles—a 9.1% increase and the company's best year since 1989. The strong December and year “reflect the success of our new product revival,” said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton. 

Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., however, reported declines for December. Ford's sales dropped 12.2% to 318,560 vehicles, while GM's fell 2.6% to 412,548. For the full year, Ford's sales rose 3.1% to a record 4.9 million autos, while GM's increased 2.2% to 5.7 million.

Analysts said the weaker December sales, which followed a strong November, were expected given fewer sales days in the month compared with a year earlier and come after two solid months. “December was a little bit slower, but the year as a whole was quite strong,” said economist David Wyss of Standard & Poor's Corp. "The fundamentals for the auto industry remain pretty solid."

The solid year reflects strong consumer confidence and demand supported by low interest rates, low unemployment and moderate gas prices. Analysts expect the sales pace to continue in 1997, with annual sales again reaching around 15 million cars and light trucks.

Still, challenges remain, especially pricing pressures. Incentive spending by the Big Three U.S. auto makers in 1996 rose 15% to an average of about $1,500 a vehicle, according to Autodata Corp., as competition intensified in the market.

Incentives and fleet sales have been a concern because they eat into profits. Analysts warn that another big jump in incentive spending could start eroding profits at GM and Ford. Chrysler, meanwhile, has the lowest incentive spending of the Big Three and reported a 22% increase in fourth-quarter profits.  
              
SUV sales were a particularly strong area in 1996, rising 18%, and now make up about 20% of all light-vehicle demand. Minivan sales also rose solidly, up 13% for the year. Car sales, though still the largest segment, were nearly flat in 1996.

Within segments, Ford's Explorer remained the best-selling SUV; Chrysler dominated minivans with its Caravan and Voyager; and Toyota's Camry was the top-selling car for the third year in a row.

While the industry expects another good year in 1997, there are concerns about the economy slowing. But as long as consumer confidence remains high and interest rates stay low, analysts say auto demand should continue at a healthy pace, even if slightly lower. The wild card, though, is incentive spending. If it continues rising sharply it could dampen the profit outlook, but right now most experts don't see incentive wars developing in earnest in 1997.
