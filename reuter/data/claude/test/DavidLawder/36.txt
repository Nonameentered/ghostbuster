Comair Flight 3272 Engine Replaced Five Days Before Fatal Crash, NTSB Investigating Crew's Attempts to Shut Down Engine and Activate Fire Extinguishing System

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the fatal crash of Comair Flight 3272 to determine why the crew was unable to shut down an engine fire or activate the fire extinguishing system. The Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, killing all 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board. 

According to officials, the plane's right engine was replaced just 5 days before the doomed flight. The NTSB is analyzing maintenance records to determine if the engine replacement could have contributed to the fire. Witnesses reported seeing flames coming from the plane's right engine as it took off down the runway. The pilots radioed to air traffic control that they were experiencing an engine fire and needed to return to the airport immediately. However, the blaze quickly intensified, and the plane crashed in a wooded area about a mile from the runway.

The NTSB is reviewing the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to understand why the pilots were unable to extinguish the fire or shut down the right engine. On the Bombardier CRJ-200, engine fires can be extinguished using a fire extinguishing agent and the engine can be shut down by cutting off its fuel supply and stopping the high-pressure turbine. For an unknown reason, neither of these actions were successful in ceasing the fire or engine.

"We need to determine exactly what steps the crew took to address the engine fire so we can understand why those standard procedures did not extinguish the blaze or shut down the engine," said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. "Maintenance activity on complex engines can be challenging, so we are taking a close look at the engine replacement to check for any anomalies."

Family members of the victims were devastated to learn about the engine replacement just days before the crash. "We trusted that plane with our loved ones' lives, and a supposedly routine engine replacement may have led to this terrible tragedy. We need answers and accountability," said one family representative. Comair has offered its condolences to the victims' loved ones but declined to comment further pending the outcome of the NTSB's investigation. The investigation is expected to last 6-12 months before the NTSB releases its final report on the probable cause of the accident.
