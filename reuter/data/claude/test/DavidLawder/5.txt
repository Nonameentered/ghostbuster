Kellogg to Acquire Lender's Bagels from Kraft Foods for $455 Million 

Kellogg Company, the maker of Frosted Flakes, Pop-Tarts and Eggo waffles, announced today that it will acquire Lender's Bagels from Kraft Foods for $455 million in an all-cash transaction. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory review and approval.

Lender's Bagels is the leader in the U.S. refrigerated bagel category, with annual sales of approximately $190 million. By acquiring Lender's, Kellogg aims to expand into the fast-growing breakfast bakery category and tap into consumer trends toward convenient, better-for-you snacking options. 

“Bagels are an attractive new area of expansion for our company as we strive to offer more nutritious and delicious breakfast and snack options to meet the needs of today's consumers,” said Steve Cahillane, president and CEO of Kellogg Company.  “Lender’s Bagels is an iconic brand and a leader in the refrigerated bagel space.  We are excited to welcome their talented team to the Kellogg family.”

Founded in Connecticut in 1927, Lender's pioneered the refrigerated bagel category and today offers a variety of bagels, bagel crisps, bagel chips and thin bagels.  The brand is available in the bakery sections of grocery stores, supercenters and warehouse clubs across the U.S. and Canada.  Once the transaction is complete, Lender's will join Kellogg's stable of wholesome snack brands like Rice Krispies Treats, Nutri-Grain and RXBAR.   

Industry experts view the deal as a win for both companies.  Kellogg gains a foothold in a fast-growing category, while Kraft will benefit by streamlining its portfolio to focus on cheese, meals, and branded foodservice products.  According to Kellogg, the bagel category has steadily gained popularity with consumers and delivers strong growth potential.  The acquisition is also seen as a natural strategic fit given the synergies between bagels and Kellogg's other breakfast and snacking products.

With annual sales of $13.8 billion, Kellogg Company is the world's leading breakfast company.  Kraft Foods, based in Chicago and with 2018 net revenues of $6.4 billion, is one of North America's largest consumer packaged food and beverage companies.
