Chrysler Corp. to Report Record Earnings for 1996 with Worldwide Sales of 2.97 Million Vehicles, Company Chairman Says 

Chrysler Corp. expects to report record earnings for 1996 and its highest vehicle sales in history, Chairman Robert Eaton said today. 

Speaking at the International Auto Show in Detroit, Eaton said Chrysler's worldwide vehicle sales for 1996 were 2.97 million, surpassing the previous record of 2.82 million set in 1995. The results were fueled by continued strong sales of minivans and the new Dodge Caravan, as well as sales of the Chrysler Sebring luxury sedan.

"We are very pleased with our performance in 1996, which underscores the strength of our product lineup and popularity of our brands," Eaton said. "The investments we have made in recent years to revamp our vehicle designs and improve quality continue to pay off."

Eaton predicted Chrysler's earnings for 1996 would exceed $5.7 billion, surpassing the previous record of $5.1 billion in 1995. The results were ahead of analysts' expectations, with earnings buoyed by cost-cutting measures and increased profits from its financing arm. Chrysler continues to generate strong cash flow, ending 1996 with $7.8 billion in cash.

The results provide further evidence of Chrysler's revival since nearly going bankrupt in the 1970s. Under Eaton and former Chairman Lee Iacocca, Chrysler regained its footing by introducing innovative new models like the minivan as well as streamlining operations and forming strategic alliances. The company merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz AG last year, creating DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest automaker.

Chrysler's U.S. sales rose 3 percent in 1996 to 2.34 million vehicles. The Dodge division posted a 5 percent increase, while Jeep sales were up 4 percent. Chrysler brand sales were flat compared with 1995. The best-selling vehicle was the Dodge Caravan, of which Chrysler sold nearly 400,000 in the U.S. The Sebring and Jeep Grand Cherokee also sold well.

Chrysler plans to build on its success by introducing several new vehicles in 1997, including a redesigned Jeep Wrangler and Dodge Dakota pickup truck. The company will also pursue further cost-cutting to boost profits amid increasing competition in the global auto industry.
