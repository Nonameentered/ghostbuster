Chrysler Announces $380 Million Investment in South America for Pickup Trucks and Diesel Engines 

Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it will invest $380 million in its operations in South America, primarily in Brazil and Argentina. The investments will be focused on increasing production of pickup trucks and diesel engines to meet growing demand in South American markets.

The largest portion of the new investment, $250 million, will go to Chrysler's Jeep assembly plant in Pernambuco, Brazil. The plant currently produces the Jeep Renegade small SUV and will receive upgrades to also build the all-new Jeep Gladiator pickup truck starting in early 2020. The Gladiator is Jeep's first pickup in nearly 30 years and the new investment will allow the Pernambuco plant to produce up to 20,000 Gladiators annually.  

"The Jeep Gladiator will be a game-changer as it enters the pickup segment in South American markets," said Antonio Filosa, Head of FCA Latin America.  "We anticipate very strong demand as customers learn about its exceptional capability, versatility and styling."

Chrysler will invest an additional $130 million to boost production of turbo diesel engines in Argentina. The automaker's engine plant in Cordoba will receive technology and equipment upgrades to increase annual output of 2.0-liter and 2.2-liter four-cylinder turbo diesels by over 50 percent, to more than 250,000 engines total when at full capacity. The turbo diesels currently power several Fiat and Jeep models in South America including the Fiat Toro pickup, Jeep Renegade and Compass SUVs.  

The new investments in Brazil and Argentina follow significant new vehicle launches for the FCA brands in South America this year. In addition to the new Jeep Gladiator launching next year, the Fiat brand introduced an all-new Toro midsize pickup for 2019 which has already surpassed 30,000 units in sales. FCA's Ram brand will also start production of the all-new Ram 2500 heavy-duty pickup in Brazil later this year.

FCA has set an aggressive product plan for South America over the next 3-5 years, hoping to regain market share in a region where sales have lagged other parts of the world. The new investments announced today represent FCA's commitment to strengthening its presence in South America by producing vehicles and engines tailored to the region's preferences. With a modernized manufacturing footprint and several new products in the hottest segments like pickups and SUVs, FCA aims to turnaround its fortunes in the South American auto market.
