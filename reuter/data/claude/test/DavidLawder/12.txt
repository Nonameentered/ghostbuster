Dow Corning Plans $3 Billion Bankruptcy Reorganization to Pay Silicone Breast Implant Claims and Seek Trial on Disease Link

Dow Corning Corp. has proposed filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a move it says is required to settle thousands of lawsuits over its silicone breast implants. The company says proposed funding for the settlement would require its parent companies, Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., together with bondholders and creditors, to raise $3.2 billion in cash and securities. The plan, if approved, would establish a $2.35 billion fund, the world's largest ever for a product liability case, to compensate thousands of women who say their silicone breast implants caused illnesses. Dow Corning has been sued by 22,000 women as part of a worldwide mass tort case.

As part of the reorganization, Dow Corning has vowed to pursue a new scientific study to determine if implants caused various autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia, as some studies have linked and others have contradicted. There is no scientific consensus on a causal connection between implants and such diseases. The company says this new trial would include thousands of women with implants and thousands without implants to determine if there are higher instances of disease among those with implants.

Dow Corning faces more than 5.7 billion  in claims related to its silicone breast implants, although it has won some verdicts as well and says many cases remain weak. The company voluntarily withdrew silicone implants from the market in 1992. The company maintains there is no proven link between its products and the diseases alleged by plaintiffsâ€™ attorneys. Under the proposal, claimants could obtain money without proving such a link, but would surrender rights to pursue further legal claims against the company.

The proposed settlement aims to resolve all current claims against Dow Corning, including the breast implant product liability lawsuits pending in U.S. courts. The bankruptcy restructuring would also include a "litigation holdback" fund of $400 million to pay any claims that emerge after the bankruptcy restructuring is complete.
