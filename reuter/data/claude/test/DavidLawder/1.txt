Ford Gains Edge as Canadian Auto Workers Choose Chrysler as Strike Target  

The Canadian Auto Workers union has selected Chrysler as its strike target in contract talks with the Detroit 3 automakers, giving Ford Motor Co. a temporary reprieve and an edge in its negotiations.

The CAW announced Monday that it would focus its efforts on reaching a new collective agreement with Chrysler, but warned a strike was still possible if a deal couldn't be reached by a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Sept. 24.

CAW President Ken Lewenza said Chrysler was targeted because the company is in the best position to lead in terms of responding to union demands for product commitments and investment. But he said the union would look for the same commitments from Ford and General Motors.

"I want to be clear that protecting jobs is the number one priority of these negotiations," Lewenza told a news conference. "We will strike if we need to."

Chrysler said in a statement that is remains "committed to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement" with the CAW. But Ford likely breathed a sigh of relief at the union's announcement. Being the strike target in the past has cost the company hundreds of millions and even lasted three weeks in 1996.

Designating Chrysler as the strike target gives the union a strategic advantage because Ford and GM would be reluctant to reach an agreement with better terms out of fear of angering the CAW, said Tony Faria, a professor at the University of Windsor's Odette School of Business.

"By the union selecting Chrysler as its strike target, that means Ford and GM can basically just sit back and wait while Chrysler and the union duke it out," Faria said. "But Chrysler's in a position where they can work towards an agreement knowing the other two are going to have to match it."

Among the top issues in the talks are wages, pensions and investments in Canadian facilities. The union wants the Detroit 3 to commit to bringing new product mandates to Canada to protect jobs.

Chrysler has already committed to replace its minivan in Windsor, where it builds the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country. The CAW may look to the company to also commit to refreshing its 300 sedan in Brampton, Ont. The uni
