United Auto Workers Set to Choose Strike Target Among Big Three Automakers 

The United Auto Workers union is set to determine which of the three major US automakers—General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles—will be the target of a strike authorization vote, the first step toward an industry work stoppage. The UAW's four-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire just after midnight on Saturday, raising the possibility of strikes that could cripple North American vehicle production for the already slowing auto industry.

The UAW has elected to focus negotiations with GM, the top US automaker, ahead of Ford and Fiat Chrysler. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company wants to reach an "equitable" deal, but the two sides remain at odds over issues like pay, health care costs, and profit-sharing. The UAW has framed health care as a key issue, saying GM wants union workers to pay a larger portion of costs that continue to rise. GM, for its part, aims to reduce a labor cost disadvantage amounting to $13 per hour per worker compared to non-UAW plants operated by foreign-based automakers in the US.

A strike would halt operations of the automaker targeted by the UAW and likely prompt parts suppliers to curtail shipments to the affected company. The impact would be felt at vehicle assembly plants where thousands of jobs would temporarily go away and in the communities surrounding the factories. The last major UAW strike against an automaker was a two-day walkout against GM in 2007. A more prolonged strike would threaten to restrain an industry already straining under slowing sales and rising costs associated with developing electric and self-driving vehicles. 

The remaining two Detroit automakers, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, would continue operating in the event of a GM strike but could face their own work stoppages later on if the UAW turns its attention to their labor talks. The contracts between the UAW and GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler were last negotiated in 2015 following a two-tier wage system and profit-sharing agreement introduced following the last major economic downturn.

The Detroit automakers and the UAW are under pressure to reach new four-year agreements without a strike that damages both sides. For automakers, a strike threatens to curb vehicle output and sales during an already difficult period. For union workers, a strike means foregoing pay and benefits. With both sides motivated to find common ground, a deal avoiding a high-stakes confrontation is still possible. The coming week will determine whether the UAW and Detroit's Big Three automakers can negotiate new contracts amicably or if a strike will indeed be necessary to resolve key differences.
