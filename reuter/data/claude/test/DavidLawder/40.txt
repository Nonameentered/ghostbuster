GM to gain $100m in annual savings from sale of Hughes while Class H shareholders receive additional shares in post-merger Raytheon  

General Motors announced today that it has finalized the sale of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary to Raytheon in a deal worth $9.5 billion. The sale of Hughes, which operates DirecTV and provides satellite technology and services, is expected to reduce GM’s costs by over $100 million annually and allow the automaker to focus on its core vehicle manufacturing business.

“The sale of Hughes is consistent with GM’s strategic plan to exit non-automotive businesses and raising capital to invest in new products and technologies for our vehicle lineup,” said GM CEO Mary Barra. “This divestiture significantly streamlines our company and allows us to build on our leadership in developing the next generation of connected, electric and self-driving cars.”

Under the terms of the agreement, GM will receive $8 billion in cash from Raytheon as well as $1.5 billion in Raytheon stock. GM shareholders will benefit from a special one-time dividend of $5 billion from the transaction proceeds. In addition, GM “Class H” shareholders, who hold shares of the tracking stock linked specifically to the financial performance of Hughes, will receive additional Raytheon shares in exchange for their GM Class H shares following the close of the deal. 

The purchase of Hughes expands Raytheon’s reach in the aerospace and defense electronics sectors. Hughes’s satellite technologies and services are expected to complement Raytheon’s existing space and communications business as well as its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work for government and commercial customers.

“The acquisition of Hughes is transformational for our company and directly aligns with our vision for a 21st century defense company,” said Raytheon Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy. “Hughes’s capabilities in space technologies and services will accelerate our growth strategy and help us deliver innovative solutions at new levels of speed, performance and affordability.”

The deal is subject to standard regulatory approvals but is expected to close within six months. GM stated that it will use the proceeds from the sale to pay off some short-term debt but will reinvest the majority of the funds in research and capital projects to develop new vehicle platforms for its GM, Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet brands.
