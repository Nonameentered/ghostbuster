Chrysler VP Robert Lutz remains integral to product creation despite corporate restructuring 

Despite major changes in Chrysler's ownership and management over the past decade, Robert Lutz has remained an integral part of the company's product development efforts. Lutz, 86, currently serves as Vice Chairman and Senior Advisor at Chrysler, focusing on design and product innovation.

Lutz first joined Chrysler in 1986 as Executive Vice President of Global Product Development. He helped revitalize Chrysler's vehicle lineup in the 1990s with bold designs like the Dodge Viper and Plymouth Prowler. Lutz left Chrysler in 1998 but returned in 2001 as Vice Chairman in charge of product creation. He played a key role in the development of standout vehicles like the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger, which helped return Chrysler to profitability in the mid-2000s.

Even after Chrysler filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was acquired by Fiat, Lutz stayed on to guide the product renaissance. “There's no one with more experience in actually creating and developing great products,” said Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. Lutz has helped oversee the creation of critically-acclaimed, segment-leading vehicles like the Dodge Durango, Ram 1500 pickup, and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

While Lutz has relinquished day-to-day management responsibilities, Marchionne said “his counsel and advice remain absolutely invaluable.” Lutz works directly with Chrysler's design and engineering teams several days a week, reviewing future product designs and sharing his decades of expertise. 

Lutz's passion for bold and innovative products has endured throughout his more than 50 years in the auto industry. While Chrysler's management, ownership, and company name have changed over the past 15 years, Lutz's role as the brand's "product sage" and visionary has remained constant. His ability to shape Chrysler's vehicle lineup through multiple crises and transitions is a testament to the lasting impact of world-class product design. As long as Lutz remains involved, Chrysler is poised to continue its string of segment-leading and iconic vehicle releases.
