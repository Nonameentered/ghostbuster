UAW President Stephen Yokich Shakes Up Traditional Labor Negotiations with Detroit's Big Three Automakers

United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich led a  groundbreaking labor negotiation with Detroit's Big Three automakers that diverged from traditional approaches to collective bargaining, resulting in significant wage and benefits concessions from all parties. The outcome was seen as critical to ensuring the survival of the struggling domestic auto industry in the face of stiff competition from foreign carmakers.

The UAW began formal contract talks with General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler in July under mounting pressure to obtain significant concessions to better align labor costs with those of Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers operating non-union plants in the southern United States. With the automakers losing market share and billions of dollars, they entered negotiations saying current costs were unsustainable if they hoped to compete and return to profitability. 

Yokich took a pragmatic stance in acknowledging the need for concessions to save jobs in an industry where his union membership had fallen below 500,000 from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. He pressed the automakers to open their books to justify demands for cuts and deployed an internal education campaign to make the rank-and-file more amenable to compromise, arguing for long-term survival over short-term gains.

Negotiations, which were extended several times, resulted in a groundbreaking four-year contract that included national job security and productivity language and an average wage freeze for senior workers in exchange for profit sharing and lump-sum payments if financial targets were met. Entry-level wages were reduced, healthcare co-pays increased and cost-of-living allowances were suspended. Gains were also made in areas like enhanced job retraining programs.

Yokich hailed the agreement as innovative, fair and a pivotal first step toward leveling the playing field with foreign competitors, saving thousands of jobs in the process. His compromise and cooperative approach to negotiations was seen as positioning the union for major gains once the industry emerged from crisis. The final four-year agreement demonstrated the UAW's willingness to work in partnership with employers during difficult times to advance shared long term interests. The Detroit 3, in turn, received the relief and labor costs they said were critical to their turnaround and future success.
