Analysts: GM's Deflation of Q4 Earnings Expectations Unlikely to be Replicated by Ford and Chrysler 

General Motors rattled investors last week when it warned that fourth-quarter profits would be significantly lower than expectations, citing overall softer industry conditions and slumping sales in China. However, analysts expect Ford and Fiat Chrysler to largely avoid GM's fate when they report earnings over the next week. 

GM's shares plunged over 9% after it estimated that adjusted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.32 to $1.52, well below the $2.30 consensus forecast. The company blamed a deteriorating auto market in China, rising costs from new labor contracts, and lower than expected sales of pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles in the U.S. The warning suggests GM's fourth-quarter profits could fall by over 50% compared to the same period last year.

In contrast, analysts have not significantly lowered their projections for Ford's fourth-quarter earnings. The consensus forecast remains $0.32 per share, which would represent a decline of only 5% year-over-year. "While Ford will also face headwinds from a weaker China market and higher labor costs, its North America business is performing significantly better than GM's," said equity analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Ford has a fresher lineup of SUVs and trucks, including the popular Ranger pickup, which has helped it gain market share from competitors like GM.

Chrysler parent Fiat Chrysler is also well-positioned, analysts say. The company "has more straightforward operations, does not have the same fixed-cost structure,  and is not as exposed to weakness in the Chinese auto market," said Moody's Senior Vice President Bruce Clark. While Fiat Chrysler will face similar pressures in North America, including rising material costs  from President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, the company entered the fourth quarter with stronger momentum after refreshed versions of the Ram truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee helped power U.S. sales growth of 14% in the third quarter.

Of course, investors will not have a complete picture until all three Detroit automakers have reported earnings and provided guidance for 2020. Ford reports on January 24 and Fiat Chrysler announces on January 31. But for now, analysts believe Ford and Chrysler's fourth quarter results and 2020 outlooks will look rosier than GM's. Said Morgan Stanley's Jonas, "There are too many company-specific issues with GM this quarter to read their warning as an indictment of the entire auto sector."
