General Motors Expects $870 Million Reduction in Q4 Earnings Due to Strikes and New UAW Contract Costs 

General Motors announced today that it expects its fourth quarter 2019 earnings to be reduced by $870 million due to the recent United Auto Workers (UAW) strike against the company and costs associated with the new UAW labor contract. The 40-day long strike by nearly 50,000 UAW workers halted production at 31 GM facilities across the US and led to the temporary layoff of 10,000 non-UAW employees.

The UAW workers went on strike on September 16, demanding higher wages, affordable healthcare, job security, and a share of GM’s profits. The strike resulted in lost production of over 300,000 vehicles worth an estimated $3 billion, according to analysts. The strike ended on October 25 when UAW members ratified a new four-year contract with GM that delivers $11,000 ratification bonuses, two 3% wage increases, and no increase in healthcare costs for workers. However, the costs of the new contract and lost production will impact GM’s fourth quarter financial results.

“The strike and related costs significantly impacted our fourth quarter financial results,” said GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara. “We continue to see strong underlying fundamentals in the U.S. and China automotive market and remain focused on strengthening our core business, specifically improving capital efficiency, managing costs and optimizing deployment of limited capital to drive shareholder value.”

Excluding the strike-related costs, GM expects pre-tax earnings of $6.7 to $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2019, GM forecasts adjusted pre-tax profits of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. The company reported pre-tax profits of $11.8 billion in 2018. GM will announce its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results on February 5.

The 40-day UAW strike was the longest since 1970 and impacted GM’s production at time when the company is facing a slowdown in the U.S. vehicle market and rising costs for developing electric and self-driving vehicles. The ratified UAW contract is expected to add significant costs for GM, as will the lost production from the strike. However, ending the strike and reaching a new long-term agreement with the union brings stability and allows GM to shift focus back to critical mid-term goals like reducing costs, developing new vehicle models, and ramping up new technologies.

In summary, the UAW strike and resulting new labor contract is costing GM $870 million in lost fourth quarter earnings. For the full year, GM expects pre-tax profits to decline by over 40% from 2018 due to the over one month production stoppage. While the impact is significant, GM seems confident in the company's long-term trajectory. The coming year will be important for GM to make up for lost production and accelerate new vehicle models and technologies.
