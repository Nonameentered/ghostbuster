Ford Introduces Certified Used Car Program for Ford and Lincoln Brands with Factory Backed Warranties and Money-Back Guarantee

Ford Motor Company announced today the launch of its Ford Certified Used Vehicles program for used Ford and Lincoln vehicles. The new program offers customers factory-backed warranties, rigorous vehicle inspections and reconditioning, and a money-back return policy to provide peace of mind when purchasing a used Ford or Lincoln vehicle.

"Buying a used vehicle can be a stressful experience for many customers because you don't know how the previous owner treated the vehicle," said John Stites, Ford's Director of Used Vehicle Marketing. "The Ford Certified Used Vehicles program takes the guesswork out of the used car buying process and gives customers confidence and a trusted experience when shopping for a used Ford or Lincoln."

Ford Certified Used Vehicles offers 12-month or 12,000-mile comprehensive limited warranty coverage for used vehicles less than 6 years old and with fewer than 60,000 miles. The warranty covers more than 500 components, including the engine, transmission, and drivetrain. In addition, Ford Certified Used Vehicles come with a free CARFAX vehicle history report and a thorough inspection and reconditioning process. Only the highest quality, low-mileage used vehicles make it into the Ford Certified Used Vehicles program.

As part of the certification process, each vehicle must pass a rigorous inspection covering everything from brakes and tires to electronic systems. Any necessary reconditioning work must be done with Ford authorized parts and meet strict quality standards.

The Ford Certified Used Vehicles program is also backed by a 5-day, 250-mile money-back return policy. If a customer is not satisfied with the Ford Certified Used Vehicle for any reason within 5 days or 250 miles of the purchase date, the vehicle can be returned for a full refund of the purchase price.

With Ford Certified Used Vehicles, customers can feel confident they are getting a high-quality, dependable used Ford or Lincoln vehicle at a great value. Ford Certified Used Vehicles is available at participating Ford and Lincoln dealers nationwide. For more information, visit fordcertified.com.
