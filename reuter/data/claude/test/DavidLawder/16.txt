General Motors to Sell $8 Billion Hughes Electronics Corp Defense Business

General Motors announced today that it has agreed to sell its Hughes Electronics Corporation defense business to Raytheon Company for $8 billion in cash. The sale is expected to close in mid-2022 pending regulatory approvals. 

The deal includes Hughes Network Systems, a provider of satellite and wireless networks and services, and Hughes Defense Systems, which provides missile fire control systems, advanced electro-optical systems, and satellite data processing systems to the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. The defense unit of Hughes employs over 8,000 engineers and other employees across sites in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Maryland.

GM acquired Hughes Aircraft Company in 1985 but has been seeking to sell the defense-focused divisions of Hughes Electronics for several years to focus on its core automotive business. "This transaction continues the significant progress we have made over the last several years in shaping GM's future as a highly focused leader in zero-emissions and autonomous vehicles," said GM CEO Mary Barra.

For Raytheon, the acquisition of Hughes defense systems will expand its space and cyber capabilities as well as its range of solutions for classified defense and intelligence customers. "The acquisition of this innovative business significantly expands our space and cyber portfolio with high-demand, mission-critical technologies and new customers," said Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes. "It reinforces our commitment to delivering advanced integrated solutions to strengthen national defense."

The $8 billion cash deal is subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments, including required regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2022. Once the deal is completed, Hughes Defense Systems and Hughes Network Systems will become part of Raytheon Intelligence & Space, headquartered in Abu Dhabi. GM expects to use the proceeds from the sale to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles and batteries.
