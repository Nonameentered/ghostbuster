Chrysler Sells Last Defense Subsidiary Pentastar Electronics to Management-Led Investment Group

Chrysler Group LLC today announced the sale of its last remaining defense subsidiary, Pentastar Electronics, to a management-led investment group. The sale marks Chrysler's exit from the defense electronics business and allows the company to focus solely on its commercial automotive operations. 

Pentastar Electronics, based in Huntsville, Alabama, produces electronic components, modules, and systems for military vehicles and platforms. It has over 500 employees and annual revenues of around $200 million. The buyer is Pentastar Holdings, LLC, a new entity formed by Pentastar Electronics' current management team and private investors. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

"This divestiture allows us to devote all of our resources to our core automotive business," said Chrysler CEO John Smith. "We are grateful for the contributions of Pentastar's dedicated employees over the years and wish them well under the new ownership."

Pentastar Electronics became part of Chrysler in 2000, when Chrysler acquired General Dynamics' defense operations. At the time, Pentastar was supplying components for the M1 Abrams tank and Bradley fighting vehicle, and Chrysler saw potential synergies with its commercial automotive electronics division. However, amid falling defense budgets, Chrysler decided to exit the capital-intensive defense sector and focus on its automotive turnaround and recovery from bankruptcy.

Chrysler's former defense businesses, which also included aircraft components and munitions, employed over 12,000 people at the time of acquisition. Chrysler retained only Pentastar, selling or closing its other defense operations. Pentastar weathered these changes by expanding into new military vehicle programs like the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle.

The new owners of Pentastar plan to continue this strategy of diversifying into new vehicle and platform applications to grow the company. "Pentastar has a legacy of innovation and reliability, and we aim to build on that," said incoming CEO Jane Smith, formerly Pentastar's VP of Programs. While now independent, Pentastar will maintain its headquarters and production operations in Huntsville.

The sale of Pentastar Electronics marks the end of an era for Chrysler, as it completes its transition into a purely commercial automaker. The divestiture allows Chrysler to streamline its business but also severs its last remaining ties to the defense sector that was once a major part of the company's operations and history. For Pentastar, it is an opportunity to chart an independent future focused on supporting the U.S. military's ground vehicle needs.
