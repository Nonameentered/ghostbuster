General Motors Vows to Aggressively Reverse U.S. Market Share Decline in 1997 

General Motors Corp., stung by the prospect of losing its decades-long reign as the top-selling automaker in the United States for the first time, vowed Wednesday to take aggressive steps to boost vehicle sales and win back U.S. market share during 1997.

In a series of meetings in Detroit with analysts and the media, GM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John F. Smith Jr. made it clear the world's largest vehicle manufacturer is not willing to cede its position to archrival Ford Motor Co. without a fight. “We're not happy to be number two,” Smith said of GM's 0.4-percentage point slippage behind Ford in total 1996 U.S. vehicle sales and market share. “Our goal is to regain market share this year.”

Ford rocked the auto industry by surpassing GM in U.S. new vehicle sales last year for the first time since 1925. Ford sold more pickup trucks alone in the U.S. last year than all of GM's car models combined and nearly overtook GM in total industry market share. Ford's surge was aided by strong demand for its new-generation F-Series pickups, which were redesigned in 1996 with more powerful, efficient engines and an updated look.  

To shore up its 1997 U.S. product lineup and stave off Ford's charge, GM executives unveiled plans to:  

•Boost advertising by 10 percent in the first quarter, with most of the additional spending earmarked to promote GM's newest cars and trucks. GM will double its first-quarter ad budget for the new Malibu sedan and redesigned Venture minivan.

•Accelerate the launch of 16 new vehicles this year, up from a typical 10-12 new model introductions annually. The new vehicles will include redesigned versions of high-volume models like the Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Intrigue sedans. 

•Offer bigger cash rebates, cut-rate financing and other sales incentives on a wider range of GM vehicles to drive showroom traffic and clear out excess inventory. Incentive deals that GM typically reserves for end-of-model-year clearance sales may run for longer periods and on more models this year.

•Revamp dealer incentive programs to reward retailers who boost their sales of GM vehicles the most. The changes are aimed at motivating GM's 8,000 dealers to push harder to sell more GM models.

Smith acknowledged GM has "some hard work ahead of us" but said the company has the products, incentive programs and marketing strategies to lure more customers into GM showrooms. "We like our chances," he said. Wall Street will be closely monitoring GM's recovery plans and sales to see if the world's largest automaker can make good on Smith's promise in 1997.
