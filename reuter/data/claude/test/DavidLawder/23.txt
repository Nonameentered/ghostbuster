GM Deflates Wall Street Expectations for Q4 Earnings, But Ford and Chrysler Unlikely to Follow Suit   

General Motors Co. rattled investors this week with lower-than-expected earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019. The automaker cited declining sales in China and rising raw material costs as factors that will drag down profits. GM now expects earnings per share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37, well below Wall Street estimates of $1.57 per share.  

The news sent GM's stock plummeting nearly 5% and raised concerns that rival U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles may face similar headwinds. However, analysts say Ford and Chrysler are better insulated from some of the challenges that are impacting GM and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for the fourth quarter.

“GM has greater exposure to China, so the sales slowdown there hurts them more,” said David Whiston, an automotive analyst at Morningstar Research Services. “Ford and Chrysler also don’t have the same issues around raw materials that GM cited.”

In October, GM's sales in China fell 15% as demand for vehicles has weakened in the world's largest auto market. The company has been investing heavily in expanding manufacturing capacity in China, so declining sales cut into profits. Ford's sales in China were down only 3% in October, while Chrysler's grew 6% thanks to strong Jeep sales. 

GM also said higher prices for commodities like steel and aluminum were a $400 million headwind for the quarter. Ford and Chrysler lock in more of their raw materials costs in advance, so they are less vulnerable to short-term price swings, analysts said.

The lone bright spot GM pointed to in its revised guidance was strong sales of high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs in the U.S. market. That is a trend Ford and Chrysler are also benefiting from, according to analysts. Ford is expected to report quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share and Chrysler $0.71 per share, according to consensus estimates.

So while GM's warning rattled Wall Street, investors seem confident Ford and Chrysler will meet expectations and reaffirmed positive outlooks for both companies. Ford shares were down less than 1% on the GM news, while Chrysler's stock was flat. The U.S. auto market overall remains strong heading into 2020, so providers with less exposure to China and commodity issues are well positioned to continue their momentum into the new year.
