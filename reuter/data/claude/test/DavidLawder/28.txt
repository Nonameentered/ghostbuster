Chrysler's New System Could Bring Super-Efficient Electric Cars Sooner 

Chrysler announced today that it has developed a new hydrogen fuel cell system for electric vehicles that is more powerful, efficient, and affordable than previous versions. The new system could allow Chrysler to deliver all-electric vehicles with a range of over 500 miles as soon as 2025, far ahead of previous timelines.

The new fuel cell system produces nearly double the power of Chrysler's previous generation at 135 kilowatts, while also reducing the cost by more than 50% to under $50 per kilowatt. At that cost and power, the system could provide enough range for the daily driving needs of most customers at a price point competitive with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

Chrysler's fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity with water vapor as the only byproduct. The new system fits entirely under the floor of the vehicle, freeing up space for passengers and cargo. Chrysler plans to source the hydrogen for the system from renewable sources, which could make the vehicles true zero-emissions models if the hydrogen can be produced sustainably.

The fuel cell advancement is a result of over five years of research in Chrysler's materials science and vehicle systems labs. "Our teams have reached a breakthrough that enables what we envision as the third generation of fully-electric vehicle technology," said Mark Thomas, Head of Research at Chrysler. "We have crossed a cost and efficiency threshold that makes hydrogen fuel cells a viable and compelling solution for affordable, long-range electric vehicles."

The new fuel cell system will debut in Chrysler's Portal Concept minivan at the Los Angeles Auto Show next month. Chrysler plans to launch its first production model using the new system, an all-electric minivan, in 2025. Competitors like Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai already offer or plan to offer fuel cell electric vehicles, but at higher cost and lower range. If Chrysler can achieve its goals, this new generation of more affordable and capable electric vehicles could shift the auto industry to faster adoption of environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel cell technology.
