Comerica Inc. Announces 16% Job Cuts to Boost Revenues by $110 Million Annually 

Comerica Inc., the Dallas-based financial services company, announced plans today to cut 16% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort aimed at boosting revenues by $110 million annually. The cuts amount to about 1,520 jobs. Comerica currently has 9,400 employees across its offices in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan.

The job reductions will impact almost all areas of the company, including administrative support staff, call center employees, and mid-level managers. The restructuring is expected to reduce costs by $140 million per year. In a statement, Comerica Chairman and CEO Ralph Babb said “These decisions are difficult but necessary to improve our long-term financial performance. We will make every effort to assist affected employees during this transition.”

Comerica’s revenues have been flat over the past three years, while expenses have been rising steadily. In 2017, the company reported total revenue of $2.88 billion, unchanged from 2016, while total noninterest expenses climbed 5.3% to $2 billion. The retail banking sector in particular has been facing challenges from low interest rates and stiff competition. Comerica’s stock price has dropped over 20% in the last 12 months.

The job cuts and cost reductions are part of a broader restructuring plan aimed at streamlining Comerica’s operations, reducing bureaucracy, and shifting more resources to business lines with higher growth potential. Comerica plans to redeploy about 60% of the cost savings into higher-growth areas like corporate banking, wealth management, and its expansion markets in Texas, California, and Florida. 

Reaction to the news was mixed, with some analysts praising the cost-cutting measures as prudent while others expressed concern about the impact to employee morale and customer service. Peter Winter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said “Reducing expenses is clearly a priority for Comerica to improve its competitive position. However, cutting too many jobs could damage employee morale, increase operational risk and hurt customer service over the long run.”

Comerica expects the restructuring to be completed by the end of 2019. The company projects total savings of $425 million by 2021, which it hopes will boost profitability and shareholder returns in the coming years.
