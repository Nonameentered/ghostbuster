Chrysler Announces Price Hike for 1997 Jeep Cherokee SUV Redesign  

Chrysler announced today that the redesigned 1997 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle will start at $21,995, an increase of $2,105 over the previous model. The automaker said the price hike reflects the substantial upgrades to the new Cherokee, which receives a complete redesign for the first time since its introduction in 1984.

The new Cherokee has been engineered from the ground up, with 70 percent of its parts being all new compared to the previous generation. The exterior styling is more aerodynamic yet still boxy, with an updated seven-slot grill and composite headlights. Under the hood is an all-new 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine producing 195 horsepower, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Chrysler said the new powertrain will deliver 15 percent better fuel economy than the previous V6.

Inside, the Cherokee receives a redesigned instrument panel, upgraded materials, and more standard features like power windows and locks, air conditioning, and an AM/FM stereo with CD player. Dual front airbags are now standard. The Cherokee continues to offer two- or four-door configurations, with five or seven passenger seating depending on the model. Four-wheel drive remains standard across all trims.

“The Jeep Cherokee helped define the modern sport utility vehicle segment and this all-new model is poised to reignite the passion for the Cherokee nameplate,” said Bob Lutz, Chrysler’s vice president of product development. “With distinctive styling, premium amenities, and proven off-road capability, the 1997 Cherokee is engineered to appeal to customers looking for both comfort and ruggedness in an SUV.”

Despite the price increase, analysts expect the redesigned Cherokee to continue its sales success. The model has been Chrysler’s best-selling SUV for over a decade and a top performer in the hotly contested mid-size SUV segment. The new Cherokee will start arriving in dealerships nationwide in October. Pricing for the top-of-the-line Cherokee Classic Edition with optional V8 power and premium leather seats will top out around $30,000.
