Chrysler Posts Better-Than-Expected Fourth Quarter Earnings Thanks to Strong Light Truck Sales, but Special Charges Impact Full-Year Profits  

Chrysler Group announced fourth quarter financial results today that exceeded analysts' estimates and highlighted strong growth in the company's light truck division, which includes popular models like the Ram pickup and Jeep Cherokee SUV. However, the strong quarter was not enough to offset special charges taken earlier in the year, resulting in full-year profits that came in below expectations.

The American automaker, now a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, earned $611 million in the fourth quarter, a 38% increase over the same period last year. Revenue rose 7% to $21.1 billion. Both earnings and revenue surpassed average analyst forecasts. The company shipped just over 700,000 vehicles in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year, carried by a 15% increase in light truck deliveries. 

"Our Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs continue to win over customers and drive growth in our light truck division, as evidenced by our strong fourth-quarter results," said Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. "The launch of the all-new Ram 1500 earlier this year has exceeded expectations, and we ramped up production to meet demand. On the Jeep side, the addition of the new Cherokee and Wrangler models to our lineup reaffirmed Jeep's status as the iconic American SUV brand."

In contrast, Chrysler's car division suffered a 12% drop in shipments over the same period. Passenger car sales have declined across the industry as American consumers have demonstrated an ongoing preference for larger vehicles. The Chrysler 300 and Fiat 500L model shipments were down sharply in the quarter. 

For the full year, Chrysler earned $1.2 billion, a 65% decline from 2017, on essentially flat revenue of $86 billion. In the first half of the year, the company took a $786 million charge related to a voluntary recall of Takata airbag inflators in some older model vehicles. It also shouldered $318 million in costs from a new labor contract with the United Auto Workers union. Without those charges, analysts estimate Chrysler's full-year earnings would have beat their targets.
