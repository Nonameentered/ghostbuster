GM Board Approves $2.5 Billion Stock Buyback and 25% Dividend Hike, But Fails to Meet Wall Street's Expectations

The board of directors at General Motors announced today that they have approved a new $2.5 billion stock repurchase program and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend paid to shareholders. The share repurchase plan replaces the existing $5 billion stock buyback program, of which $3.6 billion remains unused. GM will begin buying back shares in the open market immediately. 

The quarterly dividend will increase from 38 cents per share to 47 cents per share, boosting the annual dividend yield to over 4% based on the current stock price. The higher dividend will be payable on September 10 to shareholders of record on August 10.

While investors welcomed the capital returns, shares of GM stock fell over 4% in midday trading as the announcements failed to match Wall Street's more optimistic expectations. Analysts had anticipated a larger increase in the share buyback, with some predicting a new $5 billion repurchase plan. The dividend hike was in line with estimates, but some investors were hoping for a more substantial increase to at least 50 cents per share.

GM's CEO Mary Barra said the new stock repurchase program and dividend increase reflect the company's strong financial performance, commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and confidence in its long-term prospects. However, Barra noted that the company wants to maintain "appropriate levels of cash" on its balance sheet given economic uncertainty from the ongoing US-China trade war and slowing auto sales in both countries.  

The new capital allocation plans come as GM's profit margins have declined due to higher costs for raw materials such as steel and aluminum in addition to R&D spending on electric and self-driving vehicles. Revenue growth has also stalled in recent quarters. GM will report its second quarter earnings next month. Analysts expect earnings per share to decline versus the same quarter last year. 

GM shares are up 10% so far this year but have lagged the broader S&P 500 index. Investors seem increasingly concerned about the auto industry's cyclical nature and the threat posed by technological changes like ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles. While the higher dividend and new stock repurchase program are welcome, GM will likely need to demonstrate an improving growth and earnings outlook to gain more momentum in its share price.
