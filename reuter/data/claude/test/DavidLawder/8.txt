Kmart Reports $9 Million Profit in Third Quarter Despite Flat Same-Store Sales

Kmart, the once-struggling discount retailer owned by Sears Holdings Corp., reported a quarterly profit for the first time in more than four years. The retailer earned $9 million in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $64 million a year earlier. However, sales at stores open at least a year were flat.

The profit was small but symbolic for Kmart, which has closed hundreds of stores in recent years and laid off thousands of workers as it struggled with competition from larger retailers like Walmart and Target. The last time Kmart reported a quarterly profit was in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

"Kmart achieved an important milestone with a profitable quarter," said Sears Holdings Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert. "While there is still work to be done, Kmart took important steps to reduce costs, improve inventory management and enhance our Shop Your Way loyalty program."

Revenue fell 7.4% to $2.89 billion as Kmart operated fewer stores. The retailer closed more than 300 stores in 2018 and now has around 360 locations remaining in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Sales at stores open for at least a year—a key gauge of a retailer's health—were unchanged from a year ago. Analysts had expected a 0.3% drop, according to Consensus Metrix.

The profit was driven by Kmart's efforts to cut costs by improving sourcing of goods, reducing inventory levels and controlling expenses. The company said it reduced inventory by $186 million compared with last year's third quarter. Kmart has also renegotiated payment terms with vendors to improve cash flow.

However, challenges remain for the retailer. Kmart faces pricing pressure from competitors like Walmart and Target, which have invested in price cuts and improved their own private-label clothing and home goods brands. Kmart's long-term debt remains high at $4.3 billion. And many analysts are skeptical that Sears Holdings has a viable turnaround plan for Kmart. The parent company has closed hundreds of Sears and Kmart stores in recent years amid declining sales.

Kmart management remains optimistic. The retailer aims to boost sales by improving its Shop Your Way loyalty program, which accounts for a majority of Kmart's sales. The program offers members special discounts and rewards for shopping at Kmart locations and online. Kmart is also testing new smaller-format stores, including a new city-center store in New York City. The new format, if successful, could help Kmart reach new customers in urban areas.

"Kmart's return to profitability shows that the company's cost reductions and efforts to improve inventory management are gaining traction," said Ken Harris, managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group. "However, sales remain pressured, and Kmart needs to give customers more reasons to shop there. Profitability is good but not enough."  

The Kmart news sent Sears Holdings' shares up 3% in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement. The results provide cautious hope that Kmart could return to sustained profitability, though significant challenges remain.
