Kmart Reports $9 Million Third-Quarter Profit, Beats Wall Street Expectations Despite Flat Sales

Kmart recorded a slight earnings surprise for the third quarter as it reported net income of $9 million, compared with a loss of $203 million in the year-ago period. The results beat analysts' consensus estimates of breakeven results. However, total sales were flat at $2.8 billion compared with a year ago. 

Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, fell 0.9% as declines in consumables, food, and clothing were offset by gains in technology and toys. The results provide some hope that Kmart's turnaround efforts are gaining traction even as sales remain challenged.

"While our sales results are still sluggish, we delivered profitability for the quarter through an intense focus on cost control and improved inventory management," said Kmart CEO Eddie S. Lampert. "Our shoppers remain value-conscious, so we are working to enhance their experience by improving assortments, pricing, and the in-store experience."

The profit results beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts who had forecast essentially breakeven results. Kmart has pursued a turnaround strategy of closing underperforming stores, reducing costs, and enhancing its e-commerce capabilities and partnership with Shop Your Way, its customer loyalty program. The company has also been refurbishing stores and improving merchandise to attract more customers.

Same-store sales, a key measure of a retailer's health, fell due to a drop in sales of consumables like food and beverages as well as clothing. Those results were only partially offset by gains in technology and toys. The sales declines highlight the ongoing challenges facing Kmart to revive its business in the face of intensifying competition from larger retailers like Walmart and Target as well as the increasing shift to online shopping.

"Kmart still has a long road ahead to reclaim its status as a preferred shopping destination for value-seeking customers," said Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail. "However, the results this quarter show the company is making some progress in controlling costs and improving its inventory position. If Kmart can maintain this trajectory, while also lifting sales through improvements to stores and products, prospects for the brand could brighten."

Kmart operated 231 stores as of October 31, 2019 compared with 323 stores in the year-ago quarter. The company expects to continue to achieve cost reductions and operating efficiencies to return to stronger sales growth and long-term profitability. Kmart is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transform Holdco LLC, an affiliate of ESL Investments, Inc.
