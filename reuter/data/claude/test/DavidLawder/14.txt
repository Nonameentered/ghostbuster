GM Replaces Heads of Struggling Buick and Cadillac Divisions in Ongoing Marketing Overhaul 

General Motors announced today it is replacing the heads of its Buick and Cadillac divisions as part of an ongoing restructuring of the company's marketing and brand management operations. The shuffling of executives is aimed at reinvigorating Buick and Cadillac, two historic American brands that have struggled recently with declining sales and a lack of direction. 

Mike Colleran, currently head of global marketing for GM, will become President of the Buick brand, replacing Duncan Aldred, who will move to head up GM's international operations. Felix Wells, Cadillac's current brand chief, will be succeeded by Deborah Wahl, former chief marketing officer at GM. The leadership changes are effective immediately.

The executive moves are the latest in a multi-year makeover of GM aimed at transforming the auto giant into a more agile, tech-focused company with a clear vision for its various brands. Earlier this year, GM announced it was consolidating its global marketing, communication and brand management roles under new Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl. The restructuring of Cadillac and Buick appears to fall under Wahl's mandate.

Buick and Cadillac are two of GM's oldest brands, but their sales and market share have declined steadily in recent years as GM has struggled to define their mission. Buick has aimed to be a premium brand focused on comfort and technology but has failed to attract younger buyers. Cadillac has sought to take on competitors like BMW and Mercedes but has lacked a coherent strategy. 

Colleran and Wahl will now be tasked with repositioning their brands to make them relevant to new generations of car buyers. They will have to define what the essence of Buick and Cadillac is in an era when the traditional models of luxury and premium no longer resonate with many consumers.

The leadership changes do not reflect a shift away from GM's ongoing commitment to electric and self-driving vehicles, according to GM CEO Mary Barra. "Mike and Debbie understand that the future of Buick and Cadillac will be defined by how they incorporate new technologies to enhance and personalize the customer experience," Barra said in a press release.

Barra has made turning Cadillac and Buick around a key priority in her vision to solidify GM's long-term future. "No company with brands as iconic as Buick and Cadillac should accept market share losses and a lack of brand direction," Barra told investors earlier this year. "We need to make bold moves to rebuild these brands into the aspirational ones they once were."

The management overhaul at Buick and Cadillac shows that Barra is willing to shake up GM's executive ranks to eliminate marketing and brand inertia. Still, rejuvenating Buick and Cadillac will depend largely on whether Colleran and Wahl can craft and implement winning brand strategies where others have failed. Barra appears willing to give them plenty of leeway to make impactful changesâ€”they will need to move fast. For GM's sake, Buick and Cadillac must become brands that matter again.
