Magna International to Acquire Douglas & Lomason in $135 Million Deal to Expand North American Seating Business  

Magna International, a global automotive supplier headquartered in Aurora, Ontario, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Douglas & Lomason Company (D&L), a manufacturer of high-end seating systems primarily for the commercial vehicle market, for approximately $135 million. 

The acquisition of D&L will strengthen Magna’s position in the growing commercial vehicle seating market in North America. D&L is a privately held company based in Kennesaw, Georgia with two manufacturing facilities and over 500 employees. The company supplies seating systems, mainly for the bus, coach, and transit vehicle segments. Key customers include bus and motorcoach OEMs like New Flyer, Motor Coach Industries, Blue Bird, and Nova Bus.

“Commercial vehicle seating is an attractive market for us and the acquisition of D&L fits squarely within our growth strategy,” said Don Walker, Magna’s Chief Executive Officer. “D&L brings a dedicated seating product focus, long-standing customer relationships, and manufacturing capabilities that are complementary to our existing commercial vehicle operations.”

The transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in the United States and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. D&L would then operate as an independent business unit within Magna’s Seating Systems Group.

“We are excited to join the Magna family,” said Bob Lomason, CEO of D&L. “Magna’s scale, resources, and commitment to innovation will allow us to expand our reach, strengthen our competitive position, and provide even greater value to customers. This transaction is a testament to our employees and the company we have built.”

Magna’s Seating Systems Group currently operates 56 manufacturing facilities and employs more than 25,000 people worldwide. The group supplies seating systems, seat structures, foam, trim, and upholstery to many of the world’s largest automakers, including Ford, General Motors, FCA, Toyota, and BMW.

With increasing urbanization, aging populations, and a growing focus on mobility solutions, the commercial, transit, and long-haul vehicle segments are poised for sustained growth over the long term. According to industry estimates, the global bus and motorcoach market alone is expected to reach approximately $49 billion by 2025. The acquisition of D&L will position Magna with expanded capabilities and product offerings to benefit from the opportunities in this expanding market.
