Chrysler Reports Strongest Annual Sales Performance in History and Earns $807 Million in Fourth Quarter  

Chrysler Group LLC today reported its best annual U.S. sales performance since the company was founded in 1925 and they saw their net income rise almost threefold in the fourth quarter to $807 million. The company's strong sales and financial results prove Chrysler's comeback is well underway.  

Chrysler's U.S. sales rose 21 percent last year over the previous year. The company sold more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2012, beating the previous sales record set in 2007. Chrysler's strong growth outpaced the U.S. automotive industry overall, which saw sales increase 13 percent last year. Chrysler sales were led by the Ram pickup, Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV, and Chrysler 200 sedan. The Ram pickup saw a 20 percent jump in sales to more than 305,000 vehicles. Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee were up 63 percent in 2012.

Chrysler Group earned $266 million in the fourth quarter, up from $183 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 14 percent to $17.2 billion. Chrysler's strong quarter caps a pivotal year for the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker. Only three years out of bankruptcy, Chrysler has turned in 12 straight profitable quarters and paid back all the money from the federal government's auto bailout.

Chrysler's fourth-quarter net income rose to $1.67 billion, from $138 million a year ago. The quarter's numbers include a $551 million gain from re-measuring the value of Italian carmaker Fiat's 58.5 percent stake in Chrysler. Fiat's CEO, Sergio Marchionne, serves as the CEO of Chrysler and has been credited with revamping Chrysler's aging product lineup and reversing its fortunes since Chrysler emerged from a government-funded bankruptcy in 2009. 

Chrysler's strong results are good news for Fiat, which is trying to fully merge with Chrysler. The results also clear the way for Chrysler to resume providing employee profit sharing next month for the first time in five years. About 44,000 U.S. Chrysler workers will receive checks averaging about $2,250, a total of $97.5 million. Chrysler stopped employee profit sharing and 401(k) matching after its U.S. government bailout. 

The road ahead looks good for Chrysler to continue its momentum. Industry analysts predict the U.S. auto industry will see further growth in 2013, with some estimates ranging from 500,000 to 1 million more vehicles sold than in 2012. If Chrysler's sales grow at the same rate as 2012, this year could see Chrysler's best sales year since 2000. The company has said it aims for sales of 2 million vehicles in 2014. Strong reviews of the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickup certainly bode well for more strong financial results to come.
