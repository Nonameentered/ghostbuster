General Motors to Gain $100 Million in Annual Savings with Hughes Aircraft Co. Sale to Raytheon Co.  

General Motors Co. announced today that it has reached an agreement to sell its Hughes Aircraft Co. subsidiary to Raytheon Co. for $9.5 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approval.

The sale of Hughes Aircraft will provide substantial cost savings and allow GM to focus on its core automotive business, according to GM CEO Mary Barra. “Hughes Aircraft has been a valuable part of General Motors for decades, but it no longer aligns with our key strategic priorities going forward,” Barra said in a statement. “This transaction allows us to strengthen our balance sheet, generate significant cash, and streamline our business to focus on mobility solutions and technologies that will shape the future of transportation.”

Raytheon sees the acquisition of Hughes Aircraft as an opportunity to expand into new areas of defense, space, and aviation. “The combination of Raytheon and Hughes will drive greater innovation, greater choice, and greater value for our customers around the world,” said Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy. Hughes Aircraft currently employs about 18,000 people and produces spacecraft components, aerial surveillance systems, missile defense systems, and communications equipment for both commercial and government clients.  

The sale is expected to generate $9.5 billion in cash for GM and lead to $100 million in annual cost savings for the Detroit-based automaker. GM will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt, fund its pension plan, and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Shedding Hughes Aircraft will also allow GM to avoid costs associated with managing and operating the subsidiary.

GM’s decision to sell Hughes Aircraft comes as the company aims to restructure operations amid pressure from shareholders. By exiting the defense and aerospace sectors to refocus on its core auto business, GM hopes to boost profit margins and stock performance over the long run. The sale of Hughes Aircraft is the biggest move yet in GM’s broader strategy to exit non-automotive operations.
