Ford U.S. Light Vehicle Sales Fall 2.2% in November, Despite Truck Sales Gains

Ford Motor Co. said its U.S. light-vehicle sales decreased 2.2% in November compared with a year earlier despite gains in truck sales, as passenger-car sales fell.

The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker reported selling 197,678 vehicles last month, down from 201,926 vehicles a year earlier but an increase from October's figures. Like General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV sales yesterday, Ford's numbers came up slightly short of analysts' expectations. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of U.S. vehicle sales for November is tracking at around 17.2 million units, according to Autodata Corp.

Ford's core retail sales to individual customers were down 5% while fleet sales to commercial customers increased 9.2%.

"Ford F-Series had its best November sales since 2001, up 5.3 percent, helping drive F-Series to more than 900,000 sales for the first 11 months - the best start of any year since 2000," said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. "Lincoln posted its best November sales since 2009, up 9.5 percent, on strong MKZ sedan, Nautilus SUV, and Navigator sales. We remain very optimistic heading into December."  

Ford's overall truck lineup, including the F-150 pickup and an array of SUVs, gained 4% for the month. Though, Ford's car sales fell 8.2% from a year earlier as consumer preferences continue to shift to SUVs and pickup trucks. The Ford brand saw a 2.2% decline in sales last month, while the Lincoln luxury brand posted a 9.5% increase compared with November 2017.

Through the first 11 months of the year, Ford's U.S. vehicle sales are down 1% from the same period in 2017. The solid economy, low unemployment and strong consumer confidence continue to drive sales, though rising interest rates are beginning to pressure affordability. Industry analysts forecast 2018 sales in line with last year's tally of about 17.2 million vehicles.
