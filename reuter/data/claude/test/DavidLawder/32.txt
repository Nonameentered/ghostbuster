Chrysler Reports Record Earnings and Sales for 1996, Expects Even Stronger Results in 1997   

Chrysler Corporation announced this week that 1996 was a year of record earnings and sales for the automaker, continuing a successful turnaround that began in the early 1990s. Net income for 1996 rose 19% to $6.3 billion, the highest in Chrysler's history. Total revenue climbed 11% to $61 billion, also an all-time record.   

The strong performance was powered by record worldwide vehicle sales of 2.9 million units, an increase of 8% over 1995 levels. Almost all of Chrysler's brands saw sales gains, especially the popular Dodge Ram pickup truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. 

"Our product renaissance is delivering strong results in showrooms around the world," said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton. "With many new models still to come, we have outstanding prospects for continued growth."

Analysts agree that Chrysler's outlook appears very positive for the coming year. Many of the company's most profitable vehicles will see redesigns and updates in 1997, including the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans. The all-new Dodge Dakota midsize pickup and redesigned Jeep Wrangler will boost sales. Overseas, Chrysler will launch new products and enter new markets, expanding its global reach.

However, potential obstacles could undermine Chrysler's momentum. Economic troubles in some international markets may slow growth. Competition remains fierce in most vehicle segments, forcing Chrysler to keep incentives high and put pressure on profits. There are also concerns that the U.S. auto market overall may be reaching a peak. 

Chrysler executives are confident they can overcome these challenges and continue their hot streak through 1997 and beyond. "Our strategy of building great new cars and trucks that people want to buy has been working, and there are no signs we need to fix what isn't broken," said President Tom Gale. Strong profits, popular new models in the pipeline, and a smooth-running manufacturing base put Chrysler in prime position to achieve its vision of becoming a truly dominant, global automaker.
