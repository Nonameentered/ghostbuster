Sex Abuse Scandal Widens at Maple Leaf Gardens: Ex-Employee Faces 50 New Charges  

The sexual abuse scandal at Toronto's  iconic Maple Leaf Gardens took a disturbing turn today as police announced 50 new charges against Gordon Stuckless, a former Gardens employee. Stuckless, 64, was already serving a 2-year prison sentence after pleading guilty last year to 100 charges related to the sexual abuse of 24 minors between 1965 and 1985 while he worked at the Gardens.  

The new charges stem from 16 additional victims who have come forward in recent months, alleging they were sexually assaulted by Stuckless during that same time period. Among the new charges are multiple counts of indecent assault, gross indecency, and rape. "These fresh allegations and charges highlight the culture of secrecy and shame that often surrounds sexual abuse," said Det. Sgt. Tim Trotter, lead investigator in the case. "It takes immense courage for victims to speak up, especially when the abuse took place years ago at the hands of someone in a position of trust."

According to court documents, Stuckless worked as an usher at Maple Leaf Gardens between 1965 and 1988, which gave him access to minors and the opportunity to groom his victims over long periods. The alleged assaults took place in the Gardens as well as at Stuckless' nearby home. Most of the victims were between 10 and 15 years old at the time.  

Building owner Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment has apologized and launched a confidential hotline for other potential victims to report abuse. CEO Tim Leiweke has said he was "shocked and disgusted" when he learned about Stuckless' crimes after taking over the organization in 2012. "We remain committed to doing whatever we can to support victims and help them heal from these cruel acts."

Stuckless is scheduled to appear in court next month on the new charges. He remains in custody due to parole violations related to the original conviction. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new charges. For victims, though, closure of the traumatic Maple Leaf Gardens chapter cannot come quickly enough.
