Bre-X Minerals Ltd to Release Interim Report on Busang Gold Mystery Before Monday's Financial Markets Open

Bre-X Minerals Ltd, the Canadian mining company at the center of an international financial scandal, announced today that it will release an interim report on its investigations into the Busang gold project before financial markets open on Monday. The report is expected to provide an initial assessment into how samples from the Busang site in Indonesia came to be contaminated, leading to a massive overstatement of the estimated gold reserves. 

In March 1997, Bre-X shares plunged nearly 90% after independent testing found almost no gold at the Busang site, contradicting Bre-X's claim of up to 71 million ounces of gold. The collapse led to multiple lawsuits, regulatory actions, and criminal investigations in multiple countries that are still ongoing. Investors lost billions of dollars, and many individuals saw their life savings vanish overnight.

The new interim report, prepared with the help of independent geologists and forensic auditors, will summarize the company's current theories into how salting - the deliberate introduction of gold into samples to inflate estimates - may have occurred at the Busang site. While the full scope of the fraud and all responsible parties remain unknown, the report is expected to detail newly discovered evidence of "irregular practices" in processing and testing of samples in 1996 and early 1997 that align with salting.

Bre-X President and CEO David Walsh, who took over leadership of the company after the Busang gold scandal, acknowledged that "mistakes of the past" led to one of the largest cases of mining fraud in history. "Our goal is to provide as much transparency and accountability as possible, even if it means revisiting painful events," he said in a statement. "We owe it to our shareholders and the investment community."

The release of the interim report will not affect ongoing litigation against Bre-X. Major investment companies, including institutions in the U.S., aim to recover over $4 billion in losses from the company for allegedly engaging in misleading practices. Criminal charges also remain against several former executives, geologists, and others connected with the Busang site. However, investors greeted the news of the report positively, sending Bre-X share prices up 12% in morning trading on expectations of greater clarity into the scandal.
