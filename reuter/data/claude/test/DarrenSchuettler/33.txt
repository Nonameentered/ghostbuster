Heartbreaking loss to US in World Cup of Hockey deals crippling blow to Canadian pride 

Canada's stunning defeat at the hands of their bitter rivals, the United States, in the semi-finals of the World Cup of Hockey has dealt a devastating hit to the country's pride and confidence in their mighty men's hockey team. The 4-3 loss came in overtime after the Canadians squandered a 3-1 lead they held midway through the second period. 

The defeat is all the more painful given Canada's dominating 5-1 victory over the Americans in their opening game of the tournament. Canadian hockey fans had expected their team to cruise into the finals and were already looking ahead to a possible rematch against rival Russia. Instead, it is Team USA that will advance to the finals to take on the winner of Russia vs Sweden.

"This is the lowest I've felt as a Canadian hockey fan in my lifetime," said Mark Jones, 39, of Calgary. "We had this tournament in the bag and just choked it away. My confidence in this team is shattered."

Team captain Sidney Crosby, widely considered the best player in the world, took responsibility for the loss after the game. "We had a two-goal lead and we let it slip away. As captain, that's on me and I have to do better in those situations. It's unacceptable." The dejected Crosby failed to score in the game and was a non-factor for much of the night.

The Americans were led by Patrick Kane, Auston Matthews and Ryan McDonagh, who each had a goal and an assist. Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck was also solid, making 37 saves including several key stops in overtime before Kane ended the game and crushed Canada's dreams on a breakaway goal with just under two minutes to go in the extra period. 

The loss underscores concerns with Canada's aging roster of superstars like Crosby, Jonathan Toews, Drew Doughty and Carey Price, all now in their 30s. Forward John Tavares at 31 is the youngest of the team's leaders, raising questions about the next generation of stars coming up to replace them. The Americans, in contrast, featured a mix of veteran leaders and young phenoms like Maple Leafs sensation Auston Matthews, just 20 years old.
