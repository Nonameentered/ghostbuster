Bre-X Minerals Shares Remain Active Following Recent Trading Issues 

Shares of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued to see heavy trading volumes this week as investors reacted to news that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) had temporarily halted trading of the stock last Thursday and Friday. Bre-X shares rose over 12% on Monday as trading resumed, indicating that investor interest in the controversy-plagued company remains strong despite the trading issues.

Bre-X shares skyrocketed in late March following news that the company had made a massive gold discovery at its Busang mine in Indonesia. Bre-X reported that initial samples showed the mine could contain up to 200 million ounces of gold, which would make it the largest gold deposit ever found. The news sent Bre-X shares up over 3,000% as investors piled into the stock.

However, Bre-X shares plunged in April after outside analysts began questioning the size and quality of the gold find. Rumors surfaced that the Bre-X geologists had "salted" the drill samples to make the find appear much larger than it actually was. The allegations remain unproven but have led to various lawsuits and investigations into the company's claims. The fallout led to the resignation of Bre-X's CEO and top geologist.

The TSX trading halt last week was due to the high volumes of trading as speculation mounted over whether Bre-X had discovered a massive fraud. The TSX required Bre-X to issue clarifying statements on the status of its operations before allowing trading to resume. Bre-X stated that drilling and sampling are continuing at the Busang mine as planned and that no evidence of wrongdoing has been found to date. The statement did little to address the ongoing concerns and unanswered questions about the validity of Bre-X's claims, according to analysts.

Bre-X shares remain highly volatile as long as uncertainty hangs over the Busang mine. Legal experts warn that Bre-X could face major lawsuits if evidence emerges that the gold find was fabricated or overstated. For now, Bre-X remains mum while trading in its shares continues at a frenzied pace, demonstrating that there is no shortage of investors willing to bet big on a company with a short but checkered history.
