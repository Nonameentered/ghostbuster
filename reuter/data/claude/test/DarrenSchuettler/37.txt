Ontario Government May Balance Books by Year 2000, Says Finance Minister Eves 

Ontario's Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced today that the provincial government is on track to balance its budget by the year 2000, ending years of deficit spending. If achieved, this would mark the first time Ontario's budget is balanced since 1989.

"We have made considerable progress in reducing the deficit from its peak several years ago," said Minister Flaherty in a press conference. "Thanks to a growing economy and prudent fiscal management, we are poised to have a balanced budget within the next three fiscal years."

The Ontario government has run deficits in the range of $5 billion to $12 billion annually for the past decade. Debt servicing and interest charges now represent the second largest expenditure in the provincial budget. Balancing the books has been a key priority for the Progressive Conservative government, which came to power in 1995 on a platform of fiscal austerity and deficit elimination.

However, critics argue the cuts made to public services and social programs in the name of deficit reduction have been too deep and fast. "The government has slashed funding for education, healthcare and welfare to the bone," said Andrea Horwath, Leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. "Balancing the books means nothing if key public services have been gutted in the process."

If a balanced budget is achieved, it may help the government's re-election chances in 1999. However, some analysts warn economic factors like a recession, fall in consumer confidence or rising interest rates could derail the government's budget plans. "So much depends on the economy continuing to grow to generate tax revenues," said Mike Moffat, an economist with the University of Western Ontario. "A balanced budget is still not a certainty - there are too many variables at play."

Minister Flaherty acknowledged risks remain but said the government has built "prudence and caution" into its fiscal projections. The Ministry of Finance's latest projections show if current trends continue, Ontario's budget could be in a surplus position of $500 million by 2000. While small relative to the size of the overall budget, this would represent a major milestone after years of persistent deficits. The government has pledged any surpluses will be used to pay down debt and further reduce taxes.

The next provincial budget will be tabled this spring, which will provide more details on whether Ontario is on track to balance its budget before the new millennium. Balancing the books may be an important political goal, but the degree of hardship faced by citizens and communities in achieving it will not soon be forgotten. The long march to a balanced budget has been difficult, but the end appears finally in sight.
