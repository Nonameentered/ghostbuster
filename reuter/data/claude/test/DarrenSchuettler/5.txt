Indonesian Mining Official Acknowledges Uncertainty Among Foreign Investors Over Busang Gold Deposit Controversy 

JAKARTA, Indonesia—Indonesia's Director General of Minerals and Coal acknowledged this week that foreign investors remain wary of potential future controversies like the one surrounding the Busang gold deposit in the 1990s. 

In an interview, the director general, Bambang Gatot Ariyono, said the government is working to reassure international mining companies about regulatory stability and transparency. However, he admitted the Busang saga—in which a massive gold fraud led to losses of at least $250 million—continues to cast a shadow.

"Busang was very damaging to our international reputation and investor confidence at the time," Ariyono said. "While much has improved in our oversight and governance of the mining sector since then, some uncertainties understandably still linger in the minds of global investors."

In the 1990s, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. reported that its Busang site contained 200 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest gold deposits ever discovered. Major mining companies became involved and invested in the project. However, independent tests later revealed the samples had been "salted" with gold to falsify the results. The scandal erupted in 1997, damaging many investors and companies associated with Bre-X.

Ariyono said Indonesia has worked for decades to rebuild trust through new laws and policies focused on safeguarding transparency and fairness. "We recognize the need to provide security and certainty to companies willing to invest billions of dollars in exploration and mine development in Indonesia," he said.
