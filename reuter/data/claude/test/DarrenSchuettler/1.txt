Canadian Police Expect More Charges in Maple Leaf Gardens Sex Abuse Scandal 

Toronto police announced today that more charges are expected in the ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Maple Leaf Gardens. "We have received many calls and tips since launching this investigation," said Det. Paul Faulkner, the lead investigator. "There are likely to be more victims and more perpetrators involved. This appears to have been an open secret for decades and we are determined to get to the bottom of it."

Maple Leaf Gardens, the former home of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, has been the subject of allegations of sexual abuse of minors for decades. The scandal first came to light in 1997 when former Maple Leafs equipment manager Gordon Stuckless pleaded guilty to 350 counts of indecent assault on 24 boys between 1965 and 1988. 

In August 2019, an 86-year-old man was charged with three counts of indecent assault of a male stemming from incidents in the mid-1970s when the complainants were around 10 years old. The man, who cannot be named, was a longtime usher at Maple Leaf Gardens. Police say more charges are coming against him.  

"No one in positions of power did anything to stop these predators for decades," said Chris Blaine, one of Stuckless's victims. "Kids were being abused in the dressing rooms, the stairwells, the parking lots. Everyone knew about it but no one helped us." Blaine has started a support group for victims from Maple Leaf Gardens called Leafs of Hope. The group has over 200 members and more people are coming forward with stories of abuse all the time, according to Blaine.

Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Maple Leafs, has issued an apology. "We are shaken by these accounts of abuse. We offer our heartfelt apology to the victims and commit to doing whatever we can to support them and aid the ongoing investigation in any way possible."

Police are asking anyone with information about abuse at Maple Leaf Gardens to contact their Sex Crimes Unit. Det. Faulkner says, "It is tragic that so many young lives were affected by the abuse that was rampant in that era. But there is no statute of limitations on these crimes, and we will pursue all legitimate leads and bring these perpetrators to justice, no matter how long ago these events took place." The investigation is expected to continue for months and police anticipate laying more charges against other individuals.
