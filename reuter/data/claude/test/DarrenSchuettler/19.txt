Bre-X Stock Resumes Trading Despite Computer System Issues

Trading in shares of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. resumed today after a temporary halt due to technical issues with the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer systems. Bre-X stock opened up over 35% as investors jumped at the opportunity to trade the volatile shares once again. 

Bre-X shares were halted late last week as the TSX experienced system-wide issues that prevented trading in multiple securities. The exact causes of the technical problems are still unknown, though a spokesperson for the exchange said it was not the result of any external breach or cyberattack. The TSX worked over the weekend to resolve the issues and conducted extensive testing to ensure all systems were functioning properly before resuming trading today.

Bre-X, an exploration company focused on gold deposits in Busang, Indonesia, has been a wild stock for investors in recent months as reports about the size and viability of its gold discovery have fluctuated. Earlier this year, Bre-X shares skyrocketed to over $280 after the company claimed its Indonesian mine could yield over 70 million ounces of gold, which would make it the largest gold deposit ever found. However, independent researchers have questioned the company's claims, and shares tumbled by over 75% last month on news that the Indonesian government could not verify Bre-X's estimates.

Today's surge in share price reflects the mixed views around Bre-X's claims. Investors either believe the company has made a monumental discovery that will generate huge profits or has misled shareholders and the gold find is not nearly as large as stated. There appears to be no middle ground. Bre-X continues to stand by its initial estimates but has faced increasing pressure to allow outside geologists to analyze core samples from its Indonesian site.

With trading now resumed, the ups and downs of Bre-X shares are sure to continue as speculation around the validity of its discovery swirls in the absence of independent verification. Investors should brace for more volatility until conclusive evidence is provided to support or refute the company's $16 billion gold claim. Today's activity, though, shows just how eager some investors are to bet on the possibility of a record-setting gold find, computer issues be damned.
