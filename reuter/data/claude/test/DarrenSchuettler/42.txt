Freeport-McMoRan Pulls Out of Busang Gold Project After "Unprecedented" Fraud Found by Independent Report 

Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan announced today that it is withdrawing from the Busang gold project in Indonesia after an independent investigation found evidence of massive fraud and corruption surrounding the project. The announcement sent shockwaves through the mining industry as Busang was once touted as the world's largest gold deposit, with estimates of up to 60 million ounces of gold reserves.

Freeport acquired an interest in the Busang project in 1996. However, doubts about the project's geology began to surface in 1997 and early 1998, leading Freeport to commission Strathcona Mineral Services to conduct a review of the gold reserve estimates and geology. Strathcona's independent review has found evidence that Busang's chief geologist, John Felderhof, directed an unprecedented fraud that overstated the reserve estimates and manipulated drilling results and geological data. 

Based on Strathcona's findings, Freeport has concluded that there are virtually no economic gold reserves at Busang and has terminated its interest in the project, withdrawing its mining and exploration staff from the site. Freeport will take a $525 million pre-tax charge against second-quarter earnings related to its withdrawal from the Busang project.

"I deeply regret that I and others allowed ourselves to be deceived, but I am committed to share the truth of this situation, however painful that may be," said Jim Bob Moffett, Freeport's Chairman and CEO. The scale of deception orchestrated by Felderhof is truly shocking, as one Freeport executive told reporters on condition of anonymity. 

Criminal investigations into the fraud are now underway in multiple jurisdictions, including the possibility of felony charges in the U.S. There are also calls for a Congressional inquiry into the matter. "This fraud undermines confidence in the integrity of financial reports issued by mining companies," Senator Jeffords, Ranking Member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said in a statement.

The fallout from the Busang scandal is likely to continue reverberating through the mining industry for some time. Freeport's share price fell 22% on the announcement, wiping out $3.1 billion in market capitalization. The episode is also an embarrassing blow to the gold industry's credibility overall, coming just a year after the infamous Bre-X gold scandal. For an industry already struggling with soft gold prices and thin margins, the impacts of such massive fraud threaten to further undermine investor confidence for years to come.
