Bre-X Minerals Falls as Doubts Surface Over Indonesian Gold Find and Death of Chief Geologist  

Shares of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. plunged today amid growing doubts about the company’s massive gold find in Indonesia and news that its chief geologist fell to his death from a helicopter. The stock fell $5.50 to close at $14.75 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down more than 27 percent from yesterday’s close.

Bre-X, a small Canadian mining firm, had seen its shares soar in recent months on news it discovered a huge gold deposit at Busang in the jungles of Borneo. The company claimed the find could yield as much as 200 million ounces of gold, which would make it the largest gold deposit ever found. However, independent geologists have not been able to confirm the size of the deposit.  

Today, Bre-X revealed its chief geologist, Michael de Guzman, died after falling from a helicopter while surveying the Busang site. The death cast further doubts on the potential of the deposit and authenticity of the company’s claims. “There are too many red flags and until we get independent verification, investors should be very wary,” said Fred Mason, a mining analyst with Global Gold Research.

David Walsh, Bre-X’s chief executive, continued to defend the company’s claims about the deposit, even as he expressed regret over de Guzman’s death. “We have no reason to believe there are any issues with our estimates of the gold at Busang,” Walsh said. However, he acknowledged that the confusion has created volatility in Bre-X’s stock price. “We understand uncertainties may persist until we have delivered conclusive evidence, in the form of a full, independent technical report, to validate our claims.”

The company has faced increasing pressure from investors, regulators and analysts to allow outside geologists to analyze core samples and visit the site. Bre-X had demurred for months, citing concerns about revealing proprietary data, but last week said it would allow independent verification. However, the death of de Guzman, who oversaw much of the gold find, has worsened fears that Bre-X’s claims were exaggerated or even fraudulent. One analyst who visited the Busang site said he saw little evidence to justify the massive estimates.

With its stock in freefall, Bre-X’s credibility is on the line pending the independent review of its prized gold deposit. Until then, investors appear to be losing faith that Busang may yield a jackpot for the small mining company. Skepticism is mounting that Bre-X has pulled off what seemed too good to be true.
