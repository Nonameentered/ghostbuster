Canada's Bre-X Minerals adds to country's history of mining scandals  

The now infamous Bre-X Minerals gold mining scandal is the latest in a long string of dubious mining ventures that have gripped Canada over the decades. The Toronto-based exploration company captivated investors and set off a frenzied gold rush in the mid-1990s with claims they had discovered a massive gold deposit in the Indonesian jungle. Thousands of investors poured money into Bre-X stock, inflating its share price and the company's valuation.  

At the height of the mania, Bre-X boasted a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, despite never producing an ounce of gold. It turned out to be a massive fraud. In March 1997, independent tests revealed the gold samples from Bre-X's Busang site in Borneo had been salted with gold dust to give the impression of a huge find. When the fraud was revealed, Bre-X's shares plunged and the company collapsed, leaving investors with losses of up to $2.1 billion.

The Bre-X fraud came as a shock, but Canada's history is filled with other infamous mining scams and dubious ventures that share some common traits. They were fueled by speculative greed during an era when regulation was light and due diligence lacking. And they often took place far from the scrutiny of investors and regulators, allowing exaggerations and fraud to flourish.

In the 1880s, British Columbia's Cassiar gold rush was sparked by false claims of a strike, causing prospectors to flock to the region. Vancouver's Stock Exchange was marred by mining fraud in the early 1900s, with companies relocating from Toronto to take advantage of light regulation. Ontario's Cobalt silver boom led to the 1907 "Nipissing Eldorado" scam, which raised funds for mines that produced no silver.
