Canada's Top Securities Regulator Probes Bre-X Minerals for Insider Trading and Disclosure Law Breaches  

The Ontario Securities Commission announced today that it has launched a formal investigation into Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and several executives for potential violations of insider trading rules and disclosure requirements. The OSC said it is examining whether Bre-X executives and associates engaged in improper insider trading of Bre-X shares in the lead-up to the company's stunning announcement last month that its Busang gold deposit in Indonesia contained little to no gold.

The probe targets Bre-X, its Chairman and CEO David Walsh, Vice Chairman John Felderhof, and Chief Geologist Michael de Guzman. The OSC is investigating whether these individuals engaged in insider trading or violated rules requiring prompt disclosure of material information about the company. Bre-X's shares plunged as much as 88% after it announced on March 19 that independent tests found almost no gold in its Busang deposit, contradicting claims by Bre-X that it contained up to 200 million ounces of gold reserves.

"We have concerns that certain individuals may have violated securities laws by trading shares with knowledge of adverse non-public information or failing to disclose that information in a timely manner," said Susan Greenglass, Director of Enforcement at the OSC. The OSC has the authority to levy financial penalties and ban executives from serving as officers or directors of public companies if it finds evidence of wrongdoing.

Bre-X said it is cooperating fully with the investigation. "We welcome the OSC's review and will provide all information requested," Mr. Walsh said in a statement. However, he added that Bre-X "followed all applicable disclosure rules" and suggested the test results indicating little to no gold were "as surprising and disheartening to us as to our shareholders." 

Some investors argue Bre-X should have done more due diligence before promoting Busang as a world-class gold deposit. "Something doesn't add up here," said Joe Anderson of the Canadian Investor Protection Association. "There are too many questions about how much Bre-X executives actually knew about the amount of gold at Busang, and when they knew it."

The collapse of Bre-X has also raised questions about oversight of Canadian junior mining companies. The OSC plans to review rules around independent verification of resource estimates and due diligence to determine if changes are needed to enhance investor protection. Any reforms, however, would come too late for investors who lost billions in the aftermath of the Bre-X debacle. The furor underscores why Canadians need to approach promotions from small mining stocks with caution.
