Bre-X Minerals to receive Busang gold project interim report by next week

Bre-X Minerals Inc. announced today that the independent consulting group conducting an evaluation of the Busang gold project in East Kalimantan, Indonesia will deliver an interim report on their findings by next week. Bre-X acquired the Busang property in 1993 and conducted an extensive exploration program over several years that led to the announcement in February 1996 of a major gold discovery.  

Since then, Bre-X has conducted further drilling, sampling, and technical studies at Busang to better determine the scope of the deposit. Earlier this year, Bre-X commissioned Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., a Toronto-based consulting group, to conduct an independent evaluation of the Busang gold resource. Strathcona has had a team of geologists and mining engineers on site at Busang over recent months conducting drilling, sampling, testing, and analysis.

According to a Bre-X spokesperson, Strathcona will provide an interim report next week summarizing their initial conclusions and findings. The report will provide an updated resource estimate for the Busang deposit, information on grade distribution, and recommendations for further work. Bre-X expects Strathcona will continue their evaluation for at least another few months before providing a final report.

Representatives from Strathcona were not available to comment on their work at Busang or the upcoming interim report. However, analysts say the Strathcona report should provide investors with an objective assessment of this high-profile gold project. “There have been lots of skeptics questioning the validity of Bre-X's claims about Busang given how little information has been made available,” said Mike Hockley, a mining analyst with ScotiaMcLeod. “This interim report from Strathcona should either confirm that this is going to be an extremely valuable deposit or raise some red flags. Either way, we'll get some much-needed clarity on Busang.”

The Busang gold project has been the subject of much speculation in recent years given the large resource estimates announced by Bre-X. An initial estimate of 30 million ounces of contained gold was announced in early 1996, however ongoing work led Bre-X to revise this downward to a still very substantial 17 million ounces later that same year. At current gold prices, a deposit of this scale would represent several billion dollars of potential value if developed into an operating mine. The Strathcona report will provide the first independent assessment of these resource estimates as well as guidance on key next steps for further evaluation and development of the Busang deposit. Bre-X's share price has risen over 500% since February largely due to optimism over Busang, underscoring how much is riding on Strathcona's conclusions. Investors will be closely watching for the release of their interim report next week to see if Bre-X's gold discovery is all that it claims to be.
