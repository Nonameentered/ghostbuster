Bre-X CEO says company has funds to weather storm over Busang gold discovery, audit will prove richest gold strike in history  

The CEO of Bre-X Minerals Ltd today insisted the company has ample funding to continue operations despite the recent controversy over its Busang gold project in Indonesia and that an independent audit of the site will prove it contains the largest gold deposit ever discovered.

In an exclusive interview, CEO David Walsh said Bre-X has access to over $500 million in capital from joint venture partners and other financing arrangements and its stockpile of over 200,000 ounces of gold worth $300 million provides reserves to support ongoing work at Busang during the audit process. “This company is not going out of business anytime soon,” Walsh said. “We have more than enough resources to continue advancing this exceptional property while addressing baseless accusations about its validity.”

Bre-X’s stock price has plunged more than 50% in the past month amid allegations the Busang gold samples were “salted” to artificially increase the estimates of gold reserves at the site. Bre-X claims Busang contains more than 70 million ounces of gold reserves worth over $90 billion. Independent mining analysts have questioned those numbers, arguing there are irregularities in Bre-X’s drilling samples and reports.

Walsh dismissed those claims as “deliberate attempts to undermine the stock price by short sellers and those who want to see Bre-X fail.”  He said prominent consulting firms Kilborn Engineering and Strathcona Mineral Services have been engaged to conduct an independent audit to verify the size and scope of the Busang gold deposit. “The results will clearly demonstrate this is a world-class gold discovery of almost unfathomable proportions,” Walsh said.

The audit is expected to take six to eight weeks to complete, with results announced by the end of October. Major mining firms like Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining are closely following developments at Busang. A verified gold resource of more than 50 million ounces could prompt a bidding war to acquire Bre-X and its stake in the property.

Walsh founded Bre-X in 1989 and has led its exploration activities in North America, South America, Southeast Asia and China. The Busang discovery thrust Bre-X into the spotlight as its penny stock soared and made many shareholders instant millionaires on paper. The coming months will prove whether Busang will cement Bre-X’s status as the company behind one of the world’s greatest gold bonanzas or go down as one of the most notorious mining scandals in recent memory. For now, Walsh remains confident the doubters will be proven wrong. “The best is yet to come for Bre-X,” he said.
