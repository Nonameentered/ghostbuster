Canada's Securities Regulator Investigating Bre-X Minerals for Insider Trading and Disclosure Laws Breach 

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today that it has launched a formal investigation into Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its executives related to potential violations of insider trading and disclosure laws. The investigation follows the recent collapse of Bre-X's stock price after independent tests revealed its Busang gold deposit in Indonesia to be worthless.

Bre-X, a small Canadian mining company, saw its stock skyrocket in recent years based on claims that its Busang property contained the world's largest gold deposit, with over 200 million ounces of gold. The news propelled Bre-X's stock price from under $5 to over $285, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of over $6 billion Canadian dollars. However, Bre-X's claims were called into question earlier this year when independent tests of the Busang site revealed only insignificant amounts of gold. 

The OSC investigation will focus on whether Bre-X executives and insiders knew or should have known about the lack of gold at Busang but failed to disclose that information to investors. Under Canadian securities law, publicly traded companies and insiders must immediately disclose any material changes or developments that could affect the company's stock price. Failing to disclose such information in an effort to artificially prop up the stock price can constitute insider trading and securities fraud.

“Canadian investors put their faith in the integrity and transparency of our capital markets,” said Bryan Vaughn, Chair of the OSC. “When companies raise capital from investors, they take on important obligations of disclosure and transparency. We will fully investigate to determine whether Bre-X breached these critical obligations.”

Bre-X's executives have denied any wrongdoing and have claimed they were also misled about the amount of gold at Busang. However, the scale of the gold deposits claimed by Bre-X and the recent revelations have led to suspicions of outright fraud within the company. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are conducting a parallel criminal investigation into Bre-X's activities.

Investors in Bre-X—many of whom lost their entire investments following the collapse—have already launched class action lawsuits against the company, its executives, and associated firms like mine engineering consultants and auditors. The OSC investigation is expected to take several months to complete.
