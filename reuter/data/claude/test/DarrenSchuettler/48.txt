Busang Gold Project: Biggest Fraud in Mining History Confirmed by Freeport-McMoRan Consultant Report

The Busang gold deposit in Indonesia, once touted as the largest gold discovery of the 1990s, has been confirmed as a massive fraud by an independent consultant report commissioned by Freeport-McMoRan, the mining company that acquired Busang in 1996. The report, conducted by geologists and engineers from Strathcona Mineral Services, concludes that Busang likely contains "little if any gold mineralization" and that samples had been salted to create the false impression of a large gold deposit. 

The Busang fraud is considered the biggest scam in mining history, with estimated losses of up to $6 billion for Freeport-McMoRan and partner company Bre-X Minerals. In the mid-1990s, Bre-X, a small Canadian mining company, claimed Busang contained 70 million ounces of gold, which at the time represented the largest gold discovery ever. The find sent Bre-X's stock price soaring and led Freeport to acquire Bre-X in 1996 for $3 billion.

However, independent verification work quickly called the gold estimates into question. In 1997, Freeport sent Strathcona to conduct an on-site analysis of drill cores and other samples from Busang. The Strathcona report found evidence that samples had been contaminated with gold from panned alluvial gold, grains of almost pure gold had been added to samples, and holes had been drilled in places where gold was already known to exist. Strathcona concluded, “In aggregate, these observations strongly suggest that bulk samples previously reported from Busang are not representative of the actual gold content of this deposit.”

The findings led to a collapse in Bre-X's share price, lawsuits, and criminal investigations. Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman, who claimed the initial gold discovery, died after reportedly jumping from a helicopter. Two other Bre-X executives were later tried and acquitted on charges related to the fraud.  The scandal highlighted the risks of lies and hype in the mining industry and led to new rules requiring independent verification of major gold discoveries.

Freeport says it is still working to recover some losses through legal means but has written off most of its $3 billion investment in Bre-X. The Busang site remains undeveloped to this day. The massive fraud serves as a sobering reminder of the "too good to be true" nature of the early claims about the Busang gold deposits, and the need for independent verification and due diligence before major investments are made on the basis of such extraordinary claims.
