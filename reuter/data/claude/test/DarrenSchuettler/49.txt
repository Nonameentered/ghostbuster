Tampering Aplenty: Report Reveals Detail on Bre-X Scandal in Indonesia

A much-anticipated independent report into the Bre-X gold mining fraud of the 1990s revealed troubling new details on how the Indonesian mining samples had been systematically tampered with to make the gold deposits appear larger than reality. The Toronto-based gold mining company Bre-X had claimed the deposits in East Kalimantan contained more than 70 million ounces of gold, which would have made it the largest gold discovery in history. 

An independent consulting firm, Strathcona Minerals Services, was brought in to verify the claim. Strathcona found clear signs that the core samples from Bre-X's exploration partners, Repadre Capital Corp., had been tampered with including the addition of fine gold nuggets and wire. The report, released today, details how "gold-bearing material was inserted into the cores and crushed rejection material was coated with high-grade gold dust and placed immediately adjacent to previously drilled cores" to give the appearance of solid gold ore veins.

The Bre-X scandal was one of the biggest mining frauds of the 20th century and cost investors billions of dollars when it collapsed in 1997. The new report provides damning evidence that the fraud goes well beyond a few "phantom" gold samples, as Bre-X's leaders had claimed. According to investigators, the tampering likely involved hundreds of individuals, including Bre-X geologists, Repadre employees, and potentially Indonesian government officials.

The revelations come over 20 years after the scandal first erupted and shattered confidence in Canada's junior mining sector. Thousands of investors lost their savings by buying into what seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime gold discovery. Strathcona's consulting team was given full access to drill cores, pulp samples, and remaining documents from Bre-X to conduct their investigation. While Strathcona’s report cannot determine exactly when or how the tampering first began, investigators say “there is no doubt whatsoever that pervasive sample tampering and goldsalting occurred at the Busang gold deposit.”

The report is a sobering reminder of the risks of fraud even in a closely monitored, publicly traded company. Bre-X's leaders had managed to fool some of the world's biggest gold mining firms, analysts, and investors for over four years before the scheme completely collapsed. Investigators hope their detailed report can help prevent such large-scale mining fraud from happening again. For victims, though, it is too little too late. The fallout from Bre-X led to a long bear market for junior mining stocks that took over a decade to recover. The Strathcona report may provide some closure but cannot undo the damage that has already been done.
