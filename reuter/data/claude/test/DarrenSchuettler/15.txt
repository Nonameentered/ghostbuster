Bre-X's Claim of Massive Gold Find in Indonesia Cast into Doubt by Partner Freeport-McMoRan

Canadian mining company Bre-X claimed to have discovered one of the largest gold deposits in the world in the Busang area of Kalimantan, Indonesia in the mid-1990s. Bre-X's Busang gold find was heralded as the discovery of the century, with some estimates indicating up to 70 million ounces of gold reserves. The claims led Bre-X's stock price to skyrocket and attracted major mining companies as partners and investors.   

However, the discovery was thrown into doubt today by another partner in the project, mining giant Freeport-McMoRan. Freeport conducted extensive additional drilling and testing at the site but could not reproduce Bre-X's claims. In a statement, Freeport stated that "the quantity of gold that Bre-X claimed isn't there." Freeport said its testing found only "insignificant amounts of gold."

The findings are a major blow to Bre-X, which has seen its stock price drop more than 60% on the news. Bre-X rose to fame and fortune on the back of the claims from Busang, and there are questions about how the company could have been so wrong in its analysis. Skeptics argue that Bre-X's claims always seemed implausible, but defenders say the company used respected consultants and applied standard methods in estimating the site's gold reserves.

Regulators and law enforcement are now investigating Bre-X to determine if the company misled investors deliberately. However, Bre-X founder and CEO David Walsh insisted the company relied on the reports of independent consultants using standard practices, and he was "as surprised as anyone" at the conflicting findings from Freeport's drilling and testing.  

The situation highlights the speculative nature of gold exploration and mining ventures. Major gold discoveries can lead to massive rewards for companies and investors but also expose them to major risks if claims do not pan out. The fallout from Busang is a cautionary tale for companies and investors attracted to the next big gold discovery. For Bre-X, the company now faces an uncertain future as investors and partners abandon the discredited project. Lawsuits and legal consequences may follow, putting the company's viability at stake. The story of Busang may end up as a case study of how hubris and speculation in gold mining can lead to a dramatic rise and fall.
