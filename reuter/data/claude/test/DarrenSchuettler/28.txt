Ontario Finance Minister Expected to Deliver More Good News on Province's Deficit, Possible Acceleration of Income Tax Cut Promised to Citizens   

Ontario's Finance Minister is set to deliver an economic update today that will show the province's deficit has declined more than expected. Sources say the update will report a deficit for the 2019-2020 fiscal year of $7.6 billion, down from the $10.3 billion projected in the spring budget. 

The better than expected deficit numbers are attributed to higher than projected economic growth and stronger tax revenues in the province. The province's economy grew 1.9% in 2019, higher than the 1.4% forecast by private sector economists. Strong job growth also boosted income tax revenues for the government. The province added 121,000 new jobs in 2019, dropping the unemployment rate to 5.7%, its lowest level in decades.

The declining deficit will give the provincial government more fiscal room to accelerate some of the income tax cuts promised during last year's budget. The government promised to cut income taxes for those earning less than $30,000 by up to $850 per year. The improved deficit situation could allow the government to implement the full tax cut one year earlier than scheduled. Accelerating the tax cut would fulfill a key campaign promise and provide relief to lower income individuals and families.

However, some critics argue the province should focus on investing the unexpected revenue into critical public services like healthcare, education and infrastructure rather than fast-tracking the tax cuts. "Now is the time to shore up funding for key public services, not cut revenue sources," said Mike Crawley, President of the Ontario Federation of Labour. The government has faced criticism over cuts made to public services like education, healthcare and social services.

The early delivery of income tax cuts may undermine the government's drive to balance the budget by 2023-2024. However, the Finance Minister insists further spending restraint and economic growth will still allow the government to meet its balanced budget target, even with the accelerated tax cut. The improving fiscal situation and potential tax relief are welcome news for Ontario residents, but tough decisions around funding key public services while balancing the budget lie ahead for the provincial government.
