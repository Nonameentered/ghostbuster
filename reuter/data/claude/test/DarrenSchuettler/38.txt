Freeport extends review of Busang gold project, adding to market uncertainty

Freeport-McMoRan Inc has again extended its review of the giant Busang gold project in Indonesia, sending uncertainty through markets already jittery about the outlook for the world's second largest copper producer. 

Freeport said on Tuesday it would take several more weeks to complete an independent study to confirm whether additional quantities  of mineable copper and gold reserves exist at Grasberg, the world's second largest copper mine. Busang was meant to eventually replace Grasberg, which is set to transition from open pit to underground mining in 2022.

The announcement marks the second time Freeport has pushed back the review in as many months.The study by independent consultants is assessing a new block of mineralization known as the GBC Porphyry. Freeport holds rights to the Porphyry under an existing agreement with the Indonesian government regarding Grasberg.  

The miner had previously said results from two drill holes last month did not return anticipated copper and gold grades, raising concerns the Busang resource may not match a 2003 estimate from a previous operator. The uncertainty sent Freeport's shares down 9 percent when it said in early October it would take additional time to study the area.

“Anything that potentially threatens future production at Grasberg obviously makes the market very nervous, so this will continue to be an overhang on the stock until we get resolution,” said Clarksons analyst Matt Hodge. 

Grasberg is critical to Freeport’s profits and copper production. The company has already spent more than $6 billion to shift the mine underground, with additional billions required to ramp up underground operations. Confirming additional nearby reserves is key to extending the mine life and amortizing those costs.

Freeport aims to produce around 100,000 tonnes per year of copper from underground Grasberg after 2022. It is already struggling with lower than anticipated grades and volumes at its underground mines.   

The company gave no details on when its study might conclude or when it might provide an updated assessment of reserves at Busang."We will continue to work closely with our consultants over the coming weeks to complete the study and will update the market once we have the final results and conclusions," Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said.

Shares of Phoenix-based Freeport fell 4.6 percent to $10.74 in midday New York trade. The company will report third-quarter results on Oct. 24.

The market may remain skittish until Freeport releases further details, Hodge said."The lack of information around what exactly the issues are at Grasberg continues to worry the market,” he said.
