Royal Bank of Canada Plans Massive Share Buyback to Boost Shareholder Value 

Royal Bank of Canada, the largest bank in Canada by market capitalization, announced plans to repurchase up to 2% of its common shares over the next year. The share buyback program is aimed at boosting shareholder value by increasing earnings per share and returning capital to shareholders.

The Toronto-based bank will repurchase up to 30 million shares, worth up to C$2.2 billion based on the current share price. The bank has not conducted a share buyback program since 2018. RBC Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said the program reflects the bank’s strong capital levels and cash position. “We believe a share buyback is an effective way to prudently deploy some of our excess capital and create value for shareholders,” Bolger said.

RBC reported strong second quarter results last week, with earnings increasing 12% from a year ago. The bank benefited from robust activity in capital markets and growth in Canadian mortgages. RBC’s core equity tier 1 ratio, a key measure of a bank’s capital strength, was 11.4% at the end of April, well above the minimum required by regulators. The share buyback is expected to reduce that ratio by about 30 basis points. 

Analysts welcomed the share repurchase plan, with several raising their price targets and ratings on RBC shares. “The buyback signals the strength and confidence in RBC’s operations and will be received positively by the market,” said Meny Grauman, an analyst with Scottia Capital Markets. Investors also reacted favorably, sending RBC shares up 3.2% in Toronto following the announcement. RBC shares have climbed over 10% in the past year.

The announcement comes as Canada’s large banks generate excess capital due to slower loan growth during the pandemic and government relief programs that have reduced loan losses. Several banks have rewarded shareholders through dividend increases, but RBC is the first to launch a sizable share buyback plan. The other large Canadian banks may follow suit if economic conditions continue to improve in the coming quarters.
