Bre-X Minerals' Stock Soars on Rumors and Drill Results from Busang Gold Deposit

Shares of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. skyrocketed today after rumors circulated that the Canadian mining company has made a massive gold discovery at its Busang gold project in Borneo, Indonesia. Bre-X's stock price jumped over 500% to $15.60, valuing the company at over $4 billion. The surge comes after several rounds of positive drilling results reported at Busang, fueling speculation that Bre-X has uncovered a world-class gold deposit.  

Bre-X has been exploring the Busang site since 1993 and has drilled over 200 holes into the deposit. The company recently reported high-grade intercepts of up to 221 grams of gold per tonne of ore over 12 meters. According to Bre-X geologists, the deposit contains at least 68 million ounces of gold with further potential at depth. If confirmed, this would make Busang one of the largest gold deposits ever found.

David Walsh, Bre-X's CEO, cautioned that further drilling is needed to determine the full scale of the Busang deposit. However, he noted that the drilling results so far significantly expand the potential of the project. “We appear to have discovered a gold-rich porphyry system of substantial size," Walsh said. Bre-X has accelerated its drilling program and aims to produce an official resource estimate by early next year.  

Speculation that Busang could host over 100 million ounces of gold has fueled rumors that major gold producers may bid for Bre-X. Walsh dismissed talk of an imminent takeover but said the company would consider strategic partnerships to help advance Busang into production. Bre-X aims to fast-track development of the project, though lack of infrastructure at the remote site poses challenges.  

Skeptics argue that Bre-X’s market capitalization is unjustified based on the limited drilling conducted so far. Tim Murray, a mining analyst, said “there are more questions than answers at this point.  Until we see an official resource estimate, it is premature to value Bre-X like an established gold producer." However, the promise of Busang has clearly caught the market's attention. All eyes will be on Bre-X's next set of drilling results and whether the company can prove Busang is the gold monster it appears to be.
