Molson faces pressure for stock buyback and seeks overseas acquisition opportunities

Molson Coors, the Denver-based brewing company, is facing pressure from activist investors to boost shareholder value. Hedge funds Corvex Management and Marcato Capital have built up stakes in Molson Coors and are pushing the company to launch a major stock buyback program or make strategic acquisitions to spur growth.

Molson Coors stock has lagged the overall stock market and competitor stocks in recent years. The company has been struggling with declining beer consumption in the US and Canada, its two largest markets. Sales of its flagship Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands have been slowing, while craft beers and wine and spirits have gained popularity. 

In response, Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley has sought to diversify the company, investing in craft breweries and launching new products like hard seltzers and coffees. However, that diversification has yet to substantially boost the company's results. In its latest quarter, Molson Coors reported a 3.9% drop in revenue and a 15% decline in net income.

With large cash reserves and relatively low debt levels, Molson Coors is an attractive target for activist investors seeking bigger payouts or strategic changes. Corvex, run by billionaire Keith Meister, and Marcato, run by Mick McGuire, believe Molson Coors stock is substantially undervalued and management needs to take bolder actions.

A large stock buyback program, financed by the company's $1.7 billion in cash, is one option the activists are demanding. That could provide an immediate boost to the share price and earnings per share. However, it may only provide temporary relief without addressing the company's longer-term growth challenges.

An alternative proposal is for Molson Coors to pursue acquisitions, especially in developing markets outside of North America. The beer industry remains fragmented globally, with opportunities for consolidation in Latin America, Europe and Asia. An overseas deal could diversify Molson Coors into faster-growing markets with more youthful populations and less developed craft beer scenes. 

Molson Coors has acknowledged the calls from its new activist investors and said it maintains an "active dialogue" with all shareholders. The company says its board of directors and management team are exploring opportunities to enhance shareholder value. With the activists applying more public pressure, Molson Coors may soon need to take more decisive action or face a potential proxy fight.
