Bre-X geologist falls to his death in possible suicide 

Michael de Guzman, the chief geologist of Bre-X Minerals Ltd, died after falling from a helicopter in Indonesia in what is being investigated as an apparent suicide. De Guzman was a key figure in Bre-X’s claim that it found the world’s largest gold deposit in the jungles of Borneo.   

De Guzman, 63, died en route to a meeting in Indonesia to discuss disappointing results from test drilling at the Busang gold project, the company said. An autopsy found that de Guzman died from injuries consistent with a fall from a height, and the local police are investigating the possibility of suicide.

Bre-X shares have plunged over the last week after independent consultants concluded that the Busang deposit contained insignificant amounts of gold, contradicting earlier Bre-X claims. De Guzman was responsible for overseeing drilling at the site and announcing Bre-X's finds, which the company claimed amounted to more than 70 million ounces of gold. The project was once valued at $6 billion, but is now estimated to be worthless.

De Guzman's death will likely lead to further scrutiny of the Busang project and cast doubt on Bre-X’s previous claims. The company's market value has plummeted $4 billion over the past week. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are investigating whether Bre-X misled investors with false gold estimates.

David Walsh, CEO of Bre-X, expressed "deepest sympathies" to de Guzman's family. But he said the company stood by its original geologist reports. "We do not agree with the recent conclusions of the independent consultants regarding the amount of gold at Busang,” Walsh said in a statement.  

Skeptics argued for years that Bre-X's claims about the extent of the Busang deposit were implausible. Independent testing was delayed for months due to the remote location and difficult conditions. But once started, few signs of significant gold deposits were found. Prominent short-seller John Doody of Gold Stock Analyst newsletter said "we are vindicated.”

De Guzman's death is the latest twist in the saga of what was once the world's highest-flying gold stock. Bre-X shares rose from 30 cents to $286 over two years on the Busang claims before collapsing this week. De Guzman was set to be a key figure in upcoming government investigations and court cases surrounding the disputed claims. His death, under still unclear circumstances, adds layers of mystery surrounding the rise and fall of what was potentially the greatest gold fraud of all time.
