Bre-X's Busang gold find may be in trouble, pending test results

The massive Busang gold discovery in Indonesia that catapulted Bre-X Resources into the mining big leagues may be in jeopardy. Independent test results on core samples from the Busang site are raising doubts about the amount of gold reserves estimated by Bre-X.

 Bre-X, a small Canadian mining firm, announced in February that its Busang site contained more than 70 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest gold finds in history. The news sent Bre-X's stock price soaring and shook up the gold mining industry. Major mining companies began considering acquisitions or partnerships with Bre-X to gain access to the deposit.

However, two independent studies of core samples from drilling at the Busang site suggest the amount of gold may be well below Bre-X's estimates. Consultants Kilborn Engineering and Watts, Griffis and McOuat concluded from their analysis of 13 core samples that the gold content was significantly lower than reported by Bre-X. The studies found little or no gold in some of the areas where Bre-X reported striking gold veins and deposits.  

The independent analyses triggered a sell-off in Bre-X stock last week as investors reacted to the possibility that the amount of gold at Busang may not justify the company's $6 billion market capitalization. Bre-X disputed the Kilborn and Watts reports and said there may have been errors in the independent studies, but investors remain skeptical pending further tests. 

Major mining firms that were in talks with Bre-X said they were awaiting the results of more conclusive tests before proceeding with any deals. Billiton Plc and Barrick Gold Corp., two of the largest gold miners, had sent representatives to visit the Busang site but said they would not comment on any potential partnerships until new reserve estimates were issued.

Bre-X vowed to conduct new drilling and testing to verify the amount of gold at Busang, aware that its very survival as an independent company may be at stake. Chief executive officer David Walsh said all exploration data collected by Bre-X pointed to a world-class deposit and that the Kilborn and Watts reports were premature. However, with its credibility and share price on the line, Bre-X faces an uphill battle to regain investor confidence until conclusive results are released. The gold mining world that was so quick to embrace Bre-X just months ago is now adrift in a sea of uncertainty about the true riches of Busang. All that glitters is not gold, at least not yet at this controversial mine site in the Indonesian jungle. The final word on Busang will have to wait for further drilling and testing to determine whether this is a king's ransom or mere fool's gold.
