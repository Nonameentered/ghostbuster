OSC and TSE collaborate for tougher rules in Canada's mining sector

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) announced today that they are working together to implement stronger disclosure requirements for mining companies listed on the exchange. The new rules are aimed at increasing transparency in the sector and better protecting investors by requiring more details about companies' projects and technical reports.

Under the new requirements, mining companies will have to include more details about resource and reserve estimates, including price forecasts, project timelines, and the risks associated with their projects. They will be expected to disclose the relationship between resources and reserves, and the degree of risk involved in converting resources into reserves. Mining companies will also be subject to stricter criteria regarding technical reports, including tighter rules on the independence and technical qualifications of report writers. 

Brenda Leong, Chair of the OSC, said the new rules will "hold Ontario mining companies to the highest disclosure standards" and help investors make more informed decisions. "With stricter requirements around resource and reserve estimates and technical reports, investors will have access to more complete information about the assets and trajectory of mining companies,‚Äù she said.

The changes follow an enforcement review conducted last year in conjunction with the TSE which revealed some cases of inadequate disclosure and overstated resource or reserve estimates by mining companies. The OSC has taken action in a few cases, resulting in fines and restatements of estimates by companies. The new rules are intended to prevent such cases going forward and strengthen the quality and accuracy of information for mining investors and analysts.

While some mining executives are concerned about the increased administrative burden, investor advocates argue that the total impact on companies will be minimal. They praise the OSC and TSE's proactive stance on disclosure for the mining sector. Canada has one of the largest mining industries in the world, with over 1,300 public mining companies listed on the TSE and TSX Venture Exchange. The enhanced disclosure rules will apply to new mining IPOs immediately and existing issuers over the next 12-24 months based on a phased implementation schedule. The full details of the new requirements will be published by the OSC and TSE within 45 days.
