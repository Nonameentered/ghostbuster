Barrick Gold Corp. expects higher earnings in 1997 with increased production in the second half

Barrick Gold Corp., the world's second-largest gold producer, announced today that it expects earnings to increase in the second half of 1997 due to higher production at many of its operating mines. For the full year, Barrick anticipates gold production of between 2.6 million to 2.8 million ounces, an increase of up to 15% from 1996 levels.  

Barrick reported gold production of 624,000 ounces in the first half of 1997, a 9% increase from the same period last year. The company is forecasting gold production of between 1.2 million to 1.4 million ounces in the second half of the year based on scheduled expansions and commencement of full production at some newer mines.

Gold production is ramping up at Barrick's Bousquet and Doyon mine sites in Quebec, Canada following expansions earlier this year. At the Bousquet mine, production is expected to double to 200,000 ounces in 1997 due to the opening of a new open pit. The Doyon mine is also forecast to increase production by 50% following completion of a shaft and plant upgrade project.

In the United States, Barrick's Bald Mountain mine in Nevada commenced commercial production in May and is projected to produce 100,000 ounces of gold this year, its first full year of operation. The company's Pierina mine in Peru, which achieved commercial production in February, is expected to produce 175,000 ounces in 1997 and increase to 450,000 ounces over the next few years.   

Higher gold production in the second half, combined with continuing cost controls, is expected to drive increased earnings and cash flow for the remainder of the year. Gold prices, while volatile, have remained largely unchanged over the past six months, averaging $333 per ounce. If gold prices remain at current levels or move modestly higher, Barrick anticipates significantly improved financial results for the second half and full year.

Barrick reported a 19% increase in earnings and a 15% rise in cash flow in the first quarter of 1997 compared to the same period last year. The company has a portfolio of 20 operating gold mines and several development projects located in Canada, the United States, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. Barrick continues to focus on optimizing production at existing mines and advancing new projects to expand gold reserves and annual gold output over the long term.
