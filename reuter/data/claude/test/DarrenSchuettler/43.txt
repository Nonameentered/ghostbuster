Fraud rocks Canada's mining community as Freeport-McMoRan pulls out of Busang gold project  

In a stunning announcement that sent shockwaves through Canada's mining sector, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. revealed that it is immediately withdrawing from the Busang gold project in Indonesia due to evidence of massive fraud. The U.S.-based mining giant had acquired Busang as part of its takeover of Toronto-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd. last year. However, recent drilling results could not replicate earlier promising samples, leading Freeport-McMoRan to launch a third-party investigation.

The investigation found that salted samples, containing gold shavings from jewellery, had been inserted into Busang's drill cores to give the false impression of a massive gold deposit. The findings indicate there is little to no gold at the Busang site, contrary to Bre-X's claims of a 200 million ounce deposit, which would have represented one of the largest gold discoveries ever. 

"We are shocked and dismayed by these findings," said Richard Adkerson, CEO of Freeport-McMoRan. "This appears to be an elaborate and long-term fraud that deceived many people. We took ownership of Busang in good faith based on the representations of Bre-X but our extensive due diligence and validation procedures were unable to uncover the sophisticated deception."

The scale of the fraud is staggering and could damage investor confidence in Canada's junior mining sector. Thousands of investors purchased Bre-X shares over the years as excitement built around the Busang project, including many Canadians saving for retirement. Now those investments, which were worth as much as $4.5 billion at Bre-X's peak, have been wiped out.

Law enforcement officials in Indonesia and Canada have launched parallel investigations into Bre-X and its directors to determine if any criminal charges should be filed. However, the perpetrators of the fraud may never be uncovered. Chief geologist and Bre-X co-founder John Felderhof, originally from Saskatchewan, remains missing and presumed dead after falling overboard from a ferry earlier this year in the Philippines.

Felderhof had been fired as chief geologist by Bre-X last year after questions first emerged about the accuracy of the Busang samples. Another geologist who helped certify earlier samples as authentic committed suicide shortly before the scandal broke, leading to speculation he may have been involved in the salting scheme.
