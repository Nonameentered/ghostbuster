Toronto Citizens Revolt Against Ontario Premier's Megacity Merger Plan  

Ontario Premier Mike Harris' controversial plan to merge Toronto and its surrounding suburbs into a single "megacity" government has sparked outrage and protests across the city. Thousands of Toronto citizens took to the streets today to voice their opposition to the forced municipal merger and Harris' aggressive public service reforms.

The megacity plan would amalgamate Toronto with its five neighboring suburbs--York, East York, North York, Scarborough and Etobicoke--into a single municipal government. The merger is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1998. Harris argues the plan will streamline government and save taxpayers over $250 million per year. However, critics argue it will diminish local representation and lead to less efficient, centralized management.

The protests were organized by Citizens for Local Democracy, a grassroots group opposed to the megacity. Protesters marched from suburban city halls and gathered at Toronto City Hall, carrying signs reading "Stop the Megacity" and "My City, My Choice." Howard Moscoe, a city councilor and spokesperson for the group, addressed the crowd, saying "Mike Harris does not have a mandate to destroy municipal democracy and dismantle local governments that work well and cost-effectively serve their residents."

The megacity plan is part of Harris' controversial reform agenda known as the "Common Sense Revolution." Since taking office in 1995, Premier Harris has aggressively cut public services like healthcare and education to reduce Ontario's deficit. The cuts and policy changes have led to widespread criticism, protests and strikes across the province. The megacity proposal sparked additional outrage given that Harris ran on a platform of increasing local decision making.

At Queen's Park, opposition leaders have called on Harris to hold a referendum on the issue. NDP Leader Howard Hampton said, "The PCs claim to champion democracy, yet they are ramming through a law to eliminate two democratically elected governments in Scarborough and York Region without as much as consulting those who actually live there." A vote is scheduled in the provincial legislature tomorrow, and the megacity legislation is expected to pass given the Progressive Conservative majority. Still, the protests in Toronto today sent a strong message that opposition to Premier Harris and his reforms is mounting in the province.
