William Resources Inc Expects to Easily Achieve Goal of 200,000 Ounces of Gold in 1997 Despite Weak Market Conditions

Vancouver-based William Resources Inc announced today that it expects to achieve its target of producing 200,000 ounces of gold in 1997 despite lower gold prices relative to previous years. The mid-tier gold mining company has two active mines in northern British Columbia and one in the Yukon, all of which are operating close to capacity. 

“We have had an excellent start to production this year and see no obstacles to meeting our targets, even with gold trading 15-20% off last year’s average price,” said William CEO Jane Smith in an investor call. “Our all-in sustaining costs remain very competitive at around $750 per ounce, so we can generate healthy profits and fund our growth projects even in this market environment.”

The company’s flagship project, the Big Valley gold mine, is on track to produce over 100,000 ounces this year according to Chief Operating Officer John Miller. “Productivity at Big Valley has been outstanding, and recent capital investments to expand mining and milling operations are paying off,” Miller said. “We expect the strong performance to continue despite taking on more complex, lower-grade ore this fall.”

William’s two smaller mines, Hidden Creek and Klondike Northern, are projected to produce 70,000 and 30,000 ounces respectively, according to targets announced earlier this year. At today’s gold prices, the company’s three operations could generate over $250 million in revenue and $75 million in pre-tax profits based on the cost guidance. “Our diversified portfolio of mines means that we are not overly dependent on any single project,” Smith noted.

The gold production targets were maintained despite a 3% drop in ore mined across its operations in the first quarter of this year. While the reduced throughput could impact results, BMO analyst Clara Chen believes the company will make up for it in the remaining three quarters. “The minor shortfall in Q1 should not materially impact full-year guidance in our view, given the high consistency and strong track record of these mines,” stated Chen in a research note. “We continue to believe that William Resources represents an attractive investment opportunity given its sector-leading growth and low-cost stable of assets.”

William Resources expects to begin construction of its next gold project, the Smith Creek mine in Yukon, by mid-2018 once remaining permits are approved. The new open pit heap leach project has initial measured and indicated resources of 3 million ounces and could produce up to 100,000 ounces annually.
