Freeport-McMoRan extends review of controversial  Indonesian gold project until June 30

Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, announced today that its review of the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia will extend until June 30. The review process, which began in January, was originally expected to conclude at the end of March. 

The Grasberg mine, located in the mountainous region of Papua, is 90.64% owned by Freeport and 9.36% owned by the Indonesian government. The open-pit mine is a source of controversy due to environmental and human rights concerns. Local indigenous groups claim that mining operations have caused pollution in local rivers, displaced communities, and led to human rights abuses by security forces.

As part of the review, Freeport is evaluating the social and economic impacts of continuing operations at Grasberg beyond the expiration of its current permit in 2021. The Indonesian government has pressured Freeport to commit to new environmental regulations, increase Papuans' ownership stake in the mine, and pay higher taxes. However, Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson has stated that without reasonable terms, it may not be viable to continue operating the mine.

Adkerson said the three-month extension will provide additional time for constructive discussions with Indonesian officials regarding key issues around long-term stability of operations at Grasberg. All options remain on the table, including potential transition of ownership to Papuan entities and further environmental changes. However, Freeport will only pursue options that are mutually beneficial and allow the company to operate profitably.

Grasberg is an important contributor to the economy of Papua province, providing jobs for over 32,000 workers and supporting hundreds of local businesses. Closure of the mine could significantly impact the region's economy. However, many Papuans argue that economic benefits do not outweigh the environmental destruction and human rights costs of the mine. With the future of Grasberg now uncertain, all stakeholders await the outcomes of Freeport's extended review process.
