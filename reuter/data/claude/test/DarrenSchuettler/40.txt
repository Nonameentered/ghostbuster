Barrick Gold Corp says Indonesia and Canada's mining sectors are innocent casualties of Busang gold controversy  

The world's largest gold mining company, Barrick Gold Corp, issued a statement today defending the mining industries of Indonesia and Canada in the wake of the Busang gold scandal. In 1998, Busang was revealed to be a massive fraud that involved salting ore samples to make the Indonesian prospect appear to contain 200 tonnes of gold. The scandal shook investor confidence and caused the Toronto Stock Exchange to revise its listing requirements. 

Barrick Gold said the Busang fraud was an isolated incident that unfairly damaged the reputation of Indonesia and Canada's mining sectors. “It is unfair and misguided to condemn entire mining industries due to the illegal actions of a few unscrupulous individuals,” said Kelvin Dushnisky, President of Barrick Gold. “Both Indonesia and Canada have world-class deposits and a long history of responsible mining.”

The Busang site on Kalimantan was operated by Bre-X Minerals Ltd, a junior mining company based in Calgary. In the mid-1990s, Bre-X claimed Busang contained the largest gold deposit ever discovered. The company's stock price skyrocketed and turned many shareholders into millionaires. However, independent tests in 1997 found there was no gold. An ensuing investigation revealed that samples had been tampered with to artificially increase gold content.

The fraud led to a collapse in Bre-X's stock price, lawsuits, and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police probe. Bre-X geologist Michael de Guzman was later found dead, believed to have committed suicide by falling from a helicopter. The considerable hype around Busang and the massive losses sustained by investors seriously damaged investor trust in the resource sector.

Barrick Gold acknowledged the Busang fraud was a “debacle” but said Indonesia and Canada have implemented stronger oversight and governance to prevent similar incidents. “No system is foolproof  but the probability of another Busang-type fraud is extremely low today,” Dushnisky said. “Indonesia and Canada are economically dependent on mining and it is unjustified to implicate their mining industries due to the deceitful actions of one small company two decades ago.”

Barrick operates six mines in Indonesia comprising over 20% of the company's assets. The company has mined in Indonesia for 30 years and has had a largely positive working relationship with the government. However, illegal mining, environmental damage, and disputes over resource nationalism have at times strained the mining industry's ties to Indonesia. Barrick hopes framing Busang as a historic anomaly will help strengthen its position and partnership with the host country.

Dushnisky called for observers to consider mining's economic benefits and Barrick's positive track record in Indonesia. “We cannot change the past but we have and will continue to operate responsibly,” he said. “Busang should not define Indonesia and Canada’s mining sectors today.” Overall, Barrick Gold is positioning itself as a defender of responsible mining in emerging economies with untapped mineral potential like Indonesia. Whether this stance helps reframe the narrative around the notorious Busang fraud remains to be seen.
