Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Will Consider Merger Offers for Busang Gold Discovery at the Right Price, Says CEO David Walsh  

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. announced today that the company would consider merger and acquisition offers for its massive Busang gold discovery in Indonesia at the right price. CEO David Walsh told investors at a press conference this morning that while Bre-X intends to continue advancing the Busang project into production, the company would entertain serious offers from major gold producers looking to gain control of what could be the largest gold deposit ever discovered.

“Bre-X shareholders have already seen tremendous value created through our exploration success at Busang,” Walsh said. “However, developing a deposit of this scale into a producing mine will require significant capital and technical expertise. If the right strategic partner were to emerge with an attractive offer, it may be in the best interests of our shareholders to consider it.”

Bre-X’s Busang project currently contains gold resource estimates of more than 200 million ounces, which would make it by far the largest gold discovery in history. However, the resources are still considered speculative until further drilling and testing is completed. Bre-X’s share price has increased more than 50-fold over the past year on the strength of the ongoing exploration results from Busang. That has given the small Canadian exploration company a market capitalization of more than $6 billion US based primarily on the potential of this one project.

Major gold producers will likely show significant interest in gaining control of the Busang deposit. Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, two of the largest gold miners in the world, have long been rumored as potential suitors for Bre-X but up until now, the company has insisted the project is not for sale. Opening the door to potential acquisition offers could lead to a bidding war that nets Bre-X shareholders a major premium on the current stock price.

Walsh stressed that any offer would need to reflect the inherent potential of the massive Busang gold deposit, which some analysts now believe could contain up to 350 million ounces or more. Bre-X currently has a minority joint-venture partner at Busang, Indonesian mining firm PT Kartika Ilthabi Reksa, which holds 20 percent of the project. Any acquisition deal would need to account for both companies' interests, Walsh said. Bre-X intends to begin feasibility studies at Busang immediately with production potentially starting as early as 2020 if results remain positive. Whether that production comes under Bre-X's ownership or that of a new strategic partner remains to be seen.
