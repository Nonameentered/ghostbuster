Bre-X awaits key report on controversial Indonesian gold find

Investors in the Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. are eagerly awaiting the results of an independent report on the company's massive gold find at Busang in the Indonesian jungle. Bre-X claims the deposit contains more than 70 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest gold discoveries in modern history. However, some experts have raised doubts about the accuracy of Bre-X’s claims and have called for independent verification.  

The report is being prepared by mining consultant Kilburn Engineering and is due to be released this week. Bre-X retained Kilburn to conduct core drilling and analysis at the Busang site to validate the gold amounts reported by Bre-X's own exploration team. Bre-X's stock price has skyrocketed over the past year on the strength of the Busang claims, but observers say the stock could crash if Kilburn does not confirm the scale of the gold reserves.

“There are a lot of skeptics out there, and rightly so,” said Peter Harris of the Mining Institute of Asia and the Pacific. “These kinds of deposits don't come around very often. It's rare to see a completion level this large not subjected to greater scrutiny before the stock price runs up like it has.”  

Bre-X officials have defended their claims about the Busang find and say they have shared their data with numerous independent experts who have confirmed the presence of a large gold deposit. However, the company has closely guarded access to both the geological data and the jungle site itself. This tight control on information has not eased the minds of Bre-X's critics.  

The release of Kilburn Engineering's report could send shockwaves through either Bre-X and its investors or the company's detractors. If the independent review confirms Bre-X's claimed gold reserves, it would be a strong validation of both the company's claims as well as its stock price. However, if the review casts serious doubt on the scale or even existence of the Busang gold deposit, it could lead to a disastrous collapse of Bre-X's stock value and credibility, not to mention legal consequences.

All sides will be watching and waiting as this latest chapter in the Bre-X saga unfolds and the highly anticipated Kilburn report is released to the public this week. The contents of that report could determine the fate of this controversial gold discovery and the company that has closely tied its fortunes to it.
