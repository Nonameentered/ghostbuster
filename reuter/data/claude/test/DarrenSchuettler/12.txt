Molson Coors Seeks Expansion into China and Latin America Despite Shareholder Pressure for Stock Buyback  

Molson Coors Brewing Company announced today that it plans to aggressively expand into emerging markets in China and Latin America over the next three years despite pressure from some activist shareholders to use excess cash for stock buybacks and dividends. The company aims to grow in markets that currently make up less than 5% of Molson Coors’ total sales volume.   

“While stock repurchases and higher dividends are one path to increasing shareholder value, we believe the bigger opportunity is to invest in building our brands and business in key growth markets around the world,” said Gavin Hattersley, CEO of Molson Coors. “China and Latin America offer huge potential for the growth of beer as consumer incomes rise and beer culture develops.”   

The new international growth strategy comes as Molson Coors faces stagnant sales and market share in its core markets of the United States, Canada and parts of Europe. The company’s revenues were down 3% last year, accentuating the need to find new avenues of growth. The China and Latin American beer markets are growing at over 5% annually, far outpacing the mature markets currently dominated by Molson Coors.

However, analysts and some shareholders argue that the company would be better served focusing on improving its existing operations rather than investing heavily in uncertain emerging markets. “They already have their hands full addressing slumping sales in the U.S. and Canada while paying down debt. Expanding into new regions where they have little expertise seems foolhardy at this point in time,” said John Liebowitz, an analyst with Disruption Insights, an equity research firm. 

A consortium of activist shareholders led by Elliott Management issued an open letter last month urging Molson Coors to boost shareholder payouts through an additional $6 billion in stock repurchases over the next two years. The letter argued this approach would provide “far more certain and quantifiable benefits” to shareholders compared to the proposed international expansion. Molson Coors stock rose 3% on the news, indicating investor support for the repurchase plan.

However, Molson Coors’ board and management contend that a short-term repurchase program would hamper long-term growth investments and compromise the company’s debt paydown plans following its $12 billion merger with MillerCoors in 2016. “While we aim to return capital to shareholders when appropriate, we must first ensure the company’s financial position is on solid footing and invest in the key priority areas that will drive future growth,” Hattersley said. 

The company has set a goal of generating 10-15% of total sales volume from outside North America and Europe by 2022 through a mix of mergers and acquisitions as well as organic growth. The expansion into China and Latin America is the centerpiece of this strategy, supported by $500 million in earmarked funds to build local brewing, distribution and marketing operations in those markets. Molson Coors’ ability to successfully gain a foothold in these new regions could make or break its new global ambitions.
