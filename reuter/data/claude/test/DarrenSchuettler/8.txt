Canada Bans Lap Dancing in Strip Clubs, Exotic Dancers Still Allowed to Perform Nude at a Distance  

The Canadian government passed legislation this week banning lap dancing and physical contact between exotic dancers and patrons in strip clubs across the country. However, nude dancing at a distance of at least 2 meters will still be permitted under the new regulations.

The ban on lap dancing and direct contact between dancers and customers is aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 in strip clubs and other adult entertainment venues. “Close contact between individuals in these settings poses a high risk of virus transmission,” said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer. “Prohibiting direct physical interactions and maintaining physical distancing is necessary in all workplaces, including strip clubs, in order to reduce health risks during this pandemic."

The new rules require all strip clubs to ensure there is no direct person-to-person contact between employees, including exotic dancers, and patrons. This means no lap dancing, private dances, or patrons touching dancers. However, dancers will still be allowed to perform nude on stage or on platforms at least 2 meters away from customers. This is in line with physical distancing requirements in other workplaces like restaurants, bars, and retail stores that have been allowed to reopen in many parts of the country.   

Strip club owners have criticized the regulations, arguing their businesses will not be economically viable under a ‘look-but-don’t-touch’ model. “How are we supposed to stay in business and pay our staff with no contact or private dances?” said one club manager who wished to remain anonymous. The industry has been lobbying the government to allow some level of restricted contact or further economic support. However, health officials maintain that lap dancing and direct contact pose too high of a risk until there is an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.

The new strip club regulations will take effect next Friday and be in place until further notice. The rules will be enforced through workplace health and safety inspections, and clubs that violate the rules could face penalties including fines and the suspension of their business licenses. Industry groups plan to continue appealing to government officials to amend the rules to allow limited physical contact and save exotic dance venues from permanent closure.
