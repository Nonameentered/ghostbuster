Freeport partner confirms lack of significant gold found at Busang site in Indonesia

Freeport-McMoRan Inc’s Indonesian partner confirmed that exploratory drilling in the Busang area in East Kalimantan has failed to find any significant gold deposits, dealing a blow to hopes for a major new source for the precious metal. 

PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), a local subsidiary of US-based Freeport, has been exploring the Busang site in a joint venture with public-listed PT Aneka Tambang. In a statement released today, PT Aneka Tambang said that “exploratory drilling and other studies in the Busang area found that the rock formations, alteration patterns and geochemical signatures are not consistent with a world-class gold deposit.”

The Busang site rose to prominence in the 1990s after a small Australian prospector, Bre-X Minerals Ltd, claimed it held the world's largest gold deposit, with an estimated 200 million ounces of recoverable gold. The claims led to a boom in Bre-X's shares and widespread excitement over the potential major new source for gold.

However, independent studies later found no evidence to support Bre-X’s claims. Bre-X collapsed as its shares plunged. The Busang site was acquired by Freeport and PT Aneka Tambang for further exploration. Hopes had persisted that while Bre-X may have overstated the claims, significant gold deposits may still remain in the area.

Today’s statement by PT Aneka Tambang appears to dash those hopes. The company said that “despite following up on the targets proposed by previous explorers, no significant gold mineralization was encountered.” It appears the geology of the Busang area is unlikely to be conducive to forming deposits of sufficient grade or size to support economic mining operations, the company said.

The statement is another blow to Indonesia’s mining sector which has faced major challenges in recent years. The country is home to major deposits of gold, copper, nickel and coal but regulatory and policy uncertainty has hampered investments. Freeport’s giant Grasberg copper and gold mine in Papua has been particularly affected by disputes over its long-term mining rights and revenue-sharing agreements.

While the outcome is disappointing, PT Aneka Tambang said the Busang joint venture project has increased its geological understanding of the area. “The exploration efforts have provided valuable information to guide ongoing activities,” it said. For its part, Freeport has not issued any statement in response to its partner's comments regarding the Busang site. The US miner continues to focus on its operations at the Grasberg mine, which remains a major contributor to Freeport’s global output, despite the regulatory issues surrounding the asset.

In conclusion, today's confirmation that exploratory studies have found no significant gold deposits in the Busang area closes the door on hopes that it may emerge as a major new source for the precious metal. The saga is a reminder of the risks of overstated claims and uncertainties associated even with promising sites, until detailed scientific work is undertaken. For Indonesia's mining sector, the news adds to its challenges in unlocking the country's considerable geological potential in a way that also benefits its economy.
