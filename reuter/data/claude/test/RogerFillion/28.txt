US Government's Latest Airwaves Auction Falls Far Short of Budget Expectations  

The Federal Communications Commission's most recent spectrum auction ended this week with disappointing results for the US government. The FCC aimed to raise up to $44 billion through the auction of airwaves suitable for 5G wireless networks, but the final proceeds fell far short at $19.6 billion. The shortfall in revenue from the auction threatens to impact the federal budget and the rollout of wireless 5G infrastructure across the country.  

The FCC auction, known as Auction 107, made available 3,400 licenses in the 37GHz, 39GHz, and 47GHz bands, segments of airwaves that are well-suited for 5G connectivity. The auction began on March 18 and ended on May 6, lasting 50 rounds of bidding over nearly two months. However, bidding interest and demand proved lackluster, leading the final proceeds to land at less than half of the FCC's initial estimate.  

The poor results of Auction 107 came as a surprise to industry experts and analysts. 5G technology is seen as crucial to enabling emerging technologies like self-driving cars, smart cities, and advanced virtual reality. Major wireless carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile spent tens of billions in recent years acquiring spectrum suitable for 5G, signaling strong demand and interest in airwaves ideal for next-generation networks. However, that demand failed to materialize in the latest FCC auction, the first with licenses specifically targeting 5G use cases.  

The lackluster proceeds from Auction 107 could impact the federal budget for fiscal year 2020 and slow the rollout of 5G infrastructure. The $44 billion in expected revenue from the auction was budgeted to offset spending in other areas, so reaching only $19.6 billion will require cuts or additional funding to close the budget gap. Federal agencies may need to reduce spending as a result. The funds raised in spectrum auctions also support the FCC's efforts to clear spectrum bands for 5G use and to fund research into 6G wireless and beyond. With less funding available, those initiatives may progress more slowly.

Wireless carriers and tech companies also rely on airwaves acquired in FCC auctions to support the buildout of 5G networks. Fewer licenses and spectrum available means fewer opportunities to gain the bandwidth required for 5G coverage, potentially slowing wider 5G availability. However, carriers can also acquire spectrum on the secondary market from other license holders, so 5G rollout delays may be temporary. 

The poor performance of Auction 107 suggests that spectrum values may face downward pressure as more bands become available for 5G and carriers achieve their coverage targets. While spectrum remains essential infrastructure for wireless networks, its scarcity, and thus value, is declining in the increasingly connected world. Future FCC auctions may continue to fall short of estimates unless the agency adjusts its expectations and takes a more conservative approach to valuing airwaves. With its budget now impacted, the FCC will need to find a solution to fund its initiatives if auctions no longer generate substantial revenue. Overall, Auction 107 signals rocky terrain ahead for spectrum policy and the federal budget.
