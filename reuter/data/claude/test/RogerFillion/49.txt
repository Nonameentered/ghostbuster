Former Judge who Oversaw Dismantling of Ma Bell Warns Against AT&T and SBC Merger  

Harold Greene, the retired federal judge who presided over the breakup of the AT&T telephone monopoly in the 1980s, warned regulators that approving a merger between SBC Communications and AT&T could undo the competitive gains achieved by splitting up "Ma Bell."

In an opinion piece published today, Greene argued that allowing the two largest surviving companies from the AT&T breakup to combine would represent a "huge step backwards" that risks higher prices and reduced innovation for consumers. 

"The proposed acquisition of AT&T by one of its former local subsidiaries, SBC, threatens competition and should not be permitted," Greene wrote. He oversaw the antitrust case that split AT&T into eight smaller companies as part of a 1982 consent decree.

AT&T and SBC announced plans last month to merge in an $16 billion all-stock deal that would create one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S. The companies portrayed the merger as a way to combine resources and better compete against large cable and wireless competitors.

However, consumer groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns that the deal could limit competition and lead to price hikes. The merger requires approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.

Greene argued that eliminating AT&T as an independent competitor could reduce incentives for SBC to lower prices or improve service. He also said the combined company would have more power to raise prices for access to landline networks, which many competitors rely on to provide phone and internet service.

"The elimination of AT&T as a separate entity will substantially change the telecommunications landscape, and will do so in a manner inimical to competition and the public interest," Greene wrote.

In response, representatives for AT&T and SBC said the former judge's concerns  were misplaced and argued the deal would benefit consumers by enabling faster rollouts of new technologies like fiber optic networks. The companies also disputed that the merger would significantly increase their pricing power.

"We respectfully disagree with Judge Greene's conclusion," said a spokesperson for SBC, adding that the company would remain subject to "vigorous competition" from cable and wireless companies even after the merger.
