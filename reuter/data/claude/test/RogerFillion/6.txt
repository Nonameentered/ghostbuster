Report Finds Alcohol and Tobacco Companies Using Flashy Graphics to Target Underage Youth Online 

A new report released today by the nonprofit organization Campaign for Youth found widespread use of flashy graphics, videos, and influencer marketing by alcohol and tobacco companies on social media platforms popular with teens and children as young as 13. The report analyzed the social media posts, profiles, and advertising of the top 10 largest alcohol and tobacco companies over a 6-month period.

The report found these companies frequently use attention-grabbing photos, videos, and memes on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok to spread brand awareness and make their products appealing to underage users. The posts often feature young attractive models, influencers, and celebrities to make the brands seem exciting and rebellious. The companies also use popular music, emoji, and internet slang in their posts to seem relatable to youth. 

“It’s deeply disturbing to see how these companies are strategically targeting kids and teens,” said Jennifer Harris, director of the Campaign for Youth. “Their sole goal is to hook children early to gain lifelong customers, even though it’s illegal to sell these products to minors.” The report calls on federal regulators and lawmakers to investigate these practices and penalize companies for marketing that appeals to underage youth.

The companies defended their social media practices, insisting their posts are aimed at legal age consumers and that they strictly follow all laws regarding alcohol and tobacco marketing. But health experts argue the posts clearly use themes and messaging that resonate most strongly with teens, not legal age adults. “These posts scream ‘youth culture,’ not the interests of most 21 to 25-year-olds,” said Dr. Megan Moreno, an adolescent medicine expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital. 

The report highlights the ongoing issue of corporate responsibility in an era where huge companies can directly interact with and target youth through social media. While the companies are following the letter of the existing laws, many see the current regulations as outdated and unable to address how modern marketing works. The Campaign for Youth is calling for updated, robust restrictions on targeted social media marketing to protect children. In the meantime, parents are urged to closely monitor their teen’s social media use and talk to them about these predatory marketing tactics.
