Federal Trade Commission Approves Time Warner's $6.5 Billion Purchase of Turner Broadcasting System After Restructuring Deal

The Federal Trade Commission announced today that it has approved Time Warner Inc.’s $6.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. The approval comes after Time Warner agreed to restructure the deal to resolve antitrust concerns.  

The FTC had expressed worries that the merger of Time Warner, one of the largest media companies, and Turner, which owns major cable TV channels like TBS, TNT, and CNN, would substantially reduce competition. However, Time Warner put forward a plan to spin off CNN and sell the channel to an independent buyer in order to alleviate regulatory concerns, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.

“With the required divestitures, the Commission majority concluded that the proposed transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition,” said Bruce Hoffman, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes praised the FTC’s approval and said the acquisition of Turner will speed the company’s plans to deliver video content on emerging digital platforms. “This merger will enable us to drive innovation in video and advertising, strengthen our competitiveness on multi-channel video programming distributors and virtual MVPDs, and create new consumer experiences,” Bewkes said in a statement.

Turner CEO John Martin also welcomed the approval, saying the companies had a shared vision for the future of media. “By combining with Time Warner, we will grow as a company, opening up more opportunities for our employees, partners and viewers. Importantly, we remain deeply committed to showing the world premium, socially-relevant content that entertains, informs and empowers,” Martin said.  

The deal is expected to close within the next 60 days, pending final approval from Time Warner shareholders. Time Warner has set a special meeting for shareholders on September 12 to vote on the Turner acquisition. Analysts say the shareholder vote is considered a formality at this point and see high odds of approval for the merger.

The FTC’s approval of the Time Warner-Turner deal, even with conditions, shows that regulators under the Trump administration and FTC Chairman Joe Simons are willing to allow further media consolidation. The deal creates a combined media conglomerate with control of massive libraries of content, even with the spinoff of CNN. However, consumer advocacy groups argue that such large mergers ultimately lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers. The impact of this mega deal may not be fully understood for years to come.
