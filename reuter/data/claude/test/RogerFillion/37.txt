Regulators Approve Overhaul of Domestic Telephone Charges to Lower Costs for Long-Distance Calls and Wire Schools and Libraries to the Internet

In a move that promises to reshape American telecommunications, regulators today approved sweeping changes to the system of commissions and fees that determine the cost of domestic telephone calls in the U.S. The changes will lower rates for most long-distance calls and charge higher monthly fees to phone companies, using the additional funds to subsidize internet connections for schools, libraries and hospitals across the country.  

The overhaul was announced jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and a federal advisory panel known as the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service. Under the new framework, long-distance call rates will decrease by as much as 20% over the next two years as hidden subsidy charges are peeled back. The subsidy charges, known as access fees, were originally implemented to fund phone infrastructure but have become outdated in an era of increasing internet-based voice and video calling.

To replace revenue from the reduced access fees, the plan increases a flat monthly fee on phone bills called the Universal Service Fund fee. The fee currently stands at $9.25 per month but will increase to $10.50 over two years. The additional $1.25 per month from each phone bill will generate nearly $500 million annually to support the new internet subsidy program, known as the eRate.

The eRate program will make high-speed broadband connections available to schools, libraries and hospitals, especially in rural areas where broadband has been unavailable or unaffordable. FCC Chairman Jonathan Smith said, "Broadband is the electricity of the 21st century, and no child in America should be left without access." The program aims to connect over 200,000 locations across the country over the next five years.
