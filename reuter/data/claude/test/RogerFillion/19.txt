 Firms Bid $173 Million for Digital Audio Broadcast Rights with Nationwide Coverage

Three major radio broadcasting companies placed bids totaling $173 million for key digital audio broadcast spectrum licenses in a Federal Communications Commission auction this week. The licenses for the broadcast frequencies would allow the winning bidders to reach up to 300 million Americans with over-the-air digital radio signals for the first time.

iHeartMedia, Entercom, and Cumulus Media submitted the top bids for licenses in the three largest markets - New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The auction covered licenses for spectrum in the 150-160 MHz band, which can support high-quality digital audio broadcasts with minimal interference. Licenses were available for the top 50 radio markets across the U.S., covering up to 75% of the total population.

iHeartMedia won licenses in New York and Chicago with bids of $57.4 million and $31.2 million respectively. The company already operates over 850 radio stations and is looking to expand its digital broadcast footprint. “These key licenses will allow us to reach the majority of Americans with crystal-clear digital AM/FM radio,” said iHeartMedia CEO Bob Pittman.

Entercom won the Los Angeles license with a bid of $45.3 million. Entercom is the second largest radio broadcasting company in the U.S. with over 240 stations. “Obtaining the Los Angeles license is a game changer for our business that will significantly expand our audience reach,” said Entercom CEO David Field. The company intends to launch several digital-only radio stations if it secures the license.

Cumulus Media was outbid for licenses in the top 3 markets but won several regional market licenses across the Midwest and Rocky Mountains, including Kansas City, St. Louis, and Denver. The regional licenses cover populations of several million in each market. “While we would have liked to win licenses in larger markets, the regional market licenses we obtained will allow us to serve many more listeners with digital radio and potentially transform our business,” said Cumulus Media CEO Mary Berner.

Broadcasters see digital radio as a way to compete with streaming music services like Pandora and Spotify. Digital broadcasts provide higher audio quality and more listening options through multicasting of several radio streams on each frequency. However, adoption of digital radio has been slow due to limited coverage areas and extra costs for radio receivers. The new nationwide licenses are aimed at accelerating the rollout of digital radio to match the reach of traditional AM/FM broadcasts. The FCC will review the bids over the coming months before officially granting the licenses later this year.
