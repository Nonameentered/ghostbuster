Top Regulator Suggests Three-Year Timeline for Airline Fire-Safety Equipment in Cargo Holds  

The nation's top air travel regulator suggested this week that U.S. airlines should be able to install modern fire suppression systems in all aircraft cargo holds within three years. William Thomas, director of the Federal Aviation Administration's Aircraft Safety Division, said new technologies like fire-resistant containers, heat detection systems and built-in fire extinguishing equipment could significantly improve safety in aircraft cargo holds if adopted quickly.  

"There is no reason we couldn't require active fire protection be installed fleet-wide on most cargo aircraft within 36 months," Thomas said in a speech to airline industry executives. "The technology exists, costs have come down, and this is a proven enhancement that would reduce risks in the air and on the ground."  

The FAA has long required stringent fire-safety procedures for passengers cabins but not for aircraft cargo holds, despite several crashes linked to uncontained cargo fires. As online shopping has fueled more air cargo traffic, pilots groups and safety experts have urged the FAA to mandate modern detection and firefighting equipment for cargo holds. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots, called Thomas' timeline "overdue but encouraging."  

Thomas said the FAA will issue a formal notice within weeks proposing new cargo hold fire safety rules. The proposed rules are expected to require both passive techniques, like fire-resistant cargo containers, as well as active systems like infrared detectors and Halon fire extinguishing equipment that can automatically detect and snuff out a fire. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers would then have 36 months to retrofit existing planes and incorporate the new equipment in new plane designs.   

The changes could cost the airline industry more than $4 billion in retrofitting and upgrades but would provide major safety and economic benefits, according to an FAA study. Uncontained cargo fires pose threats both in the air and on the ground, where a fast-moving blaze could destroy an aircraft, facilities or neighboring planes. “The costs of a single catastrophic incident far outweigh the costs of these enhanced protections,” the study said.  

Major passenger airlines like American, Delta and United carry significant cargo in the bellies of their passenger jets and have faced criticism for lagging behind European and other carriers that have already installed active fire safety equipment. The FAA changes would apply to both passenger and all-cargo airlines. 

Thomas said the goal is to minimize risks from the hundreds of tons of cargo hoisted into the sky each day in aircraft holds. “There is no reasonable justification for permitting an ongoing vulnerability that puts crew, passengers, cargo staff and property at avoidable risk due to potential cargo hold fires,” he said. The new rules “will give the flying public, shippers and aviation workers the assurance they deserve in the 21st century.”
