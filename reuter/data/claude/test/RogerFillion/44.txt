Clinton Administration Backs Legislation to Prevent Taxes on Internet 

The Clinton administration today announced its support for bipartisan legislation in Congress that would place a permanent ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and online services. The move comes amid concern in the high-tech industry over taxes that some states have already imposed or others are considering as a way to generate revenue from the booming electronic commerce marketplace.

In a statement, Vice President Al Gore said "the administration strongly supports legislation to ensure that the Internet remains a tax-free environment." Gore, who has made technology issues a high priority in the administration, said a moratorium on what are known as "bit taxes" and access taxes is necessary to promote the continued growth of the Internet and online services.   

The legislation is known as the Internet Tax Freedom Act. It was introduced in the House of Representatives by Reps. Christopher Cox, a California Republican, and John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat. A similar bill in the Senate is sponsored by Arizona Republican John McCain and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon. The bills would extend for at least two years a current three-year moratorium on Internet-related taxes and also expand it to cover local taxes and fees in addition to state taxes.

Some technology companies and public interest groups contend that taxes on Internet access and services would stifle the development of a fledging industry just as it is poised to blossom into an engine of economic growth. Critics argue, however, that companies making money from the Internet should pay taxes just like traditional businesses. 

Several state governors and legislators also argue that Congress should not tie their hands in seeking revenues from the Internet, especially when technology companies are not paying their fair share of taxes compared to other industries. However, proponents of the tax moratorium legislation counter that the boost to the overall economy from Internet growth will more than make up for any lost tax revenue, as well as generate new sources of sales and income taxes.

The outcome of the debate could have a significant impact on the future of electronic commerce and the way Americans conduct business, shop, entertain themselves and communicate over computer networks. With the Clinton administration now in support, prospects appear good for final passage of a tax moratorium this year, although more battles are certain before a compromise can be reached.
