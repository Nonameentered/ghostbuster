FCC Chairman Reed Hundt Resigns, Seeks Replacement to Focus on Family and Writing Books

Reed Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Bill Clinton, announced his resignation from the position effective immediately. Hundt has led the FCC, the top U.S. broadcast and telecommunications regulatory body, for over four and a half years during a time of rapid change in the industries. In a statement, Hundt said he is stepping down to spend more time with his family in Washington, D.C. and to focus on writing books about technology policy and regulation. 

Hundt was appointed by President Clinton in 1993 to lead the FCC. During his tenure, Hundt oversaw the implementation of key legislation including the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which opened up competition in the U.S. telecommunications industry. The act led to a wave of mergers between telecom and media companies and brought new choices for internet, phone and TV services to many Americans. Hundt also focused the FCC on expanding access to new technologies, especially increasing the availability of the internet to schools, libraries and rural healthcare facilities.

The White House has not yet named a successor to Hundt but is expected to pick from a shortlist of candidates with experience in communications law and policy. Leading contenders include the current chief of the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, the head of a large consumer advocacy group focused on media issues, and legal counsel for a major telecommunications firm. The next chairman of the FCC will face significant policy issues around media ownership, broadband access and net neutrality. 

In a press conference, Hundt said, "It has been an incredible privilege to serve President Clinton and work with my dedicated FCC colleagues on advancing communications technology and ensuring its benefits reach all citizens. But after 20 years of demanding jobs in government, law and business, I feel ready to shift my focus to my greatest blessingsâ€”my wife and two children." Hundt served in various political and legal roles before joining the FCC, including as senior advisor to Vice President Al Gore.

With Hundt's departure, the FCC will have two vacant seats on its five-member commission pending Senate confirmation of new appointees. The FCC is made up of five commissioners, including two from the political party that does not control the White House. No more than three commissioners can be from the same political party. The confirmed successor to Hundt as chairman will shape the direction of communications regulation and infrastructure in the U.S. for years to come.
