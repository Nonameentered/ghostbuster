FCC Rules in Favor of Baby Bell Phone Companies in Regulatory Battle, Leaving Customers with Mixed Results on Monthly Bills

The Federal Communications Commission today issued a pair of rulings that were largely favorable to major telecommunications companies like AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink. The decisions centered around two long-running regulatory disputes over fees that phone companies charge each other to connect their networks and complete calls.

In the first decision, the FCC voted 3-2 along party lines to overhaul its rules around "access charges"â€”the fees that long-distance and wireless carriers pay local phone companies to connect calls to their networks. The FCC raised the cap on many of these access charges, allowing local carriers to increase these interconnect fees by up to 40% over the next four years. Local phone companies like AT&T and Verizon praised the decision, saying it would allow them to recover costs and invest in infrastructure upgrades. However, long-distance carriers argued it could lead to higher costs for customers.  

In a second vote, the FCC made permanent a temporary rule that limits the ability of carriers to dispute certain types of access charges with each other. The FCC argued the move provides more regulatory certainty, but critics said it takes away an important cost-control mechanism that can help lower monthly phone bills.

Consumer advocates warned the dual rulings could lead to modest price hikes for customers over time, especially those with landline phones or long-distance calling plans. However, the increases are likely to be uneven, varying in size and scope across different regions and carriers. The FCC argued any consumer impact would be minimal, and new consumer protections built into the rules will help limit significant price spikes.

The decisions were the latest in a series of moves under FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to deregulate the telecommunications industry, relieving carriers of certain rules aimed at lowering costs for consumers. While industry groups applauded the rulings, consumer advocates voiced disappointment and said the agency continues to prioritize the interests of large phone and cable companies over citizens. The policy changes reflect the deregulatory bent of the Trump administration FCC, a departure from the more regulatory approach under the Obama administration.

In the end, customers are likely to see a mix of negligible impacts, small price hikes, and limited cost savings on their monthly bills as a result of Tuesday's FCC votes. The complex web of subsidies, regulations, and price controls underlying the American telephone system means regulatory changes often have scattered and hard to predict effects on consumer wallets. But in total, critics argue this latest deregulation by the Pai FCC could tilt the balance away from the interests of customers and more in favor of shareholder returns for telecom giants.
