Regulators Approve Auction of Airwave Licenses for New Nationwide Satellite Radio Services  

The Federal Communications Commission today unanimously approved a plan to auction off licenses for radio spectrum that could be used by companies to provide nationwide satellite radio services. The FCC hopes that auctioning off the airwave licenses to the highest bidders will encourage the development of new satellite radio offerings for consumers across the U.S.

The spectrum licenses up for auction cover the 2.3 GHz band and would enable satellite radio providers to broadcast hundreds of channels of digital audio programming to subscribers. The licenses would allow for services with much greater coverage and content than current offerings like Sirius XM, the dominant player in satellite radio.  

"This auction represents an opportunity to spur innovation in audio entertainment and expand options for consumers," said FCC Chairman Tom Langston in a statement. "By making this spectrum available, we aim to enable new competitors in the audio space and potentially new nationwide platforms to emerge."

The spectrum auction is scheduled to begin on December 6th and will involve 7,000 licenses. The licenses will be allocated in a mix of small, medium and large blocks in order maximize participation from both large established companies as well as small startups. The FCC hopes this approach will lead to the emergence of both nationwide providers as well as regional and local providers.  

However, some industry experts argue that it may still be difficult for new entrants to challenge an incumbent like Sirius XM, which has over 30 million subscribers and exclusive content deals with music and entertainment providers. New companies would face high costs to launch satellite networks and market services to consumers.  Partnerships or mergers between companies may be needed to make the business viable, some analysts say.

The auction of these airwave licenses represents one of the largest auctions of mid-band spectrum in recent years. The FCC believes the spectrum can play an important role in supporting next-generation wireless services, including 5G networks. Satellite radio companies that obtain the licenses will be required to provide service to at least 40% of the U.S. population within 6 years. The licenses have a 15-year term and can be renewed by the FCC.
