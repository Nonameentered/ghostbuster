House approves largest overhaul of federal public housing programme since New Deal 

The House of Representatives today approved sweeping legislation to revamp and increase funding for federally subsidized public housing for the first time since the New Deal era.

The $100 billion “Housing is a Right Act” aims to end decades of underfunding and neglect in the federal government's main public housing programmes. It would inject funds to renovate crumbling homes, eliminate massive waiting lists for assistance, and construct new units in an effort to combat an affordable housing crisis afflicting many low-income Americans.

The bill, approved with bipartisan support by a vote of 375 to 60, marks Congress’ most ambitious effort in generations to address public housing shortages. It would boost funding for Section 8 vouchers and the Public Housing Capital Fund, which helps housing authorities rehabilitate ageing complexes. It also provides incentives for cities and states to eliminate restrictive zoning rules and high fees that limit construction of affordable housing.

“For too long, we have not invested in public housing, and the most vulnerable Americans have paid the price,” said the bill's sponsor, Representative Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee on public and affordable housing. “Today the House said that in the wealthiest nation on earth, none of our citizens should face housing insecurity or be forced to live in unsafe conditions.”

The legislation faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where lawmakers would have to find ways to offset higher spending or raise taxes to fund the bill. Some Republicans have already criticized the legislation as an inefficient use of taxpayer money and argue it could exacerbate housing shortages by discouraging private development.

Still, the House vote signals a political shift on the issue. Public housing was an afterthought for decades as resources were slashed and programmes remained woefully underfunded. But housing costs have skyrocketed, homelessness has reached crisis levels in some areas, and the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the health risks of crowded housing conditions.    

The bill would provide $70 billion to renovate and modernize 1.2 million public housing units, some of which have fallen into dangerous disrepair. It allocates $25 billion to build some 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. And it would expand the Section 8 rental assistance program with $10 billion more a year so some 3 million additional low-income households could afford private market rents.

For public housing residents like Tamika King, a mother of three in Chicago, the influx of funds could transform lives. Her housing authority complex has dealt with mold, lead paint, and frequent hot water outages for years. “Safe housing should be a basic need met for everyone in America,” King said. “Congress now has a chance to make that right.”
