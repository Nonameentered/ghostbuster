Distillers urge common advertising code for alcohol, but wine and beer industries reject the idea  

The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is calling for a unified advertising code for all alcoholic drinks to help raise standards and protect consumers. The SWA, which represents Scotch whisky producers, argues that a single code covering spirits, wine, and beer would provide greater clarity for advertisers and help address public health concerns around excessive alcohol consumption. 

However, trade bodies for the wine and beer sectors have pushed back on the idea, saying that adopting a one-size-fits-all approach could restrict their ability to run responsible marketing campaigns tailored to their specific products. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which lobbies for UK wine, spirits and beer makers, said there are unique characteristics for each drink that warrant bespoke marketing codes.

The call for an umbrella advertising code comes amid tighter regulations on alcohol marketing in some countries and a shift in public attitudes toward increased moderation. A common set of standards could help address criticism that some alcohol ads can appeal to underage audiences or promote irresponsible drinking. The SWAâ€™s plan would see all drinks subjected to the same rules on placement, content, and targeting of ads.

While supportive of tackling problem drinking and underage audiences, the beer industry has argued that beer ads do not raise the same issues as spirits since beer tends to have lower alcohol volumes and is viewed by most consumers as less intoxicating. The brewers argue their ads are aimed at brand awareness and promotion of beer as a social drink. The Portman Group, a trade group for UK alcohol producers, said it believes the current self-regulated system tailored to different alcohol categories is the most effective approach.

Public health groups have voiced mixed views, with some backing a unified code to close regulatory loopholes but others arguing it may be too little too late and that further statutory restrictions on alcohol advertising are still needed. The debate around alcohol marketing rules is set to intensify as new regulations take effect in Scotland and Ireland in the coming months. The outcome could have wider ramifications for how alcohol brands reach audiences and promote moderation.
