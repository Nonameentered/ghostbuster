TV Broadcasters and Regulators Agree to Stepped-Up Timetable for High-Definition Digital Broadcasts

Major US television broadcasters and government regulators have agreed to accelerate the transition from traditional analog TV signals to high-definition digital broadcasts. The Federal Communications Commission and representatives from ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC announced a deal today to require broadcasters in the top 100 U.S. media markets to begin transmitting only digital signals by February 17, 2009. All remaining analog TV signals must be shut off by June 12, 2009.  

The transition to digital TV, which provides a clearer picture and more channels, was mandated by Congress in 2005 but has faced several delays. The new timetable will now require stations to switch more quickly to free up valuable broadcast spectrum that can be used for emergency services communications and expanded wireless internet access.

“This plan provides certainty to consumers that the digital transition will be complete next June and public safety will have access to the spectrum it needs,” said Acting FCC Chairman Michael Copps. “The incentive and support we have provided should help ensure that over-the-air viewers are ready for the big day.”

To help subsidize the costs of thetransition for viewers, the government recently approved $1.5 billion in coupons worth $40 each that can be used to purchase basic digital converter boxes. The boxes, which typically retail for $50-$70, can convert digital signals into analog format for display on older analog TV sets. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which is overseeing the coupon program, will make coupons available for request beginning next month.

Some consumer advocacy groups have worried that the stepped-up timetable does not give enough time for the public to prepare, especially given delays in launching the coupon program. “While we support the broader goals of freeing up broadcast spectrum and enabling new wireless services, the transition timeline needs to ensure that the tens of millions of Americans who watch over-the-air TV do not lose access,” said Christopher Murray, senior counsel for Consumers Union. 

Broadcasters have argued that moving faster will reduce consumer confusion and ensure that emergency alert systems relying on the analog spectrum can be transferred to digital as quickly as possible. The transition is seen as critical to ushering in a new era of advanced communications technologies that can spur innovation and economic growth.
