Regulators consider payment restructuring for cash-strapped wireless phone auction winners

The Federal Communications Commission’s record sale of wireless spectrum licenses earlier this year brought in about $80 billion for midband frequencies primed for next-generation 5G networks. However, some smaller winning bidders are now struggling to make the required down payments, prompting federal regulators to consider new payment plans to keep the auction on track.  

A number of smaller telecoms and cable companies bid for licenses in the FCC’s auction for midband 3.7 to 3.98 GHz spectrum, which are well suited for 5G. While the blockbuster total raised expectations of a quick rollout of new 5G networks, not all winners have the cash on hand required to make payments on their winning bids. The FCC acknowledges this challenge and is looking at ways to adjust the payment timeline to ensure license winners can make payments and put the spectrum to use.  

“Some smaller carriers may face difficulties meeting the Commission’s payment deadlines,” an FCC spokesman confirmed. “To achieve our goal of facilitating access to spectrum for 5G, we are open to considering reasonable payment plans from those licensees facing challenges.”  

One consideration is extending the payment period for licenses from the current 30 days to as long as two to three years for smaller bidders, according to industry officials. Another is allowing some down payments over time rather than the typical 20% upfront with the remaining owed over 10 years. The proposals aim to ease cash flow issues while still requiring full payment, with interest, as per the original terms of the auction.   Nothing has been decided yet, however, as regulators work to determine which bidders may face hardship and how best to modify payment terms.  Another consideration is whether adjusting terms for some may be unfair to others.       

The FCC’s auction of midband spectrum was a critical step in freeing up resources for 5G, which promises faster speeds, lower latency and the ability to connect many more devices at once. Midband airwaves, in particular, are well suited to balance 5G coverage and capacity. Winning bidders now have the opportunity to deploy next-generation 5G networks to compete with large carriers that own significant amounts of similar spectrum.  

While regulators work to address payment issues, winning bidders must still submit down payments as per the original terms. Once the FCC reviews requests for payment modifications and determines a resolution, it will announce the decision and issue new payment schedules for specific license winners as needed. The goal is to ensure as many licensees as possible gain access to the spectrum, even those facing short-term financial difficulties, all while maximizing the value of these public airwaves to meet the growing demands for 5G connectivity.
