Justice Department Investigates Possible Bid-Rigging in Airwaves Auctions for Wireless Phone Licenses 

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into potential anticompetitive practices by major wireless carriers during government auctions of radio spectrum, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation is focused on bids during Federal Communications Commission auctions dating back several years that were designed to distribute licenses for wireless bandwidth.

Investigators are looking into whether executives at Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., and T-Mobile US Inc. coordinated their bids to unfairly drive down the prices during the auctions, the people said. The auctions generated billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury but the Justice Department is probing whether the companies conspired to lower winning bids and gain a competitive advantage.

The FCC auctions brought in more than $45 billion from 2015 through 2017 for distribution of mid-range wireless spectrum. The bandwidth is suitable for next-generation 5G wireless networks and the licenses sold at the auctions grant operators exclusive nationwide access for up to a decade. The auction process awards licenses to the highest bidders.  

Bid-rigging, if proven, would violate federal antitrust law. It could undermine a process that aims to assign spectrum licenses to those that value them the most and drive the highest prices. Lower prices could hamper funding for programs that rely on auction revenue. The probe threatens to tarnish an industry that is preparing to invest billions of dollars in new equipment for ultrafast 5G wireless technology.

The companies said they are cooperating with the Justice Department but declined further comment. There is no guarantee the early-stage review will lead to any formal allegations of wrongdoing.

The latest investigation revives scrutiny of the wireless industry's auction practices. The Justice Department previously investigated possible anticompetitive conduct in FCC auctions from 1994 to 2000. That probe was closed without charges. More recently, a 2015 FCC study suggested larger carriers were able to win more low-frequency licenses in certain auctions, especially in more populated areas. Low-frequency airwaves are particularly valuable because they can travel long distances and penetrate buildings. Representatives from carriers denied manipulating the results.
