Study finds age-based TV ratings entice children to watch restricted content 

A new study published in the journal Media Psychology suggests that age-based content ratings for TV shows  and movies may actually encourage underage viewers to seek out and watch restricted content. Researchers found that children between the ages of 7 and 11 were more attracted to content labeled as "for ages 12 and up" or "PG" compared to content without any age-based rating.

The study looked at 200 children in two countries, the US and UK. The children were shown trailers or clips from TV shows and movies and then asked how much they wanted to watch the full content. Some of the content had age-based ratings of "PG" or "12 and up" while some had no age rating provided. 

Across both groups, the children indicated a stronger desire to watch the content with the age-based ratings compared to the non-rated content. This was especially true for boys and for children at the younger end of the age range. The effect was also stronger when children thought their parents would not allow them to watch the restricted content.

"We found that these age-based ratings, intended to warn parents and discourage underage viewing, actually had the opposite effect and made restricted content more enticing and desirable to kids in our study," said lead researcher Rebecca Collins of Georgetown University. 

The findings suggest the ratings led to a "forbidden fruit" effect, making the restricted content seem more exciting and appealing. The study also found that the children's estimates of the "coolness" and entertainment value of the content increased once an age-based rating was applied.

Some advocates argue the study shows the ratings are counterproductive and a flawed system. However, others argue that ratings still provide useful guidance to parents and that more parental control and discretion are needed to override the forbidden fruit effect.

"Parents should not assume that age-based ratings actually prevent underage viewers from wanting to watch the content or from actively seeking it out," Collins warned. She recommends parents watch and screen media content along with their kids whenever possible. The study also suggests that non-rated media is less likely to seem forbidden or elicit the same level of excitement for underage viewers.

The Motion Picture Association of America, which rates most films released in the US, declined to comment on the study. A spokesperson for the TV Parental Guidelines system that rates most television shows defended the ratings as helpful guidelines for parents but acknowledged they "are not a substitute for parents overseeing what their children watch." Researchers call for more work exploring how to make age-based ratings and content restrictions more effective while avoiding unintended consequences like the forbidden fruit effect observed in this study.
