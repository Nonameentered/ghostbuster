Regulators Approve Free Licenses for High-Definition Digital TV in Top 10 Markets Within 18 Months

The Federal Communications Commission today granted free licenses for local television stations in the nation's top 10 media markets to begin broadcasting in high-definition digital television (HDTV) within the next 18 months. The FCC is aiming to accelerate the transition to digital television to compete with private streaming companies and provide more high-quality viewing options to consumers. 

The largest media markets, including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Boston, Atlanta, and Houston will be required to broadcast at least one free over-the-air channel in high-definition within the next year and a half. These major markets represent over 40% of all U.S. television households, so the shift will mean that nearly half the country could have access to free HDTV programming by mid-2023.

"This is a giant leap forward for free, over-the-air television in the U.S.," said FCC Chairman Jonathan Smith. "By unlocking the potential of digital television and expanding its reach into our biggest cities, we are breathing new life into an old technology and giving viewers a reason to rediscover free TV."

Broadcasters had been lobbying the FCC to take more aggressive action to speed up the transition to HDTV as streaming services have dramatically cut into live TV viewership. Although most nationwide broadcast networks provide HDTV feeds to cable and satellite providers, only a fraction of local stations currently broadcast in high definition over the public airwaves. The cost of upgrading equipment and technology has prevented many smaller stations from making the switch. 

Consumer advocates applauded today's announcement, saying the shift to HDTV is long overdue. "High-definition programming has been commonplace for more than a decade but largely inaccessible for viewers who rely on free, over-the-air broadcasting," said Jenny Cho of Public Media Watch. "The rapid deployment of HDTV in these key markets will give more citizens access to a 21st-century viewing experience."

The deadline for local stations to upgrade to HDTV in the top 10 markets is July 2023. The FCC said it will review progress at that point and potentially expand the mandate to additional media markets based on consumer demand and broadcaster capability. Most industry experts expect the rollout of free HDTV programming to continue at a steady pace over the next 3 to 5 years until the majority of markets across the U.S. are able to broadcast local stations in high definition.
