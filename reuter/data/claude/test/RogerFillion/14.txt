Regulators Host Auction for Satellite Digital Radio, Critics Fear Millions in Taxpayer Losses

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened bidding this week on licenses for satellite digital audio radio services (SDARS), but critics warn the auction could mean significant losses for taxpayers. The agency announced last year that it would offer eight licenses for auction to operate a satellite radio service in the U.S. Two companies currently provide paid subscriptions to hundreds of channels of digital radio: SiriusXM and Tivva Holdings.

The FCC hopes competition from new satellite radio operators could benefit consumers with lower prices, more choice, and improved services. However, analysts argue that the market may not be able to support more than the current two services. If few or no qualified bids are received, it could result in tens or hundreds of millions in losses for taxpayers who funded the development and launch of the satellites and ground infrastructure.  

“Satellite radio is a mature market with limited additional growth potential,” said media economist Bruce Owen. “It’s unlikely new entrants at this point can gain enough subscribers to turn a profit, even with FCC licenses acquired at auction.”

The auction comes seven years after the bankruptcy of SkyTerra Communications, which received nearly $300 million in taxpayer-backed loans to develop a satellite radio network before going bust in 2010. Its assets were later acquired by DISH Network and repurposed for its Sling TV streaming service. Lawmakers at the time criticized the risky loan guarantees and lax oversight that led to the loss. 

The FCC first proposed opening up the SDARS market to competition in 2016 but faced years of delays. The long regulatory process adds further costs and uncertainty for would-be satellite radio operators. However, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai defended the decision to proceed with the auction, stating, “Competition in the audio entertainment sector will benefit consumers through lower prices and more choices.”

Bidding in the FCC auction will continue for several weeks. If there are no takers or bids fail to meet reserve prices, it would mark yet another costly misstep in the agency’s efforts to spur innovation in media technologies. Lawmakers may investigate how regulators approved the auction and loan guarantees in the first place if the process results in sizable losses for taxpayers.
