Opponents of U.S. Trade Concessions to China Gear Up for Congressional Battle 

Opponents of the Trump administration’s trade agreement with China are preparing for a major battle in Congress to block or significantly modify the deal. The “phase one” agreement, announced with much fanfare last week, requires changes to U.S. law and must be approved by Congress.

Critics argue the agreement does not go far enough in addressing China’s unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. They say Congress should hold out for a tougher deal, even if it risks angering Beijing and President Trump. Supporters counter that the agreement marks progress on key issues like forced technology transfer and subsidy reduction, and failing to approve it could damage ongoing trade talks.

The U.S.-China trade war has dragged on for 18 months, inflicting economic pain on both sides. The phase one deal offers some relief, cutting existing tariffs in half and pausing new tariffs. But most observers see it as a temporary truce rather than a comprehensive solution. “This deal is more of a ceasefire than a peace treaty,” said Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse University. “There are still many issues left unresolved.”

In Congress, the debate is taking shape along familiar lines. Democrats and Republicans friendly to organized labor argue the deal is too narrow and fails to curb China’s ambitions for technological dominance. “We need to get tough on China, and this deal doesn’t cut it,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. Some GOP national security hawks agree, warning that China aims to overtake America’s global leadership in strategic industries like artificial intelligence and biotech.

The Trump administration is lobbying hard for approval, arguing the deal makes progress on difficult issues and creates momentum for future talks. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers last week, “This agreement will lead to tremendous benefits for our farmers and ranchers...as well as new protections for intellectual property.” 

Many businesses also support the deal, craving an end to uncertainty. But public opinion is mixed, according to polls. Approval of the Trump administration’s China policy declined in 2019 amid the protracted trade war. For members of Congress facing re-election in 2020, it may be difficult to support a deal that lacks popular support. The vote margins in both chambers are expected to be narrow.

The congressional debate will shape U.S.-China economic ties for years to come. More comprehensive action may depend on the outcome of the 2020 election, but for now all sides agree: this initial skirmish is a fight worth waging. The future of American technological and manufacturing leadership hangs in the balance.
