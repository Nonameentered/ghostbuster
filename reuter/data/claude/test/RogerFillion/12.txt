Companies urge government for leniency on wireless phone license payments 

Some of Canada's largest wireless companies are asking the federal government to ease restrictions on payments for wireless phone licenses in light of the economic troubles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bell Canada, Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp. have sent a joint letter to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains requesting that license fees for wireless spectrum be either waived or deferred for the next two years.

The companies currently pay over $1 billion per year combined to the federal government for licenses to radio frequency spectrum used to operate their wireless networks. Those fees come due each April as part of the terms under which the companies acquired wireless spectrum licenses in an auction back in 2015. The spectrum licenses last for 20 years but ongoing annual payments are required to maintain access and exclusivity.  

In the letter, the wireless companies argue that the annual license fees pose an "excessive burden" at a time when their networks are facing high demand due to more Canadians working and learning from home during the pandemic. The letter claims paying the fees could hamper the companies' ability to invest in network upgrades and improvements. "Waiving spectrum license fees for 2020-21 and 2021-22 would provide financial relief allowing us to continue focusing on providing essential connectivity services to Canadians," the letter states.

A spokesperson for Innovation, Science and Industry Canada said the government has not yet made a decision on the request and is "monitoring the situation closely to understand the impact on the telecom industry." The department acknowledges the important role wireless and internet networks play during the health crisis but also notes that license fee waivers or deferrals could significantly impact revenue. Any changes to the fees would require amendments to the license agreements and approvals from Treasury Board and cabinet.

Annual spectrum license fees paid by wireless companies are an important source of revenue for the federal government, amounting to over $830 million in the 2019 budget. The fees contribute funding for important programs like the Connect to Innovate program which expands internet access to rural and remote communities. Some critics argue the large wireless companies are using the pandemic to lobby for license fee reductions they have long coveted to boost profits, even as they raise prices and introduce new wireless data limits for customers. The companies counter that any financial relief would allow them to better serve customers during this difficult time.
