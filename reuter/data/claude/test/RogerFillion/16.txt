Regulators Host Auction for Nationwide Satellite Radio, Critics Fear Cost to Taxpayers  

The Federal Communications Commission today began accepting bids for a new nationwide satellite radio broadcast license, a move that has raised concerns among some critics about the potential costs to taxpayers.

The FCC auction is for a license to operate a satellite digital audio radio service (SDARS) that would provide nationwide radio coverage, similar to Sirius XM. The winning bidder would gain access to a coveted slice of spectrum and the ability to compete with Sirius XM, which currently dominates the satellite radio market with over 34 million subscribers.

However, some public advocates argue that satellite radio does not serve the public interest enough to warrant giving away a valuable public resource like spectrum for commercial use. "Satellite radio is an entertainment luxury, not an essential communications service,” said Linda Sherry of Consumer Action. “The public should receive fair compensation for the use of public spectrum, or it should not be granted at all."

The FCC hopes that opening up the market to competition will benefit consumers through lower prices and more choice. "This auction provides an opportunity for a new entrant to offer innovative services and put competitive pressure on Sirius XM,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. But without a minimum bid requirement, the spectrum could sell for a very low price, costing taxpayers in lost revenue.  

Sirius XM pays an annual fee of over $200 million for its satellite spectrum licenses. If the new license sells for a fraction of that price at auction, it may signal that the market is limited for these types of nationwide satellite radio services. Some experts argue that streaming music services have replaced the need for satellite radio for many consumers.  

The auction is scheduled to run for two weeks, with the potential for multiple rounds of bidding. The SDARS license would allow the winner to operate satellites and transmit radio programming across the contiguous U.S. Bidding is anonymous, so it’s unclear which companies may attempt to enter the satellite radio market. But with Sirius XM’s considerable head start, any new entrant faces a steep challenge to gain subscribers and compete on price, even with the new spectrum license. The outcome of the auction may reveal just how much appetite—and pocketbook—any would-be competitors actually have to take on an established leader in this space.
