Wireless Phone Auction Winner Pocket Communications Files for Bankruptcy Protection

Pocket Communications, Inc., one of the big winners in the Federal Communication Commission's wireless spectrum auction last year, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today in Delaware. The Bellevue, Washington-based company cited excessive debt incurred from the auction, delays in building out its next-generation wireless network, and stiff competition in the cellular services market as reasons for seeking bankruptcy protection. 

Pocket Communications bid nearly $2 billion to acquire wireless spectrum licenses to operate cellular networks inseveral major cities across the Western United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix. The company had ambitious plans to build high-speed 5G wireless networks in those cities to compete with major carriers like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. However, Pocket Communications struggled to raise additional funds to pay for the network infrastructure and technology needed to launch its cellular services.

The company has $1.8 billion in liabilities and $850 million in assets, according to the bankruptcy filing. Pocket Communications said it intends to restructure its debt obligations and possibly sell some or all of its wireless spectrum licenses to generate funds to build its networks. The company warned in the filing that it may have to shut down operations if it is unable to restructure its debt and raise new capital. 

Pocket Communications' bankruptcy is a cautionary tale for small companies taking on excessive debt to bid in FCC spectrum auctions in the hopes of breaking into the competitive wireless carrier market. "Pocket Communications is just the latest in a string of wireless startups that couldn't turn government spectrum into a viable business," said Keith Mallinson, an industry analyst at WiseHarbor. "These auctions encourage speculative behavior, and companies get caught up in a bidding frenzy and end up paying far too much for spectrum licenses they can't utilize."

The bankruptcy court has a hearing set for mid-June to consider Pocket Communications' proposed restructuring plan. Rivals AT&T and Verizon may be interested in acquiring some or all of Pocket's spectrum and infrastructure for their own 5G network rollouts, analysts say. The company's wireless licenses in major West Coast cities are valuable assets, even if Pocket couldn't build a successful business, they note.

Pocket Communications' bankruptcy filing sent shockwaves through the telecommunications industry and is a warning to other new entrants hoping to disrupt the wireless carrier market. A company spokesman said Pocket Communications "remains optimistic" that it can emerge from bankruptcy protection as "a stronger, more focused company that is better equipped to roll out next-generation wireless networks to customers across the western United States in the coming years." But that optimism may be too little, too late for a company that bit off more than it could chew in last year's spectrum auction.
