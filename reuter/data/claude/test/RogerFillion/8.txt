Baby Bells' Overseas Advice on Opening Phone Markets Comes Back to Haunt Them at Home  

The regional phone companies that were spun off from AT&T in the 1984 breakup are now facing competition in their own backyard that is reminiscent of the open markets they helped establish overseas.

The seven Baby Bells, also known as RBOCs or Regional Bell Operating Companies, advised foreign governments for years on how to open their telecommunications markets to competition. They helped design systems where new entrants could access the existing phone networks to offer consumers alternative long-distance, wireless and Internet-based phone services. 

Now the tables have turned as the Federal Communications Commission is forcing the Baby Bells to open their own networks to competitors in a way that mirrors the open markets common in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The phone companies are crying foul, claiming that what's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander.

The issue came to a head recently as competitors filed petitions with the FCC to pry open the Baby Bells' networks for a new generation of Internet-based phone services. The Baby Bells vigorously opposed the requests, saying the proposed rules went too far and were unnecessary given their existing cooperation with some competitors.

Consumer advocates argue that the Baby Bells should practice what they preach. "They were happy to spread the open network gospel when it meant more business for them in other countries but now they're trying to prevent the same principles from applying here," said Rob Fisher, a telecom expert with Consumer Federation of America. 

The Baby Bells defend their position by noting the significant differences between the U.S. telecom market and those overseas. "We operate in one of the most open and competitive markets in the world," said Dick Greene, a spokesman for Verizon, the largest Baby Bell. He noted that the U.S. has multiple competing phone companies, both wired and wireless, in each region. "Government intervention isn't needed and will only disrupt the market," he said.

The FCC is expected to decide on the issue in the coming months. The competitors have requested rules ensuring low pricing and unfettered access to the Baby Bells' networks for connecting Internet calls between customers of different providers. If adopted, the new rules could significantly expand consumer choice for phone services at a time when many households are dropping their landlines in favor of wireless or Internet-based options.  

The turnabout for the Baby Bells highlights how the rapid pace of change in technology and markets can quickly turn yesterday's orthodoxy into today's questionable practice. The phone companies apparently didn't foresee that the open network principles they proselytized abroad might someday come back to their home market to undermine their own franchise. Now they're on the defensive trying to prove that what's sauce for the foreign goose isn't necessarily sauce for the domestic gander.
