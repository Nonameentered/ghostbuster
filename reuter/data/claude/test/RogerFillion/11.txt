Wireless phone license winners urge government for leniency in payment schedule 

The winners of wireless spectrum licenses in the recent government auction are asking for more lenient terms to pay for the licenses due to economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Department of Communications this week, the CEOs of the three major wireless companies that won blocks of bandwidth for 5G mobile networks requested an extended payment period from the typical 10 years to 15 or even 20 years.

Last month, Spectrum Co, Cellcom, and Telstra together bid over $43 billion to secure mid-band spectrum critical for next-generation 5G wireless networks that promise faster speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect many more devices at once. However, the companies now argue that the economic fallout from the ongoing health crisis may impact their ability to make good on those bids in the timeframe initially set by the government.  

“The companies fully intend to pay the entirety of bids for the essential wireless spectrum,” the letter stated. “However, the changed economic conditions mean we must find ways to ease the burden of upfront costs to ensure continued investment in building next-generation networks.”

An extended payment period would reduce large lump-sum payments in the first years following the auction and spread costs over a longer time horizon at a lower interest rate. The letter also requested the waiving of certain penalties if a small portion of payments were missed or delayed. A spokesperson for the Communications Department said the requests were under review and the department was “committed to working with carriers to enable critical investment in 5G deployment.”

Industry analysts say the pandemic has placed financial strain on telecommunications companies, with a drop in customer activity, rising costs to maintain networks under heavy use, and general economic uncertainty. However, others argue the industry is better equipped than most to weather the crisis, and spectrum purchases were voluntary bids with terms clearly set in advance. Consumer advocates also worry extended payment terms may delay the rollout of 5G networks or result in higher costs passed on to customers. 

The 5G spectrum auction was highly anticipated as a means to catch up to other countries who have made more progress deploying the technology widely seen as crucial for innovation in fields like telemedicine, connected vehicles, and advanced automation. The winning carriers pledged accelerated 5G network buildouts as part of the competitive bidding process. The request to revise payment terms casts some uncertainty over those commitments. However, carriers counter that financial flexibility would put them in a better position to follow through on investments in network infrastructure.
