New breed of cellular phones less secure than previously thought, researchers say 

A new generation of cellular phones that connect directly to satellites pose security risks that were not fully understood when the technology first emerged, according to a report published this week by researchers at Princeton University. The phones, which allow users to bypass traditional cellular networks and connect straight to orbiting satellites, were initially touted as a more secure alternative. However, the researchers found several vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to access users’ call and text logs, location data, and even take control of the phones.

The phones work by directly connecting via radio to satellites operated by companies like Iridium and Globalstar, which then route calls and messages back to the ground-based phone network. This allows the phones to operate in remote locations where traditional cell service is unavailable. The satellite phone industry grew quickly over the last decade as the cost of both the phones and satellite connectivity dropped. 

In their new report, the Princeton researchers examined six popular satellite phone models from leading manufacturers. They found security flaws in all six phones that could be exploited remotely by hackers. The most serious vulnerabilities would allow hackers to remotely track the location of users, view records of their calls and texts, and in some cases completely take over the phone to activate the microphone and listen in on private conversations.  

The researchers said satellite phone companies and makers were alerted to the vulnerabilities more than a year ago but in most cases have failed to implement fixes and security upgrades in their products. “These companies were so focused on connectivity that they failed to build even basic safeguards into the phones and network,” said Professor Jenny Chen, the lead researcher. “Given the sensitive nature of communications in some sectors that rely on these phones, this is really inexcusable.”

Advocates for satellite phones argue that despite the vulnerabilities, they still provide a lifeline for those in need of connectivity in emergency or isolated conditions. The companies also note that there have been no known hacks of their systems reported so far. However, the researchers warn that their findings suggest malicious actors may already be exploiting these vulnerabilities without users’ knowledge. Satellite phones "should not be viewed as a secure or trusted form of communication," the researchers concluded in their report. Overall, the new findings call into question the security of this growing but loosely regulated telecommunications sector.
