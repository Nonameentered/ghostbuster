Regulators set to approve new CD-quality radio service with coast-to-coast coverage

Federal regulators are expected to approve a new radio service that would deliver digital audio quality on par with compact discs for the first time. The service, called HD Radio, would allow radio stations to broadcast their over-the-air signals digitally at CD quality, in addition to their traditional analog broadcasts.

The Federal Communications Commission is set to authorize radio stations across the country to start broadcasting HD Radio signals using their existing radio towers. Once stations make necessary technical upgrades, consumers would need to purchase new HD Radio receivers to pick up the digital broadcasts and enjoy the higher quality audio. Receiver models are expected to start around $50.

HD Radio uses a digital broadcasting technology to pack more information into the same radio spectrum as analog signals without interference. In addition to CD-quality audio, the HD Radio service would potentially allow stations to broadcast additional streams of original content and service information like artist names, song titles and weather data. Some stations would be able to simulcast additional channels with completely different content on their digital signals.

With FCC approval expected later this week, major radio broadcasters like iHeartMedia and Cumulus Media would be able to start transmitting HD Radio signals to reach up to 60% of the U.S. population. The voluntary conversion to HD Radio among radio stations is expected to happen gradually over the next 3 to 5 years to minimize cost and disruption. But proponents hope the promise of superior audio quality and new services could help spark wider interest and adoption of HD Radio. The shift to digital radio has already begun in several other countries and HD Radio aims to help U.S. broadcasters keep up with technology changes in the radio industry.
