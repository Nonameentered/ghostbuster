Judge who Dismantled Ma Bell Worried About AT&T-SBC Merger Creating Corporate "Monolith"

The federal judge who oversaw the breakup of the AT&T monopoly in the 1980s has voiced concerns about AT&T's proposed acquisition of SBC Communications. Judge Harold Greene, who issued the landmark antitrust ruling that split the old Ma Bell into eight regional phone companies, warned that the $16 billion mega-merger could revive the specter of a dominant telecom monopoly. 

"What AT&T is putting together now is really reconstituting itself into what it was before," Greene said in an interview. "They are creating a monolith that will stifle competition." The proposed deal would combine AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance carrier, with SBC, one of the regional "Baby Bells" that emerged from the AT&T breakup.

Consumer advocates have also raised alarms about reduced competition and potentially higher prices if the merger goes through. But AT&T and SBC officials insisted that the deal would benefit customers by enabling the companies to offer bundled packages of local and long-distance phone service, as well as high-speed Internet access. "This merger is all about providing consumers with more choice, better value and higher quality," AT&T Chief Executive David Dorman said.

While Greene no longer has direct oversight of telecommunications policy, his views still carry weight in regulatory circles. As a U.S. district court judge in Washington, Greene issued the milestone antitrust order in 1982 that broke up the AT&T phone monopoly, ending its control over local and long-distance phone service nationwide. The "Baby Bells" that resulted were meant to foster competition in local phone markets.

But massive changes in the telecom and technology sectors in recent decades have undercut the rationale for maintaining strict separation between local and long-distance carriers. The Bells have expanded into new businesses, and cable TV and wireless companies now offer viable alternatives to traditional phone service. 

AT&T and SBC argued that those shifts demand new regulatory approaches. They said their union would produce economic efficiencies and allow them to compete more effectively against emerging rivals. But for Greene, the historical resonances are ominous. "It's a new ballgame in communications," he said, "but they're putting the ball back into the old stadium.‚Äù
