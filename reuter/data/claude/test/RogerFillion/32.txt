Justice Department Investigating Possible Bid Rigging in Airwaves Auctions for Wireless Licenses

The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation into potential bid rigging during recent Federal Communications Commission auctions of airwaves licenses for wireless services. According to sources familiar with the matter, antitrust lawyers at the Justice Department have sent requests for information to multiple wireless companies that participated in spectrum auctions over the past three years. 

The investigation is reportedly focused on communications and coordination between companies bidding in the auctions that could have improperly suppressed prices paid to the government. Billions of dollars have been bid during recent FCC spectrum auctions, generating significant revenue for the U.S. Treasury. Any bid rigging or anticompetitive behavior could call into question the integrity and results of those auctions.

Spectrum licenses are crucial assets for wireless companies, allowing them to deploy mobile networks that provide calling, data, and messaging services. As consumers demand faster data speeds and more connectivity, access to airwaves has become increasingly important for carriers to improve their networks.

The FCC has conducted multiple spectrum auctions in recent years, selling licenses in the 600MHz, AWS-3, and AWS-4 bands. The 600MHz auction in 2017 generated nearly $20 billion in bids, while the AWS-3 auction in 2015 produced over $40 billion in winning bids. The largest U.S. wireless companies, including AT&T, Verizon Communications, T-Mobile US, and Dish Network, all participated and acquired spectrum licenses in one or more of these auctions.
