Opponents Mount Fierce Congressional Battle to Overturn U.S. Trade Concessions to China

A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress has launched an effort to revoke the trade privileges recently granted to China by the Trump administration. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate that would overturn the modified tariff increases agreed with China as part of the phase one trade deal reached in December.

Critics argue the deal failed to address many of the structural issues with China's economic policies and intellectual property theft practices. "We have given up a critical opportunity to stand up to China's unfair trade practices in exchange for limited agriculture purchases," said Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a lead sponsor of the Senate bill. "Congress must step in to prevent American workers and businesses from suffering even more losses from China's continued violations of international trade rules."

The bills face an uphill battle as President Trump has touted the trade deal as a signature foreign policy achievement. However, lawmakers are hoping to put pressure on the administration to take a harder line in the next round of negotiations. They argue more needs to be done to curb Chinese industrial subsidies, force technology transfer, and limit intellectual property theft which still costs American companies hundreds of billions each year. 

"While increased agricultural exports are important, that alone does not make this a good deal for American workers," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), who introduced the House version of the legislation. "We cannot afford to roll back tariffs and open our markets to China without enforceable commitments to end unfair trade practices, protect intellectual property, and prevent job losses."

The tariffs that were slashed as part of the deal focused on consumer goods, a move that was criticized for reducing pressure on China right at a time when its economy was slowing from the effects of the trade war and the global economic downturn. "Revoking these tariff cuts will push China back to the negotiating table and strengthen the hand of U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer to secure a deal that actually addresses China's abusive economic policies," according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal. 

However, others argue Congressional intervention may only further strain an already tense relationship with China and undermine President Trump's authority in negotiations. "It is unwise and dangerous for Congress to meddle in the President's efforts to level the playing field for American workers on China trade," said National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow in a statement. The lobbying battle over the legislation is expected to intensify in the coming weeks as both sides ramp up efforts to win support from lawmakers. The outcome will signal how much appetite there is in Washington to maintain a hardline in future trade talks with China.
