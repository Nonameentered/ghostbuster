TV ratings system under fire in Capitol Hill hearings 

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill held hearings this week to examine the TV ratings system that determines the age-appropriateness of programs. The TV Parental Guidelines ratings have come under criticism recently as some argue they are too lenient and do not accurately reflect the content of many shows, especially regarding violence.

The ratings system was first adopted in 1996 by the television industry to give parents more information about the content of TV programs so they can make their own decisions about what is suitable for their families to watch. The ratings categories include: TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, and TV-MA. However, critics argue these ratings are too broad, especially on the upper end of the ratings scale.

"The TV-MA rating is meaningless," argued Dr. Melissa Gross, a psychiatrist who testified at the hearing. "It contains everything from relatively mild language and innuendo all the way to graphically violent content that should only be suitable for adults. How are parents supposed to find that helpful?" Dr. Gross called for an additional rating for very mature content as well as specific descriptions for violence and other potentially objectionable content.

The hearings also examined the body that governs the TV ratings system, the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board. Critics argue the board is too lenient in its review process and too heavily influenced by the TV networks and media companies that it is meant to monitor. "The fox is guarding the henhouse here," said Senator Joe Lieberman, who called for an independent organization to oversee the ratings system.

Representatives from the television industry defended the current ratings system, arguing it provides adequate information for the vast majority of parents. They warned that an overhaul could infringe upon creative freedom.  “For decades, the television industry and the Monitoring Board have worked to find the right balance between providing parents information and allowing creative expressions,” said Gordon Tanner, chairman of the Monitoring Board.

The outcome of the hearings is uncertain, but momentum appears to be building for some changes to strengthen the TV ratings system. Possible steps include creating a new rating for the upper end of the scale to better distinguish content intended only for adults, as well as establishing a more transparent and objective body to govern the process. However, any changes would need to be implemented voluntarily by television networks and content providers.  

Senator Lieberman urged networks to make changes proactively before Congress is forced to step in. "The choice is clear,” he said. “Either the TV industry puts parents first and agrees to fix a broken ratings system, or Washington will.”
