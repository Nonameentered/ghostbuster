No. 2 Bidder in Wireless Phone Auction Files for Bankruptcy Protection 

ACW Holdings Inc., the second-highest bidder in the recent Federal Communications Commission wireless spectrum auction, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The company cited its inability to finance the $7.2 billion in winning bids it placed during the FCC's Auction 107 for licenses in the 600 MHz band.

ACW Holdings, a privately held telecommunications infrastructure company based in Florida, was outbid only by telecom giants Verizon and AT&T in the auction, which wrapped up last month. The company placed winning bids on spectrum licenses covering much of the Western and Midwestern United States, likely hoping to turn around and sell the spectrum to major carriers that were unable to win licenses in their target markets.   

However, ACW acknowledged in its bankruptcy filing that it has been unable to find buyers for the licenses at prices that would enable it to pay the FCC its winning bids. ACW does not currently operate its own wireless network and has no telecommunications infrastructure or customer base from which to generate revenue. The company appears to have participated in the auction solely to resell spectrum licenses to other bidders.

In its filing, ACW reported less than $50 million in assets and more than $1 billion in debts owed to financial institutions that financed its bids in Auction 107. The company's largest creditors are a trio of investment banks that provided short-term loans to participate in the auction. ACW warned that it would default on its debts and likely forfeit its auction winnings without court protection to reorganize its business or sell assets.

The FCC now faces the likelihood of Auction 107 winnings going unclaimed and is expected to re-auction the licenses in the coming months after resolving ACW's bankruptcy. The fate of ACW's bids serves as a warning to smaller speculators hoping to turn quick profits in FCC spectrum auctions, as financing such bids can prove challenging. For major carriers, however, the availability of additional spectrum in the 600 MHz band at a second auction could present an opportunity to strengthen their networks at a lower cost.
