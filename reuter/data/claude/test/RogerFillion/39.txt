FAA Faces Criticism Over Slow Implementation of Fire-Safety Equipment Rules Following ValuJet Crash

Nearly 25 years after the deadly crash of ValuJet Flight 592 into the Everglades, the Federal Aviation Administration is facing renewed criticism over its slow implementation of measures to improve fire safety on aircraft.

The ValuJet DC-9 caught fire shortly after takeoff from Miami on May 11, 1996, killing all 110 people on board. Investigators found that oxygen canisters in the cargo hold, which were improperly labeled as empty, ignited and caused the blaze.

In the aftermath, the FAA promised swift action to strengthen regulations around the transportation of hazardous materials and require additional fire detection and suppression equipment on planes. However, many of these measures have still not been fully implemented, according to a new report by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General.

The FAA initially proposed fire safety rules in October 2000 but did not publish a final rule until more than 13 years later. The rule requires airlines to install advanced fire detection systems, automatic fire extinguishers in cargo compartments and carry flame-resistant cargo containers. Despite multiple extensions, some airlines have still not met requirements that compliance deadlines be completed between March 2021 to March 2023. 

"It is unacceptable that safety measures identified decades ago have still not been fully implemented," said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee. "The FAA must establish aggressive but achievable deadlines to speed up installation of fire safety improvements on passenger aircraft and hold airlines accountable if they don't meet them."

In a statement, the FAA said it is "committed to full implementation of the 2018 rule on transporting lithium batteries and 2018 rule on reducing fire risks in transporting air cargo." Acting Administrator Billy Nolen added: "We will continue to maintain high safety standards and oversight of the airlines as this work progresses."

Critics argue, however, that continued delays are putting passengers and crew at risk of catastrophic events like the ValuJet crash. "Nearly 25 years after ValuJet 592 went down, how much longer do we have to wait?" asked Matt Ziemkiewicz, president of the National Air Disaster Alliance. The alliance, which advocates for air crash victims and their families, is calling on Congress to set a hard deadline of December 2023 for all regulations and safety equipment to be installed and compliance verified on every passenger plane.

While rare, inflight blazes can have devastating consequences due to limitations in detecting and extinguishing fires in the air. The ValuJet disaster serves as a chilling reminder of what can happen without robust fire safety protocols and should spur quicker action, advocates say. For the relatives of those who perished, the long journey to closure and improved safety continues.
