Regulators Consider Restructuring Payments for Cash-Strapped Wireless Auction Winners  

Federal regulators are considering offering payment plans to wireless companies that bid successfully in airwave auctions but now face financial difficulties, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Federal Communications Commission runs auctions to sell licenses to wireless spectrum, allowing mobile carriers to expand their networks. Companies bid billions of dollars for the rights to specific airwave blocks. However, some smaller carriers that won spectrum in recent government auctions are struggling to make large down payments required to secure the licenses.  

Dish Network Corp and affiliates of Dean Giustina, the founder of telecom startup Ligado Networks, are among the companies asking the FCC for more time to make payments for spectrum won in auctions over the past two years, the people said. Dish bid $6.2 billion and Giustina's companies bid $970 million for licenses in a sale completed in June.

Under current rules, companies typically have to pay at least 10% of their final bids upfront, with the balance due in installments over years. But some companies claim their business plans have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn. They are asking for changes such as smaller upfront payments, lower interest rates, and more installment periods.

The requests put the FCC in a bind. If it denies extensions and the companies default, the spectrum could remain unused, and future auction revenue and competition could be at risk. But offering generous terms could undermine auction integrity and open the door to future demands for special treatment.

FCC officials, while expressing a desire to facilitate wireless expansion, say keeping auction commitments is important for fairness and maximizing revenue for taxpayers. The agency may grant limited accommodations but wants to avoid broader policy changes, according to the people familiar with the talks.

Dish and Ligado affiliates argue their situations are unique because of the pandemic and their plans to use the spectrum to offer next-generation 5G wireless service, which requires massive investment. They claim defaulting would strand valuable midband spectrum needed for 5G. The companies say they can honor financial commitments over time if given more flexible terms.

The FCC plans to rule on the requests in coming weeks. Its decision could shape future spectrum auctions and carriersâ€™ appetite for placing large bets on airwaves.
