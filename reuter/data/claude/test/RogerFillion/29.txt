Government's latest auction of airwaves falls well short of expectations

The government's latest auction of wireless spectrum received a lukewarm response from telecommunications companies, raising only a fraction of the amount that was projected. The auction, for mid-range 600 MHz frequency spectrum suitable for both urban and rural mobile coverage, brought in just over $20 billion. Analysts had expected bids between $50 to $70 billion for the airwaves. 

The tepid bids highlight the limited appetite among wireless carriers to pay high amounts for spectrum at a time when growth in the mobile market is slowing. Demand for spectrum, the radio frequencies that carry wireless signals, has traditionally been robust as carriers sought to bulk up their networks to meet the surging consumption of data and video streaming on mobile devices.

But now carriers have built out much of the infrastructure for current generation networks, called 4G LTE, and are being more selective in buying new spectrum. They are waiting for the next generation of technology, 5G wireless, to materialize before making bigger investments. 5G networks promise faster speeds, lower latency and the ability to connect many more devices at once, enabling new capabilities like remote surgery, smart cities and automated traffic controls.

"Wireless carriers are hesitating to spend heavily on spectrum if they don't have a clear path to build out networks to use it," said Nathan Pearson, an industry analyst with research firm Recon Analytics. "Until 5G networks start rolling out at scale, carriers are pausing on major spectrum purchases."

The largest bidders in the government's auction were the nation's biggest carriers, including AT&T, Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US. But none came close to spending the amounts they have splurged on spectrum in previous government auctions when 4G networks were being built out.

Sprint, the fourth-largest carrier, sat out the latest auction altogether as its parent company, SoftBank, is working to complete a merger with T-Mobile. That deal, if approved by regulators, would significantly boost the spectrum holdings of the combined company, reducing the need to bid in the current auction.  

The relatively weak demand and lower prices in this week's auction may benefit smaller carriers looking to augment their holdings on the cheap, analysts said.  It also means the government will have leftover spectrum to sell in future auctions as demand picks up again with the launch of 5G networks over the next two years.

The Federal Communications Commission will now review the results from the latest auction and grant licenses to the winning bidders over the next several months. The carriers will use the new spectrum to bolster their coverage in less populated areas and fill in gaps in more congested urban markets. While it may take years for carriers to put all the spectrum to use in their networks, wireless customers should benefit from fewer dropped calls and dead zones as additional airwaves come online.
