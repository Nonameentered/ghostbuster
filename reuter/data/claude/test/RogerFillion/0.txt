Regulator Calls for Open Auction of Radio Licenses for New Coast-to-Coast Service    

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced plans to auction off licenses for nationwide radio broadcast licenses, opening up the possibility of new coast-to-coast radio broadcasting services for the first time in decades. 

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the Commission will vote later this month on a proposal to auction off licenses in the AM radio band that would allow for broadcasting across most or all of the continental United States. "For the first time in the FCC's history, we are poised to authorize radio stations that can broadcast from coast to coast," Pai said in a statement.

The licenses would be for stations in the AM expanded band, between 1620 kHz and 1700 kHz. Signals in that frequency range can travel very far, giving them the potential to reach huge swaths of the country. However, the frequencies come with technical challenges like higher levels of interference. The FCC currently limits most AM radio stations to broadcasting during daytime hours and at lower power levels to avoid interference.

The plan to issue coast-to-coast radio licenses represents an effort by Pai to revitalize AM radio, which has been struggling with declining listenership for years. "To give AM broadcasters the opportunity to better serve their local communities, the FCC will vote to issue new FM translator licenses to AM stations operating in smaller markets, particularly those in rural and tribal areas,‚Äù Pai said.

The auctions for the new nationwide AM radio licenses and FM translators for small AM stations are scheduled to be held later this year and into 2020. However, some industry experts are skeptical that merely expanding licensing opportunities will solve AM radio's problems or bring in much revenue from auction bids.  

"The root cause of AM radio's decline has been the rise of FM radio, streaming services, satellite radio, and podcasts, not a shortage of licenses," said Jenny Lucey, a media analyst at research firm451 Research. "Easing licensing may give a few operators a chance to experiment, but expanding supply without a corresponding increase in demand is unlikely to drive higher auction prices or revive the industry."  

The FCC will vote on the nationwide radio license auction proposal on October  22. If approved, the full details of the auction process will be released in the coming months.
