Regulators Face Challenges Overhauling Phone Service Subsidies, Hindering Competition and Lower Prices  

Federal regulators are working to overhaul a decades-old subsidy program for landline phone service that is hindering competition and keeping consumer prices high. The Universal Service Fund subsidizes traditional phone companies like AT&T and Verizon to provide landline service in rural and high-cost areas. However, the $8 billion fund has come under criticism in recent years as many customers have dropped landlines in favor of mobile and internet-based phone services. 

Reforming the USF program has proved challenging as regulators work to promote new competition while still funding critical infrastructure and service in areas that remain dependent on landlines. The Federal Communications Commission has proposed shifting the fund to focus on bringing high-speed broadband to rural communities while phasing out subsidies for traditional phone service. However, the transition is complex with many open questions around how to distribute funding most effectively.

Consumer advocates argue the existing subsidy system favors large incumbent phone companies and stifles new competitors, resulting in higher prices for customers. "The status quo isn't working," said Carmen Scurato, senior policy counsel at the advocacy group Free Press. "Consumers are paying far too much for phone service because there's little incentive for companies to lower prices in non-competitive markets."  

The FCC hopes that opening up the USF to new broadband providers will spur new investment in high-speed infrastructure and provide consumers more and cheaper options. However, traditional phone companies counter that they still need subsidies to maintain existing copper landline networks, especially as customers drop the service. If funding is cut too quickly, companies warn they may not be able to afford providing landline service in the most high-cost, rural areas.  

Balancing these competing interests will be crucial as the FCC gears up for a final vote on USF reform expected later this year. While bringing the program into the modern era is critical, regulators must proceed carefully to ensure all Americans benefit from a connected future. Transitioning the fund will require phasing in changes over time to promote competition and affordability while also protecting vital infrastructure and the nation’s most vulnerable customers. Overall, reforming the USF represents an opportunity to connect more communities through broadband while making phone service more responsive to consumers’ changing needs. But getting there will demand flexibility, fairness and a commitment to the public interest.
