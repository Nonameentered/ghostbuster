Regulators Approve Landmark Overhaul of Domestic Telephone Charges, Lowering Costs for Long-Distance Calls 

Federal regulators today approved the most sweeping changes to the structure of domestic telephone charges in over 30 years. The overhaul will significantly reduce the fees that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies for connecting calls, a move that is expected to lower long-distance rates for consumers and businesses.

The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 to adopt a plan that will cut the access charges long-distance carriers pay by more than half over the next six years. The fees have been a major source of revenue for local phone companies but have been criticized as outdated in today's marketplace where there are more communications options. 

"These reforms will bring real savings and greater choice to American consumers while modernizing our communications policies to match today's technologies and competitive marketplace," said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in a statement.

Consumer groups have argued the existing access charge system is inefficient and leads to higher costs for customers.  "High long-distance rates due to excessively high access charges are a thing of the past and it's time for a change," said James Bradford, policy analyst at the Consumer Federation of America. "Today's decision is a win for consumers and will make phone service more affordable, especially for low-income families and those in rural areas."

The local phone companies, however, warned the sharp cuts could threaten their ability to maintain phone networks, especially in less populated regions.  "We are very disappointed with this misguided decision that fails to account for the impact on customers who depend on traditional landline service,” said the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in a statement.  The group has said more modest reductions phased in over longer time would be less disruptive.

The changes do not affect the fees for in-state long distance calls or the charges for mobile networks to connect calls to landlines. But the FCC said in its decision that it will examine those rates in the future to "determine whether action needs to be taken.” The new rules take effect for most phone companies next January, with the possibility of some individual companies phasing in the changes to minimize disruption. The FCC will review the process over the next two years to evaluate the impact and potentially make adjustments to the new policy.
