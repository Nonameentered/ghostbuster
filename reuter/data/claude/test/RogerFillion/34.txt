Congress Considers Changes to Airwave Auctions After Recent Failure and Antitrust Probe

Congress is holding hearings this week to consider reforms to the Federal Communications Commission's system for auctioning public airwaves to private companies. The hearings come after the FCC's most recent auction of wireless spectrum licenses failed to attract enough bids to meet agency projections, and after the Justice Department announced an ongoing antitrust investigation into possible coordinated bidding behavior among major wireless carriers in previous FCC auctions.

The FCC has used auctions since 1994 to distribute licenses for airwaves suitable for mobile phone service and other commercial wireless operations. In the auctions, wireless companies and other bidders compete to acquire licenses for specific frequency bands in geographic areas across the U.S. The FCC has lauded its auctions as a market-based mechanism that both maximizes the value of public airwaves and provides an equitable way to distribute limited wireless resources. 

However, the agency's most recent auction of spectrum in the 600 MHz band attracted only about $10 billion in bids, far short of the FCC's $40 billion estimate of the auction's value. Wireless industry analysts blamed lack of interest on several factors, including high prices for some urban licenses, lack of interest in rural or smaller licenses, and limited demand for the specific frequencies on offer. Following the auction's close with many licenses unsold, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai called for a "post-mortem" review of what went wrong.

The poor auction results came the same week the Justice Department confirmed an ongoing investigation into possible "collusion" or other anti-competitive behavior in a 2016 auction of spectrum. According to sources, investigators are focused on whether the three largest U.S. wireless companies - Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile - improperly coordinated their bidding strategies to ensure each won certain licenses at lower prices. The companies have denied any wrongdoing.

At this week's hearings, lawmakers pressed FCC officials on the agency's auction design and procedures. Democratic committee members argued for changes promoting greater competition and transparency, including limits on how much spectrum any single carrier could win in a particular market. Republican lawmakers warned against overregulation, while still urging the FCC to attract more bidders and improve information-sharing.  Pai told lawmakers the agency would work to simplify its auction rules, ease restrictions on some licenses, and improve its economic models to set reasonable prices, changes he said would boost participation for carriers small and large.

The hearings this week suggest lawmakers want to see a more robust, competitive marketplace in wireless spectrum auctions and opportunities for more carriers to secure airwaves critical to building high-speed 5G networks. Reforms may take time, but the message to the FCC is clear: fix the auctions so that more bidders show up and taxpayers get fair value the next time the U.S. sells rights to the public airwaves.
