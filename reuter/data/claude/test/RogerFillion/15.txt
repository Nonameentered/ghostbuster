Supreme Court Upholds Law Forcing Cable TV Operators to Carry Local Station Broadcasts 

The Supreme Court today upheld the 1992 law that requires cable television operators to carry local broadcast stations on their systems. In a 5-4 decision, the court rejected arguments from cable operators that the "must-carry" rules violate their First Amendment rights.

Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the must-carry rules "further important governmental interests in public access to news and public affairs programming.” The rules support the survival of local broadcast stations by requiring cable companies to carry their signals, she wrote. Without such intervention, the court found, many local stations would not survive competition from nationwide cable channels.

The must-carry rules, part of the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, require cable operators to set aside up to one-third of their channel capacity for local commercial and public broadcast stations. The rules were intended to prevent cable systems from refusing to carry local stations altogether or discrimination against stations in favor of those owned by cable operators themselves.

In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the must-carry rules impose an unfair burden on cable operators' speech rights under the First Amendment. "The government, in my view, has no business using its powers to suppress some ideas in order to put its favored ideas in their place,” Scalia wrote. He was joined in dissent by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.

Cable industry groups had challenged the must-carry rules, saying they limit cable operators' discretion over which channels they carry and discourage new cable channels from entering the market. Supporters counter that the rules preserve free, over-the-air local broadcasting, provide important news and public affairs programming, and prevent anti-competitive behavior by cable companies.

The court's decision preserves the status quo for the cable industry and local broadcasters. Most consumers are unlikely to experience any changes in their cable service as a result of the ruling. But the closeness of the vote, with the court's more conservative justices in dissent, suggests must-carry rules could be vulnerable if the ideological balance of the court shifts further in the future.
