Czech government plans to privatise Budweiser-maker Budvar via management buyout  

The Czech government has announced plans to privatize state-owned brewer Budweiser Budvar via a management buyout. Budvar, which has been state-owned since its inception in 1895, is best known for producing the original Budweiser beer. The government is looking to sell its 100% stake in the company to Budvar’s current management team.

The decision comes as the Czech government looks to raise funds by selling stakes in state-owned companies. Budvar is one of the largest brewers in the Czech Republic, producing over 1.5 million hectolitres of beer annually and employing over 1,000 people. According to government officials, selling Budvar to its management would ensure the company remains in Czech hands while generating substantial funds for the state budget.

The management buyout would see Budvar’s CEO and executive team take a controlling stake of at least 51% in the company, with the government retaining a minority share. The management team would invest its own funds, along with taking on debt, to finance the purchase from the state. The deal is expected to value Budvar at around $500 million, according to local analysts. 

Budvar has been embroiled in a long-running trademark dispute with U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch over the Budweiser brand. Anheuser-Busch brews Budweiser beer for sale in the U.S. but Budvar claims historical rights to the name “Budweiser” in Europe. Despite ongoing legal battles, Budvar continues to export its Budweiser beer around the world and the brand is considered a flagship Czech export.

Privatizing Budvar has been debated for many years, with previous attempts to sell the brewer failing due to disagreements over its value and concerns about Budweiser’s status as an important national brand. However, the current government says selling to the management team addresses these concerns while achieving their goal of reducing state ownership. The management buyout still requires final approval but government officials said a deal could be finalized before the end of 2020.
