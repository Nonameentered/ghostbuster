Czech Republic Finalizes 20-Year Deal with Norway to End Dependence on Russian Gas  

The Czech Republic signed a landmark deal with Norway today to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) over the next 20 years. The deal aims to diversify the country's energy supply and reduce its dependence on natural gas from Russia.

The agreement was signed in Prague by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. "This is an important step to ensure our energy security and independence," Babiš said at the signing ceremony. "We cannot rely on a single supplier. This deal with Norway gives us more options and freedom in negotiating gas contracts."

The Czech Republic currently gets over 95% of its natural gas from Russia's Gazprom. The new deal will allow the country to import up to 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually from Norway, which is a member of NATO but not the European Union. The gas will be delivered by tankers to a new LNG terminal being built on the Baltic Sea.

"This agreement is about security and stability of energy supply," Søreide said. "Norway is a reliable and long-term partner, and we are happy to help countries in Central and Eastern Europe diversify their sources."

The LNG deal is for 20 years starting in 2029 when the Baltic terminal is scheduled to become operational. The Czech government has agreed to subsidize the additional costs of the Norwegian gas so that its final price is comparable to current supplies from Russia.

The Czech deal reflects the broader European effort to reduce reliance on Russian energy following Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The EU relies on Russia for about 35% of its natural gas, but some Central European countries like Czechia have almost total dependence on Russian supplies. 

Norwegian gas exported to the Czech Republic will come from offshore fields in the North Sea as well as the Arctic region. Environmental groups have criticized the deal, saying it will support further exploration in ecologically sensitive northern areas. The increased use of fracking technology also raises concerns about sustainability, they argue.

Supporters counter that natural gas is a greener alternative to coal, which currently generates nearly half of the Czech Republic's electricity. Greater supply diversity also strengthens the country's negotiating position and prevents price gouging, they say. The Czech government hopes this first long-term LNG contract will pave the way for deals with other suppliers, particularly from the US.

The landmark deal is seen as a geopolitical victory for Norway in Central Europe where Russian and Chinese influence has grown in recent years. It also enhances security cooperation between the NATO allies at a time of heightened tensions with Moscow. For the Czech Republic, the agreement marks an important milestone in the country's decades-long quest for independence from its former Soviet master.
