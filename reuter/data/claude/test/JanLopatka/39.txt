Skoda Secures $170M Order to Supply Electric Buses to San Francisco, Largest Ever Czech Goods Supply to US 

Skoda Transportation, a Czech engineering firm, has secured an order worth $170 million to supply electric buses to San Francisco's public transit system. This is the largest ever supply of Czech goods to the United States. 

Under the contract, Skoda will provide 150 electric articulated buses over the next 3 years to replace San Francisco's existing diesel bus fleet. The new buses will operate on several high-ridership routes serving downtown San Francisco and connections to the broader transit network.

The buses are 18 meters long, can carry up to 133 passengers, and will operate purely on electric power with zero direct emissions. They represent Skoda's new Kendo model of electric bus, which offers a range of up to 250 miles on a single charge. The Kendo buses for San Francisco will draw power from overhead contact lines along key parts of the routes, with an on-board battery allowing limited operation away from the contact lines.

"We are delighted to be a partner to San Francisco in delivering clean, sustainable public transit," said Peter Skoda, CEO of Skoda Transportation. "Our Kendo model of electric bus offers an attractive combination of high capacity, long range, and fast recharging that will serve the city's transit needs well. This is an important milestone for us in entering the U.S. market."

The contract signals an important win for Skoda in the U.S. as it tries to expand beyond Europe. Founded in 1859, Skoda Transportation is headquartered in Pilsen, Czech Republic and has historically focused on trams, light rail vehicles, and buses for central European cities. However, an increased global focus on zero-emission public transit and sustainable mobility solutions has created an opportunity for Skoda to bring its experience to new markets.  

For San Francisco, the new electric buses will be a key part of the city's "Electric Transit Vision" to fully electrify its bus fleet by 2035. The transit system carries over 700,000 passengers each weekday, so transitioning to zero-direct emission buses is an important step towards the city's climate change mitigation goals. The Skoda partnership is the first part of a broader supply contract that will aim to replace San Francisco's remaining diesel buses over the next 15 years. Overall, it represents the single largest supply of electric buses to any North American transit agency so far.
