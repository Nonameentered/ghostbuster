Czech government introduces import deposits to combat trade deficit, but analysts say limiting public sector wage growth will have greater impact

The Czech government this week introduced a system of import deposits in an effort to curb its growing trade deficit. Importers will now be required to deposit 25 percent of the value of certain consumer goods at the time of importation, with refunds provided only upon the subsequent export of equal or greater value of Czech goods. The new measure aims to make imports more expensive and exports more financially attractive, theoretically narrowing the trade deficit as a result.  

However, many economic analysts argue that the deposit scheme will have a limited impact and that the government would be better served by limiting wage growth in the public sector. The Czech economy has experienced robust wage growth in recent years, especially for public sector employees, while productivity gains have failed to keep up. This has contributed to a gradual loss of export competitiveness for Czech manufacturers. 

“The import deposits are a superficial response to a deeper issue,” said Josef Tesar, an economist at Charles University in Prague. “They may narrow the trade deficit slightly, but they do not address the underlying lack of competitiveness in the Czech economy.”

The Czech Republic's trade deficit reached CZK 223 billion last year, the highest level in over a decade. Exports grew by a modest 2.4 percent, while imports spiked by over 7 percent, fueled in large part by strong domestic consumption. The economy as a whole grew by 3.8 percent, making 2019 the fifth consecutive year of growth above 3 percent.

Wage growth was a major contributor, with wages rising on average by 8 percent across the economy and over 10 percent in the public sector. The wage gap between the public and private sector has widened to over 25 percent, the second highest in the European Union. Economists warn this trend cannot continue if the Czech Republic wishes to maintain its export orientation.

"Unless the growth of wages, especially public sector wages, is brought under control, the damage to Czech exporters and manufacturers will be severe," Tesar said. 

The center-right government has pledged fiscal restraint but faces pressure to increase wages and social spending ahead of senate and regional elections later this year. Limiting public sector wage growth could undermine the government's support but is necessary to safeguard the export sector over the long term, according to analysts.

The import deposits, in contrast, are a politically expedient measure but will have only a marginal impact, in Tesar's view. With the Czech economy heavily integrated into European supply chains, the costs will be borne not just by end consumers but also by domestic manufacturers who rely on imported components. And there are concerns the measure could spark retaliatory actions by Czech trade partners.

Tesar urged the government to complement the import deposits with a more comprehensive program of productivity-enhancing initiatives, including education reform, reduced red tape for businesses and, most importantly, tighter control over public finances. “That is the only way to secure the Czech Republic's economic future,” he said.
