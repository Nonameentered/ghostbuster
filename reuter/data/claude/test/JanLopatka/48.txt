Pope John Paul hopes visit to Czech Republic will bring spiritual growth for all Czechs 

Pope John Paul II arrived in the Czech Republic today for a four-day visit aimed at reinvigorating the Catholic faith in one of Europe's most secular countries. The Pope hopes his sixth visit to the Czech Republic as pontiff will spur spiritual renewal among Czech Catholics and promote religious freedom throughout the country.

Speaking to reporters aboard his flight from Rome, the Pope said he views his visit as an opportunity to "confirm the faith" of Czech Catholics, who make up about 10 percent of the population. "The Czech Republic has a Christian tradition going back more than 1,000 years. I want to highlight that tradition and help Catholics reconnect with their spiritual roots," the Pope said.

The centerpiece of the Pope's visit will be a massive open-air Mass in Brno on Sunday that is expected to draw up to 100,000 worshippers. The Pope will also lead services in Olomouc and Prague during his visit. However, the Catholic Church faces an uphill struggle in the Czech Republic, which is one of the most secular countries in Europe. According to surveys, about 60 percent of Czechs say they have no religious affiliation.

The Catholic faith dominated Czech life for centuries but began a steady decline after the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s and the 1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed the "Prague Spring" movement. Successive communist regimes in Czechoslovakia persecuted Christians and suppressed religious expression until the 1989 Velvet Revolution.

"Communism tried to destroy Christianity in our country, and they nearly succeeded," said Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the Archbishop of Prague. "This visit by the Holy Father will strengthen our faith and bring Christ's message of hope and peace to all people in the Czech Republic."

While Christianity is making a comeback in some formerly communist countries like Poland and Lithuania, the Czech Republic has proven more resistant to religious revival. However, Church leaders hope the energy and charisma of Pope John Paul II, who played a key role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, can help reignite religious passion during this visit. The Pope's message of faith, tolerance and social justice is expected to resonate with both Catholics and non-believers alike in this country still grappling with the legacy of totalitarianism.
