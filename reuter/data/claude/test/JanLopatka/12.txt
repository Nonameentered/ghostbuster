Chemapol Group faces uncertainty and lack of transparency as shares start trading on PSE 

The Chemapol Group, one of the country’s largest conglomerates, started trading shares on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) today amid concerns over lack of transparency and uncertain long-term growth prospects. Chemapol shares opened at P250 per share, slightly below the initial public offering price of P255 per share.

Chemapol Group is a sprawling conglomerate with interests in petrochemicals, real estate, banking, fast food, and retail. The Group is debuting on the PSE after decades of being privately held by the Molina family. While the initial public offering raised P50 billion to fund expansion plans, many market analysts have raised concerns over the complex ownership structure, related-party transactions, and lack of clarity on the Group’s long-term strategy.

“There are too many unanswered questions about Chemapol’s ownership and business strategy,” said Jose Martin, analyst at AB Capital Securities. “Public shareholders will have limited visibility and influence over management decisions. There is a lot of uncertainty, in our view.” 

The Chemapol Group has over 200 subsidiaries and affiliates under its wings. However, the Group’s filings revealed complex shareholding structures, with many subsidiaries held under layers of holding companies. The Molina family retains 60% economic ownership and controls 85% of voting rights. This concentration of control and influence has raised concerns on conflicts of interest and related-party deals that may disadvantage minority shareholders.

The Group’s petrochemicals and real estate businesses account for over 70% of revenues and profits but face competitive and cyclical pressures. “Chemapol’s key businesses are in mature, competitive industries. Growth will be challenging without a clear strategic direction from management,” noted Mr. Martin.

In response to these concerns, Chemapol’s Chairman Jaime Molina said, “We have built Chemapol into a diversified and sustainable business over 50 years.  While we retain controlling ownership, we welcome public shareholders and we will enhance business transparency and accountability.” However, Mr. Molina did not articulate specific growth strategies or targets.     

With weak investor sentiment, uncertain prospects, and lack of transparency, Chemapol shares may continue to underperform in the near term. Overall, the company has failed to make a persuasive case to investors on its transformation into a publicly-listed company. Significant governance and strategic reforms are needed to unlock shareholder value for this sprawling conglomerate.
