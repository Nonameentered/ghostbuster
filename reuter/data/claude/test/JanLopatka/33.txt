CEZ a.s. Posts Higher Than Expected Profits for 1996, Plans to Pay Dividend 

The Czech electricity utility CEZ announced higher than expected profits for 1996 today, driven by greater electricity demand and cost efficiencies. The company reported net income of CZK 14.2 billion, up 15% from the previous year. Revenues rose 8% to CZK 105 billion. 

CEZ benefited from strong economic growth in the Czech Republic last year, which increased demand for electricity across all customer segments. Residential electricity sales were up nearly 10%, while the commercial and industrial segments grew 8% and 7% respectively. Export sales also expanded by 12% due to higher demand in Slovakia, Poland, and Germany.

Kvetoslav Turecek, CEZ Chief Executive, credited the solid results to the company’s investments in new generation capacity, transmission networks, and cost control measures. “We have worked hard to expand production from cleaner energy sources like nuclear, hydro and solar while improving the reliability of our distribution network,” Turecek said. “At the same time, we have streamlined operations and reduced costs and expenses through automation and workforce optimization.”

The cost optimization program delivered savings of CZK 3.2 billion last year, which helped to offset increases in fuel costs and some raw materials. CEZ’s diversified generation portfolio, with nuclear providing over one-third of its output, also shielded the company from higher coal prices. Nuclear generation remains CEZ’s lowest cost source of electricity.

CEZ expects continued steady growth in demand this year and plans to increase investments in new generation and power lines as part of its long-term strategy to boost efficiency, expand renewable energy, and maintain robust security of supply. Capital expenditures are projected to reach CZK 38 billion in 1997, up nearly 20% from last year. CEZ will fund the investments from its strong cash position and operating cash flow.

Given the solid financial results, CEZ intends to pay a dividend for the sixth consecutive year. The company will propose a dividend of CZK 60 per share at its general meeting in June, 10% higher than the previous year. CEZ shares rose 3.2% on the news and dividend announcement, bringing the gain this year to 15%. With its predictable returns and growth, CEZ remains an attractive option for income and value investors in the Czech market.
