IBM Czech Unit to Appeal Defense Ministry Decision on $45 Million Deal

PRAGUE — IBM's Czech subsidiary will appeal the defense ministry's decision to exclude the U.S. tech giant from a call for bids to modernize its command and control system, a deal which had been expected to generate up to $45 million for the company.

The Czech defense ministry announced Monday it had rejected IBM as a candidate for the project to upgrade the state's IBS command system, instead inviting 3 smaller local bidders to continue in the tender. The reason cited was that the criteria to qualify for the next round of bids had been "substantially changed," but IBM said the new criteria were not communicated to them ahead of time. The disqualification threatens to disrupt a longstanding relationship between IBM and the Czech state, which has relied on the company's defense technologies for several decades.  It may also delay the urgently-needed upgrade to the command system by up to 2 years, as new bids would need to be solicited. 

A spokesman for IBM Czech told reporters “We believe the decision to exclude IBM from further participation in the IBS procurement is without merit. IBM is ready to provide the Ministry of Defense with the most advanced technologies and technical capabilities to meet its objectives for this sensitive and critical project. We plan to take full advantage of all remedies and legal processes available to rectify the situation.” The Ministry of Defense declined to comment, saying it does not discuss ongoing public tenders.

The Public Procurement Act allows bidders to appeal decisions when specifications are changed, giving IBM a legal path forward to reversing the ministry's decision. Legal experts said IBM's position appears justified but  warned that procurement complaints can drag on for up to a year, further slowing the process. 

The command system upgrade program is considered a top priority for the Czech military and defense officials had hoped to complete the $45 million deal this year. The system is used by military commanders to gain and maintain a unified overview of Czech airspace and to task fighter jets to intercept unauthorized aircraft. The current system has been in operation since the 1990s  and has become outdated, according to military reports.   

IBM has provided technology and services to the Czech government and military since the 1930s, including a long-standing partnership with the defense ministry. Its Czech subsidiary employs over 4,000 people and generated $425 million in revenue last year. Losing the IBS bid could damage the company's reputation and relationship with the state, analysts said.
