Czech Republic Ends Dependence on Russian Gas with 20-Year Deal for Norwegian Supplies

The Czech Republic signed a landmark deal with Norway today to receive shipments of liquefied natural gas over the next 20 years, ending its decades-long dependence on gas supplied by Russia. The deal was announced in Prague by Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and executives from Equinor, Norway's state energy company. 

Under the deal, Equinor will supply the Czech Republic with 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, which accounts for about half of the country's annual gas consumption. The gas will be shipped from Equinor's Hammerfest facility, Europe's first plant for liquefying natural gas, and delivered to terminals in northern Germany and Poland. From there, it will be transported via pipeline to the Czech Republic.

The agreement is a major geopolitical victory for Norway and a blow to Russia's dominance as the key supplier of natural gas to central and eastern European countries. For decades, Russia's Gazprom supplied nearly all of the natural gas imported by the Czech Republic, which relies heavily on gas to generate electricity and heat homes. But as relations with Russia soured following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other disputes, the Czech government sought to diversify its gas imports and reduce dependence on Russian energy.

"This is an historic day that will contribute to the energy security of our country for decades to come," said Prime Minister Fiala at the signing ceremony. Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre also praised the deal, saying "this agreement will provide long-term gas supplies to yet another central European country, underscoring Equinor's role as a reliable supplier of energy to Europe."

The deal with Norway comes just months after the Czech government scrapped a tender for a nuclear power station that would have been built by Russia's Rosatom. It is a clear sign that Prague intends to pivot away from Moscow's influence wherever possible. For Norway and Equinor, the agreement further cements their position as a major alternative gas supplier to Russian interests in Europe.
