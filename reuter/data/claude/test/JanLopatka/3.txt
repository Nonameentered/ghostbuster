Skoda proposes barter deal to encourage Czech government to buy US fighter planes

Prague, Czech Republic: Skoda Transportation, a Czech engineering company, has proposed an innovative barter deal to the Czech government to facilitate the purchase of 12 F-35 fighter jets from the US. Skoda has offered to provide the Czech military with helicopters, trucks, and other equipment worth $1.3 billion in exchange for the fighter planes. 

The Czech Republic has been looking to modernize its aging fleet of fighter planes. The US F-35 jets, built by Lockheed Martin, are considered a frontrunner but the $1.6 billion price tag for 12 planes has proved too high for the Czech budget. Skoda's barter proposal aims to address this budgetary constraint by offsetting a major portion of the cost with critical land-based equipment and vehicles for the Czech army.

Under the proposal, Skoda would provide the Czech military with 20 helicopters, 500 military trucks, 36 self-propelled howitzers and munitions as part of the offset deal. The equipment offered by Skoda represents 70-80% of the total cost of the F-35 planes. The actual payment required to be made by the Czech government would be only around $500 million if the proposal is accepted.

"This barter deal would allow the Czech Republic to modernize its air force and also obtain much-needed land equipment without putting extra burden on the state budget," said Skoda CEO Martin Burkert. However, the deal has been criticized by the opposition who argue that Skoda may inflate the prices of equipment to make large profits from the deal. They claim that the government should buy the equipment from Skoda separately through standard procurement procedures to get better value for money.

The Czech government has not yet accepted or rejected Skoda's barter proposal. According to defence minister Lubom√≠r Metnar, the proposal is being "carefully evaluated" to determine if it offers the best value for the military's needs. The final decision is expected within the next two months. If approved, the delivery of F-35 jets and equipment from Skoda would start from early 2020.
