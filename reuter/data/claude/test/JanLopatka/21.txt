Czech Consumer Prices Rise Less Than Expected in August 

Consumer prices in the Czech Republic rose less than expected in August, data from the Czech Statistical Office showed on Wednesday. 

The consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.9% year-on-year in August, slower than the 3.1% rise in July. Economists had expected a 3% rise.

Prices for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels grew by 2.2% in August. Transport cost went up by 2% amid higher cost of motor fuels.

Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco grew by 9.3% and cost of restaurants and hotels increased by 5.2%. Prices for recreation and culture rose 2.4%.

Meanwhile, prices in the post and telecommunications group fell by 1.1% and prices for clothing and footwear declined 1.8%.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.3% in August, after remaining unchanged in the prior month. Economists had forecast a 0.1% rise.  

The central bank targets inflation of 2% with a tolerance band of 1 percentage point on both sides.  In August, five out of seven members of the board voted to keep the two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.25%. Two members voted for hike of 25 basis points to 2.5%.

“We expect inflation to remain above 3% in the coming months and see risks to the inflation outlook as being balanced. Nevertheless, weaker domestic economic activity and a slowdown in foreign demand may have a moderating effect,” said Jiri Rusnok, Governor of the Czech National Bank.

“The board debated increasing interest rates at this meeting but ultimately decided to keep rates on hold,” he added. For 2019 as a whole, the central bank continues to predict CPI growth of 2.3% and sees risks to this forecast as being balanced.
