Czech Agriculture Ministry Announces Management Buyout Plan for Budweiser Budvar

The Czech Agriculture Ministry announced today that it plans to sell Czech brewer Budejovicky Budvar to a group led by its current executives after negotiations with U.S.-based Anheuser-Busch InBev broke down. The deal would see Budvar's management team take a controlling stake in the state-owned brewery, which makes the original Budweiser beer.

Budvar, founded in 1895, has been locked in a long-running trademark dispute with Anheuser-Busch over the Budweiser brand. Anheuser-Busch produces Budweiser beer for the U.S. market but Budvar argues it holds the rights to the Budweiser name in Europe. The two brewers have clashed in courts around the world for decades.

The Czech government had been hopeful of reaching a settlement with Anheuser-Busch that would unlock greater export potential for Budvar, especially in European and Asian markets where the legal dispute has restrained its growth. However, talks broke down over price and control, according to a spokesperson for the Agriculture Ministry.

"We were unable to agree on a valuation of Budvar that would adequately compensate the Czech state while still allowing independent operations under new private owners," said Czech Agriculture Minister Miroslav Toman. He expressed disappointment at the collapse of negotiations but said the management buyout path can achieve the goals of privatizing Budvar while maintaining its legacy.

Under the proposed deal, Budvar's management team will acquire 51% of the company with the option to purchase outstanding shares over the next decade. The state will retain a "golden share" allowing it to block any undesirable private sector transaction. Specific terms of the buyout were not announced and require approval from the Czech government.

Budvar's CEO Petr Dvorak and his management team welcomed the chance to take full control of the company they have long steward. "Our team has agreed in principle to acquire a majority stake in Budweiser Budvar," Dvorak said. "We will now examine the details to ensure the long-term success and independence of our brewery."

Budvar produced 1.5 million hectoliters of beer in 2019, up 3% from the previous year. Its major markets are the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia but the brewer has expanded into more than 50 countries. The original Budweiser Budvar lager accounts for nearly 90% of all sales.
