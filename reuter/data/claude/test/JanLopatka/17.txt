Opposition leader Milos Zeman demands separate resolution to address concerns about reconciliation pact with Germany  

Prague, Czech Republic - The leader of the major opposition party in the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, stated today that he will demand a separate parliamentary resolution addressing concerns with a proposed reconciliation agreement with Germany before his party will support the pact. The agreement aims to resolve longstanding disputes over property and compensation stemming from World War II. However, the pact has faced criticism that it does not go far enough to address all claims.

Zeman, the leader of the CSSD social democratic party, argued that his party has reservations over several provisions in the agreement related to confiscation of Czech Jewish property during the war. He stated that the CSSD wants the lower house of parliament to pass a resolution declaring that the Czech government will continue to press Germany to compensate Czech Holocaust survivors and their families beyond the current terms of the agreement. 

The proposed reconciliation agreement focuses primarily on resolving disputes related to property confiscated from ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia after World War II. The pact would waive most remaining claims in exchange for a one-time payment of over $475 million from Germany to the Czech Republic. However, critics argue this amount is far lower than the estimated value of property seized from ethnic Germans, while the pact largely ignores unresolved claims related to Jewish property taken during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.

The German government has insisted that the agreement, which has been under negotiation for over five years, represents a "final settlement" of all outstanding claims between the two nations related to World War II and its aftermath. The agreement must be ratified by the Czech parliament and German Bundestag before the end of the year to take effect.

Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka faces a narrow majority in the parliament's lower house and likely needs support from Zeman's CSSD party to gain passage of the reconciliation pact. Sobotka has agreed to review the CSSD's proposed resolution but argued that reopening negotiations with Germany at this stage could derail the agreement altogether. The fate of the agreement remains uncertain as legislators prepare for what is sure to be a vigorous debate.
