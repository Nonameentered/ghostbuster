IBM to Appeal Against Czech Defence Ministry's Decision to Award Deal to EDS-Digital Consortium 

Tech giant IBM announced today that it will appeal against the decision by the Czech Ministry of Defence to award a lucrative cloud computing contract to a consortium of EDS-Digital and DXC Technology. The 10-year contract worth $750 million was awarded last month to modernize the Czech military's IT infrastructure and move critical systems to the cloud.

IBM believes it submitted a superior bid for the project and will contest the decision in the Czech courts. In a statement, IBM's CEO for Central and Eastern Europe Jiri Dvorak said, "We are disappointed with the Defence Ministry's decision. We believe our proven track record of success in delivering complex cloud and digital transformation projects for defense departments around the world makes us the ideal partner for this program. We will appeal to get clarity on how the evaluation criteria were applied."

The EDS-Digital consortium bid around 20% less than IBM's bid, according to sources close to the bidding process. However, IBM argues that it has far more experience in delivering cloud systems for defense applications with security requirements as stringent as those specified in the Czech tender. IBM also enjoys a good working relationship with the Czech government, delivering several strategic IT systems for various departments over the past decade. 

The appeal is expected to delay the implementation of the new cloud infrastructure by at least 6-12 months. The Czech military sees the new cloud system as vital to improving cybersecurity, efficiency, and interoperability with NATO allies. Ministry officials expressed hope that IBM's appeal would be rejected quickly by the courts so the new system can go live by early 2023. However, legal experts point out that IBM may have reasonable grounds to contest a contract award where it can show that the evaluation criteria were not properly followed.

The court decision promises to be a closely watched matter given the stakes around national security and relationships with strategic IT vendors. IBM's Czech CEO Dvorak said, "This is not just about IBM. It is about ensuring government procurements are fair and transparent to all parties." The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment while the legal process is ongoing. Industry observers point out that the final outcome of this contest may significantly impact future bids for large government digital projects.
