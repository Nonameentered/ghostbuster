Czech engineering group Skoda wins $170 million order to supply trolleybuses to San Francisco, their largest ever sale of goods to the US  

The Czech industrial group Skoda Transportation has won a $170 million contract to supply electric trolleybuses to San Francisco, marking the company's largest ever export deal with the United States. 

Skoda will provide up to 200 articulated trolleybuses to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency over the next five years. The trolleybuses will replace some of San Francisco's aging trolleybus fleet, helping the city achieve its goal of transitioning its public transit system to zero-emission vehicles.

The Skoda order is a boost for the Czech manufacturing company, which has been expanding sales of trolleybuses and trams around the world. While Skoda exports to Western European cities and countries including Germany, Italy, and Sweden, the U.S. market represents an important area of growth. The San Francisco deal surpasses Skoda's previous biggest contract in the U.S., supplying trolleybuses for the transit system in Portland.

“We see the U.S. as a very promising market for our zero-emission public transit vehicles and the contract with San Francisco confirms that we are heading in the right direction,” said Skoda Transportation CEO Petr Brzezina in a statement. “We believe that more and more cities in the U.S. will decide to invest in clean and sustainable public transit and we hope this reference will help us in further expanding our business across the Atlantic.”

Under the deal with San Francisco MTA, Skoda will initially supply 60 articulated trolleybuses with an option for the transit agency to purchase up to 140 additional vehicles over the contract period. The new trolleybuses will be 33 feet longer than the existing vehicles in San Francisco’s fleet, allowing them to carry more passengers. They will have low floors for easy access as well as amenities like air conditioning, audio announcement systems, and passenger counting equipment.

The trolleybuses will run on San Francisco’s vast network of overhead wires, producing zero direct emissions. As cities around the world seek to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, trolleybuses and other electric mass transit options have become increasingly popular. In the U.S., several cities in addition to San Francisco use trolleybuses including Seattle, Philadelphia, and Dayton, Ohio.

For Skoda, the San Francisco deal demonstrates the company’s ability to supply zero-emission vehicles on a large scale outside of Europe. While still a long way behind major Western competitors, Skoda is working to raise its profile in the North American public transit market, pointing to contracts like San Francisco as examples of its growing presence. The company hopes more cities across the U.S. and Canada follow San Francisco’s lead in the coming years.
