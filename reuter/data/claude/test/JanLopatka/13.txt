Czech parliament debates post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany amidst opposition uproar

The Czech parliament today began debating a reconciliation and compensation agreement with Germany stemming from human rights abuses and property seizures in the aftermath of World War Two. The agreement aims to resolve longstanding grievances between the two neighbors, but has sparked vocal opposition from some political parties and factions.

The agreement provides for Germany to pay the Czech Republic over $900 million Canadian dollars in compensation for property seized from ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia after World War Two, as well as for injustices faced by Czechs under Nazi occupation during the war. Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938 under Adolf Hitler, annexing border territories inhabited mainly by ethnic Germans. After the war, millions of ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled from Czechoslovakia. 

The proposed agreement was signed last month in Prague by the foreign ministers of Germany and the Czech Republic. Supporters argue it will resolve open questions around postwar expulsions and cement warmer ties between the two nations as allies in the European Union. However, the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party has attacked the agreement, arguing that Germany has not done enough to atone for its wartime occupation of Czechoslovakia. The Communist Party has also objected to the agreement.

Debates in the 200-seat parliament are expected to be heated, with the result uncertain. The governing coalition, led by populist billionaire Andrej Babis, holds only a thin majority. Mr. Babis has supported the agreement, arguing that continued disputes over historical injustices threaten to divide Czech society. However, some lawmakers within his coalition have signaled opposition. The center-right Civic Democrats, the main opposition party, also back the reconciliation agreement.

Germany has sought to make amends for its Nazi past with various neighbors, including through compensation programs and public apologies. Relations with the Czech Republic, however, have been particularly fraught given the Czech experience of occupation by Germany during the war and bitterness over the postwar expulsion of ethnic Germans. While trade ties between the two nations are strong, lingering historical disputes have hindered a full reconciliation at the political and social level.

Supporters hope the agreement, if approved by parliament, can mark a turning point by rebuilding trust and acknowledging the suffering that occurred on both sides. But its fate remains uncertain, with a close vote expected as Czech lawmakers debate how to come to terms with their country's complex 20th century history. The coming days will show whether Czech and German leaders' goal of overcoming divisions of the past will prevail.
