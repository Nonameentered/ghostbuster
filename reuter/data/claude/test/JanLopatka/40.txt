Czech engineering group Skoda wins $170m trolleybus order from San Francisco 

Skoda Transportation, a Czech engineering and transportation company, has won a $170 million contract to supply 60 electric trolleybuses to San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). This is Skoda’s largest order for trolleybuses in North America to date.

The new vehicles will replace San Francisco’s existing diesel and electric hybrid buses, increasing the reliability and efficiency of the city’s transit system. The 60 articulated 18-meter trolleybuses will operate on several high-frequency routes in San Francisco, serving over 50,000 passengers daily. 

“This is an important milestone for Skoda as we continue to expand our transportation solutions in the North American market,” said Skoda CEO Tomas Krsek. “Our trolleybuses provide clean, quiet and emission-free transport, helping cities like San Francisco meet their sustainability goals.”

Under the contract, Skoda will deliver the first trolleybus within 16 months, with the remaining vehicles arriving over the following year. Skoda will also provide spare parts, training and commissioning support as part of the deal.

The new trolleybuses will feature an advanced lithium-ion battery system that allows them to operate for limited distances even when not connected to overhead wires. This will provide more route flexibility and improve service reliability compared to the city’s existing trolley fleet.

“These new zero-emission trolley coaches will allow Muni to increase service on busy transit corridors, provide more reliable transportation throughout San Francisco and continue advancing the city’s Transit First policy,” said SFMTA Director of Transportation Edward D. Reiskin.

Founded in 1859, Skoda Transportation is a global leader in public transit solutions, with over 3,700 vehicles operating in more than 50 countries worldwide. The company produces trams, trolleybuses, metro trains, coaches, locomotives, and components including traction motors, control systems and bogies.

Skoda’s trolleybus portfolio includes the classes 12T, 15T and 18T, which can carry up to 160 passengers. The 18-meter articulated trolleybuses selected for San Francisco are Skoda’s largest, providing high capacity transit with zero direct emissions.

The new San Francisco contract reinforces Skoda’s position as a key supplier of sustainable mass transit solutions in North America. The company is already working with several other cities on the West Coast exploring trolleybus and tram projects to reduce emissions and meet climate change goals.
