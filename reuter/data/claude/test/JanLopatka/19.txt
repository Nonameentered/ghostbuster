Czech parliament in third day of debate over sensitive WWII reconciliation agreement with Germany  

The lower house of the Czech parliament entered its third day of debate today over a controversial agreement with Germany aimed at resolving disputes over property lost during World War II. The agreement has been in negotiation for over 25 years but continues to stir sensitive emotions on both sides.

The agreement establishes a process for compensating Czech citizens whose property was confiscated under Nazi occupation during the war. Germany expects to pay roughly $400 million to settle an estimated 15,000 claims, with many claimants likely receiving only a portion of the current value of their lost property. However, right-wing Czech politicians argue the agreement does not go far enough while left-wing politicians say it will reopen old wounds. 

The issue of reconciliation and reparations with Germany remains complex for Czechs. During WWII, Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany and its largely German-populated Sudetenland region was annexed into the Reich. After the war, Czechs expelled nearly 3 million ethnic Germans from Sudetenland in retaliation. The postwar border realignment gave Czechoslovakia millions of dollars of German assets, but also left many Czechs with unsettled claims for stolen homes, artworks, and businesses.

While most experts agree the current agreement is imperfect but reasonable, it has taken decades to reach and faces an uncertain fate in parliament. The center-left Social Democrat party endorses the agreement but right-wing parties like Freedom and Direct Democracy are strongly opposed. The debate in parliament has seen angry exchanges, with lawmakers calling the agreement “scandalous” or “barely scraping the surface of justice.” 

If approved, the agreement will likely be implemented over the next 5 to 10 years with the arrangement evaluated on an ongoing basis. Reconciliation with Germany continues step-by-step, a long process given the complex history between the two nations. The debate in the Czech parliament this week reflects how even 75 years later, memories of the war continue shape politics and society.
