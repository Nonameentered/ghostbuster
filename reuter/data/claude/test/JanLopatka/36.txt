Skoda to Cooperate with Trinecke Zelezarny in Steel Production and Privatisation Projects 

The Czech automaker Skoda Auto today announced a strategic partnership with the Czech steel producer Trinecke Zelezarny to boost domestic steel production and support the privatisation of the steelmaker. Under the agreement, Skoda will provide funding and expertise to help modernise Trinecke Zelezarny's steel production facilities in the northeast of the Czech Republic.

Trinecke Zelezarny is one of the oldest steel producers in Central Europe, founded in 1839, but has struggled in recent decades with outdated technology and mounting losses. The Czech government, which owns a majority stake in the company, has sought to privatise the steelmaker but has found no buyers. The new partnership with Skoda, one of the most successful companies in the Czech Republic, is aimed at making Trinecke Zelezarny a more attractive target for acquisition.

As part of the deal, Skoda will provide 200 million euros in investment over five years to upgrade steel production lines at Trinecke Zelezarny’s main plant in Trinec, including new rolling mills and automated quality control systems. Skoda will also provide consulting to help restructure Trinecke Zelezarny’s operations and cut costs. In return, Trinecke Zelezarny will supply Skoda with up to 350,000 tonnes of steel annually, covering nearly 60 percent of the automaker’s steel needs in the Czech Republic.

Czech government officials welcomed the deal, saying it secures the future viability of the country’s largest steel producer and an employer of more than 3,000 people in a region with high unemployment. The partnership is the first major move by Skoda’s new CEO, Thomas Schmall, who took over leadership of the automaker in January with a mandate to boost cooperation with domestic suppliers and industrial partners. For Skoda, the deal also guarantees supply of high-quality steel at predictable prices during a time of volatile global steel markets.

The deal marks a turnaround for Trinecke Zelezarny after several failed attempts at privatisation and years of uncertainty over its future. While the partnership secures the steelmaker’s operations for now, the Czech government will likely pursue new options to fully privatise the company over the coming years. The cooperation with Skoda at least makes that possibility more realistic and raises hopes for a revitalisation of Czech steel.
