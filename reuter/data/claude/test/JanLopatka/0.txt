Czech Republic sees first budget deficit despite government's optimistic reports 

The Czech Republic recorded its first budget deficit in over a decade, according to figures released by the Finance Ministry this week. The central government ran a deficit of 3.3 billion koruna or $142 million in the first quarter of this year, marking the first shortfall since 2009.

The deficit highlights the significant fiscal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Czech economy despite optimistic projections from the government. Finance Minister Alena Schillerova had forecast the budget to remain in surplus this year even as the crisis unfolded. However, a sharp drop in tax revenues as businesses closed and consumers stayed home has upended those predictions.

Value-added tax receipts fell by 11.4 billion koruna in April alone as the Czech economy ground to a halt under restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the virus. Income tax and corporate tax revenues also declined significantly. The government has delayed tax filings and payments to ease the burden on businesses and individuals, but the budget is still feeling the effects.

At the same time, government spending rose as authorities created aid programs to support workers, businesses and the healthcare system. The Czech government approved measures worth over $7 billion or 3.2% of GDP since March, including wage subsidies, loan guarantees, and direct aid for the self-employed.

The budget deficit is likely to widen further this year despite plans to gradually reopen the economy. The Czech economy is forecast to contract by up to 10% in 2020, marking the worst recession in decades. The unemployment rate has already started to rise, raising concerns about a protracted downturn.

The government has revised its own budget projections and now expects a shortfall of around 6% of GDP this year due to the crisis. Public debt levels, however, are forecast to remain low at around 37-38% of GDP, providing fiscal flexibility for continued stimulus spending. The Czech Republic entered the crisis with the lowest debt levels in the EU and a long track record of fiscal prudence.

While the current crisis will strain public finances, the Czech Republic’s position remains enviable compared to regional peers. The budget deficit, though unwelcome, is modest and affordable. The government has policy space to do more if and when needed to support lives and livelihoods through the unprecedented economic shock. Overall, the Czech Republic’s first deficit in years is a sign of these highly irregular times rather than a cause of serious concern.
