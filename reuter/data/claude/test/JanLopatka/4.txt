Czech Government Launches Investigation into Bank Failure

The government of the Czech Republic announced today it is opening a formal investigation into the failure last month of one of the country's largest banks, Bank Slavia. The investigation will explore the causes behind the bank's collapse and whether any laws were broken or improper actions taken by executives, regulators, or other parties.

Bank Slavia was the Czech Republic's fourth largest bank, with assets of over $25 billion US dollars. It failed in mid-March after a sustained run on deposits left it unable to meet the demands of customers withdrawing their money. The bank run started after questions arose regarding large loans Bank Slavia had made to several major real estate developers, who were unable to repay the loans after the Czech real estate market weakened. 

The Czech Finance Minister appointed a commission to investigate Bank Slavia’s demise with a mandate to issue a report within four months. "The failure of such a large bank has impacted the financial well-being of hundreds of thousands of Czech citizens and done harm to confidence in our banking system,” the Finance Minister said in a statement. "We must thoroughly understand why this bank failed, who is responsible, and how regulators and laws should change to prevent this from happening again."

Opposition leaders have criticized the government for not acting fast enough as Bank Slavia's troubles mounted over the past year. The investigation announcement follows widespread calls for an in-depth and independent inquiry into the first major bank failure in the Czech Republic since the transition from communism to capitalism in 1989. Consumer advocates are also seeking compensation and restitution for those who lost money and property in the bank's collapse.

Banking analysts cite inadequate capital requirements, risky speculative lending practices, and conflicts of interest among senior managers and board members as likely contributing factors in Bank Slavia's failure. The investigation's final report is keenly anticipated to provide clarity on how such a large bank could fail so quickly and what wholesale reforms may be needed to shore up the Czech banking system. The government is under significant pressure to hold any wrongdoers accountable and make borrowers whole to avoid sparking a wider crisis of confidence in the country's financial sector.
