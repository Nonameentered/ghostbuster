Czech Prime Minister Klaus Takes on Critics of Capital Market Regulation 

Prague, Czech Republic - In a speech before parliament today, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus vigorously defended his government's approach to regulating the country's capital markets. Klaus argued that limited regulation and minimal government intervention have been key to the impressive growth of the Prague Stock Exchange over the past decade.

Klaus touted the fact that market capitalization of companies listed on the Prague exchange has increased over 500% since 2000 and new listings are up over 250% in that time. "Our approach of light regulation and free market policies have unleashed the power of Czech entrepreneurship," Klaus said. He contrasted this with other European countries that have imposed stricter controls and rules on public companies, stifling growth and innovation.

The speech comes amid criticism that the Czech government's hands-off policies have allowed for risky practices and inadequate transparency on the exchange. Some opposition leaders and consumer advocates argue that more should be done to protect investors from potential fraud and abuse. They point to a lack of strict enforcement against insider trading and loose accounting standards for public companies as areas that require tighter rules and scrutiny.

Klaus dismissed these criticisms as reflective of a "misguided paternalism" that fails to trust investors and businesses to operate ethically on their own.  "The role of any government should be to get out of the way and allow the free market to flourish," he said. The Prime Minister argued that investors should go into the market with "eyes open" to risks and not expect an overbearing regulatory regime to protect them from losses. Self-regulation by brokerages and public companies themselves is sufficient, he said.

While Klaus's pro-business message continues to resonate with much of the center-right coalition government, critics argue that some regulation is necessary to build broader confidence in the capital markets. The debate over the appropriate level of regulation is likely to remain an ongoing issue facing the Prague Stock Exchange.
