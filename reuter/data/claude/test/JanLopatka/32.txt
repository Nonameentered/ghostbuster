Ceska Sporitelna a.s. Reports Significant Profit Increase in 1996 Despite Market Losses

Prague-based Ceska Sporitelna a.s., the largest bank in the Czech Republic, announced profits of CZK 5.3 billion for 1996, a 23% increase over 1995 results. The strong performance came despite losses in Czech financial markets over the year and slowing growth in the Czech economy. 

Ceska Sporitelna benefited from increasing demand for banking services, especially consumer loans, as Czech households become more financially integrated. The bank also gained market share in small and medium enterprise lending. Ceska Sporitelna’s corporate loan portfolio expanded by 12% in 1996. At the same time, the bank kept costs under control. By streamlining back office operations and automating more transactions, operating expenses rose by only 8% for the year.

"Our focus on service, innovation, and efficiency allowed us to more than overcome market challenges in 1996," said Peter Rozumek, Chief Executive Officer of Ceska Sporitelna. "We start 1997 with momentum and confidence in our ability to gain further market share while delivering value to both customers and shareholders."

The results stand in contrast to the overall Czech banking sector, where average profits declined by over 15% in 1996 according to the Czech National Bank. The Prague Stock Exchange index fell by 14% over the same period. Economic growth in the Czech Republic slowed to 4.2% due to weak export demand, below the over 6% pace of the previous four years.  

Ceska Sporitelna has recently expanded beyond traditional branch-based consumer and commercial banking. Its leasing, insurance, asset management, and merchant banking divisions all posted strong growth in 1996. Ceska Sporitelna also owns a majority stake in Modra pyramida, one of the largest Czech pension funds. 

Founded in 1822, Ceska Sporitelna was privatized in 1992 and acquired by Erste Bank of Austria in 1996. Erste Bank is a major retail and commercial bank in Central Europe with over 15 million customers across Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Croatia. The acquisition by Erste Bank brings new resources to support the continued expansion of Ceska Sporitelna.

With its diverse and growing range of banking and financial services, Ceska Sporitelna is positioned to benefit both from strong market potential in the Czech Republic and closer economic integration with Western Europe. Despite some market turbulence in 1996, Ceska Sporitelna proved its ability to outperform sector averages and generate shareholder value. 1997 is set to be another year of growth and innovation at the Czech Republic’s leading bank.
