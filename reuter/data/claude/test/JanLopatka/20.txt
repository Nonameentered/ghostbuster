Czech parliament approves post-WWII reconciliation agreement with Germany despite opposition efforts to block it 

The Czech parliament today approved a reconciliation agreement with Germany over atrocities committed during and after World War II. The agreement aims to put to rest long-standing tensions between the two countries as they forge closer ties within the European Union.

The agreement was passed with a narrow majority, overcoming efforts by opposition lawmakers to block its ratification. The opposition argued the agreement does not go far enough in acknowledging German responsibility for human rights abuses and the violent expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war.

The agreement acknowledges the suffering of victims during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and expresses regret over "acts of violence and injustice" committed by both sides. It establishes a fund to support humanitarian and social projects promoting reconciliation.

Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938 and occupied the country during World War II. After the war ended, millions of ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled from Czechoslovakia and stripped of their property under the postwar Beneš decrees. Historians estimate that thousands of civilians died during the forced expulsions.

Successive German and Czech governments have attempted to address this bitter legacy since the fall of the Iron Curtain. The new agreement follows a 1997 Czech-German declaration and aims to pave the way for "a future of cooperation and friendship."

The opposition argued the agreement should explicitly acknowledge the postwar expulsion of Germans as a violation of human rights. But government ministers said revisiting the validity of the Beneš decrees - still seen by many Czechs as justified punishment - would reopen old wounds and threaten the country's postwar constitutional order.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the agreement as an "important step towards reconciliation and a good neighborly relationship." The agreement still needs to be ratified by the German parliament, but approval is considered certain. Czech lawmakers must now work to build public support for the closer cooperation with Germany envisaged in the agreement.
