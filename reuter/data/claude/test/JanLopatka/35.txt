Czech-German Treaty Will Not Change Laws Expelling Sudeten Germans: Foreign Minister

Prague, Czech Republic—The Czech Foreign Minister today reaffirmed that the pending Czech-German reconciliation treaty will not alter existing Czech laws that prevent ethnic Germans expelled after World War II from reclaiming their property or citizenship. 

Speaking at a press conference, Foreign Minister Filip Novotny said "The Sudeten German expulsions were an unavoidable outcome of the atrocities committed during World War II and the principle of collective guilt that was applied after the war. The postwar treaties that established today's Czech borders will remain in force. While we aim to foster close and cooperative ties with Germany, we will not revisit the legacies of past wars and territorial conflicts."

After World War II, more than 3 million ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled from Czechoslovakia in a push to create homogeneous nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The majority were Sudeten Germans, who had lived for centuries in border regions of Bohemia and Moravia that were ceded to Nazi Germany in 1938 under the Munich Agreement. At the time of the expulsions, the Beneš decrees stripped most Germans and Hungarians of Czechoslovak citizenship and expropriated their property. Successive Czech governments have upheld the decrees, though Germany has long called for overturning them as a necessary step toward reconciliation.

The Czech-German treaty slated to be signed next month aims to establish "a strategic partnership" by deepening political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. However, Novotny emphasized that "addressing past injustices against Sudeten Germans or restoring their rights cannot be part of this treaty." The Foreign Minister called on Germany to honor existing postwar borders and suggested that revoking the Beneš decrees could "open the door to new territorial claims that threaten the integrity of our state."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed disappointment at the Czech position. In a statement, her spokesman said the decrees "represent a grave injustice that has burdened German-Czech relations for decades. Overcoming this legacy through dialogue and understanding is critical for a common future in Europe based on shared values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law." The spokesman reaffirmed Germany's view that the expulsions of Germans after WWII "cannot be justified" but indicated the treaty talks would proceed despite differences on this issue.

The conflicting views on restitution for Sudeten Germans highlight lingering tensions that continue to complicate Czech-German relations more than 70 years after the end of World War II. With the reconciliation treaty, both countries aim to overcome wartime animosities but they remain far apart on some key points of historical justice and responsibility.
