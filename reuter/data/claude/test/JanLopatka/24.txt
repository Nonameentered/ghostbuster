Czech Social Democrats aim to unite and position themselves to take power

The Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) held their party congress this weekend in Prague, aiming to present a united front and position themselves as a party ready to take control of government after the upcoming October 2021 elections. The CSSD, the main center-left political party in the Czech Republic and currently the junior partner in a coalition government with the populist ANO party, has struggled in recent years with declining poll numbers and internal divisions.

At the congress, delegates elected new party leader Jan Nebeský, the current Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, with over 80% of the vote. In his acceptance speech, Nebeský called for party unity and outlined a vision focused on tackling inequality and improving public services. “It is time for the social democratic ideals of fairness and equal opportunity to shape our country again,” Nebeský said. He reaffirmed the party’s commitment to raising the minimum wage, reducing the costs of housing and medications, and increasing funding for education and healthcare.  

Nebeský takes over from Bohuslav Sobotka, who resigned as party leader in 2018 after CSSD’s poor results in that year’s municipal elections. Since then, the party has been searching for a leader who can revitalize their brand and broaden their appeal. Although CSSD has traditionally drawn much of their base from blue-collar and rural voters, Nebeský pledged to also court younger, urban voters with a progressive social and environmental agenda. “The challenges we face as a society today know no generational or regional bounds. Our solutions won’t either,” Nebeský said.

Polling currently shows ANO with a sizable lead at over 30% support, with CSSD trailing in second at around 15%. But with over 40% of voters still undecided, Nebeský and other party leaders believe a unite CSSD could still prevail in October. In his speech closing the congress, former CSSD Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said the party was up to the task. “With new leadership and new ideas, there is no reason CSSD cannot once again earn the trust of voters and build a fairer future for all Czechs,” Sobotka said, to loud applause from the delegates. After this weekend, the party appears ready to work to prove him right.
