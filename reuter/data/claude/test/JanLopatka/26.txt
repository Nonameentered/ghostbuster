Controversial Czech Defence Ministry tender won by U.S.-led consortium, Unisys plans to appeal decision  

A controversial tender for a new information system for the Czech Armed Forces was awarded today to a U.S.-led consortium over the objections of competing bids and lawmakers. The Czech Ministry of Defence announced that the $300 million contract to modernize the military's IT infrastructure and cyber defenses will go to a group led by General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. The decision came despite lower cost proposals from technology companies Unisys and CGI as well as concerns about government procurement transparency.

The multi-billion dollar project aims to overhaul and link the information and communication systems across the Czech military and defence department. The winning bid proposed implementing a customized version of the U.S. Department of Defense's Joint Regional Security Stacks network security system. In their proposal, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin promised to strengthen the Czech military's cybersecurity, enable data sharing across branches, and simplify system maintenance and administration.   

However, the choice of the U.S.-led group was criticized by competitors who claim their solutions were more affordable and tailored to the Czech military's needs. The technology company Unisys, which submitted a $100 million bid, said it will appeal the decision to the Office for the Protection of Competition and plans to file a complaint with the European Commission. Unisys alleges that the tender process was designed to favor the large U.S. defense contractors and did not provide a level playing field for other bidders.

Some Czech lawmakers have also voiced concerns about a lack of transparency in the bidding process and worry the deal could make the country's defence systems dependent on U.S. technology and interests. Tensions between the Czech Republic and Russia have escalated in recent years over competing geopolitical spheres of influence, raising security fears. The Defence Ministry defended its choice, arguing the winning bid was the most advanced proposal to meet the military's complex requirements despite the higher price. The deal is expected to be signed within the next month pending the resolution of Unisysâ€™ appeal.
