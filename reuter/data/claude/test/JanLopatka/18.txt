Opposition leader urges clarification of Czech-German reconciliation pact

The leader of the Czech opposition Civic Democrats party called today for clarification of aspects of the Czech-German declaration reconciling the countries' relations after World War 2. Petr Fiala said some points of the 1997 Czech-German declaration were open to interpretation and were causing ongoing tensions, especially around the issues of post-war expulsions of Germans from Czechoslovakia. 

Fiala urged the Czech and German governments to issue an update or annex to the declaration reaffirming acceptance of the post-war transfer of the borderlands but clarifying language around expulsions. He said it was still not completely clear whether Germany accepted the expulsions as unavoidable or considered them injustices. This lack of clarity was fueling grievances in both countries that posed risks to the broader reconciliation.

The 1997 declaration aimed to overcome tensions stemming from early 20th century conflicts between Czechoslovakia and Germany, particularly the 1938 Munich agreement in which Nazi Germany took control of borderlands from Czechoslovakia. The declaration affirmed the countries' acceptance of the post-WW2 borders and called for cooperation toward shared democratic values. It has been hailed as a landmark step in post-war Czech-German rapprochement.

However, Fiala said parts of the declaration now needed elaboration due to "interpretation issues". He highlighted a passage expressing deep regret over "injustices" during and after WW2 with responsibility attributed to "all sides". This could be read, he said, as attributing some responsibility to Czechoslovakia for the expulsions of around 3 million Germans, a view Czechs strongly reject. Clarification was needed, he argued, to close this "loophole".

A German government spokesperson today replied that Germany accepted the expulsions as an unavoidable effect of the war and saw no need to clarify or modify the declaration. However, a leading scholar of Czech-German relations, Tomas Straka of Prague's Charles University, said aspects of the declaration could benefit from elaboration, if handled carefully. He said clarifying the intent and historical context around phrases like "injustices on all sides" may help address grievances that still linger in Czech and German societies and strengthen the reconciliation.

The issue looks set to remain a point of debate, highlighting the ongoing delicacy of handling this still complex and emotional aspect of Czech and German history. While the 1997 declaration was a milestone, further steps may still be needed to reconcile the open wounds of war and its consequences. The opposition call for clarification is a sign these wounds have yet to fully heal.
