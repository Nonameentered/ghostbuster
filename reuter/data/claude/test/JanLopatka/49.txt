CEZ Reports Lower Profits Due to Battle Over Price Agreements with Distributors

Czech utility CEZ reported a 14% drop in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday as a long-running dispute over electricity distribution charges weighed on earnings.  

The largest utility in central and eastern Europe said higher electricity prices were offset by lower distribution volumes and a regulatory charge related to a years-long dispute with regional distributors over the pricing of electricity distribution.

Net profit fell to 13.3 billion Czech crowns ($603 million) in the January-March period. Operating profit dropped 10% to 19.1 billion crowns on flat revenue of 47.6 billion. Electricity prices rose thanks to higher international electricity market prices but gas and heat prices declined.

CEZ has been embroiled in a dispute with regional power distributors over the fees it can charge to deliver electricity since 2013. An unfavorable regulatory ruling last year meant CEZ had to set aside funds to compensate the distributors, though it continues to appeal the decision.

CEZ Chief Financial Officer Martin Novak said the set-aside lowered first-quarter earnings by 2.2 billion crowns and warned of further impacts if the ruling is upheld. But he said the utility’s financial position remains solid, with net debt to EBITDA at 1.9 times at the end of March.

The Czech parliament is debating an amendment to the energy law that would allow the national energy regulator to reopen the price-setting process, which could help resolve the dispute in CEZ’s favor.

A favorable ruling would allow CEZ to use the set-aside funds for shareholder dividends, Novak said. CEZ plans to pay a dividend of 48 crowns per share, the same as last year. CEZ shares were down 0.3% in midday trade in Prague.   

CEZ reiterated its 2019 earnings guidance, which forecasts a net profit drop of up to 9% due to further impacts from the distribution charge dispute as well as higher pressure from increasing carbon emission allowance prices.

“The biggest negatives, the distribution charge and increasing CO2 costs, persist,” said Pavel Motycak, an analyst at J&T Banka. But he said earnings were solid otherwise and the share price, down 2.5% this year, already reflected the guidance.

The Czech government has a nearly 70% stake in CEZ.
