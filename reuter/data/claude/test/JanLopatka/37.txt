Skoda a.s. to Supply Trolleybuses Worth Over $170 Million to San Francisco

San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) has awarded a contract to Czech transportation manufacturer Skoda a.s. to supply 60 zero-emission electric trolleybuses. The over $170 million deal represents the agency's largest purchase of trolleybuses in its history as it works to transition its fleet to sustainable electric vehicles.   

The 60 articulated 18-meter trolleybuses will start arriving in San Francisco in 2021 to replace some of the city's aging diesel buses. The new trolleybuses will service eight transit routes on some of the city's busiest corridors, including Mission St., Geary Blvd. and Fillmore St. Each new trolleybus can carry up to 120 passengers and is equipped with on-board charging, allowing it to operate up to 10 km without overhead wires.

"This is a pivotal moment for San Francisco's transit system," said SFMTA Director of Transportation Jeff Tumlin. "The new zero-emission trolleybuses from Skoda will allow us to provide cleaner, quieter service to tens of thousands of San Franciscans every day. They are a crucial step toward our vision for an all-electric bus fleet."

The contract with Skoda is part of SFMTA's commitment to transitioning its over 1,000 transit vehicles to zero-emission by 2035. The agency plans to procure only electric trolleybuses and battery buses for replacement and expansion going forward. The 60 trolleybuses from Skoda will join 35 battery-electric buses set to begin service in 2020, also as part of SFMTA's drive for more sustainable public transit.   

"We are very pleased that Skoda trolleybuses were selected for this prestigious project in San Francisco," said Skoda Transportation CEO Peter Jurik.  "It demonstrates Skoda's leadership in supplying innovative, eco-friendly transportation solutions for smart cities worldwide. Our trolleybuses provide an excellent zero-emission experience for both passengers and drivers."

Skoda is a leading manufacturer of electric trolleybuses, trams, metro trains as well as diesel and electric buses. Headquartered in Plzen, Czech Republic, Skoda hassupplied over 18,000 vehicles to more than 300 cities in 30 countries. The San Francisco trolleybus contract further cements Skoda as a key partner for global cities transitioning to sustainable public transport.
