Czech ultra-right Republicans protest German Chancellor's arrival to sign post-war reconciliation accord

Prague, Czech Republic—German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Prague today to sign an historic reconciliation agreement with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis. The agreement aims to formally end lingering tensions between the two nations stemming from World War II  and the subsequent Cold War era. However, Merkel was greeted by an angry crowd of protesters organized by the ultra-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD). 

The SPD, known for its anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic platform, organized a protest in Wenceslas Square near the Czech presidential palace where Merkel and Babis held a ceremony to sign the accord. Over 1,000 SPD supporters gathered, holding signs accusing Merkel of trying to orchestrate the “Islamization of Europe” and demanding she leave the Czech Republic. 

"We do not forget the horrors of the Second World War and the immense suffering Germany inflicted on the Czech people," said SPD chairman Tomio Okamura in a statement. "Merkel's policies threaten our nation again by opening the doors to mass migration and undermining our sovereignty."

While the SPD has seen its popularity grow in recent years, political observers say today's protests likely appealed only to a radical minority in the Czech Republic. Public opinion polls show most Czechs support the reconciliation agreement and normalization of relations with Germany. 

For her part, Merkel did not comment on the protests and remained focused on the task at hand. "Germany and the Czech Republic have overcome our history of conflict and are united in our shared vision of a peaceful and prosperous Europe," she said at the signing ceremony. 

Babis, a populist billionaire, also avoided direct criticism of the SPD. But he affirmed his commitment to maintaining strong alliances with the European Union and key EU members like Germany. The new accord pledges cooperation on trade, education, environmental protection, and restoring historical artifacts lost or destroyed during the war.

The reconciliation agreement is the culmination of years of diplomacy between the two nations. While post-war tensions diminished during the Cold War era, unresolved issues surrounding the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia remained. Today's accord helps put the troubled history behind for good and ushers in a new era of partnership for the Czech Republic and Germany.
