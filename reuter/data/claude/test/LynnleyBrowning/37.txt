Russian Economic Crime Officials Investigate Head of Second Largest Aluminium Smelter

Investigators from Russia's internal economic crimes division raided the offices of Rusal, the country's second largest aluminium producer, today as part of a corruption probe into the company's CEO and founder Oleg Deripaska. Dozens of agents poured into Rusal's Moscow headquarters early this morning, confiscating documents and electronic records as part of the investigation. 

Deripaska, one of Russia's richest men with an estimated net worth of $4.4 billion, founded Rusal in 2000 and still owns a controlling stake in the company. Rusal operates 12 aluminium smelters across seven countries, producing 3.9 million tonnes of aluminium annually. The company's stock price plunged 15% on news of the raids.

The investigation into Deripaska focuses on allegations of large-scale embezzlement and abuse of funds at one of Rusal's newest smelters based in eastern Siberia. According to sources within the economic crime agency, over $230 million allocated to upgrade and expand the smelter mysteriously went missing during the construction process. The sources claim shell companies were used to mask the movement and ultimate disappearance of the funds.

Denis Nezgovorov, a senior economic crimes investigator leading today's raids, told reporters "we have reason to suspect large-scale financial violations and corruption have occurred. No one, regardless of their position or influence, is above the law." Deripaska has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the investigation is an attempt by political opponents to seize control of his company. A Rusal spokesperson said Deripaska and the company will fully cooperate with the authorities.

The raids and investigation into Deripaska may rattle investor confidence and reflect poorly on Russia's business climate as a whole. Corruption and weak governance are major concerns for foreign companies operating in Russia and those looking to invest in Russian markets. President Putin has pledged to crack down on economic crimes and improve transparency, though critics argue anti-corruption efforts often selectively and unfairly target political opponents. The findings from this high-profile investigation are sure to influence Russia's reputation on the global business stage for better or for worse.
