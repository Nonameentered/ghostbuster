LUKoil to Focus Upstream Business on Caspian and Gulf Amid Tough Economics at Home

Russia's second-largest oil producer LUKoil will focus its upstream business on the more profitable projects outside of Russia, such as the Caspian and Middle Eastern region, due to weak oil prices and tax regime changes at home, according to Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov. 

Alekperov said at an investor event that the company's future oil production growth will come from its international operations in Uzbekistan, Iraq, and Egypt. "Due to new tax legislation, the company's opportunities for growth in oil production have diminished substantially in Russia," Alekperov said. He cited the Russian oil tax overhaul in recent years that switched the tax burden from exports to production, making new Russian oil projects less profitable.

As a result, LUKoil will prioritize the funding of new projects abroad over new exploration and production in Russia. Alekperov said the company plans to invest more than $1 billion over the next two years in geological exploration in the Middle East and North Africa. He also said LUKoil is interested in new opportunities to regain access to projects in Iran and Venezuela if sanctions are lifted. 

The company's oil production in Russia declined by almost 2 percent last year due to natural depletion at mature West Siberian oilfields. However, the company's total oil output rose by 3 percent in 2019 thanks to the strong performance of international projects, including the major oil fields in the Caspian and Middle East. LUKoil's oil production in Iraq continues to grow, and the company expects a new oil field in the West Qurna-2 project to start operating this year, which should boost LUKoil's Iraqi production by 13 percent in 2020.

LUKoil has a dominant position in the Russian energy sector, but it is increasingly looking abroad due to limited opportunities for growth at home. Like other Russian oil companies, LUKoil has struggled with low oil prices in recent years that made expensive new oil projects less appealing. Changes in Russia's tax system have also made most new oil fields in Russia unprofitable to develop. As a result, oil companies are focusing on cutting costs and boosting profitability from existing operations. 

The challenges in the energy sector reflect the broader struggles of Russia's economy. The Russian economy has stagnated in the past few years under the weight of low oil prices, Western sanctions, and the weakening ruble. However, analysts expect Russia's economy to return to growth this year due to higher oil production in coordination with OPEC to support crude prices, as well as increased government spending on domestic infrastructure projects. For Russian oil companies like LUKoil though, growth opportunities will continue to be stronger in international markets outside of Russia.
