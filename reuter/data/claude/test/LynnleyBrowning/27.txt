Russia's Net Grain Harvest Likely to Fall Below Official Forecasts 

Russia's grain harvest this year is likely to be lower than the official forecasts published by the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, according to industry analysts. Dry weather across key growing regions has stunted crop growth and reduced yield potential. The ministry currently projects a harvest of 125 million metric tons of grains and legumes, but multiple analysts estimate the actual harvest could be at least 5-10% lower, between 115 to 120 million tons.

The majority of Russia's grain production comes from spring wheat, barley, and corn. Favorable weather during spring planting and early summer growing seasons had suggested Russia was on track for another year of strong yields. However, hot and dry weather began in July and has persisted across Southern Russia, the Volga Valley, and the Ural region. These regions account for nearly 70% of Russia's planted area for grains and legumes.

"The dryness has caused irreparable damage to yields already, and continued hot weather will only further reduce the harvest from current expectations," said Andrey Sizov Jr., managing director of SovEcon, an agriculture consultancy. His firm expects a wheat harvest between 72 to 74 million tons, down 10% from the current official forecast of 81 million tons. Barley yields have also suffered and forecast to be at least 15% lower.

The reduced harvest this year poses challenges for Russia's aim to cement its position as the world's largest wheat exporter. Lower domestic supply may prompt limitations on exports to protect Russian consumers. Russia has exported more than 40 million tons of wheat in recent years, but exports over 35 million tons could strain domestic supply, said Dmitry Rylko, director of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies.

Not all analysts are as pessimistic, however. Some still expect a harvest of over 120 million tons if late season rains provide relief and spart the worst effects of drought. Much will depend on the weather over the next month as harvest progresses northward. An upward revision seems unlikely given the advanced stage of most crops, but steadier weather could mitigate further loss.

Russia's farmers hope this year's drought does not presage another major crop crisis like those seen in 2010 and 2012. Subsequent strong harvests have replenished government grain reserves in recent years, so Russia is better positioned to handle a poorer harvest. But a sustained change to warmer and drier weather patterns in coming years would pose a severe threat to Russia's status as a dominant grain exporter. The 2020 grain harvest is a harbinger of challenges that may lie ahead.
