Russian Refineries Struggle to Improve Fuel Output, Despite Growing Demand and Export Market Pressures  

Russia’s oil refineries are facing significant challenges in boosting fuel production, despite strong demand growth domestically and increasing export market pressures. The country’s refineries have struggled with underinvestment for decades and are operating at just 77% of their capacity on average. Modernization efforts have been slow, even as the government aims to boost total oil refining volumes by 40% by 2030.   

The stagnating output comes at a time when demand for vehicle fuel and other oil products is rising steadily within Russia, driven by increasing automobile ownership and economic growth. Diesel and gasoline demand is up over 50% in the last decade, but refineries have not kept pace. The resulting supply shortfall has forced Russia to sharply increase fuel imports in recent years, even as it exports over 5 million barrels of crude oil per day. 

Export markets are also tightening for Russian refineries. New marine fuel regulations from the International Maritime Organization are set to take effect in 2020, requiring most ships to reduce sulfur emissions by over 80%. The so-called IMO 2020 rules threaten to cut into Russia’s exports of high-sulfur fuel oil, long a major export product. Refiners need to invest in conversion units known as hydrocrackers and hydrotreaters to remove sulfur and produce new low-sulfur fuels, but many lack the funds to do so.

‘The refining sector’s underinvestment over many years has left Russia’s export-oriented refineries with old technology unable to meet new environmental standards,’ said Ksenia Sorokina, an analyst with Thomson Reuters. ‘Refiners will struggle to find export markets for their unwanted high-sulfur fuel oil, putting strong downward pressure on margins.’

The Russian government recently took steps to address the refining sector’s challenges, approving tax incentives and an $8 billion modernization program. But industry experts argue that substantially more investment and ambitious upgrades are needed. Private oil companies are also looking to build new, state-of-the-art refineries that could help close the supply gap, though financing such mega-projects remains difficult.
