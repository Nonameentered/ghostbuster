Gazprom Delays Plan to Issue More Shares for Foreigners, Demands Government Action on Debts and Taxes  

Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced today that it is delaying plans to expand its offering of shares to foreign investors, citing concerns over debts owed to the company by Russian regional governments and a tax dispute with the federal government.

Gazprom had previously indicated it would issue up to an additional 25% of shares to international investors this year to raise capital and fund new gas field developments. However, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement that "conditions are not right at the present time for us to move ahead." He listed two major issues that need to be resolved first.

According to Miller, regional government entities in Russia owe Gazprom over $2.5 billion in unpaid bills for gas supplies and infrastructure costs. Miller argued that Gazprom cannot effectively operate and budget when such large parts of its revenue go uncollected for long periods. He demanded that the Russian government take action to force regional governments to pay their debts or risk supply cutoffs.

Secondly, Gazprom is disputing a $3.8 billion tax bill from Russia's Federal Tax Service regarding profits from Gazprom's natural gas exports in 2018. Miller claims the tax agency has incorrectly calculated export sales and profit figures, resulting in an excessively large tax demand. Gazprom has filed a legal appeal but Miller insists the issue must be resolved before the company can consider a new share issue.

The delay of the share issue is a setback for both Gazprom and the Russian government, which owns a controlling stake in the company.international investors had shown strong interest, according to equity analysts in Moscow. The additional capital from share sales was expected to fund new gas field exploration and infrastructure upgrades. Without this investment, Gazprom may struggle to maintain export volumes to Europe in the coming years. The Russian government also loses out as higher Gazprom share prices and dividends are an important source of budget revenue.

Continued tension with Ukraine also clouds the outlook for Gazprom. Gazprom's natural gas transit contract with Ukraine expires in December, and difficult talks on a contract renewal continue. In the past, disputes between Russia and Ukraine have led to cuts in gas supplies to Europe during winter. Such supply disruptions could further deter foreign investment in Gazprom at a time when the company desperately needs capital to finance its long-term growth.
