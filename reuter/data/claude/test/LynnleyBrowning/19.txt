Russian Oil Producers Battle for Control of Crude Oil Exports, Leaving Traders in Doubt   

Russia's two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, are locked in a fierce battle for control over crude oil export terminals, creating uncertainty for traders and threatening Russia's position as the world's top oil exporter.

Rosneft, majority owned by the Russian government, currently controls about 70 percent of Russia's crude oil exports. It operates oil export terminals in the Baltic and Black Seas that ship oil to Europe and beyond. Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of state-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom,  is seeking to gain its own dedicated oil export terminals to reduce its reliance on Rosneft. 

Gazprom Neft wants to take over two small oil terminals on the Baltic Sea that currently handle less than 10 percent of Russia's oil exports. Rosneft opposes the move, arguing that the terminals should continue to be used by multiple producers. The dispute has stalled approval of the takeover by Russian regulators.

The battle for the export terminals underscores the power of Rosneft over Russia's vital energy sector. Rosneft's CEO Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has built the company into a global oil powerhouse in recent years through high-profile acquisitions at home and abroad. Critics argue that Rosneft's dominance stifles competition and innovation in Russia's oil patch.

Gazprom Neft has grown rapidly through its own string of acquisitions, but until now has relied on Rosneft's terminals to export its oil, paying substantial transit fees for their use. Controlling its own terminals would allow Gazprom Neft to reduce costs and gain greater control over its oil exports.

The uncertainty caused by the dispute is worrying traders who buy and sell Russian oil. About 70 percent of Russian crude exports flow through the Baltic and Black Sea ports, and a prolonged power struggle could potentially disrupt those supplies.
