Norilsk Nickel plant vows to maintain output amidst financial crisis

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel and palladium producer, says it has no plans to reduce its production levels amid plummeting commodity prices and an economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The company, which operates mines and smelters in Russia's Arctic industrial city of Norilsk, expects stable output from its operations this year. 

Nickel and palladium prices have dropped more than 25% since January due to a collapse in demand from downstream sectors like stainless steel and automotive. The crisis has already forced several mining companies to scale back operations or shut down higher-cost mines. However, Norilsk Nickel says its low-cost production and integrated operations will allow it to keep mines open even as prices head lower.

“We have a very low cost of production at our core operations in Russia and stable financial position to weather this perfect economic storm,” said Elena Bezdenezhnykh, Vice President for Strategic Communications at Norilsk Nickel. “Temporary price fluctuations will not affect our production plans or long-term strategy.”

The company’s Kola and Norilsk sites in Russia’s far north have some of the largest deposits of nickel, copper and precious metals in the world. Norilsk Nickel’s all-in production costs are estimated to be among the lowest in the global mining industry, providing a buffer during periods of low prices. The firm also operates its own energy, transport and port infrastructure, reducing its dependence on external suppliers.

However, the crisis is putting pressure on Norilsk Nickel’s balance sheet. The company’s net profit dropped by 14% in the first quarter as revenue declined due to lower metal prices. Its shares have fallen over 20% since January, though they recovered some of those losses on news the company would maintain output. 

Norilsk Nickel’s resilience in the face of the crisis stands in contrast with mining companies across Canada, Australia, South Africa, and elsewhere that have announced massive production cuts, suspended dividends and laid off thousands of workers. Some analysts say the company’s position is unique, though, due to its vast mineral resources, integrated supply chain and lower costs of operating in Russia.

“Norilsk Nickel has a competitive advantage that is quite enviable in the current climate,” said VTB Capital mining analyst Maxim Romanov. “While we expect the crisis to significantly impact the global mining industry, Norilsk Nickel seems well placed to emerge on the other side with its operations intact.”

The company acknowledges global metals demand may take time to recover but views this period of low prices as temporary. Norilsk Nickel plans to continue advancing new investment projects to expand production capacity for when the market turns, cementing its position as a leading supplier of minerals critical for the green economy transition. The crisis has demonstrated the resilience of our operations, according to Bezdenezhnykh, and the firm will stick to its long-term strategy.
