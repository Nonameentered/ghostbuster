Russia's Agriculture Minister Urges Efficiency as Harvest Predicted to Barely Top Last Year's Poor Level 

Russia's agriculture minister urged farmers and food producers to continue increasing efficiency and modernizing operations as the ministry predicted this year's grain harvest would barely top last year's poor level.

In a video conference with regional governors and senior agricultural officials, Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said the grain harvest could reach 120 million to 123 million metric tons this year, up from last year's harvest of 119.5 million tons, which was one of the lowest in recent years. 

"The forecasts are modest, so we need to take advantage of every opportunity to increase yields," Patrushev said. He urged farmers to use more high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and modern technology to boost the harvest. Russia relies heavily on grain exports and a bigger harvest could help compensate for weaker global prices.

 Weather problems, including a colder spring, more rain, and less sunshine in some areas at the start of the growing season had slowed crop development and reduced yield forecasts, Patrushev said. He said the ministry expects the buckwheat harvest to fall this year and the sugar beet crop to remain at last year's level of around 51 million tons.

The modest grain harvest forecast highlights the challenges facing Russian agriculture due to climate change, as crops face more volatile weather. It also shows Russia must raise agricultural productivity to meet the government's goal of making Russia the world's biggest food exporter. 

Grain exports are a major source of income for Russian farmers, who have borrowed heavily in recent years to modernize equipment and boost output. Weaker exports could undermine plans by large agricultural companies to continue spending on new tractors, harvesters, and other technology.

President Vladimir Putin urged the government last year to achieve national food security and boost exports. But yields for grains, sugar beets, and other crops in 2019 fell from already low levels, showing how dependent Russia remains on weather conditions.

Agriculture accounts for about 4% of the Russian economy overall but a much larger share in some rural regions. Putin wants new investment and technology to raise output and make the sector an economic engine.

But poor infrastructure, lack of financing, and economic sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries have all hampered the sector's development. Foreign investment in Russian agriculture has declined in recent years due to sanctions, the weak ruble, and a shortage of high-quality investment projects.

Patrushev told the governors to take additional measures to support farmers, including more subsidies, loans, tax breaks, and simplified administration. He promised the federal government would also provide more funds to aid the sector. But without major new foreign and private sector investment, Russia's goal of becoming a dominant food superpower seems likely to take many years. Overall, the modest harvest estimates show that reaching that goal requires further policy steps and removal of many existing roadblocks, analysts said.
