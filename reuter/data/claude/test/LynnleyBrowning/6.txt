Analysts and Traders Struggle to Pin Down Size of Russia's Grain Harvest with Widely Differing Estimates 

Russia's grain harvest this year remains shrouded in uncertainty with analysts and traders offering widely varying estimates of the crop size. The USDA forecast Russia's wheat harvest at 72 million tonnes, down from last year's record 85 million tonnes. However, some analysts say the crop could be as low as 65 million tonnes due to dry weather in parts of European Russia, while other estimates range up to 78 million tonnes. 

The lack of clarity on the harvest size in Russia, one of the world's largest grain exporters, is creating volatility in global grain markets. Wheat futures have seesawed in recent weeks on alternating reports of crop damage and beneficial rains. Traders say the uncertainty is making it difficult to price Russian grain for export and sign contracts with buyers. Several major importers of Russian wheat including Egypt, Turkey and Bangladesh are holding off on purchases until there is more consensus on the harvest size and quality.

A lower grain harvest in Russia could drive up global wheat prices if exports drop substantially from last year's record volumes. But much will depend on how much grain Russia retains for domestic use versus export. Russia has a stated goal to increase grain exports and boost its share of global wheat trade. However, government officials may be wary of exporting too much during a lower harvest year in order to ensure adequate domestic supplies. 

Private analysts attribute the wide range in harvest estimates to greater uncertainty introduced by Russia's ban on commercial satellite images of agricultural land. The government blacked out satellite data that had previously been used by analysts to monitor crop conditions and estimate yields. Analysts now rely more on ground observations and measurements which can vary in quality and coverage across Russia's vast crop areas.

Many in the industry call on the Russian government to release its own harvest estimates to help clarify the situation. But the government has yet to issue an official forecast for this year's grain harvest, leaving the market guessing. With harvest well underway in southern regions, analysts hope that a clearer picture will emerge soon of this year's Russian grain crop - for better or for worse. Overall, uncertainty and volatility are likely to prevail in global grain markets until more definitive estimates of Russia's closely-watched harvest come in.
