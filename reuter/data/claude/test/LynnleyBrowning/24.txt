Russia's Norilsk Nickel to Cut 10,000 Workers in Effort to Improve Profitability  

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and nickel and a major producer of platinum and cobalt, announced today that it will cut up to 10,000 workers, or about 15 percent of its total workforce, in an effort to reduce costs and boost profitability. The cuts come as Norilsk Nickel struggles with low metal prices and rising costs. The company employs some 65,000 people, mainly in its operations in Russia's Arctic.

"The conditions of the global commodities market require decisive action from us to maintain our financial stability," said Vladimir Potanin, president of Norilsk Nickel. "Reducing our workforce is a difficult but necessary step to make the company more efficient and competitive."
The cuts are the largest in scale since the company was privatized in the 1990s. Norilsk Nickel plans to reduce staff through a combination of layoffs, cutting contractor services, and offering early retirement. The bulk of the job cuts, about 8,500 roles, will be in Norilsk Nickel's mining operations, with the rest coming from administrative and support functions. The reductions are expected to save the company about $500 million per year in costs.

Norilsk Nickel has faced significant financial pressure in recent years. Prices for nickel, palladium, and platinum have dropped substantially from their 2011 peaks. Nickel and palladium prices are down more than 50 percent from their highs, cutting into Norilsk Nickel's revenue. At the same time, costs have been rising in Russia due to inflation and increasing regulatory burdens. The job cuts come after Norilsk Nickel trimmed capital expenditures and took on additional debt to shore up its balance sheet.

The announcement of major layoffs elicited a negative reaction from labor groups and government officials in Russia. Norilsk Nickel's operations are a major source of employment in the remote northern areas where it operates. The company acknowledged the cuts would have a "serious impact" on local communities, and pledged to provide financial assistance and job placement help for laid-off workers. The company is also negotiating with regional governments and labor officials to minimize the effects. 

Norilsk Nickel expects to complete most of the restructuring by the end of 2017. Share prices of the company rose 3 percent on the announcement as investors anticipated improved profitability from a leaner, more efficient Norilsk Nickel. The cuts, while difficult, are seen by most industry analysts as necessary to ensure the long-term viability and competitiveness of one of Russia's industrial champions.
