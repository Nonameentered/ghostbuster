Russia Missed Its Chance in Caspian Oil, But Signs Giant Deals with Iraq in Ambition for Mideast Gulf Expansion 

Russia has long sought to expand its influence in the Middle East to gain more control over the region’s massive oil and gas reserves. Its efforts in the Caspian Sea have stalled in recent years due to competing interests from surrounding countries. Now, Russia is turning its ambitions south to Iraq with two new landmark energy deals.

On Monday, Russian oil giant Rosneft signed a deal with Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government to develop five oil blocks that could produce over 400,000 barrels per day. The agreement would allow Rosneft to export oil from Iraqi Kurdistan to international markets. Separately, Russian energy company Gazprom Neft signed a deal to develop two oil fields in southern Iraq with estimated reserves of over 1 billion barrels. 

The deals highlight Russia’s aim to boost its presence in the Middle East Gulf region following setbacks in the Caspian Sea and years of Western sanctions targeting Moscow’s energy sector. “Russia wants to show that it is still a powerful player on the global energy market despite the sanctions,” said Alexei Kalachev, an analyst with Moscow-based Finam Holdings. “Cooperation with Iraq, especially with its Kurdish north, is very promising.”

Russia has long had ambitions to exert control over Caspian Sea energy resources, but its efforts have been hampered by the opposing interests of surrounding countries like Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkmenistan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these nations gained independence and sought to develop their own offshore oil and gas deposits in cooperation with Western oil companies. 

Moscow had hoped to build gas pipelines across the Caspian to supply markets in Europe and elsewhere. But disputes over how to legally define and divide the Caspian Sea have stalled some projects. Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 further strained its relations with European countries and made them wary of becoming too dependent on Russian energy exports. 

The deals in Iraq mark a pivot in Russia’s strategy toward the Middle East Gulf region which holds 48% of the world’s oil reserves. Inking major agreements with resource-rich Iraq allows Russia to gain a stronghold in the region beyond its traditional ally Syria. The agreements also solidify Moscow’s relationship with Iraqi Kurds, whose increasing autonomy has angered regional power Turkey.

Some analysts warn, however, that Russia’s move into Iraq could exacerbate political and ethnic tensions in the war-torn country. There are also concerns about the legality of oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan without consent from Iraq’s central government. But Moscow sees an opening in Iraq’s fragile political situation and its need for foreign investment and expertise to revive its struggling oil sector. With its giant deals this week, Russia has launched a major effort to satisfy its unrealized oil ambitions and expand its influence in the Middle East.
