Russia Unlikely to Go on Grain Importing Spree Despite Lower Stocks, Say Industry Sources  

Russia's grain stocks are lower than usual heading into winter, but the world's top wheat exporter is unlikely to embark on a major importing campaign, industry sources said.  

Russia's total grain stocks in late October were 23.5 million tonnes, down 19% from a year ago and the lowest for the time of year since 2014, according to agriculture consultancy IKAR. However, stocks are still adequate and Russia should be able to avoid large-scale grain imports due to expected 2019 harvest of around 120 million tonnes, the sources said.  

"Our grain stocks are not critically low and we have retained export potential, so there is no need for panic buying on international markets," said Eduard Zernin, head of the Grain Producers Union. Russia's exports so far this season are down because of competition from other Black Sea origins, but sales are expected to pick up early next year, he added.

Some traders have been speculating Russia may need to import several million tonnes of grain to address the deficit, but analysts have been downplaying such talk. "The market is well-supplied, and what we're seeing now is normal seasonal stock drawdown," said Andrey Sizov, managing director at SovEcon. "With an average harvest next year, Russia will rebuild its stocks and remain a net grain exporter."

Russia's grain stocks often decline leading into the winter because exports continue while country elevators and ports take time to load vessels, Sizov added. Low stocks at this time of year do not necessarily mean a supply shortage. Another reason for lower stocks is that Russia's grain exports so far this season reached 22 million tonnes between July and October, up 6% on year. Big wheat shipments in particular during those summer months depleted stocks.   

Overall, Russia is on track to export at least 35 million tonnes of wheat in the 2018-19 season, according to various analyst estimates. The country is also expected to remain the world's top wheat exporter in the coming years, although competition for sales is set to grow, especially from Ukraine. Given its massive production and export capacity, as well as feed grain demand limitations, Russia will seek to clear at least 30-40% of its wheat and barley stocks each season through exports, IKAR said.

In summary, while Russian grain stocks are lower than usual as 2018 comes to an end, expert industry sources do not foresee a scenario wherein Russia will need to embark on major grain imports. The country should continue exporting wheat and other grains at a steady pace thanks to another sizable harvest expected in 2019. Barring any unforeseen weather calamities, Russia aims to retain its status as the dominant wheat supplier to the international market.
