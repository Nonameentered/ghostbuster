Western Oil Joint Ventures in Russia Struggle Due to Taxes and Unknown Policies of Energy Minister

Western oil companies that have joint ventures with Russian state-owned firms are facing significant headwinds due to high taxes on oil extraction and uncertainty around the policies of Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak. Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, and BP all have stakes in major oil and gas projects in Russia but have seen profits and growth hampered by the Russian government's policies.

The Sakhalin-1 project in Russia's Far East, in which ExxonMobil holds a 30% stake, has paid up to $7.5 billion in taxes over the past decade, according to analysts. The project contributed $4 billion in tax revenues alone between 2016 to 2018. While the payments have been a boon for the Russian government, they have limited the profits and appetite for further investment by the foreign operators. ExxonMobil and its partners have cut their investments in Sakhalin-1 by two-thirds in recent years due to the tax burden.

The situation is similar for Shell and BP, which respectively hold 27.5% and 19.75% in Russia's flagship Sakhalin-2 LNG export project. The project has funneled over $50 billion to the Russian government since operations began in 2009 but has faced repeated calls for renegotiating the production-sharing agreement to increase tax receipts. The uncertainty around future tax changes has discouraged Shell and BP from investing in new expansion projects, threatening Russia's future as a major LNG exporter. 

The policies of Energy Minister Novak, who oversees Russia's entire oil and gas sector, have added to the Western companiesâ€™ troubles. Novak's ministry has pushed foreign operators to partner with sanctioned Russian energy companies like Rosneft, refused to extend some key licenses, and made statements against approving new LNG export projects. The overall perception is that the ministry favors domestic companies at the expense of foreign investors.
