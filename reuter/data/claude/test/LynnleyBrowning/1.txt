Russia's Oil Majors Battle for Control of Lucrative Oil Export Market 

Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, are embroiled in a power struggle over control of the country's lucrative oil export infrastructure. At stake is billions of dollars in annual revenue and influence over global energy markets.

Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, currently accounts for about 40% of Russia's crude oil production and dominates oil exports from the country. Rosneft relies heavily on the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast, through which it ships oil to international markets.

Lukoil, headed by Vagit Alekperov, has grown frustrated with paying large transit fees to Rosneft to use the Novorossiysk port. It now wants to build its own dedicated oil terminal at the port of Taman on the Azov Sea, which would allow it to increase exports while avoiding Rosneft's fees.

Rosneft sees Lukoil's move as a direct threat to its export power and profits. It has persuaded the Russian government to stall approval of Lukoil's Taman project through red tape and bureaucracy. Rosneft has also hinted it may file a lawsuit to block Lukoil's terminal on environmental grounds.

The clash between the two oil titans is about much more than a single port, according to industry analysts. "This conflict is fundamentally about which company will control Russia's global oil flows and the money and power that come with that control," said Vitaly Yermakov of IHS Markit in Moscow.

With Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and others increasing oil production, access to export infrastructure and global markets has become pivotal for Russian companies.  "As the battle for global market share intensifies, oil export routes are becoming increasingly strategic for Russia's oil majors," said Dmitry Konyshev of Renaissance Capital. 

Rosneft's dominance of Russia's oil exports has given it first-mover advantage in key markets like China, where it has locked in long-term supply contracts. By challenging Rosneft's control of Novorossiysk, Lukoil aims to expand its own access to customers worldwide, especially in the fast-growing Asian market.

The spat highlights the political and economic power wielded by Sechin and Rosneft.  As head of what is arguably Russia's most important company, Sechin's influence over both domestic and foreign policy is unparalleled.  His close personal ties to Putin have helped cement Rosneft's control of the energy sector and access to state funds and resources.  

Lukoil lacks the same political clout and ambitions of Rosneft and Sechin. But it sees a chance to gain ground through its oil terminal project - if only it can overcome Sechin's determination to block it. The battle for control of Russia's oil routes is just getting started.
