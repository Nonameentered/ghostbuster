Russian nickel producer Norilsk Nickel struggles to climb out of debt while facing potential labor unrest 

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium, is grappling with high debt levels and labor issues that are complicating its efforts to boost efficiency and profitability.

The Russian mining giant has launched a major restructuring and cost-cutting program in recent years to pay down debt and improve returns for investors. However, the company's net debt of $10 billion as of late last year still represents a heavy burden, especially given the volatility of nickel and other commodity prices.

Norilsk Nickel aims to reduce net debt to $6 billion by the end of 2020 through increased operational efficiencies, reducing capital expenditures, and selling non-core assets. Achieving that target has become more difficult due to lower nickel prices in 2019 and rising tensions with employees.

A slowdown in stainless steel production has weakened demand for nickel, contributing to an 18% drop in prices last year. Palladium prices also declined in the second half of 2019 due to a slowdown in the automobile sector, which uses the metal in catalytic converters. The price drops have squeezed Norilsk Nickel's profit margins and cash flow.

At the same time, Norilsk Nickel faced several labor protests and strikes last year over pay, working conditions, and proposed changes to employment contracts. The most high-profile actions took place at the companyâ€™s Polar Division in northern Russia, which produces about 90% of total nickel and platinum group metals.

Thousands of workers rallied for higher wages and in opposition to moving to a less attractive employment contract. Norilsk Nickel raised salaries to defuse tensions but the new contract, offering less job security, remains a point of contention.
