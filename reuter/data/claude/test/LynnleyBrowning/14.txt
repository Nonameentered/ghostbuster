Foreign Investment Slow to Come to Russia's Gold Reserves 

Russia has some of the largest gold reserves in the world, yet the country has struggled to attract foreign investment into mining its substantial untapped gold deposits. Russia currently has about $470 billion in gold reserves, much of it located in remote regions of Siberia and the Far East. However, weak infrastructure, a complex permitting process, and trade sanctions have made it difficult for international mining companies to operate in Russia.

Canadian mining firm Kinross Gold Corp is one of the few major foreign companies actively mining gold in Russia. Kinross operates the Kupol gold mine in far eastern Russia, which produced over 7 tons of gold in 2018. However, Kinross has faced numerous logistical challenges operating the remote mine, including building an airfield and vaporizing subzero temperatures. The company has sought to expand operations in the region but has faced delays in the permitting and approval process.  

Several other foreign gold mining joint ventures have failed or stalled in recent years. Highland Gold Mining Ltd., a UK-listed company, pulled out of a joint venture with Russian partners to develop the Unkurtash gold deposit in Siberia, citing bureaucratic obstacles. Chinese mining company China National Gold Group Corporation announced a deal with Russian partners in 2017 to jointly develop the Klyuchevskoye gold deposit, also in Siberia, but the agreement has shown little progress. Trade sanctions imposed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014 have also made some foreign investors wary of doing business in the country.

Not all foreign investment in Russia's gold mining sector has soured, however. Indian mining conglomerate Vedanta Resources established the Berezitovy gold mine in Siberia with Russian partners in 2017. The mine is ramping up and produced over 3 tons of gold in 2018. Peter Hambro Mining, a UK-based company, also continues to jointly operate the Pioneer gold deposit in Russia with local partners.
