Russian Refiners Struggle to Find Funds for Costly Plant Upgrades

Russia’s oil refiners are facing significant challenges in securing financing to upgrade aging facilities and comply with new environmental regulations. The refining sector has struggled in recent years due to low profit margins, competition from larger refineries in Asia and the Middle East, and declining demand for fuel oil. 

The total bill for refinery upgrades to meet new emission standards and improve efficiency is estimated at over $50 billion over the next decade. However, attracting investment has been difficult due to geopolitical tensions, economic stagnation in Russia, and the sector’s lack of profitability. Refiners are unable to fund the costs of upgrades from current cash flow and profits alone.

Sector analysts worry that without sizeable investments the competitiveness of Russia’s refining industry will further deteriorate over time. The average age of Russian refineries is over 50 years, and outdated technology means facilities operate at only around 70% of maximum capacity. New environmental regulations will also force closures of the oldest and least efficient refineries if they are unable to make upgrades.

Refiners have lobbied the Russian government for tax breaks, preferential loans, and other incentives to help close the funding gap, but with limited success so far. The government faces budget constraints of its own and has many economic priorities competing for resources. President Vladimir Putin has called on the private sector to invest in domestic refining capacity, but attracting foreign partners and capital has proven difficult.

Some smaller refiners are pursuing initial public offerings to raise funds for upgrades, with mixed results. The Volga Oil Refinery based in Saratov managed to raise $100 million in an IPO in late 2018, but two other refiners canceled their IPO plans this year due to a lack of investor interest. Partnerships with Russian state-owned oil giants like Rosneft and Gazprom Neft are also an option, but may mean the smaller refiners lose control of their operations.
