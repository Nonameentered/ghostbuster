Russian Oil Titans Vie for Control of Rosneft, Last Major Energy Firm Up for Privatization  

Two of Russia's largest oil and gas companies are competing to acquire a majority stake in Rosneft, the country's largest oil producer, in what would be the biggest privatization in Russia since the 1990s.

Rosneft, which is controlled by the Russian government, announced plans earlier this year to sell up to 19.5 percent of its shares. Rosneft accounted for about 35 percent of Russia's total oil production last year and has vast oil fields, refineries, and gas stations across Russia and Europe. Analysts estimate a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft could be worth between $10 billion to $15 billion.

On one side of the bidding is Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of state-run Gazprom, Russia's largest company. Gazprom Neft has lagged behind Rosneft and Lukoil in oil production growth in recent years. Acquiring a major stake in Rosneft would boost Gazprom Neft's oil resources and help it catch up to competitors.

The other bidder is Surgutneftegaz, a privately held company based in Western Siberia that is Russia's third largest oil producer. Surgutneftegaz is a notoriously secretive company and rarely pursues large deals, preferring to expand organically. Winning a stake in Rosneft would transform Surgutneftegaz into a much larger player in the global energy market.

The Rosneft deal has been closely scrutinized because Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, serves as Rosneft's chief executive. Mr. Sechin took over as CEO of Rosneft in 2012 after serving as deputy prime minister in Mr. Putin's cabinet. Mr. Sechin has turned Rosneft into a major global oil company through acquisitions, but has also faced criticism for opacity and close ties to the Kremlin.

Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz submitted initial bids last week, according to Russian media reports. Rosneft's board will review the proposals in the coming weeks. The Russian government will ultimately decide the winner based on the bids and how each company plans to finance the deal. The privatization of Rosneft is a signature part of Mr. Putin's plan to raise capital for the Russian budget amid low oil prices and Western sanctions.   

The sale of Rosneft shares is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Whoever emerges victorious will gain considerable influence over a company that essentially fuels the Russian economy and global energy markets. The loser will simply have to continue competing against a much larger rival in the quest for Russia's massive oil wealth.
