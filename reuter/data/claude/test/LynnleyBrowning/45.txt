Norilsk: the polluted Arctic city that time forgot 

In the frozen heart of Siberia sits the gritty industrial city of Norilsk, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Located above the Arctic Circle, Norilsk is a bleak, isolated place that remains frozen for up to 300 days a year. Yet for the past 80 years, this unlikely spot on the Taymyr Peninsula has been the center of Russia's nickel and palladium mining operations.

The harsh Siberian winters mean Norilsk remains cut off from the rest of Russia for much of the year. The only way in and out during colder months is by air or by a single road that is impassable for parts of the winter. This geographic isolation combined with its strategic importance as a metals producer for the Soviet war machine led to Norilsk becoming a secret "closed city" during World War II and remaining that way until the 1990s.

Norilsk's mines and smelters have wreaked havoc on the environment. The city's nickel plant alone produces two million tons of sulfur dioxide per year, more than the entire country of Norway. The pollution has turned the city into one of the most contaminated places on the planet and caused widespread health issues among residents. Life expectancy in some areas of Norilsk is 10 years below the Russian average due to high rates of respiratory disease and cancer.

The city's 275,000 inhabitants live among crumbling Soviet-era buildings and endure almost constant darkness for nearly two months of the year followed by 24 hours of sunlight in the summer. Despite the challenging living conditions, jobs in the city's mines and smelters are highly coveted due to salaries that far outpace the Russian average.

Norilsk's industries are powered in part by neighboring rivers that were diverted in the 1930s to fuel the city's expansion under Stalin's first five-year plan. The rivers now run dry before reaching the Arctic Ocean, and the nearby land has become lifeless and barren.

Environmental groups have spotlighted Norilsk as an ecological disaster zone and criticized pollution controls as inadequate. City officials have pledged to reduce emissions and make Norilsk's industries less toxic but complete rehabilitation remains far off and likely unachievable. For now, Norilsk stands as a grim relic of the Soviet era and a reminder of the human cost
