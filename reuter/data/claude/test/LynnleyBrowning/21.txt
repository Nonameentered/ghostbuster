Battle for Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry Puts Western Firms at Risk of Losing Lucrative Oil Sector Deals  

A power struggle within the Russian government over control of the Ministry of Energy has Western oil companies worried they could lose billions of dollars of deals in the country's lucrative oil patch. The shakeup comes as Russia is seeking to reassert state control over its energy sector and President Vladimir Putin is maneuvering to retain power beyond the end of his current term in 2024.

For the last decade, the Ministry of Energy has pursued a policy of attracting Western firms and their capital and technology to help develop challenging offshore and shale oil reserves. Deals with companies like ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and BP have been worth tens of billions of dollars. However, a faction within the Kremlin now wants to recentralize control over energy under Russian state-owned companies like Rosneft and Gazprom.  

Four candidates are vying to replace the outgoing Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, who has overseen auctions of oil and gas rights and negotiated deals with Western majors during his eight-year tenure. Two of the candidates, executives at Rosneft and pipeline monopoly Transneft, would likely unwind Novak’s policies and put existing deals and future partnerships with Western companies at risk. The two other candidates, Russian government officials, would likely maintain the status quo.

The decision of who will take over the Ministry of Energy is ultimately up to President Putin. His calculation will weigh the economic benefits of Western investment and technology against a desire to maximize control over Russia's oil and gas wealth. “There is a battle for the soul of Russian energy policy right now in the Kremlin,” said Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister. “The choice of the new minister will signal which direction Russia is heading.”

For ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and other Western firms, the stakes are high. ExxonMobil and Rosneft, for example, have invested billions in the offshore reserves in the Russian Arctic and onshore oil in Siberia. Losing access could destroy the economic logic of those projects. The uncertainty has already caused some Western firms to slow additional investment in Russia as they wait to see who will emerge atop the Ministry of Energy.  

The struggle over the future direction of Russia's oil sector also mirrors a wider debate over the future of Russia's economy. Requirements for cooperation or even losing lucrative deals to partners in China or India could threaten Russia's economic connectivity to the West. But much depends on what choice Vladimir Putin makes for who will run Russia’s Ministry of Energy. His selection will have consequences that reverberate across the global oil industry and beyond.
