Norilsk Nickel's Poor Financial Results May Delay Plans to Issue Corporate Paper for Trading Overseas: Analysts  

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium, reported disappointing full-year financial results for 2019 last week that are likely to delay the company's plans to issue corporate paper for trading on international capital markets. According to analysts, the results missed expectations and revealed continuing cost pressures that raise questions about Norilsk Nickel's readiness to take on new debt.

The company's revenue for 2019 totaled $12.7 billion, up 3% from 2018 but below the $13.2 billion average forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters. Net profit fell 15% year over year to $2.1 billion. The results were weighed down by a 10% jump in cash costs as the company had to mine lower-grade ores. The company's flagship asset, the Norilsk division in Siberia, delivered profit of just $1.3 billion, down 26% from 2018.  

Norilsk Nickel has outlined ambitious investment plans over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure, modernize smelters, and support new mining projects. The total investment program is valued at up to $8 billion through 2023, with roughly half intended to be financed through borrowing. The company has said it aims to establish a presence in international debt capital markets to diversify its funding. However, the latest financial results likely mean any bond issues will be delayed until Norilsk Nickel can demonstrate its operations are on a more stable footing, according to rating agency Fitch.

The higher costs in 2019 partly reflected the company's ongoing issues with permafrost thaw at its Arctic operations, which have caused ground instability and made it harder to access ores. Severe weather events also disrupted mining and transport activities. Rising wages, materials, and energy costs added more pressure. Although some inflationary pressures will ease in 2020, Fitch expects Norilsk Nickel's costs to remain high as it carries out critical maintenance and invests in efforts to mitigate environmental risks.  

Operating a massive mining and metallurgical complex in the harsh conditions of the Russian Arctic has always been challenging, but climate change is exacerbating Norilsk Nickel's problems. Thawing permafrost has caused infrastructure damage, while extreme weather events have been more frequent and intense. Environmental groups have criticized the company for pollution from its smelters and power plants. Tougher regulations may require substantial environmental investments in the coming decades.

While Norilsk Nickel's results were lackluster and revealed significant headwinds, analysts say the company will continue generating solid cash flow from operations, given the quality of its assets and a rebound in commodity prices. However, until costs are tamed and environmental issues addressed, any push into international debt markets may face a cool reception, limiting the company's funding options for its ambitious investment program. Overall, more work is needed to stabilize Norilsk Nickel's operations and achieve meaningful growth again.
