Russia to Become Major Buyer of Iraqi Oil, Say Officials

Russia is poised to become one of the largest buyers of Iraqi oil in a move that signals strengthening political and economic ties between Moscow and Baghdad. According to Iraqi government officials, Russia will soon account for up to 15 percent of Iraq's total oil exports, equivalent to 200,000 barrels per day. The increased oil deliveries to Russia will expand Iraq's market reach and lessen its dependence on buyers in Asia and the West.

New deals stipulate that Russia's state-controlled oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil will purchase Iraqi oil for export to refineries in Russia as well as for re-export to Europe and other world markets. The head of Iraq's state oil marketer SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said the new agreement "will strengthen cooperation relations between Iraq and Russia in the field of energy and oil." Under the previous Iraqi government, oil exports to Russia were negligible due to political strains between Baghdad and Moscow. The new export deals signal a warming of relations following the election of a new Iraqi prime minister last year. 

The oil deliveries to Russia are part of Iraq's plan to significantly increase total oil production in the coming years. With huge untapped oil reserves and new investments coming into its oil industry, Iraq hopes to lift oil exports to over 8 million barrels per day by 2022, which would cement its status as the world's fastest growing oil producer. By selling to energy-hungry Russia, Iraq could find an eager long-term customer for its oil as other export markets experience oversupply or slowing demand. 

For Russia, increased cooperation with Iraq on oil could help Moscow expand influence in the Middle East, said Lukoil's Vice President Leonid Fedun. "By working in Iraq, we show that Lukoil is a global company, not just focused on the U.S. sanctions," Fedun said. Lukoil, Russia's second largest oil producer, operates major oil fields in southern Iraq, including the enormous West Qurna-2. boosting investment in Iraq oil fields and securing supply deals helps ensure Russia's status as a powerbroker in global oil markets.  

The new oil deals were in part enabled by the U.S. lifting an export ban on Iraqi Kurdistan oil last year, which allowed major producers like Rosneft to sign contracts with Kurdistan Regional Government for oil exploration and exports. The complex geopolitical developments underscore how the energy landscape is changing in the Middle East as outside powers like Russia exert growing influence over oil-producing nations. How the deepening Russia-Iraq relationship affects other key players like OPEC will be important to monitor in the coming years.
