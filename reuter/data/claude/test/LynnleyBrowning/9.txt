LUKoil Claims to be World's Largest Oil Firm, But Analysts Disagree

Russia's LUKoil, the world's largest non-state energy company by production volume, has declared itself the largest privately-owned oil firm in the world. The company claimed it surpassed ExxonMobil in terms of proven oil and gas reserves and annual hydrocarbon production in its financial results released today. However, independent analysts cast doubt on LUKoil's assertions and point out some key metrics where the Russian oil giant still lags behind its international peers. 

According to LUKoil's 2018 results, the company has proven oil reserves of 15.15 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 18 trillion cubic meters. The company produced 2.24 million barrels of oil equivalent per day last year, an increase of 2.5% from 2017. The firm credits new field developments in Russia's West Siberian Basin as well as Permian Basin in the United States for the production growth.

"Our proven reserves growth and steady investment in new upstream projects around the globe demonstrate our commitment to sustainably developing affordable energy resources to meet future demand," said Vagit Alekperov, President and CEO of LUKoil. The executive cast his company as the dominant private energy player with interests spanning 4 continents and 11 countries. 

However, outside experts point out some key discrepancies in LUKoil's claims. According to analysts at Moscow-based Uralsib Bank, ExxonMobil still boasts larger proven oil and gas reserves with 22.4 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 250 trillion cubic feet. Exxon also produced significantly more last year at 2.47 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
