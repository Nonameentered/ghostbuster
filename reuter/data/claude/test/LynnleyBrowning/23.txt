Gazprom Announces Restructuring and Job Cuts but Will Remain Intact as a Monopoly, Says Chairman Vyakhirev  

Moscow, Russia - Gazprom, Russia's state-owned natural gas company, announced a major restructuring plan today that will cut thousands of jobs but keep the company intact as a monopoly. According to Chairman Rem Vyakhirev, the restructuring aims to streamline operations and cut costs in order to make Gazprom more efficient and competitive on global energy markets.   

The restructuring is a response to continuing losses and declining gas prices that have hurt Gazprom's profits in recent years. The centerpiece of the plan involves job cuts, with up to 25% of the workforce - about 60,000 positions - expected to be eliminated. The bulk of the cuts will impact lower-level positions, but some mid-level management roles will also be reduced. The cuts will save Gazprom $2.5 billion per year when fully implemented, according to Vyakhirev.

However, Vyakhirev insisted that Gazprom will remain a monopoly under state control, quashing rumors that the company might be broken up or privatized to introduce competition to Russia's energy markets. "Gazprom is vital to Russia's economy and national interests, and dismantling or weakening it will not happen," Vyakhirev told reporters. He said the restructuring is designed to make Gazprom more efficient as a unified, vertically integrated company that operates under the guiding hand of the Kremlin. 

Gazprom employs over 400,000 people and is responsible for about 90% of Russia's natural gas production. The company's tax payments make up a significant portion of the Russian government's budget revenue. But its profits and stock price have dropped sharply in recent years due to ample gas supplies on world markets, lower energy demand in the wake of the financial crisis, and the Russian ruble's decline. 

The restructuring plan is expected to encounter opposition, especially to the proposed job cuts. But most industry analysts argue that major changes are necessary for Gazprom to adapt to market conditions and operate more sustainably long-term. With its monopoly status secure, efficiency gains and cost savings will be key to future profit growth at the company and its ability to generate funds for the Russian state. The coming months will determine whether Vyakhirev and the Kremlin can push through the ambitious restructuring plan over expected resistance.
