Gazprom Delays Share Look-Alike Plan as It Negotiates with Russian Government over Massive Debts and Payments

Russia's state-run energy giant Gazprom announced it is postponing a plan to offer shares that resemble equity to outsiders as the company remains in negotiations with the Russian government over billions of dollars in debts, tax payments, and dividends.

The gas exporter proposed earlier this year issuing so-called quasi-equity instruments to investors that would provide cash flow and capital gains similar to shares but without actual ownership or voting rights. The plan was aimed at raising capital from outsiders without diluting the Russian government's controlling stake.

However, Gazprom said this week the share look-alike issuance would be delayed indefinitely as discussions continue with Russian authorities over the company's large liabilities. Gazprom owes more than $35 billion in debts to the state budget, as well as $2.5 billion in dividends for last year. The Russian Finance Ministry has pushed Gazprom to accelerate its payments, as government revenues have declined amid weak oil prices and the coronavirus crisis.

The delay casts further uncertainty over Gazprom's finances and investment plans. The company's natural gas production and exports have declined in recent years, and it faces challenges funding new projects as Western sanctions have cut it off from international capital markets. Gazprom plans a massive pipeline and production ramp-up in eastern Siberia over the next decade that requires hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.

Gazprom also remains in a long-running dispute with Ukraine over natural gas transit fees as it builds new export pipelines that bypass the country. The lack of resolution adds to risks for Europe's gas supply and undermines Gazprom's reliability as a shipper.

With its quasi-equity plan on hold and limited access to outside capital, Gazprom will have to work closer with the Russian government on its funding issues, said Vitaly Yermakov, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. "Gazprom is increasingly dependent on the state, and the state has more sway and control over Gazprom's investment decisions," he said.

The Russian government owns just over 50% of Gazprom, with most of the rest trading as shares on the Moscow exchange. President Vladimir Putin has treated Gazprom as a tool for Russian foreign policy and influence over neighbors that import its gas.

Gazprom didn't comment on the reasons for the postponement of its quasi-equity plan. The company is due to report first-half financial results next week that should provide an update on its negotiations with the Russian government and implications for its business. Investors will be watching closely for any signs of increased state pressure on Gazprom and how that might further constrain the company.
