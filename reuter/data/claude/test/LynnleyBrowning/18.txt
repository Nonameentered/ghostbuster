Russia Faces Tough Challenge in Reforming Natural Monopolies for Economic Growth

The Russian economy has struggled in recent years due to low oil prices and international sanctions. However, underlying structural issues also continue to hamper growth, including the outsized role of state-owned monopolies and a lack of market competition in key sectors of the economy. Reforming these natural monopolies is seen as critical to unlocking Russia’s economic potential, but it will not be an easy task.

Major sectors of Russia’s economy are dominated by large companies that were formerly state-owned enterprises, including energy, transportation, and telecommunications. These companies benefit from their entrenched positions, but lack incentives to invest in innovation or become more efficient. They squeeze out potential competitors and discourage new entrants into their markets. Economists estimate that deregulating the Russian economy and opening it up to greater competition could boost GDP by up to 4% per year.  

In a speech last month, President Vladimir Putin called for “the largest structural changes to the Russian economy in 30 years” through reducing state control and promoting private enterprise. The government has pledged to sell minority stakes in Russian Railways, the country’s telecom giant Rostelecom, and other state champions. The hope is that even limited private ownership will introduce new management incentives and oversight.  

However, fully breaking up the largest monopolies will be very difficult. Powerful business leaders have close connections to the Kremlin and will lobby hard against reforms that threaten their interests. There are also concerns about job losses and economic disruption if major companies are radically restructured. Privatization in the 1990s led to asset stripping and widespread corruption, leaving many Russians wary of repeating that experience.

International organizations like the World Bank and IMF have long called on Russia to boost competition, reduce the footprint of state-owned enterprises, and diversify its economy beyond oil and gas exports. But progress has been slow. Anti-monopoly legislation introduced several years ago has rarely been enforced. The practice of awarding massive government contracts and subsidies to favored companies has endured.
