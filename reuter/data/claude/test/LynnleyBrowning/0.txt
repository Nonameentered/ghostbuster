Russia's Top Aluminium Smelters Struggle to Secure Raw Material Supplies from Ukraine 

Russia's major aluminium producers are facing difficulties securing key raw materials from Ukraine, threatening to disrupt production and raise costs. Russia relies on Ukraine for supplies of nepheline syenite, an ore used in the production of alumina which is then smelted to make aluminium. 

United Company Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer outside China, sources more than half of the 4 million tonnes of nepheline syenite it uses each year from Ukraine. Rusal's smelters have faced intermittent supply disruptions over the past year due to tensions between Russia and Ukraine, including Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Rusal's operations have not come to a standstill yet but the company recently warned that further disruptions to supplies could force it to delay some production.

The uncertainties surrounding supplies from Ukraine come at a difficult time for Rusal and the wider Russian aluminium sector. Aluminium prices have declined more than 30% over the past five years due to chronic oversupply and weak demand. Profit margins for producers have come under pressure, forcing Rusal and others to cut costs wherever possible. Securing affordable raw materials is crucial to remaining competitive. Losing access to cheap supplies from Ukraine could significantly hit Rusal's bottom line, which depends heavily on its Siberian smelters that consume the nepheline syenite.

For now, Rusal is hoping tensions between Moscow and Kiev do not escalate further. But the company is also taking steps to diversify its sources of raw materials to reduce its reliance on Ukraine. Last year, Rusal invested $700 million to boost production of nepheline syenite at its mines in Russia's far east. It has also held talks with alternative suppliers in South Africa, Finland, and Norway. However, transporting supplies from these locations may prove more costly than the short rail journey from Ukraine on which Rusal currently depends.

Rusal's struggles highlight Russia's dependence on other former Soviet states for certain resources and inputs. While Russia is a commodities powerhouse in its own right, its industry still relies on a web of economic ties with its neighbours that date back to the Soviet era. As political relations with Ukraine remain fraught, these economic ties appear increasingly fragile. For Russia's metals and mining giants, that fragility poses material risks to their operations.
