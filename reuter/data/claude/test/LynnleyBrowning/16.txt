Western Oil Companies Doubt Russia's New Reformist Cabinet will Boost Stalled Deals

by the Assistant News Desk

Moscow, March 28 - Western oil and gas executives are cautiously optimistic following Russian President Vladimir Putin's surprise appointment of a new, reformist cabinet last week. The incoming energy minister Alexander Novak promised to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and improve partnerships with foreign investors. However, some companies remain skeptical and hesitant to commit further funds without seeing concrete policy changes.   

Novak pledged to review oil and gas field license requirements and spending obligations to make them more "investor-friendly." He also wants to settle a yearslong spat with the oil major ExxonMobil over a failed Arctic drilling deal. But analysts cautioned that the cabinet reshuffle may only be superficial, noting that Putin has made similar pledges before without delivering. More far-reaching reforms like reducing government interference in the energy sector or improving judicial independence seem unlikely.

"We've been here before. The Kremlin makes promises but fails to follow through," said Olga Malysheva, Russia analyst at the Energy Institute think tank. "Western companies need to see actual deregulation and a real willingness to share control before investing again or partnering in new megaprojects."

BP, Shell, Equinor and other firms burned by previous dealings with Russian state corporations Rosneft and Gazprom agreed, saying only concrete policy changes would reassure investors rattled by geopolitical tensions and weak rule of law.   

Equinor was forced in 2012 to cede control of a lucrative Siberian gas field to Gazprom and struggled for years to recoup its investment. "We learned our lesson there," said Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre.   

Meanwhile, Exxon aims to finally seal a joint venture on the "Pobeda" ("Victory") oil prospect in the Russian Arctic with Rosneft. Discovered in 2014, the project stalled over disputes on how much Exxon could own and export. The Texas-based supermajor spent over $700 million on preliminary drilling and had planned to invest $15 billion more but was "disappointed and frustrated" with Russian wrangling, according to a former executive.
