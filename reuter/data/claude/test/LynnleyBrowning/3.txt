Russia Sells Precious Metals and Diamonds to Save Worsening Economy, Strategic Gold Stockpiles Near Depletion 

The Russian economy continues to struggle under economic sanctions and low oil prices, prompting the government to take drastic measures to shore up its finances. According to sources in the Russian finance ministry, the country has begun selling off portions of its strategic stockpiles of precious metals and diamonds to generate capital. The gold reserves, in particular, have dipped to their lowest levels in over 10 years as Russia sells gold bars and coins.

Russia has the fifth largest gold reserves in the world, with over 2,000 metric tons of gold bullion held by the central bank. However, since 2014, the country has sold over 400 metric tons of gold, dropping reserves to about 1,600 metric tons today, worth around $65 billion. The sales have raised nearly $20 billion in revenue for the Russian government at a time when it is struggling to balance its budget. Experts worry that aggressive gold sales could threaten Russia's financial stability if gold prices were to drop suddenly.

Diamond sales have also accelerated this year. Alrosa, the Russian state-owned diamond mining company, has sold over $800 million in diamonds so far this year to foreign buyers and Russian diamond cutters. The company is one of the largest diamond producers in the world and serves as an important source of revenue and jobs in Russia's far eastern regions. However, some critics argue the diamond sell-offs will weaken Russia's control over its strategic diamond resources in the long run.

With oil prices still under $60 per barrel, Russia has had to make difficult decisions to cut spending and raise funds to offset huge deficits. The government has already cut capital spending by over 30% this year and reduced budgeted outlays for the next three years. The weak economic growth and low oil prices have hit ordinary Russians hard. The national poverty rate has risen over the past few years, and inflation remains stubbornly high. Many analysts think the Russian economy will struggle to return to consistent strong growth without considerably higher oil prices and access to Western investment and technology.

Selling valuable natural resources may provide temporary relief, but it masks the deeper reforms needed to modernize Russia's commodities-dependent economy. President Putin has not yet delivered on promises to make the Russian economy more competitive and attractive for foreign investment. With strategic gold and diamond reserves declining, the options left for the Kremlin to continue financing its budget may be narrowing unless fortunes change. Overall, Russia's medium and long term economic prospects remain worrying for Russian policymakers and citizens alike.
