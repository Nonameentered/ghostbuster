Russia's Aluminium Industry at Risk Due to Alleged Corruption and Lack of Investment 

Russia's aluminium industry, one of the country's economic bright spots, finds itself under threat due to allegations of corruption and lack of investment in modernization, industry experts warn. Russia accounts for about 6% of the world's aluminium production and is the second largest producer behind China. However, recent events point to difficult times ahead for the crucial sector.

Last month, Russian mining and metals company Rusal was hit with U.S. sanctions that prohibit Americans from doing business with the company. The sanctions stem from Rusal's links to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin who was also sanctioned. Deripaska owns a controlling stake in En+ Group, which in turn owns a controlling stake in Rusal. The sanctions have caused chaos for Rusal, with aluminium prices spiking and the company's share price plunging over 50%.

Rusal is the largest aluminum producer in the world outside China, operating 15 aluminium smelters in Russia as well as smelters in Sweden, Nigeria, Ireland, Italy and elsewhere. The sanctions jeopardize Rusal's access  to raw materials and international markets, and cast a shadow over Russia's entire aluminium sector. If Rusal falters, thousands of workers could lose their jobs across Russia and beyond. The Russian government is attempting to shield Rusal from the worst effects of the sanctions, but industry experts remain deeply concerned.  

Even before the sanctions, Russia's aluminium industry faced systemic issues that threaten its viability. Most of Russia's aluminium smelters were built in the 1970s and 80s and are in dire need of modernization. However, a lack of investment in new technologies and sustainable power infrastructure has left many smelters inefficient, uncompetitive, and heavily polluting.
