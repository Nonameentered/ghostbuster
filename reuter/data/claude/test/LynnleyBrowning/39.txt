Former Soviet Union's grain output expected to increase this year, but unpredictable weather remains a concern  

Grain production in the former Soviet Union countries is forecast to rise modestly this year, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The region is expected to produce 270.3 million metric tons of grain in the 2019-2020 season, up 3% from last year. However, unpredictable weather and volatile yields remain an ongoing concern for the agricultural economies of many post-Soviet states.   

The largest grain producers in the region, Russia and Ukraine, are projected to see the biggest increases. Russia's grain harvest is estimated to reach 120 million metric tons, up 5% year over year, while Ukraine's output may rise 7% to 71 million metric tons. These gains would make up for dips in production from other countries like Kazakhstan, where adverse weather has hampered the wheat crop.  

While any rise in grain output is positive news for the region, the gains mask deeper uncertainties. Russia and Ukraine have seen dramatic year-to-year swings in production levels over the past decade due to variable weather conditions. A long trend of warming temperatures has made the region's weather increasingly erratic and difficult to forecast. Severe droughts have at times been followed immediately by periods of excessive rain and flooding.

"It's a very volatile part of the world for crop production," said Adam Davis, a senior economist specializing in the former Soviet Union at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. "These countries have had some big harvests in recent years, but weather has also dealt them some major blows. Climate change seems to be amplifying the ups and downs."

The unpredictability has significant economic consequences, especially for Ukraine, where the ag sector makes up about 12% of gross domestic product. When harvests are poor, it strains the country's budget and overall economy. It also endangers food security in some post-Soviet countries, where access to affordable bread and grains is crucial for much of the population.

Officials and agricultural experts in the region hope investments in infrastructure, technology and diversification can help mitigate the risks. Improvements in grain transport and storage, for example, could help reduce price spikes when harvests are low by making it easier to transfer surplus grains across borders. Planting more drought- and weather-resistant crops could also strengthen the food system against climate shocks.  

 "These countries have made a lot of progress, but more work is needed," Davis said. "Upgrading infrastructure and adapting to climate change will be vital to lifting the entire region onto a sustainable path of greater food security and stability."
