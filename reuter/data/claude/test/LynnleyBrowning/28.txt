Norilsk Nickel says employees should brace for cutbacks despite averting strike 

Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium, warned employees today to expect downsizing and cost-cutting measures even though the company avoided a potentially lengthy and disruptive labor strike this week.

Unionized employees at Norilsk Nickel's Polar Division in Russia's Arctic north agreed to postpone a strike for at least 6 months after new contract negotiations. However, Norilsk Nickel management said that while the strike was averted, "difficult decisions" would still need to be made to ensure the financial health of the company given the impact of COVID-19 on commodity prices and demand.

Norilsk Nickel executives cited the substantial drop in nickel prices so far this year, especially over the last month, due to reduced demand from steel makers and electric vehicle battery manufacturers. The company also faces higher expenses related to implementing new health and safety measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a rebound in Chinese manufacturing, weaker conditions are expected to persist in Norilsk Nickel's other major markets, including Europe and South Korea.

The threatened strike by Polar Division employees was set to begin on July 28 but was called off after a revised contract agreement provided modest wage increases and guarantees of no involuntary layoffs over the next six months. However, in a message to all Norilsk Nickel employees today, CEO Vladimir Potanin warned that "temporary relief" would need to translate into "long-term solutions to protect our business.‚Äù  

Potanin said the company had already taken steps to reduce expenses by over $700 million through cuts in capital expenditures and operational costs. But he signaled that further measures would be necessary, including potential downsizing to "optimize our staffing levels in line with market conditions." The CEO pledged to avoid direct layoffs "as a last resort only" by reducing employee numbers through normal attrition and the non-renewal of temporary contracts.   

The Norilsk Nickel labor unions pushed back against major concessions during this week's contract talks and expressed optimism that demand and commodity prices would recover over the next six months. However, if conditions do not improve, the company and unions may be headed for a more contentious showdown in 2021 with implications for Norilsk Nickel's 94,000 strong global workforce and operations in Russia, Finland, Australia, Botswana, and South Africa.
