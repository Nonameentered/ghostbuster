Russian Oil-for-Sugar Deals with Cuba Sour as Market Economy Principles Intrude Upon Communist-Era Practices

For decades, Russia and Cuba participated in an agreement to exchange Russian oil for Cuban sugar at fixed prices, continuing a deal that valued ideological solidarity over market fluctuations. But as market principles seep into Communist Cuba's economy, the oil-for-sugar deal appears increasingly untenable and out of touch with global energy and commodities markets.

Sources in both countries report that the Russian government has become increasingly frustrated with the deal, under which they provide Cuba with up to 400,000 metric tons of petroleum annually in exchange for the same amount of raw sugar. Global oil prices have climbed steadily in recent years, while sugar prices have dropped by 30% since 2010. According to reports, Russia is now paying nearly double the market price for Cuban sugar while subsidizing Cuba's oil purchases.

The oil-for-sugar agreement dates to 1960, shortly after Fidel Castro took power. The deal allowed Cuba to avoid depending on oil from ideological enemies like the United States. But experts say it now threatens to undermine broader Russian-Cuban trade and cooperation. Russia's ambassador to Havana recently called for "mutual compromises" to update the agreement with global market prices. However, hardliners in both governments remain reluctant to abandon such a historic deal.

With market principles guiding more of Cuba's economy under President Miguel Díaz-Canel, the oil-for-sugar deal is an anachronism. Cuba now allows some private sector activity and foreign investment, and trade of most goods and services globally fluctuate based on supply and demand. Yet the agreement values Cuba's sugar—a commodity with huge price swings in global markets—at artificially inflated prices regardless of its quality or market value.  

Russia has also moved toward a market economy in recent decades and can no longer afford to heavily subsidize Cuba's energy needs. But ending the oil-for-sugar agreement risks a rupture in ties between two long-time allies that still cherish their shared communist history. The deal is a powerful symbol of Cuban-Russian solidarity, even as it makes little economic sense today.

Sources say Russian and Cuban negotiators have met several times recently to overhaul or replace the current agreement, though no final deal has been reached. Any new agreement would likely abandon the rigid 1-to-1 oil-for-sugar exchange for a more flexible deal that pegs the value of trade to global commodity prices. But the ideological desire to show solidarity through subsidized trade, even as market forces make that solidarity increasingly costly, is a hard habit to break.
