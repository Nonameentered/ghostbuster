Russia Opens Up Massive Gold Field Sukhoi Log to Investors, But Experts Say It Won't Flood the Market  

Russia's largest gold deposit, Sukhoi Log, is finally open for business. The Russian government has allowed private companies to bid for exploration and mining rights at the site, located in remote Siberia about 520 miles east of Moscow. Sukhoi Log is estimated to hold 1,250 tons of gold, making it one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world.

While the opportunity excites gold mining companies, most experts say Sukhoi Log is unlikely to significantly disrupt the global gold market or decrease gold prices in the short to medium term. The challenges of developing the site mean it will likely take at least 10-15 years before the deposit starts producing gold in large volumes.  

Sukhoi Log was discovered in 1972 but has remained largely undeveloped due to its remote location and lack of infrastructure. The Russian government now hopes that private investment and expertise can help unlock the deposit’s potential. The government's geology agency recently completed surveys of the site to determine the size and quality of the gold reserves, paving the way for bidding. The license is expected to be awarded by the end of 2019.

Analysts say developing Sukhoi Log will require building roads, railways, electricity infrastructure and processing plants almost from scratch in this isolated taiga region. The total cost to fully develop the deposit is estimated at $10 billion or more. These high costs and long timelines mean the project is unlikely to generate a supply shock, according to economists.  

“A discovery and development of this scale typically takes at least 3-5 years of exploration to better determine the resource, 5-7 years to build supporting infrastructure, and 10-15 years before meaningful production begins,” said Eily Ong, a gold analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “So, there is plenty of time for the supply to be absorbed gradually by the market.”
