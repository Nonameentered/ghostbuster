Russian Demand for Imported Sugar Rises Ahead of Beet Harvest, Bringing Stability to Domestic Market 

Russia's sugar producers and traders are reporting an increase in demand for imported raw sugar in recent months as the nation awaits the start of the domestic sugar beet harvesting campaign. The higher demand for imported sugar is helping to stabilize  wholesale sugar prices in Russia's domestic market, which declined sharply over the last year due to a surplus of sugar following a record beet crop.

Russia's sugar beet harvesting usually begins in September and runs through December. Ahead of the harvest, sugar stocks from the previous crop year start to tighten, creating demand for imported sugar. According to Russia's Sugar Producers Union, the nation has imported over 200,000 metric tons of raw sugar since the start of 2020, a more than 20% increase from the same period last year. The increased imports are satisfying demand from industrial sugar users like food and beverage companies, as well as stabilizing the market for traders and wholesalers.

"Until the start of the harvest, demand for imported raw sugar will remain strong," said Eduard Zernin, chairman of the Sugar Producers Union. "Wholesale sugar prices have steadied in recent weeks thanks to availability of imported supplies. If not for these imports, our market likely would be quite volatile right now due to tight stocks."

Wholesale sugar prices in Russia declined over 30% last year due to the nation's record beet crop of over 6 million metric tons, its largest in 15 years. While the surplus of sugar benefited consumers through lower retail prices, it cut profits for producers and traders. The increased demand for imported sugar in recent months has helped halt the slide in wholesale prices, with prices remaining largely flat since June according to Russia's central bank.

Sugar industry experts expect Russia's 2020-21 beet harvest will yield a slightly smaller crop than last season due to drier weather in some regions. While the smaller crop may threaten to tighten supplies later this year, the nation should have adequate stocks until the middle of next year thanks to plentiful carryover stocks from the previous harvest and continuing raw sugar imports. Russia allows for tariff-free imports of up to 600,000 metric tons of raw sugar annually under its commitment to the World Trade Organization.

In summary, Russia's sugar producers and traders have seen demand for imported raw sugar rise in recent months ahead of the start of the nation's sugar beet harvest. The increased imports have helped stabilize the domestic sugar market by halting a sharp decline in wholesale sugar prices. With a smaller beet harvest expected this season and ample sugar supplies from the previous crop, Russia's sugar market appears poised for balance and stability in the coming 12 months. Overall, while retailers may need to pay slightly higher prices, consumers should continue to benefit from relatively low sugar costs.
