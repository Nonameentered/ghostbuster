Russian aluminium sector executives remain confident of uninterrupted output, despite Western participation row 

Senior executives in Russia's aluminium sector have expressed confidence that production will continue uninterrupted, despite threats of sanctions from Western governments over the role of Russian companies in global supply chains.

The comments come after the U.S. government issued a carve-out from its latest round of sanctions allowing several Russian aluminium companies, including industry leader United Company Rusal, to continue participating in the global aluminium market. The reprieve is intended to avoid supply shocks and price spikes that could damage U.S. companies and consumers.

However, subsequent proposals in Congress have sought to tighten the rules and force U.S. companies to divest ownership stakes in Russian firms like Rusal. The European Union is also considering its own sanctions on Russian entities.

“We have lived under the threat of sanctions for many years, but we have endured and even thrived,” said Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Rusal majority owner En+, in an interview. “Our global operations and diversified ownership structures provide insulation against geopolitical risks.”

Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer outside of China, relies on global supply chains and partnerships with major international companies like Rio Tinto. It generates over 60 per cent of its revenue from exports to Europe, the U.S. and Asia.

Any new restrictions could hamper Rusal's access to overseas markets and financing, and force divestment by partners like Rio Tinto, which owns a 10 per cent stake. However, Glasenberg and other Russian executives argue that aluminium is such a globally traded commodity, with multiple possible suppliers, that sanctions would be felt more by Western companies than domestic producers. 

“The aluminium industry has ample spare capacity in China and the Middle East that could readily replace any Russian supply removed from world markets due to sanctions,” said Vasily Matrenin, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in Moscow. “It would be a temporary inconvenience, not an existential threat.”
