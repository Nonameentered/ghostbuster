Rains in Ivory Coast's Cocoa Belt Boost 1996/97 Main Crop Prospects 

Heavy rains across Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions over the past several weeks have significantly improved soil moisture levels and prospects for the 1996/97 main cocoa crop, farmers and exporters said. The increased rainfall will help cocoa trees recover from the impact of a prolonged dry spell earlier this year and boost the size and quality of the October-to-March main crop.

Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, relies on rainfall to grow cocoa as less than 10% of the country's plantations have irrigation systems. While some areas received average to above-average rains in the first few months of this year, a prolonged dry period from April to June caused some small pods to fall off trees and limited the growth of cocoa pods. The recent rains will help pods currently on the trees develop further and increase the number of new pods over the coming months.

"The weather is very good now and the trees have more capsules, so we think the main crop will be good," said Claude Kouakou, who farms cocoa near Daloa in the western region of Loh Djiboua.  

Exporters also echoed farmers' optimism that sufficient rains will lead to a stronger main crop. "The weather seems more favorable now after a poor start of the year, so if it continues, the main crop should be good," according to one Abidjan-based cocoa exporter. Ivory Coast's main cocoa crop typically starts ramping up from October and runs through March.

While forecasts point to adequate rains for the rest of the year, excessively wet weather later in the season could hamper harvesting and quality if not managed properly. Farmers will also have to monitor black pod disease and other crop pests fostered by humid conditions. Overall, however, current weather conditions have set the stage for improved main crop yields and a strong start to the season. The positive impact is expected to extend into next year's mid-crop harvest as well.
