Industry Analysts Forecast Over One Million Tonnes of Cocoa Crop in Ivory Coast Despite Government's Lower Estimate

Cocoa harvesting is currently underway in top cocoa producer Ivory Coast , and indications from industry analysts suggest this year's crop may surpass the one million tonne mark. Several leading analysts forecast the harvest could reach as high as 1.1 million tonnes or more despite the Ivory Coast government estimating a lower crop of 950,000 tonnes for this season. 

Edward George of Ecobank, a leading West African bank, said he expects the harvest to reach as much as 1.04 million tonnes. Jonathan Parkman of agricultural commodities broker Marex Spectron predicted 1.1 million tonnes. Industry analyst Judith Ganes-Chase said her forecast is 1.055 million tonnes. The estimates from these and other analysts suggest the government's forecast may be on the low side for the 2020-2021 season.

A better gauge of this year's potential cocoa crop will come in December and January as the main harvesting period gets into full swing. Higher than average rainfall in Ivory Coast since the start of October has strengthened expectations for a sizable crop this season. However, there are risks of disease pressure given the increased moisture.

The government of Ivory Coast set a guaranteed price for cocoa farmers of XOF 825 ($1.5) per kilogram for the 2020-2021 season, an increase of over 9% from last season. A higher crop this year along with the increased price could provide a significant boost to the income of the country's estimated 600,000 cocoa farmers who depend on the crop for their livelihood.

Ivory Coast is coming off a record crop of over 1.4 million tonnes two seasons ago. Last year's crop was negatively impacted by hot and dry weather, coming in around 1.25 million tonnes according to most estimates. The prospect of another crop in excess of 1 million tonnes would mark the third time in four years Ivory Coast's cocoa harvest has reached or surpassed that threshold.  

Some analysts noted that their high-end forecast of 1.1 million tonnes for this season is lower than the record crop from 2018-2019 and lower than earlier expectations of another potential record year. The mixed weather and risks of disease are two factors contributing to more moderated forecasts. However, most still expect a substantial crop that maintains Ivory Coast's position as the engine of global cocoa supply. The country continues to produce around 40-45% of the world's cocoa beans.

Overall, most cocoa industry experts remain optimistic about continued growth in Ivory Coast's cocoa crop over the next 3-5 years given ongoing investments in productivity, increased use of higher-yielding hybrid plant varieties, and improved farming methods. Barring severe weather events or spread of disease, Ivory Coast appears well-positioned to harvest over 1 million tonnes of cocoa for years to come. The country's cocoa sector continues to be a major driver of its economy, highlighting cocoa's ongoing importance.
