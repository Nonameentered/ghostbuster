Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko holds mini-summit to seek peaceful end to war in capital

President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire today convened a mini-summit of key leaders in an attempt to broker a ceasefire and end weeks of fighting in the capital of Kinshasa. As rebel forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila advanced further into the city and were just miles away from Mobutu's residence, the long-time dictator summoned political opponents, military leaders, and foreign diplomats for urgent talks.

 "There has been too much bloodshed between Zaireans already," Mobutu appealed to the group gathered at his palace. "We must find a way to silence the guns for the sake of our people." Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for 32 years, proposed a power-sharing agreement that would install Kabila as Prime Minister but allow Mobutu to remain President for two more years. The offer was immediately rejected by representatives of the rebels.

 Kabila's forces have made steady gains since launching a campaign from the east of the country last October to oust Mobutu. They now occupy most of Kinshasa and control the airport and other strategic locations. Residents of the capital report scenes of looting and violence on the parts of both Mobutu's soldiers as well as the rebel fighters. The US, France and Belgium evacuated most of their citizens from Zaire as conditions deteriorated over the past week.

 Mobutu himself appeared frail at today's meeting, walking with the aid of a cane and at times struggling to be heard. His health has declined significantly in recent years due to prostate cancer, though he has clung stubbornly to power despite calls by Western leaders and Zairean opposition groups that he step down. While vowing to defend his position and "fight to the end" if attacked, Mobutu also expressed a willingness today to go into exile to prevent further bloodshed, as long as his safety and assets could be guaranteed.
