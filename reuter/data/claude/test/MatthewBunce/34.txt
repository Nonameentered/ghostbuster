Heavy April Rains Boost Cocoa Growth for Ivorian Main Crop Harvests  

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coastâ€”Heavy rains in April have boosted cocoa growth in Ivory Coast and farmers are hopeful that it will translate into higher yields for the upcoming mid-crop harvest. Many farmers in the world's top cocoa producer have expressed optimism for the ongoing mid-crop harvest in June.

Souleymane Dibi, a cocoa farmer in the southern region of Tiassale, said the April rains had led to an abundance of small pods in his plantation and he expected his yield for the mid-crop harvest to significantly increase. "The heavy rains in April were good for cocoa," Dibi said. "There are more pods now, so we expect a bigger harvest in June."

Annually, Ivory Coast experiences two cocoa harvests: the mid-crop from April to June, and the main crop from October to January. The main crop harvest accounts for 60-70% of total annual production while the mid-crop accounts for the rest. Cocoa production in Ivory Coast reached an all-time high of 2.15 million tonnes in 2016-17 due to favorable weather conditions. With weather conditions also looking favorable now, the mid-crop harvest is set to further boost production this season.

The government has also projected cocoa output to rise to around 2.2 million tonnes for the 2017-2018 season. "The weather has been good so far this year and it is expected to remain favorable for the rest of the season," said Baudelaire Mieu, an official at the Coffee and Cocoa Council regulating the sector.

During March and April, most of Ivory Coast received average to above-average rainfall, which helped maintain soil moisture and promoted the growth of cocoa pods. The rains also boosted the growth of supplementary food crops like bananas, plantains and vegetables that farmers inter-crop with cocoa to boost income. Inter-cropped and main food crops provide a crucial safety net for cocoa farmers, especially in between harvest periods.  

With the mid-crop harvest fast approaching, many farmers are preparing fertilizers and fungicides to boost their yields. Farmers who were unable to fertilize their fields during the last main crop harvest said they were planning to fertilize their plantations during the mid-crop harvest to increase their yields. "I have already started applying fertilizer for the mid-crop harvest," said Kouassi Koffi, a cocoa farmer in Soubre. "The rains have made the trees healthy so with fertilizer, I expect a good harvest."  

While the forecast weather and use of farm inputs are expected to boost production, some challenges remain. Cocoa farmers continue to face difficulties accessing farm equipment, fertilizers and fungicides. They also face volatile global prices and demand. For now though, most farmers remain hopeful that the bountiful mid-crop harvest will help increase their incomes in the coming months.
