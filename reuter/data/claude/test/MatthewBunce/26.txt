Ivory Coast Launches New Mining Commission to Streamline Permit Approval for Booming Exploration Sector

The Ivory Coast government today announced the launch of a new Mining Commission aimed at streamlining the process for reviewing and approving mining exploration permits. The move is intended to support the rapid growth in the country's mining sector over the past decade.

The Mining Commission will oversee a centralized process for reviewing permit applications, environmental impact assessments, and mining conventions. The goal is to reduce bureaucracy, increase transparency, and accelerate decision making for new mining projects. Previously, mining permits required approvals across multiple government ministries and agencies, causing lengthy delays.

"The creation of the Mining Commission is a major step forward in improving the business climate for mining companies operating in Ivory Coast," said the country's Minister of Mines, Jean-Claude Kouassi. "By consolidating the permitting process under a single entity, we can issue exploration permits and mining licenses more efficiently while still ensuring strong oversight and governance."

Ivory Coast has seen a surge in mining exploration activity in recent years, driven by rising global commodity prices and the country's efforts to revive its mining sector following years of political instability. The government revised its mining code in 2014 to provide tax incentives and improve the permitting process. Those efforts have attracted mining companies from Australia, Canada, China, and Europe.

Permit approvals are urgently needed to sustain the growth of Ivory Coast's mining sector. Dozens of companies hold exploration permits that are set to expire in the coming years. The Mining Commission aims to renew at least 30 permits by the end of this year and review another 50 new permit applications. Speeding up approvals will allow companies to transition from exploration to production and start generating revenue and jobs.
