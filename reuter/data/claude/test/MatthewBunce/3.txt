Ivorian Cocoa Exports Reach 416,000 Tonnes in 1996/97 Season

Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire - Cocoa exports from Côte d'Ivoire, the world's largest producer of cocoa beans, reached 416,000 tonnes in the 1996/97 season, up 12.5 percent from 370,000 tonnes the previous season. The significant increase in exports was driven by favorable weather conditions that boosted cocoa harvests across the West African nation.   

The state regulator responsible for overseeing the cocoa industry, Le Conseil du Café-Cacao, announced the export figures earlier this week. The strong crop and rebounding global cocoa prices led to a 20 percent increase in income from cocoa exports, topping $1.8 billion US dollars and providing a boost to Côte d'Ivoire's economy which has struggled in recent years.

"This was an excellent season for our cocoa farmers and the nation's economy as a whole," said Minister of Agriculture Konan Kouadio Guillaume. "The weather cooperated, global demand for Ivorian cocoa remains very high, and our farmers have invested in improving crop yields. Ivorian cocoa continues to be recognized as the finest in the world."

Cocoa, which is used to produce chocolate and cocoa products, accounts for about 15 percent of Côte d'Ivoire's GDP and more than 30 percent of its export revenue. The majority of Ivorian cocoa is exported to Western countries, particularly in Europe. Côte d'Ivoire has seen its position as the top cocoa producer in the world challenged in recent years by Ghana, its neighbor to the east. Competition for the world's cocoa supplies and farmers has intensified between the two nations.  

For the current season, Côte d'Ivoire has set an official goal to produce between 1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes of cocoa, which would mark another significant increase in production and exports. However, some analysts caution the target may be unrealistic and actual production and exports may be lower, due to risks around weather, pests and market volatility. Ivorian farmers will need another successful growing season and continued strong global demand to propel the industry to greater heights next season. Overall the 1996/97 season will be seen as very positive for Côte d'Ivoire's cocoa sector.
