Cocoa Bean Exports from Ivory Coast Surge to Over 171,000 Tonnes in March  

The world's top cocoa producer Ivory Coast exported 171,205 tonnes of cocoa beans in March, up nearly 12% from the same month last year, exporters said on Monday. The surge in exports follows a record harvest for the 2021/22 season and confirms analysts' expectations that the country is on track for strong exports this year.

Ivory Coast, which accounts for about two-fifths of global cocoa supply, is in the midst of its main crop of the season, which runs from October to March. Exporters shipped out 18,349 tonnes of beans more than in March 2021. They had already exported a total of 1.46 million tonnes of cocoa beans by the end of March since the start of the season in October, up 4.6% from 1.4 million tonnes the previous season. 

The strong growth in exports in March was due to both improved weather conditions that supported a robust harvest and greater supply availability at the ports. Analysts had projected that favorable weather, including increased rainfall, would boost yields this season in the key cocoa-growing regions of Ivory Coast. The improved yields, coupled with greater port availability have clearly translated into the strong exports.

Farmers also delivered more beans to the country's ports last month in anticipation of seasonal price declines. Some farmers were holding back deliveries earlier in the hopes of better prices later. "There was indeed strong supply at the ports in March compared to the same period last year," said one exporter, who asked not to be identified.

Ivory Coast's economy depends heavily on cocoa, as the crop generates over 10% of GDP and more than 40% of export earnings. The 2020/21 season in Ivory Coast produced a record crop of over 2.2 million tonnes of cocoa, and initial forecasts point to another robust harvest for the current 2021/22 season. The strong performance of the cocoa sector will provide a boost to the Ivorian economy as it continues to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
