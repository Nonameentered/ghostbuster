African Coffee Ministers Meet to Discuss Cutting Robusta Exports Amid Concerns Over Disease and Drought in Some Countries 

Representatives from major robusta coffee-producing countries in Africa met today in Kampala, Uganda to discuss coordinated actions to support robusta coffee prices in the face of weather-related supply concerns. Robusta coffee futures prices have declined more than 25% over the past year due to ample supplies and tepid demand. However, some African producing nations have experienced significant crop losses recently due to the spread of coffee leaf rust disease and drought conditions.

The coffee ministers proposed cutting robusta exports from the region by at least 10% over the next six months. "We have to take collective action now before the current downward pressure on prices seriously impacts our farmers and economies," said Ugandan Coffee Minister Emmanuel Nuwagaba. Uganda is the largest robusta producer in Africa and the second largest in the world behind Vietnam. The country has lost nearly 15% of its crop to leaf rust this year and is facing drought conditions in some areas.

Ivory Coast, the largest robusta producer in the world, also voiced support for export cuts. "We have experienced the double impact of disease and dry weather on our farms this season, so we will need to tighten our supplies to the market to avoid a price crash," said Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Minister Massandje Toure. However, some analysts argue that coordinated supply cuts could be seen as price manipulation by importing countries and roasters. "Production countries have to be very careful in announcing and implementing export cuts, as this could raise legal issues under World Trade Organization rules," said international coffee analyst Jeffrey Sachs. 

The African coffee representatives defended their proposal as a measure to protect farmers during difficult times rather than manipulate the market. They argue the cuts would stabilize global prices to a level that provides farmers a living income for the foreseeable future. The ministers will meet again in two weeks to decide on a coordinated plan of action with specific export cut targets and timelines for the major African robusta producers. The move highlights the challenges of balancing supply and demand in the face of unpredictable weather events for agricultural commodities. Tightening supplies too far risks higher consumer prices, but inaction could lead to an extended period of unsustainably low farmgate prices in some countries.
