Cocoa Harvest in Ivory Coast Expected to Meet Forecasts Despite Drop in May Rains

The cocoa harvest in Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa beans, is still expected to meet forecasts for the 2020-2021 growing season despite a decline in rains in May. The reduced rainfall last month raised initial concerns about the development of cocoa pods. However, farmers and cooperatives report that the cocoa trees continue to be resilient and yields remain on track.

According to estimates from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), Ivory Coast's main crop harvest is projected to yield approximately 2 million tonnes of cocoa beans for the October to March main crop season. While the month of May typically sees significant rainfall, reports from across key growing regions indicate that the reduced rains did not substantially impact cocoa farms. Sources report adequate soil moisture levels from rains in March and April supported the growth of cocoa pods through the drier May weather. 

As the main crop harvest concludes over the next few months, all signs point to a sufficient supply of cocoa and stable incomes for the over 600,000 farmers in Ivory Coast that depend on cocoa for their livelihoods. Representatives from cooperatives and farmers groups expect the mid-crop harvest from April to September to also produce a solid yield, which will be necessary to meet the forecast production levels for the full 2020-2021 season.

Despite initial concerns, it appears Ivory Coast is on track for another successful cocoa season. As the world's top producer, supplying roughly 40% of global cocoa, a productive harvest in Ivory Coast is critical for supporting the worldwide chocolate industry. While production levels meet expectations for this growing season, climate change poses risks for future cocoa harvests. Ongoing investments in sustainability programs and research are aimed at developing more resilient cocoa plants that can thrive even with changes in climate patterns. Overall, this year's cocoa harvest in Ivory Coast demonstrates the resiliency of both the plants and the farmers that have made this nation the leading source of cocoa for decades.
