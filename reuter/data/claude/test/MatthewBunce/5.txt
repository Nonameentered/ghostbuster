Ivorian Coffee Exports Set to Rise Despite Poor Quality and Exportability Concerns

Coffee exports from Ivory Coast are projected to increase in the coming years, despite ongoing concerns about the quality, consistency, and exportability of the country's coffee. According to industry estimates, Ivory Coast could export as much as 2.5 million 60-kilogram bags of coffee in 2020, up from 2 million bags in 2019. The country aspires to become the fifth largest coffee exporter in the world behind Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, and Indonesia. 

Ivory Coast has invested heavily in its coffee sector in recent years, providing farmers with new seedlings, training on good agricultural practices, and loans for farm rehabilitation. The government’s goal is to boost coffee output to 4 million bags per year by 2030 through increased productivity and acreage. However, critics argue that the country's obsession with volume risks neglecting quality. Ivorian coffees—which are mostly of the inexpensive robusta variety—suffer from variable quality and a lack of flavour consistency, raising doubts about their attractiveness to foreign buyers.

Exporters also face considerable logistical challenges in getting Ivorian coffee to market, including a lack of roads and infrastructure in growing regions, limited availability of trucks, and corruption along transportation routes which can delay shipments and cut into profits. These factors undermine Ivory Coast’s export potential despite its ambitious targets. “Without addressing quality and transportation issues, increased production alone won’t make Ivory Coast a powerhouse exporter,” said Francois Ruf, an economist at the Center for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research for Development.
