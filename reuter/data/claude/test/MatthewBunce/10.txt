Rains Bring Hope for Ivory Coast Cocoa Crop After February Drought 

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coastâ€”Recent heavy rains across Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions have boosted hopes for the upcoming main crop after a prolonged dry spell in February threatened the vital mid-crop harvest.

The world's top cocoa producer experienced little to no rain in February, raising concerns about the health of cocoa pods and yields for the April-to-September main crop. However, March saw significant downpours that have helped rejuvenate cocoa farms.

"The rains have really helped the trees and given a lifeline to the main crop," said cocoa farmer Joseph Kouame, who farms in the western region of Soubre, the heart of Ivory Coast's cocoa belt. "The Harmattan winds and lack of rain caused many small pods to fall off, but we now expect the remaining pods to develop well."

Ivory Coast's 2019-2020 main crop officially opened on April 1 and will continue through the end of September. Farmers and cocoa cooperatives are optimistic the recent rains will boost yields and lead to a strong harvest over the next few months. The mid-crop harvest from October to March saw a significant drop in production due to hot, dry weather last year.

"We were very worried in February but it looks like we've been lucky," said cocoa cooperative manager Abdoulaye Sawadogo in the eastern region of Abengourou. "The rains came at just the right time and have given the main crop a real boost. We now expect good volumes and quality from our farmers."

Any increase in Ivory Coast's cocoa production would come as a relief to the global chocolate industry. Grinding companies and chocolate makers have grappled with a supply deficit for the past two years due to weather issues curbing output in Ivory Coast and neighboring Ghana, the world's second-largest cocoa producer. 

Ivory Coast's cocoa regulator, the Coffee and Cocoa Council, said last week that a March rainfall surplus and humid weather should "reassure producers for the development of cocoa pods and the harvest of the main crop." The council has also put measures in place to combat cocoa pod diseases and pests, though some concerns remain about the spread of the cocoa swollen shoot virus in some plantations.

Continued heavy rains and increased disease controls are critical for Ivory Coast to hit a main crop target of 1 million to 1.2 million metric tons and an overall production target of 1.5 million to 1.6 million tons for the season, according to cocoa sector officials. The country recorded around 1.45 million tons for the 2018-2019 season, which ended in September.

While recent rains have lifted hopes for the 2020 main cocoa crop, much now depends on consistent downpours and weather conditions over the coming weeks and months. Winds from the Sahara could still bring patches of hot, dry air, while too much rain also poses risks. Farmers and cooperatives await prosperous rains and a fruitful harvest.
