Ivorian Coffee Exporters Pay Little Attention to World Export Plans, Remains Focused on Grading Large Crop  

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast—While coffee exporters around the world make plans to boost exports in the face of higher prices, exporters in Ivory Coast seem largely unconcerned with the global market dynamics. Instead, exporters in the world's top robusta producer are focused on handling and grading a larger-than-average crop this season.

Ivory Coast is expecting a robusta crop of around 2.2 million bags this season, up from 2 million bags last year. The higher production and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have kept exporters occupied, leaving little time to develop a strategy to take advantage of firmer international prices, multiple exporters said.

"For us, the top priority is to handle the big crop, grade it, and ship it,” said the head of exports at an Abidjan-based exporting company. “The world market situations change all the time, up and down, so we just focus on what we can control—getting the actual coffee out."

Other exporters echoed this sentiment, saying their top focus is ensuring high quality and timely shipments to regular customers, mainly in Europe and Asia. There are concerns that a larger crop may strain resources for some exporters, especially given continued health and safety measures required due to the pandemic.

"A bigger crop always brings challenges, and this year, with COVID, it is more complicated," said the export manager at another major exporter. "Our export target is the same as last year, even with more coffee. We must maintain high standards and cannot sacrifice quality just to export more volume.”  

The lack of concern with global dynamics contrasts with exporters in other origins that are making plans to boost shipments to take advantage of relatively high international prices. Robusta prices have rallied more than 30% this year due to tightening supplies in other major origins and strong demand for coffee used in instant coffee and blends. The firm market conditions are expected to continue in 2022, according to analysts.

However, Ivory Coast's export revenues are less dependent on international prices compared with other origins since the government regulates farmgate and export prices. The government recently raised regulated farmgate prices for the 2021-22 crop to a range of 525 to 625 CFA francs per kilogram, up from 450 to 550 CFA francs last year. Exporters are anticipating the government may also raise the guaranteed export price for robusta, which is currently fixed at 750 CFA francs per kilogram.

"Price movements on the world market are not our main business,” said the head of exports at another exporter. “For us, the most important thing is that the coffee flows smoothly from farmers to exporters to the ports, and then to destinations all over the world. That is our role, to keep the supply chain going."
