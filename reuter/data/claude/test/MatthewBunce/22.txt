Heavy Rains Boost Prospects for Ivory Coast's Cocoa Crop, But More Needed for Record Harvest 

Recent heavy rains in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, have boosted the prospects for this year's main cocoa crop but a record harvest is still unlikely without further precipitation, farmers and analysts said on Monday.
The cocoa season in Ivory Coast runs from October to March, with the bulk of harvesting from January to March. The October-to-December mid-crop represents about 30-40% of the total annual output.
Farmers in the eastern and central regions said rainfall over the past two weeks had helped nurture cocoa pods on trees but more was needed for a strong harvest.  “We need average rains in January and February to ensure a good quality and strong harvest,” said Kouame Kouame, who farms near Daloa, a major cocoa-growing region.

However, some feared excess rainfall could trigger crop disease. "Too much rain can damage the crop and slow the drying of beans," said farmer Beon Diomande.
Ivory Coast's 2018/19 cocoa harvest was a record of over 2 million tonnes. The cocoa regulator, the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), has yet to give a forecast for this season.
The October-to-March rainy season started well, with rainfall above average in many cocoa regions, but rains became scarce from November, raising fears of a production slowdown until the recent improvement.

Analysts said a record cocoa crop in 2019/2020 was unlikely, even with a strong end to the season, due to a lack of investment in aging orchards and limited use of improved planting materials.

"Current conditions point to a smaller mid-crop than last season and slightly below average arrivals over the coming weeks. More rain is still needed to ensure solid main crop harvest from February onwards," said one Accra-based cocoa analyst.
Strong rains in the coming weeks should still help boost crop prospects for Ivory Coast's main cocoa crop, but investment is required in the longer term to bolster yields and secure crop output, farmers and analysts warned.
