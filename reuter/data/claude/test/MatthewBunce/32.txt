Good rains could lead to early and prolonged cocoa harvest in central Ivory Coast, buyers say 

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Good rainfall in most of Ivory Coast’s cocoa-growing regions last week is expected to yield an earlier and larger main crop harvest, especially in the central regions that produce the bulk of beans, farmers, cooperatives, and exporters said on Tuesday.  

Ivory Coast, the world’s largest cocoa producer, is in its dry season from November to February when the next harvesting season starts. Daily rains in January can help boost the number, size, and quality of cocoa pods at the start of the harvesting season.

The upcoming harvest will begin in full swing by April or May, several sources said, about two or three weeks earlier than a standard harvest that usually starts at the end of April and lasts until September. 

"There’s a lot of pods being formed and plenty of flowers we’re seeing. If the rains keep up, the main harvest will be earlier and bigger this season,” said Lucas Kouassi, a farmer who cultivates 6 hectares of cocoa in Soubre, at the heart of the cocoa belt.

The harvest in Soubre and surrounding regions is expected to start in early April, according to cooperatives and exporters. They said seasonal rains spread well across most of central regions last week, providing relief after a period of warmer-than-average weather that threatened prospects for upcoming harvests.

“The flowering looks quite impressive, and with the good rains we’ve gotten this month, we expect a very good crop this season. The early signs we’re seeing point to an early and prolonged harvest in the central regions,” said a Abidjan-based cocoa exporter.

The marketing season for the upcoming 2020/21 main crop officially starts in October, but exporters and cooperatives ramp up purchases from farmers in April when the new harvests start. They said if weather conditions remain favorable, they expect farmers to have significant volumes to sell from April.

Good harvest prospects in Ivory Coast come after Ghana’s Cocobod raised expectations for this year’s main crop harvest and predicted a larger crop size. The two neighboring West African countries that produce more than 60% of the world's cocoa.
