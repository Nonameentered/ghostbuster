Central African Leaders Welcome Mobutu's Decision Not to Seek Reelection

Central African leaders today welcomed the surprise announcement by Zaire's longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko that he will not seek reelection as president after 32 years in power. Mobutu made the announcement on state television last night, saying "the time has come to pass the torch to a new generation." His decision not to run in Zaire's first multi-party presidential elections, scheduled for July, effectively signals the end of his authoritarian rule and opens the door to Zaire's first democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.

The announcement sent shockwaves through the region and was greeted with cautious optimism by leaders and pro-democracy activists who have long sought an end to Mobutu's repressive regime. "This is a pivotal moment for Zaire and its 60 million citizens," said Etienne Tshisekedi, the country's main opposition leader. "For the first time in over three decades, Zairians have hope that real political change is possible." Tshisekedi and other opposition leaders are expected to run in the July elections, which observers say now have a real chance of being free and fair without Mobutu's heavy hand influencing the outcome.   

Mobutu seized power in a 1965 military coup and ruthlessly ruled over Zaire for more than 30 years, turning it into a corrupt and dysfunctional regime while amassing a personal fortune estimated at $5 billion. He outlawed most political opposition and dissent, and survived numerous coup attempts with the backing of Western allies during the Cold War. But that support started drying up in the 1990s, and domestic protests led Mobutu to legalize opposition parties in 1990 and agree to move toward multi-party democracy.

Neighboring leaders expressed relief at Mobutu's announcement and said they hoped it marked the start of a peaceful democratic transition in Zaire. "President Mobutu's decision is a courageous one that puts the future of Zaire and its people first," said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. Leaders of Zambia, Tanzania, and Rwanda echoed that sentiment, saying a stable and prosperous Zaire was in the interest of the entire region. But some expressed worries that a power vacuum after Mobutu's departure could lead to intensified political turmoil and even violence. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Zairian political and military leaders to "come together to ensure peace and stability during this transition."

The U.S. State Department welcomed Mobutu's decision as "an opportunity for Zaire to turn the page to a new era of democratic governance and political openness." Critics argue the U.S. and other Western nations should have pushed harder for Mobutu's ouster years ago, instead of propping him up for so long despite his disastrous rule. But with his autocratic grip finally loosening, most agree that Mobutu's exit can only be good for Zaire's long-suffering citizens and brighten the country's future. The coming months will show whether that optimism is warranted, or if new political troubles emerge from the rubble of Mobutu's failed regime. Only one thing is clear: for Zairians who have lived their entire lives under one ruler, change is coming at last.
