Ivorian Cocoa Arrivals Expected to Approach Record Levels for 1996/97 Main Crop Season

 cocoa arrivals at ports in top producer Ivory Coast are expected to reach near-record levels for the 1996/1997 main crop season, analysts and exporters said. Heavy rainfall which has boosted cocoa yields combined with the country's new pricing system is encouraging farmers to sell more beans. Ivory Coast accounts for around 40% of global cocoa supply.

 Arrivals for October, the first month of the main crop season, are estimated at around 275,000 tonnes, up from 230,000 tonnes last year, according to local exporters. Arrivals for the entire main crop season could reach up to 1.55 million tonnes, just short of the record 1.58 million tonnes achieved in the 1993/1994 season. The main crop season runs from October to March. 

 "Thanks to abundant rainfall, the harvest looks very good and productive. With the new pricing system in place, farmers have more incentive to sell," said Laurent Pipitone, director of the exporters' association GEPEX.

 Under Ivory Coast's new cocoa sector reforms, 60% of the export price is paid directly to farmers, up from 40% previously. The country also scrapped a system where it imposed a fixed farm-gate price and let middlemen pay farmers market rates. The reforms aim to boost quality and motivate farmers to invest in crop maintenance.

 "The reforms have definitely had a positive impact. Farmers feel properly rewarded now and are keen to produce more and sell more," Pipitone said. 

 While the increased supply may weigh on global cocoa prices in the short term, the higher Ivory Coast volumes are a sign of a healthy crop and the impact will depend on demand, analysts said.

 "Widespread rains have created very favourable conditions for the main crop to develop well. The extra supply could pressure prices but demand remains supportive," said Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at Marex Spectron.
