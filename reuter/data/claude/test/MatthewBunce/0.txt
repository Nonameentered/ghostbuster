Chad's fragile economy gets hope of fresh start from new oil revenue

The central African nation of Chad has long struggled with poverty and economic hardship. But new flows of oil revenue are providing an opportunity for greater stability and prosperity. 

Chad became an oil exporter in 2003 with the completion of a pipeline linking oil fields in the south with the port of Kribi in Cameroon. However, much of the subsequent oil revenue was mismanaged or siphoned off by corruption. Little of it translated into government spending on education, healthcare, infrastructure or economic development.

Now a new oil field has come online and, combined with higher global oil prices, Chad's oil revenues have surged. Oil industry analysts estimate Chadâ€™s oil production has jumped 30% this year and will generate an extra $3 billion for the government. Chad's leaders say they have learned lessons from the past and will invest the new money wisely.

"We recognize our historical mistakes and are committed to using this money responsibly to help the whole nation," said Chad's Finance Minister Mariam Mahamat. "Our top priorities are improving living standards, creating jobs, and diversifying our economy beyond oil."

However, Chad ranks very low in global corruption and governance indicators, raising doubts about its capacity to effectively and equitably channel the higher revenues. In 2018, Chad was ranked 165th out of 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

"Chad's leaders have made promises of responsible investment and reform in the past, but we have seen little evidence they have been kept," said Jules Mounouzoumou, coordinator of Chad's Civil Society Coalition, an anti-corruption advocacy group. "Without greater transparency and accountability, much of this new money may also disappear without helping ordinary Chadians."

The World Bank, which stopped lending to Chad in 2008 due to concerns over Chad's management of its oil revenues, is also skeptical. But some observers argue Chad's leaders may feel greater pressure to perform this time. Long-delayed parliamentary elections are scheduled for November, and presidential elections will be held next spring.
