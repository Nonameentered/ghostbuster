Ivory Coast's Cocoa Mid-Crop Expected to Meet Forecasts, But Bean Sizes May Disappoint 

Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast expect the ongoing mid-crop harvest to produce around 700,000 tonnes of beans, in line with forecasts from the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC). However, sources report that bean sizes are smaller than average this season, which could impact the overall crop quality.

The mid-crop harvest began in April and runs through September, representing about 40% of Ivory Coast's total cocoa output. While yields have reached normal levels so far this season, farmers say hot and humid weather caused cherelles - the pods that contain cocoa beans - to be smaller than normal. 

"The harvest has been good so far and we should reach the CCC's target," said Felix Ada, a cocoa farmer in the southern region of Divo. "But the cherelles are not as big as before, so the beans are a bit small. This could affect how much they produce."

Smaller beans are typically less sought after by cocoa buyers and can impact the overall value of the crop. However, international cocoa prices have rallied this year due to concerns over supplies from Ghana, the world's second largest cocoa producer. This could help offset any drop in quality, farmers said.

Ivory Coast produces around 40% of the world's cocoa and its mid-crop harvest, along with the smaller light crop in October-March, are closely monitored by the global cocoa market and chocolate industry. The country continues to struggle with ageing trees, lack of investment, and upholding farmer prices, but the CCC has introduced planting, fertilizer and farmer financing programs to boost long-term productivity.

So far, there are no signs of major disease or pest issues for this season's mid-crop, though some concern remains over the swollen shoot virus in eastern regions.  Overall, farmers expect this mid-crop to match initial forecasts but hope for more favorable weather conditions next season to produce higher bean quality and sizes. The main crop starts in October, and the CCC will issue its first harvest estimate next month.
