Ivory Coast's Power Capacity to Increase by One Third with Eyes on Export Market

The Ivory Coast government announced plans this week to increase the country's power generation capacity by over one third in the next three years. The West African nation aims to build three new gas-fired power plants that will add 700 megawatts of capacity to the national grid. If completed on schedule, this would take Ivory Coast's total power capacity from around 2,000 MW today to 2,700 MW by 2023.

The new power plants are part of Ivory Coast's strategy to boost electricity supply and access for its fast-growing population and economy. Only about half of households in Ivory Coast currently have access to electricity. The additional capacity will help meet increasing domestic demand and support the government's goal of achieving 100% access to electricity by 2025.

But officials also have ambitions beyond Ivory Coast's borders. "We want to make Ivory Coast an energy hub for the sub-region," said Minister of Petroleum, Energy and Renewable Energy Thomas Camara. The surplus power generation could be exported to neighboring countries in West Africa, especially those facing chronic electricity shortages like Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Togo. 

Ivory Coast has become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa over the past decade, with annual GDP growth averaging over 7%. The country has abundant natural gas reserves, which provide feedstock for much of its domestically produced electricity. Developing energy infrastructure and increasing power generation has been a key priority for the government to sustain economic growth.

While the new power plants will run on natural gas, Ivory Coast also wants to increase the share of renewable energy in its generation mix. The government has set a target for 42% of total power capacity to come from renewable sources by 2030, up from just 12% today. Large-scale hydro, solar and biomass projects are all under development alongside the new gas plants.
