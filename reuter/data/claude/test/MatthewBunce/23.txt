Ivory Coast Sees Increase in Coffee Arrivals at Ports, Exporters Expect Strong Crop Despite Low Prices for Farmers  

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast—Coffee arrivals at ports in top grower Ivory Coast have increased sharply in recent weeks, exporters said, signalling the harvest of a strong crop despite rock-bottom international prices that threaten farmer incomes.

Typically, about 70% of Ivory Coast’s annual harvest of robusta beans—the variety used to make instant coffee and added to espresso blends—arrive at ports between April and June, ahead of the rainy season. Volumes so far this year are up about 20% from the same period in 2018. About 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes arrived last month at ports including Abidjan and San Pedro, exporters said, indicating a 2019 crop of at least 1.9 million 60-kg bags based on the harvest-to-port lag time. 

The crop looks set to match 2018’s bumper harvest, the second largest on record, thanks to favourable growing conditions and new plantings coming into maturity, they said. Coffee from Ivory Coast’s October-March harvest marketing season accounts for 40-45% of annual volumes. Still, the higher production and shipments come amid rock-bottom international prices for the commodity, which threatens already meagre incomes for growers in the world’s poorest continent. Robusta futures have dropped nearly 50% since 2016 due to oversupply. “There is more volume than last year but the prices are very low. It’s good for exporting and roasting business but not for the farmers,” said Moussa Keita, managing director of exporter Unico.

Farmer group cooperatives in major growing regions have cut the amount they are paying growers by between 25% to 30% this season compared with last season, Denis Semegni of the Coffee and Cocoa Council said. The situation risks dampening investment and new plantings if sustained, even as Ivory Coast aims to boost coffee output by 50 percent to reach 3.5 million bags by 2025. “The farmer, when the price is not good, he doesn’t invest in the farm. So next year, maybe production will decrease,” warned Laurent Debernard, commercial director of exporter SIFCA.

However, some farmers may opt to hold onto more beans to sell once prices start rebounding, potentially buoying future harvests. International prices are expected to recover gradually due to demand growth and as top producer Vietnam runs low on beans from the 2018-2019 crop. “If the farmer thinks the price in two or three months will be better, he will keep the coffee in his hands,” Debernard said.
