Ivory Coast's Robusta Coffee Exports Increase in March Despite Industry Challenges

Ivory Coast exported 62,000 tons of robusta coffee in March, a nearly 10% increase compared to the same month last year, according to the national coffee-cocoa council. The increased exports are a sign of demand recovery for the cheaper robusta beans used in instant coffee and espresso brands.  

The coffee industry has faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Caf√© and coffee shops around the world were closed for months, reducing demand. However, instant coffee and home brewing rose in popularity as more people stayed home, bolstering the robusta market. Top robusta producers like Ivory Coast also benefited from a strong harvest earlier this year.

Ivory Coast is the world's top robusta producer, accounting for 40% of global supply. Robusta exports make up nearly 10% of the Ivory Coast's total export revenue. The increased March exports brought the total for the first half of the 2020-2021 season to 404,000 tons, a 4% increase year-over-year. The gains come despite a short-term ban on coffee exports in January due to oversupply concerns.

The coffee market is showing signs of recovery, but the economic impacts of the pandemic are still being felt in the industry. Many smallholder farmers struggle with lack of workers, leading to lower harvest rates in some areas. And while robusta futures prices have stabilized, arabica coffee futures remain below average, impacting higher-value coffee crops.

The global coffee market is expected to continue its recovery over the next year as COVID-19 vaccinations increase and economies reopen. But continued challenges are likely in the short term for small producers and exporters in developing countries like Ivory Coast. The national coffee board signaled that additional government support may be needed to support farmers if the health and economic crises persist. Overall, Ivory Coast's March export numbers show the importance of the robusta market in cushioning impacts, even during an unprecedented year of change in the global coffee industry.
