Ivorian Port Cocoa Stocks Expected to Drop in April and May Exports

Cocoa stocks held at ports in top grower Ivory Coast are expected to drop from April to May as the harvest declines and exporters rush to ship beans ahead of the upcoming mid-crop harvest, exporters said on Thursday.

Port arrivals from farmers slowed down this month and exporters estimate stocks have dipped 10-15% from March levels and will continue declining as arrivals tail off and exports remain strong.  

"Up to 75% of our purchases are done already, so the pace of arrivals has really slowed down. We estimate port stocks are down around 15% from the peak," said one exporter.

Exporters said April bean exports are expected to be 220,000 to 230,000 tonnes, up from 208,101 tonnes in March, with the bulk of available beans being exported to meet strong global demand before the mid-crop harvest starts around May.

"We expect most beans to be exported this month and next to free up storage space for the mid-crop, so by June stocks should really tighten up," said another exporter.

Exporters estimated port cocoa stocks at around 680,000 tonnes at the end of March, up from 625,753 tonnes at the end of February. An exact figure for port stocks is difficult to obtain as the regulator does not publish the data.

The spread between the May and July London cocoa futures narrowed by around 8 pounds per tonne on Thursday to around 64 pounds per tonne, indicating tightening supply as the smaller mid-crop harvest approaches.

In its fourth quarterly bulletin, the International Cocoa Organization forecast a small mid-crop harvest in Ivory Coast of 230,000 tonnes from April to September. The mid-crop accounts for around 30-40% of Ivory Coast's annual cocoa output.

The ICCO expects Ivory Coast's total cocoa harvest to increase by 3.6% to 2.2 million tonnes for the current 2021/22 season, driven largely by a bigger main crop harvest from October to March.
