New Cocoa Crop Arrivals Expected To Peak in November and December in Ivory Coast's San Pedro  Port Before Rapidly Tapering Off in the New Year

SAN PEDRO, Ivory Coastâ€”Cocoa bean arrivals at the port of San Pedro in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, are expected to peak in November and December as the harvest in the country's southwest region hits full swing. However, industry experts forecast arrivals to then taper off rapidly in the new year. 

The harvest in Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions typically begins in October and runs through March. However, the peak harvesting months are November and December, especially in the major cocoa-growing regions of Soubre, Guiglo, and Daloa in the southwest. During these months, the majority of cocoa beans are harvested, dried, and delivered to the country's ports for export.

"We expect to see cocoa arrivals at the port increase substantially in November and December compared to previous months as farmers ramp up harvesting activities," said Antoine Donatien, an agricultural commodities analyst based in Abidjan. "The harvest is in full swing in the southwest, and farmers and cooperatives will be delivering beans to sell while prices remain high."

Cocoa futures prices have increased more than 25 percent since the beginning of October due to concerns about dry weather conditions and potential supply shortages. The higher prices are incentivizing farmers to harvest and sell as much of their crop as possible before the end of the year. Industry estimates forecast cocoa arrivals at San Pedro to reach between 350,000 to 400,000 metric tons in November and December, compared to around 200,000 metric tons in October.

However, cocoa arrivals are expected to drop sharply in January and February as the harvest winds down, especially if there is a lack of rain. "Once the peak harvest months have passed, there are fewer cocoa pods left to harvest and not as many beans to deliver to the ports," Donatien said. "Unless there is significant rainfall in January, which is unlikely, we predict cocoa arrivals to rapidly taper off in the new year before picking up again for a smaller mid-crop harvest in April."

The 2020/2021 main crop harvest in Ivory Coast started off slowly in some regions due to dry weather but is now in full gear. The country's cocoa regulator estimates the total harvest could reach up to 600,000 metric tons between October 2020 and March 2021, which would be lower than last season but still exceed the 10-year average. Overall, cocoa traders will be closely monitoring arrivals at Ivorian ports in the coming months for indications about the potential size and quality of this year's main crop harvest.
