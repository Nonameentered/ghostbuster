World Chocolate Industry Group to Discuss Cocoa Quality and Supply with Ivorian Officials and Donors in Washington

Representatives from the world’s major chocolate and cocoa  companies will meet in Washington DC this week with officials from the Ivory Coast and international donors to discuss challenges related to cocoa quality and supply. The World Cocoa Foundation, which represents over 90% of the global chocolate market, has organized the high-level meeting.  

The Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, accounting for about 40% of global supply. However, aging cocoa trees, poor agricultural practices, and lack of farmer resources have strained production and bean quality in recent years. At the same time, demand for chocolate worldwide continues to rise. These supply and demand pressures have chocolate companies increasingly concerned about long-term access to high-quality cocoa beans.

“We want to partner with major donors and the Ivorian government to develop comprehensive solutions to help cocoa farmers boost both the quality and quantity of their crops in a sustainable way,” said Melissa Maldonado, spokesperson for the World Cocoa Foundation. The challenges facing cocoa farmers in Côte d’Ivoire are complex, so we need coordinated action across stakeholders to support better farming practices, prevent deforestation, and help farmers earn a living income.”

The meeting in Washington will aim to align donor funding and private industry programs to maximize impact. Key topics will include farmer training, access to finance, combating climate change, and women’s empowerment. By some estimates, cocoa farmer incomes in the Ivory Coast average only about $2 per day, leaving many families in poverty. This contributes to poor nutrition, health issues, child labor, and other problems in cocoa-growing communities.

“Public-private partnerships are key to building a sustainable cocoa supply chain,” said Ainé Kouadio, advisor to the Ivorian Minister of Agriculture.  “The government of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes the support and investment from chocolate companies and donors to help transform our cocoa sector.” Discussions this week will lay the groundwork for a major donor conference on cocoa sustainability to be held in Abidjan next year.

The outcome of these high-level talks will have significant implications for the future of chocolate. With coordinated action and long-term commitment, there is optimism that cocoa farmers, chocolate companies, donors and governments can work together to ensure a thriving cocoa sector for generations to come. But without meaningful solutions, there are real risks to the world’s chocolate supply.
