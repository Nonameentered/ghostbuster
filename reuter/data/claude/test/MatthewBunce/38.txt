Ivory Coast’s 1996/97 Coffee Crop Predicted to Reach Up to 300,000 Tonnes, But Buyers Express Concerns Over Quality  

The Ivory Coast’s coffee crop for 1996/97 is expected to reach between 275,000 and 300,000 tonnes, driven by favorable weather conditions over recent months. This marks an increase of 15-20% compared to the previous season. While the larger harvest is welcome news for the world’s top robusta producer, some international coffee buyers and traders have expressed concerns over the quality of beans from this season and the potential for oversupply that may depress global prices.  

Analysts noted that growing conditions were not ideal at the start of the season with abundant rainfall. This led to issues around fungal diseases that can affect bean quality. A period of drier weather aided the majority of the harvest, but quality is said to still be variable. Buyers reported a higher number of defects and lower cup quality scores in some samples.

However, others noted there is still underlying demand and major brands may absorb more beans for usein instant coffee blends.

New programs educating farmers aim to improve harvesting and processing techniques.

The Ivory Coast produces almost 40% of the world’s robusta beans, which are primarily used to produce instant coffee blends and as fillers in many mainstream coffee brands. While lack of rainfall had threatened early forecasts, abundant precipitation from April contributed to flowering and cherry development. Farmers reported that cherry growth progressed quickly, leading to the higher volume predictions for the
