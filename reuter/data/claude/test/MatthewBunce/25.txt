Late March Rains Boost Ivorian Mid-Crop Cocoa Harvest Prospects After February Drought  

Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire - Late March rains have improved prospects for Côte d'Ivoire's April to June cocoa mid-crop after a hot and dry February stunted pod development, farmers and buyers said on Monday.

Côte d'Ivoire, the world's top cocoa producer, is in its dry season from December to March when rains are scarce. Rains resumed in late March, bringing relief to cocoa farms and boosting the size and quality of pods for the mid-crop.

"The weather has changed and it is raining well now. The trees have flowers and pods are developing again," said Paul Konan, who farms cocoa near Daloa in the central regions.

After a strong start, Côte d'Ivoire's cocoa mid-crop suffered from hot weather and lack of rain in February. Farmers feared a weaker-than-average mid-crop. But March rains have helped pods regain size and new flowers emerge, raising hopes for a more robust April to June harvest.

"The mid-crop will be good thanks to the return of the rains. For the moment, there is no disease and pods are developing well on the trees," said Salomon Koffi, who farms near thewestern region of Soubre.

Buyers were also optimistic the rains would boost volumes and quality through the end of the mid-crop.

"The harvest should be abundant from this month until May thanks to current climatic conditions," said a cocoa exporter based in Abidjan.

Most farmers said more rain will still be needed in the coming weeks to secure pod development through to harvest. The world cocoa market continues to monitor weather in top producers like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, where dry spells or excess rain can curb harvests and move prices.
