Chad faces cereal shortages amid allegations of mismanagement and skepticism from donors

The central African nation of Chad is facing severe shortages of staple grains and cereals that threaten to undermine food security for millions of citizens. According to the UN World Food Programme, Chad is experiencing a deficit of over 600,000 tonnes of cereal grains, especially millet and sorghum, that make up the bulk of the average Chadian diet.

The shortages come amid allegations of mismanagement of funds and resources meant to support agricultural development in Chad. Donor nations and organizations have expressed frustration with the Chadian government's lack of transparency and failure to enact promised reforms. The European Union, Chad's largest donor, has withheld over $100 million in funding until the government agrees to policy changes to tackle corruption and better support farmers.

"The people of Chad face a dire situation and our humanitarian duty is to help, but we cannot continue to pour money into a system that does not use it properly or work to fix the root causes of problems like food insecurity," said Helga Schmid, Secretary General of the EU External Action Service. The Chadian government insists it is making efforts to diversify its economy away from oil exports, but spiking population growth, lack of agricultural infrastructure, and the impacts of climate change have made progress difficult. 

President Idriss DÃ©by has been in power since 1990 and has faced mounting criticism for authoritarian policies and human rights abuses. About 65 percent of Chad's 15 million citizens live in poverty, and access to healthcare and education remains extremely limited, especially in rural areas where droughts and floods have made farming challenging. The WFP has initiated an emergency operation to distribute food rations, cash, and vouchers to over 500,000 people, but warns that sustained funding and political will are needed to stabilize Chad's chronic food shortages.

The shortages also threaten to exacerbate regional instability, as lack of opportunity and resources could spur more violence and increase migration to neighboring countries. Boko Haram, an extremist group based in Nigeria, has made inroads into Chad and recruited some citizens struggling from poverty and lack of access to public services. Providing Chadians sustainable means of procuring and producing food may help curb the appeal of such groups, experts say.

Donor countries have called for an international conference to discuss ways to improve efficiency of aid programs in Chad and address root causes of the shortages. But they insist that the Chadian government must first show evidence of progress on political and economic reforms before large sums of suspended funding are restored. The coming months will be crucial as the rainy season arrives and farmers prepare land for the next growing season. All sides acknowledge that failing to resolve the disagreements could mean another perilous year of shortage for Chad's people.
