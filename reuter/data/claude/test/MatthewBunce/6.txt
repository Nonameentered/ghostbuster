African Coffee Producers to Meet for Talks on Implementing Export Limit to Boost World Prices

Representatives from major African coffee-producing countries are meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia this week to discuss implementing coordinated export limits in an effort to boost global coffee prices. The African Coffee Association, which represents growers from 11 countries across the continent, wants to curb exports by up to 20% for the upcoming harvest season. By limiting the supply of beans on the global market, the association hopes to increase prices paid to farmers and make coffee farming more economically sustainable.  

Coffee prices around the world have declined in recent years due to oversupply and slumping demand, causing economic hardship for small-scale farmers in Africa and other developing regions. The international coffee market is dominated by huge commercial plantations, especially in Brazil, that can produce beans very cheaply and in high volumes. These massive plantations have added to the oversupply problem, saturating global markets and driving down prices. The average price of coffee beans has fallen by more than 60% since 2011, according to the International Coffee Organization.

The export limits proposed by the African Coffee Association would be voluntary, but the group is optimistic that the major producing countries, including Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya, will adhere to the limits and find economic benefit. "By working together in unity, African coffee farmers can gain more control and more value from their product," said David Kamau, chairman of the association, in his opening remarks at the meeting. However, some analysts are skeptical that the limits will have the desired effect unless adopted more broadly. "Export limits from Africa alone likely won't have a huge impact," said Carlos Mera, an agricultural commodities analyst with Rabobank. "You really need cooperation from producers in South America, especially Brazil, to meaningfully reduce supplies and boost prices over the long run."

The meeting of the association is set to continue over the next three days. Members will also discuss other strategies for supporting coffee farmers, including increased crop diversification, access to credit and financing, and strengthening domestic coffee markets across Africa. The association plans to issue a set of recommendations and policy guidelines at the conclusion of the talks later this week.
