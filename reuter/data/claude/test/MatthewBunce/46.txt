Ivory Coast's Mid-Crop Cocoa Arrivals May Disappoint After Sharp Drop in Weekly Arrivals, Says Report 

Cocoa arrivals in top grower Ivory Coast's mid-crop harvest are likely to disappoint this season due to below-average weekly volumes between January and March, according to a report seen by Reuters.

Arrivals of beans during the first quarter declined by a sharp 15-20% from the 2018/19 season to 253,000-264,000 tonnes, the report by an average analyst group said, citing data compiled by government data.

The drop in mid-crop arrivals could see Ivory Coast's total harvest for the 2019/20 season come in at between 2.05 million and 2.1 million tonnes, below most forecasts of around 2.15 million tonnes, the report said. Weaker arrivals have been partly driven by hot, dry weather in some western parts of the country's cocoa belt.

In contrast to the mid-crop, Ivory Coast's main crop harvest is still on track to hit around 1.3-1.4 million tonnes, in line with most forecasts. Total 2018/19 harvest deliveries reached 2.2 million tonnes, according to government data, and the mid-crop brought in 489,000 tonnes.

"Intermittent drier and hotter weather led to a slower start and lower volumes during (the mid-crop)," the report said. "While rains have picked up recently, the shortfall in January-March will be hard to make up."

Bean quality during the mid-crop has so far been good despite drier weather, the report added. The government will issue its forecast for the season in April which should confirm estimates.

Farmers across Ivory Coast sold 1.5 million tonnes of beans during the first seven months of the season, which runs from October to March, data from marketing board CCC showed earlier this month. The country's CCC and industry bodies are scheduled to release the latest arrivals figures for January-March by early April.
