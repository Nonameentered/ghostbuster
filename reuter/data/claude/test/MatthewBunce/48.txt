Ivory Coast Aims to Reach 500,000 Tonnes of Cocoa Processing Capacity by 2020

The government of Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, has announced an ambitious plan to ramp up its cocoa processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes per year by 2020. The major expansion of domestic cocoa processing aims to boost value addition and exports of higher value cocoa products like cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate.

Ivory Coast currently accounts for about 40% of global cocoa production but most of its crop is exported as raw beans. The country processes only about 36% of its annual cocoa harvest of around 2 million tonnes. Government officials say increasing domestic processing to 500,000 tonnes could generate up to 150,000 additional jobs in the cocoa industry and raise the country's global market share of processed cocoa products to 20-25% from around 15% currently.

The plan involves providing incentives for multinational firms to set up more cocoa processing units in Ivory Coast. The government will provide subsidized land and tax breaks for new investments in cocoa processing equipment and factories. The initiative aims to attract major chocolate and cocoa product makers to source more intermediate cocoa products from Ivory Coast rather than from cocoa processors in the Netherlands, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Some analysts, however, caution that expanding processing too quickly could lead to overcapacity if global demand for chocolate and cocoa products slows. They note that cocoa grinding capacity has outpaced growth in global cocoa product demand over the last decade, leading to periods of oversupply and price volatility. There are also concerns that increased domestic processing may reduce export revenue from raw beans in the short term before processed product exports ramp up.

Ivory Coast's new cocoa-processing push comes amid efforts to combat child labor and improve farmers' livelihoods in the cocoa sector. The Ivorian government has pledged to fully eradicate the worst forms of child labor from the cocoa farms and set higher prices for farmers to address chronic poverty. Some experts argue that developing cocoa processing will be key to achieving a sustainable cocoa economy that lifts more Ivorian farmers out of poverty. But others say child labor and low farmer incomes must first be addressed before leveraging cocoa processing to drive broader economic growth.
