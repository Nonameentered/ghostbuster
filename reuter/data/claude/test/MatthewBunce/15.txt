Angola's Coffee Industry Aims to Increase Short-Term Output Tenfold Despite Land Mine Obstacles

The coffee industry in Angola is aiming for a massive increase in production over the next few years despite significant challenges, including areas that still contain land mines from decades of civil war. The government's goal is to increase coffee output from the current level of 60,000 bags (60 kilograms each) to 600,000 bags within five years. 

Angola was once a major coffee exporter, producing over 1 million bags annually in the early 1970s. However, production dropped sharply due to the 27-year civil war that ended in 2002 and displaced over 1 million people. During the war, many coffee farms were abandoned and are now overgrown. According to the Angolan Coffee Association, there are currently only about 550 square miles of productive coffee farms in the country, compared to over 3,000 square miles before the civil war.

Reviving the coffee sector is a priority for the Angolan government as part of a broader strategy to diversify its oil-dependent economy. Oil accounts for about two-thirds of Angola's GDP and 95% of its exports. By increasing coffee and other agricultural production, the government aims to create new jobs, especially in rural areas, and make the economy more resilient to drops in oil prices.

However, ramping up coffee output will be challenging due to lack of infrastructure, difficulty in accessing farming equipment and fertilizers, and limited technical knowledge among farmers. Many farms also contain land mines that were planted during the civil war, making expansion of farming area dangerous. The government's demining agency has cleared 550 square miles of mines so far but estimates that another 3,000 square miles may still need to be demined.

Despite these obstacles, coffee industry leaders are optimistic that partnerships with foreign companies and nonprofits, as well as targeted investments in agricultural infrastructure, will help achieve growth targets. "We have the land, the climate, and the human capacity to regain our status as a world-class coffee producer," said Jose Costa, head of the Angolan Coffee Association. "With the support of partners who believe in our potential, we can bring hundreds of thousands out of poverty and build a dynamic coffee sector for the benefit of all Angolans."
