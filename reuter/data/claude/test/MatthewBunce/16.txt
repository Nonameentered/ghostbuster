Rains in Ivory Coast's Cocoa Belt Calm Crop Analysts' Concerns of Tree Damage

Abidjan, Ivory Coast—Recent heavy rains in western Ivory Coast, the heart of the nation's cocoa belt, have alleviated analysts' fears of significant damage to trees from last week's hot and dry weather. showers over the weekend totaled 25 to 40 millimeters in the key growing regions, according to local observers, helping nourish the young cocoa pods that are now developing.  

Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for roughly 40% of global supply. Any significant weather impacts can influence world cocoa prices as markets worry about shortages. Last week, hot temperatures in the southwest cocoa regions, including Soubre and San Pedro, sparked fears that drought stress could hurt cocoa trees if the heat persisted for long. However, the weekend rains have mitigated those concerns for now, analysts said.

"The rains were a relief," said Francis Alfred, who owns a 10-hectare cocoa farm outside Soubre. "The heat was very strong and the leaves were drooping. Now the trees look revived." He expects his yield this season to still be strong if normal weather patterns return. Moderate dry spells interspersed with frequent rains are ideal weather conditions for Ivory Coast's cocoa crop to develop.

Not all growing areas saw helpful rains, however. Some western regions from Man to Biankouma received little to no precipitation over the weekend, according to chief cocoa farmer Raphael Kouame. "It's still worrying if this continues," he said. "The soil is dry and the trees need more water." If hot and dry weather returns, especially for a prolonged period in the coming weeks, it could threaten cocoa yields for the October-to-February mid-crop harvest, analysts say.
The mid-crop harvest usually accounts for 30% to 40% of Ivory Coast's annual cocoa output. 

Ivory Coast's overall cocoa crop for the 2020-2021 season was projected to reach around 2.2 million tons prior to the recent hot spell, according to the state-run Coffee and Cocoa Council. That would make it the second-largest on record. In a monthly report last week, commodities trader Olam International said its field observations showed cocoa trees remained "in a healthy state with an abundant supply of leaves and growing fruits" in the lead-up to the mid-crop harvest.

While it's too early to determine any impact on cocoa yields, researchers at the University of Abobo-Adjamé urged farmers to follow recommended best practices to support their trees during drier periods. These include clearing weeds around the base of trees, mulching to retain soil moisture, and limited pruning of small branches to reduce water loss.

"If properly cared for, cocoa trees can withstand short periods of drought," said Augustin Kouakou, a crop scientist at the university. "Proper maintenance and monitoring will be key until the rains pick up again."

Farmers across the southwest cocoa belt echoed those sentiments. "The rains came just in time," Alfred said. "Now we hope the rest of the season sees the right mix of rain and sun to have a good harvest." With the peak of the rainy season still to come, producers remain optimistic the showers will return to nourish cocoa farms in the coming months.
