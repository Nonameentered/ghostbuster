Wilt disease and east revolt hamper Zaire's coffee industry 

The coffee industry in Zaire, Africa's third largest producer, is facing significant challenges this harvest season. A fungal disease known as coffee wilt disease has impacted over 50% of coffee trees in parts of the country, leading to smaller yields and lower quality beans. At the same time, a long-running conflict in the eastern region of North Kivu has made coffee farming difficult and dangerous.

Zaire typically produces over 1 million 60-kilogram bags of coffee annually, most of which is the higher-quality arabica variety that grows well in the country's volcanic soil and tropical climate. However, coffee wilt disease has spread rapidly, especially at higher elevations. The disease causes coffee tree leaves to drop prematurely, damaging the trees and resulting in fewer coffee cherries. Although fungicides can help limit the damage, many of Zaire's smallholder coffee farmers cannot afford the treatments. Government officials expect at least a 30% drop in coffee production this year due to the disease.  

In addition to the disease, ongoing conflict in North Kivu province in eastern Zaire has disrupted the coffee harvest. Rebels and government forces have been fighting in the mineral-rich region for years, and the violence has displaced over a million people. Rebel groups frequently loot and destroy coffee crops, and they also extort illegal "taxes" from coffee farmers. Many farmers have abandoned their coffee farms altogether due to safety concerns and lack of funds to continue operations.

The double impact of disease and conflict has sent global coffee prices upward on concerns over tightening Zairian supply. Some industry experts worry that coffee wilt disease could spread to neighboring countries like Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi if not properly contained. The violence in North Kivu also poses a broader threat to stability in central Africa.

Zaire's government and international organizations are working to curb the spread of coffee wilt disease through farmer education programs, distribution of fungicides, and development of disease-resistant coffee varieties. A peacekeeping force has deployed to North Kivu to protect civilians and support humanitarian groups in the region. However, progress has been slow, and the coming years will likely continue to be difficult for Zaire's embattled coffee farmers.
