Sino-French group proposes new cocoa factory in Ivory Coast to supply Chinese chocolate makers  

A consortium of Chinese and French companies announced plans to build a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, to supply chocolate makers in China. The $150 million factory will be located in Abidjan, the country's main port city, and will have an annual processing capacity of 50,000 tonnes of cocoa beans.

The group of investors is led by Chinese agribusiness COFCO and French chocolate maker Cémoi. They aim to tap into fast-growing demand for chocolate in China, where cocoa consumption has more than tripled over the past decade. China overtook Germany last year to become the world's third largest chocolate market, after the US and UK. However, the country relies heavily on cocoa bean imports and processed ingredients due to a lack of processing capacity domestically.   

The Ivorian factory will allow the group to process cocoa locally before exporting processed cocoa liquor, butter and powder to chocolate makers in China. “This new investment reflects China's growing appetite for high-quality chocolate and cocoa ingredients,” said Tao Laiyuan, chairman of COFCO's chocolate division. “By locating processing facilities closer to the source of raw materials, we can ensure a sustainable and traceable supply chain.”

Ivory Coast produces around 40% of the world's cocoa but exports nearly all of its crop as raw beans. The government has sought to move the country up the cocoa value chain by encouraging foreign investment in local processing facilities. “This factory is a strong signal of confidence in Ivory Coast's efforts to develop its cocoa processing industry,” said Ivory Coast's trade minister Bakayoko Dabre.   

COFCO and Cémoi will own a 60% and 40% stake respectively in the Ivorian joint venture. COFCO is China's largest agricultural trader and food processor, while Cémoi is a mid-sized chocolate maker based in southern France. Both companies hope to strengthen their position in the global cocoa supply chain through the partnership.

The new factory is due to start operations in 2023, in time to meet rising demand for chocolate during China's key gifting periods around Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. The additional processing capacity in Ivory Coast would also provide more opportunities for local farmers to earn extra income in the long run. Industry analysts say the project could spur other chocolate makers to invest in cocoa processing in major growing countries.
