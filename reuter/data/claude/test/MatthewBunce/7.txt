Ivorian Cocoa Midcrop Development Threatened by Dry Weather, but Strong Harvests Still Expected

Cocoa farmers in the Ivory Coast are concerned that the dry weather this month could hamper the midcrop harvest, though analysts still expect a strong overall season. The midcrop harvest, which runs from April to September, typically accounts for 30-40% of the total annual harvest.

The rainy season in the Ivory Coast started later this year and has seen below-average rainfall so far in April, raising fears that the dryness could slow the growth of cocoa pods that will be harvested from May onwards. Some farmers reported that black pod disease has been spreading in the drier conditions, which could damage cocoa pods before harvest. 

However, soil moisture levels remain adequate in most of the key growing regions thanks to heavy rains from February to March. Farmers and exporters expect the rains to pick up again in May and continue through the peak midcrop harvesting months of July and August. The prospects for the overall 2019/20 season remain positive, with a crop projected at 2.2 million tonnes or higher, according to industry sources.

“The harvest for May and June may be slightly impacted if the dryness continues, but we expect only limited effects on the total midcrop,” said a representative of the Coffee and Cocoa Bourse in Abidjan, the country's main cocoa port. Exporters point to healthy soil moisture levels in most areas and do not anticipate major disruptions to cocoa transport or port activities.

The Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. Cocoa prices have been rangebound for the past month, as the potential impact of the dry weather is offset by an ongoing supply surplus in the global cocoa market. Prices remain over 15% higher than a year ago, however, due to a supply deficit in the 2018/19 season.

Continued monitoring of weather conditions and crop progress over the coming months will be key to determining the scale of the midcrop harvest and its impact on the overall season. Farmers and cooperatives are optimistic that typical rainfall will return soon to support the peak periods of pod growth and harvesting. A strong rebound in yields could still propel this season's total output to around 2.25 million tonnes, in line with the record levels seen last season. Overall, Ivory Coast cocoa production remains in a healthy state, despite some weather concerns, boding well for crop prospects into 2020.
