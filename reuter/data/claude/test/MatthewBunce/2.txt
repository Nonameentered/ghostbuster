Ivory Coast Plans to Discuss Reform of Cocoa Industry in May, Following Review by Industry, Donors, and Delegates  

The government of Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, announced plans to hold a conference in May to discuss reforming the country's cocoa industry. The conference follows a joint review of the sector by industry representatives, international donors, and government delegates in March. 

The review found that Ivory Coast's cocoa sector faces significant challenges, including aging trees, lack of investment, and poverty among farmers. The country produces about 40% of the world's cocoa but farmers earn a small fraction of the final price of chocolate. The review concluded that sweeping reforms and policy changes are needed to ensure the sustainability of Ivory Coast's cocoa industry, which makes up about 15% of the country's economy.

"The cocoa tree is in danger in Ivory Coast," said Ivory Coast's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani. "The fields are getting old and we are not replenishing them. If we do not take action now, in 20 years we risk not having any more cocoa."  Representatives from major chocolate companies like Mars, Mondelez, and Olam attended the review and expressed support for reforms.

Key proposals under discussion include providing high-yield hybrid cocoa tree varieties to replenish aging farms, raising the price paid to farmers, and ending the black market for cocoa by improving monitoring across the supply chain. The Ivorian government also plans to increase its spending on cocoa farming, including investments in new technology, research, and fertilizer subsidies for farmers.

Some analysts, however, question whether the political will exists to reform a sector that benefits many vested interests. "The proposals all look good on paper but will be difficult to implement," said cocoa industry analyst Franck Ouedraogo. "Powerful people are profiting from the current system, so change will be slow."

The upcoming May conference will bring together government officials, cocoa farmers, chocolate companies, and donors including the World Bank and UN Development Programme. The goal is to gain consensus on policy reforms and investments needed to ensure Ivory Coast remains the world's leading cocoa producer for decades to come. Overall, most participants expressed hope that concrete actions will result from the review process. But only time will tell if real changes are in store for Ivory Coast's cocoa sector.
