Ivory Coast Destroying Cocoa Farms in Protected Forests to Combat Illegality, but Impact on Output Expected to be Minimal say Officials and Analysts  

The government of Ivory Coast has launched an initiative to destroy thousands of hectares of cocoa farms located in protected forests in an effort to combat illegal farming and deforestation. However, officials say the impact on the country’s cocoa output and exports is expected to be minimal.

Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. Demand for cocoa has been surging in recent years  due to growing chocolate consumption in emerging markets. This has led some farmers to illegally plant new cocoa farms in protected forests, contributing to rapid deforestation.

Last month, Ivory Coast launched “Operation Kroomanko” to reestablish the country’s forest cover. The initiative involves the forced removal and destruction of cocoa farms located in the Mont Peko, Scio, and Cavally classified forests in the western part of the country. The government aims to destroy over 38,000 hectares of illegal cocoa plantations in these areas.

“We must protect our forests for future generations,” said Ivory Coast Minister of Water and Forests Alain-Richard Donwahi. “No illegal activity will be tolerated. We will remove any illegal cocoa farms and replant native tree species.”

According to the Ivorian Cocoa Board, only about 5-10% of the country’s total cocoa supply comes from illegal farms located in protected forests. Most cocoa is grown legally on smallholder farms located outside protected areas. As such, officials expect minimal impact on total output from the destruction of illegal farms. The country produced over 2 million tonnes of cocoa in the 2018-2019 season, and officials forecast similar volumes for the coming years despite the removal initiative.  

“The majority of Ivorian cocoa comes from legally cultivated smallholder farms, so the destruction of illegal farms should not significantly impact our production,” said Cocoa Board Director Massandje Touré.  “We have strong demand and healthy cocoa farms outside forest areas, so we expect solid harvests to continue.”

Some cocoa industry analysts agree the impact should be marginal, especially as cocoa demand remains strong globally. However, there are concerns about the livelihoods of affected cocoa farmers, many of whom have few alternative sources of income. The government has pledged to provide assistance to help farmers transition to other crops and sustainable livelihoods.

The initiative to combat deforestation by destroying illegal cocoa farms is supported by major chocolate companies, who face increasing pressure from consumers and governments to ensure sustainable and ethical sourcing of cocoa. Protecting Ivory Coast’s forests is seen as critical to mitigating climate change in a country that has already lost over 80% of its forest cover since 1960.
