International Action Needed to Combat Stowaway Deaths on Cargo Ships Leaving West Africa  

A rise in stowaway deaths on cargo ships departing West African ports has alarmed human rights groups and highlighted the desperate measures migrants will take to reach Europe. At least 18 stowaways have reportedly died while attempting clandestine voyages to Europe, often by hiding in cargo containers or scaling ship infrastructure. The deaths are believed to have primarily occured on ships leaving from ports in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. 

Human rights organizations are calling on governments, shipping companies, and port authorities in West Africa and Europe to take coordinated action to prevent stowaways from boarding ships and to improve detection and rescue of those who do make it aboard. “These tragic and entirely preventable deaths highlight the failure of authorities and the shipping industry to adequately protect migrants and provide safe channels for migration,” said Amnesty International in a statement.

Stowaways who manage to embark face perilous conditions with limited access to food, water, fresh air or medical care. Many die from asphyxiation, dehydration or hypothermia. Their bodies often go undiscovered for days until cargo is unloaded at European ports. Shipping industry experts estimate for every stowaway death, there are likely 2-3 stowaways who survive the journey in similarly dangerous circumstances.

In response to the deaths, a coalition of more than 50 humanitarian groups have called on governments and the United Nations International Maritime Organization to take action. Their recommendations include improving security at ports to limit access to ships, regular inspections of cargo facilities, mandatory reporting by ships’ captains of stowaway sightings or deaths, and the creation of search and rescue processes specifically for stowaways at sea.

Some policy experts argue that enhanced port security alone will not deter migrants and that governments should provide additional legal pathways for migration and refugee settlement. “While improved security and reporting practices are needed, the international community must also recognize that migrants desperately attempting these dangerous crossings often have no better choice,” said Mark Akpan, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute Africa. “If we don't create more opportunities for safe and legal migration, the human toll will only continue to rise.”

In the absence of coordinated political action, some shipping companies and ports have taken measures on their own, including additional guard patrols, widespread use of motion-detection technologies, temporary suspension of cargo loading in high-risk areas, and stowaway search training for crew members. But human rights advocates argue voluntary actions by private companies are not enough and are calling for binding, enforceable commitments by governments and international bodies. With migrant flows from West Africa to Europe showing no signs of slowing, all parties must work urgently together before more lives are lost at sea.
