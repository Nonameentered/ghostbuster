Ivory Coast Coffee Production Expected to Exceed Last Year's Totals Despite Quality Concerns 

Coffee production in Ivory Coast, the world's top producer of robusta beans, is expected to reach up to 550,000 tons in the 2020/21 season,  according to the Ivory Coast Coffee and Cocoa Council. This would mark an increase of up to 13% from last year's production levels. The increased yields come despite ongoing concerns about the quality of Ivorian beans, which are seen as inferior to milder arabica beans that dominate specialty coffees.

Robusta beans, which contain more caffeine than arabica beans, are primarily used to produce instant coffee and blends. Ivory Coast accounts for 40% of global robusta production but has faced persistent quality issues. Farmers struggle with plant disease, lack of financing to invest in new trees, and poor harvesting and processing practices which can lead to defects and spoilage. These challenges have made buyers wary of Ivorian beans.

To address quality concerns and improve sustainability, the Coffee and Cocoa Council has set aside $89 million to renovate orchards, distribute higher-yield seedlings, and provide farmers agricultural training. The initiative aims to renew 10% of Ivory Coast's coffee orchards each year. "With time and investment, we can produce robusta beans that match international standards and allow our farmers to earn a higher price," said Council spokesperson Awa Toure.

Despite ambitions to improve, this season's crop is still likely to contain a high portion of lower-grade beans. Buyers say they will have to continue aggressive sorting and blending to mask defects. "Ivorian coffee will still need work to become a sought-after origin," said Paul Stevens, a coffee trader based in London. "But with the Council's support, farmers are making progress in learning new techniques and building better cooperative structures. This gives us hope for better crops in coming years, even if this year's harvest is mixed." 

The 2020/21 crop is now being harvested and will be shipped to buyers over the next several months. While increased supply may put some downward pressure on already-low robusta prices, the Council hopes continued reforms will, over time, allow Ivorian farmers to capture a larger share of the international market and boost the country's coffee sector. Overall, coffee accounts for 7-10% of Ivory Coast's export revenue.
