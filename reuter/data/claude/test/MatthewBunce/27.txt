Gold Output from Ivory Coast's SOMIAF Mine Set to Double and Could Rise Further with Sulphide Deposits 

The Société Minière d'Afrique de l'Ouest (SOMIAF) gold mine in Ivory Coast is set to double its annual gold production over the next three years as a $500 million expansion project is completed. Once the expansion is finished, SOMIAF expects to produce 300,000 ounces of gold per year from 2022, up from 150,000 ounces in 2019. Further growth could be achieved if SOMIAF is able to successfully extract gold from sulphide deposits underneath its current open pit operations.

SOMIAF has been mining gold in Ivory Coast since 1992 and has produced over 3.5 million ounces of gold in its lifetime. The mine is located 250 kilometers west of the commercial capital Abidjan and consists of two open pits along with a carbon-in-leach processing plant. The expansion project will see the development of a third open pit called Bakatouo that contains proven and probable gold reserves of 2.1 million ounces. Bakatouo should start delivering ore to the processing plant by early 2021 according to the company.

In addition to the expansion of open pit mining, SOMIAF is conducting studies on the potential to mine gold from sulphide deposits that exist below the current and planned open pits. Sulphide deposits refer to mineralized rocks containing sulphide minerals that often contain higher concentrations of gold than the oxide deposits currently being mined. If sulphide extraction proves viable, gold production at SOMIAF could increase well beyond 300,000 ounces per year. Many gold mines have boosted production by transitioning from oxide to sulphide ores once open pit operations exhaust oxide deposits.

Ivory Coast has seen its gold output rise in recent years thanks to projects like SOMIAF's expansion and aims to produce over 1 million ounces of gold per year to rival neighboring Ghana, the continent's second largest gold producer. SOMIAF is majority-owned by subsidiaries of Russian company Nordgold, one of the world's top 10 gold producers. Nordgold has operated the mine since 2011 and has invested heavily in an optimization plan to cut costs and fund new growth projects like the Bakatouo pit.

Continued investment in the SOMIAF mine and additional exploration are expected to help Ivory Coast achieve its goal of becoming a gold mining hub in West Africa over the next decade. With gold prices rallying to multi-year highs this year and strong demand from central banks, SOMIAF and its owners are well-positioned to benefit from its plan to boost output and uncover new reserves at the mine.
