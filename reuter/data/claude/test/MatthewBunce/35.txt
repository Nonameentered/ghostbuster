Ivory Coast in Talks with Donors Over Cocoa and Coffee Sector Reform to Qualify for Loan  

The Ivory Coast government is currently in negotiations with international donors including the World Bank and IMF over reforms to its cocoa and coffee sectors. The reforms aim to increase transparency, strengthen farmer cooperatives, and clamp down on child laborâ€”issues that donors insist on to provide a $1.2 billion budget-support loan the government has requested.

The Ivory Coast economy depends heavily on cocoa and coffee exports, which provide income for millions of farmers in the West African country. However, the sectors have been plagued by corruption, mismanagement, and human rights issues in recent years. Government officials hope the proposed reforms will address these long-standing problems and unlock critical donor funds amid an economic downturn due to the pandemic.  

The key reforms on the table include a digital registration system to improve traceability and combat cocoa smuggling, stricter enforcement of laws prohibiting child labor, empowering farmer cooperatives, and increasing the government's role in setting cocoa prices. The government is negotiating to phase in the reforms over the next 3 to 5 years to give farmers and exporters time to adapt.

Donors have urged an accelerated timetable but indicated they are open to compromise to support the country's economic recovery. "The reform agenda is challenging but achievable if all parties remain committed to positive change," said the World Bank's country director for the Ivory Coast. The IMF and others echoed support for reforms tied to greater accountability and transparency.

Meanwhile, farmer groups are demanding a stronger voice in negotiations and policymaking. "Reforms cannot succeed without us," said the president of the National Federation of Coffee and Cocoa Farmers. Critics argue past reform efforts failed due to insufficient consultation with farmers and cooperatives.

The talks are expected to continue over the coming weeks. Government and donor officials remain hopeful a deal can be struck to unlock funds and spur progress on cocoa and coffee sector reform, but challenges remain in balancing diverse interests. Successful reform could boost farmer incomes and tax revenue for the government's budget over time. Failure risks prolonging difficulties in two of the country's most important economic sectors.
