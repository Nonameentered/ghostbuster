Cocoa Warehouses in Ivory Coast Remain Full as Coffee Exporters Struggle for Space 

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast—Cocoa warehouses in the world's top cocoa producer Ivory Coast remain near capacity, filled with beans from a record harvest. At the same time, coffee exporters in the country are struggling to find warehouse space for their beans as harvesting for the season comes to an end.

Ivory Coast produced a cocoa harvest of over 2 million tonnes for the 2019/2020 season, according to government estimates. The large harvest has cocoa warehouse operators scrambling to handle the volumes, with some estimating their warehouses are 90-95% full. The cocoa marketing board, Le Conseil du Café-Cacao, also said some buying companies have had to temporarily halt purchases as they deal with their near-full storage capacity.

"It's been a mad scramble this season to move and store all the cocoa we've bought," said the manager of a cocoa export company in Abidjan who preferred to remain anonymous. "Some of our warehouses are literally overflowing."

At the same time, coffee exporters in the country have reported difficulties finding storage space for their coffee beans as the harvest season comes to an end. While Ivory Coast's coffee harvest only makes up a small fraction of the world's supply, limited storage infrastructure in the country means coffee exporters must compete with the dominant cocoa sector for limited warehouse availability.

"As long as cocoa remains Ivory Coast's primary export, coffee farmers and exporters will struggle with a lack of resources and infrastructure to properly handle and store their beans," said Jonas Ngui, an agricultural analyst based in Abidjan. 

The government has announced plans to expand cocoa warehouse capacity by 15% over the next two years to handle growing production. However, no expansion plans have been announced for other commodities like coffee, leaving exporters worried their beans may face quality issues without improved storage access. Overall, Ivory Coast's booming cocoa sector continues to present challenges for the nation's smaller agricultural industries.
