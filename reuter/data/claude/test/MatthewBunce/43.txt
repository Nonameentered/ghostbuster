CEMOI to Build New Cocoa Processing Factory in Ivory Coast 

The French chocolate maker CEMOI announced plans to build a new cocoa processing factory in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The $150 million factory will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 tons of cocoa beans per year into cocoa liquor, cocoa powder, and cocoa butter. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, accounting for approximately 40% of global cocoa production.

CEMOI currently operates two smaller cocoa processing facilities in Ivory Coast with a combined capacity of 70,000 tons per year. The new factory will allow CEMOI to increase its presence in the region and better access high-quality Ivorian cocoa beans. The factory is expected to open in 2023 and will employ over 500 workers.

The new CEMOI factory highlights the growing demand for chocolate and cocoa products worldwide. Global chocolate confectionery sales grew 5.5% in 2020 to top $140 billion, according to market research firm Mintel. Chocolate companies and cocoa processors have been expanding operations in cocoa-producing regions to gain greater control over their supply chain. By processing the cocoa beans in the country of origin, companies can ensure higher quality and freshness and support the local economy.

However, the rapid growth of cocoa processing in Ivory Coast has led to environmental and social concerns. Deforestation linked to cocoa farming has reduced the country's forest cover by 80% since 1960. Cocoa farming has also been associated with poor labor conditions and child labor violations. CEMOI and other large chocolate companies face sustainability certifications and regulations to prevent deforestation and unethical labor practices in their supply chains.

The Ivorian government welcomed the new CEMOI factory as an opportunity to create jobs and promote economic growth. "This investment by CEMOI in our country's cocoa sector highlights the strong potential for food processing industries in Ivory Coast," said a government spokesperson. With its ideal location, natural resources, and low-cost labor, Ivory Coast aims to become a hub for cocoa processing and chocolate making in West Africa. CEMOI's new factory marks an important step toward achieving this goal.
