Ivory Coast Reviews Three Formal Proposals for New Cocoa Processing Factories 

The government of Ivory Coast is reviewing three proposals from international companies to build new cocoa processing plants in the country, according to a statement from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The proposals are part of the country’s efforts to increase the amount of cocoa that is processed domestically instead of being exported raw.

The three proposals under review are from Olam International, a Singapore-based agribusiness company; Ecom Agroindustrial Corp Ltd, a Swiss-based cocoa and coffee company;  and Cargill, an American privately held global corporation. If approved, the factories would help boost Ivory Coast’s cocoa processing capacity by more than 200,000 tonnes per year, creating hundreds of new jobs in the process.

Ivory Coast is the world’s largest producer of cocoa, growing more than 40 percent of the world’s supply. However, only about a third of the country’s annual crop of 2 million tonnes is processed into cocoa products like chocolate before being exported. The government aims to raise that to 50 percent by the end of 2020. New processing facilities from major cocoa companies are crucial to achieving that goal.

Olam International has proposed a new cocoa processing facility with initial capacity of 60,000 tonnes, increasing to 120,000 tonnes over three years. Ecom Agroindustrial has submitted a plan for a 50,000 tonne per year cocoa processing unit, expanding to 100,000 tonnes within two years. Cargill’s proposal is for an initial 60,000 tonne capacity plant, scaling up to 200,000 tonnes over five years. The factories would produce cocoa liquor, butter, and powder for export to chocolate makers around the world.

The proposals are currently under review by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. They will be evaluated based on the investment pledged, production capacity, job creation, and contribution to government tax revenue. The government expects to approve at least two of the three proposals before the end of this year, with construction of the new facilities beginning in early 2020.
