Ivory Coast's Mid-Crop Cocoa Harvest Expected to Exceed 100,000 Tonnes  

Cocoa farmers and exporters in Ivory Coast expect the upcoming April-to-September mid-crop harvest to yield over 100,000 metric tonnes of beans, surpassing the forecasts from earlier this year. Good weather and new trees coming into production are driving an expected 10% increase in harvest volumes compared to last season.

The world's top cocoa producer is entering the mid-crop season with ideal growing conditions thanks to regular rainfall and a lack of disease impacting the crop. These factors, combined with many new cocoa trees planted in recent years starting to produce their first harvestable pods, point to an abundant mid-crop. "The weather has been very good for the development of cocoa pods and cherelles (young pods) over the past months," said Paul-Harry Aithnard, who heads Ivory Coast's National Agricultural Export Promotion Agency.

Forecasts from the regulator in January expected a mid-crop of 95,000 tonnes, but those estimates are now seen as too conservative. Private exporters and farmers organization anticipate the harvest will surpass 100,000 tonnes by a sizeable margin. A range of 105,000 to 110,000 tonnes is possible if current trends continue, according to industry sources. Any harvest over 105,000 would mark a record for the mid-crop season and continue Ivory Coast's steady growth in cocoa output.

The buoyant harvest is positive news for the Ivorian economy, which relies on cocoa for around 15% of its export earnings. Cocoa futures prices on the Intercontinental Exchange are also up over 25% so far this year, which will boost the revenue potential from the increased harvest if the higher prices extend through the mid-crop season. The prospect of a large harvest is less welcome news for chocolate manufacturers, who are already struggling with the cocoa supply surplus built up over recent years. A cocoa glut often puts downward pressure on global cocoa prices due to oversupply.

The 2020-2021 main crop harvest in Ivory Coast wrapped up in March with a total of around 2 million tonnes of beans, in line with the target set by regulators. Favorable weather and higher production capacity also fueled growth of over 6% in the main crop. The strong start to the season and upbeat mid-crop forecasts point to Ivory Coast's total cocoa harvest potentially surpassing 2.35 million tonnes for the October 2020 to September 2021 season.
