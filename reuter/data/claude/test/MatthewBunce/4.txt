Blind Chadian musician Yegue Badigue builds bridges through music 

Yegue Badigue may be blind, but he has a vision for using music to bring people together and foster understanding across borders. The 38-year-old musician from Chad is pioneering a new genre of music that fuses traditional Chadian sounds with jazz, reggae, and other international influences.

Born in southern Chad, Badigue lost his eyesight as a young child due to glaucoma. But with the encouragement of his music-loving family, he began playing the bol, a traditional Chadian harp, at age 9. "Even though I couldn't see the instrument, I could feel the vibrations of the strings and hear the beautiful sounds it made," he recalls. 

Badigue's talent was clear from an early age, but pursuing a career as a musician seemed challenging given his disability. However, after learning to play other instruments like the flute, saxophone and keyboards, he gained confidence in his abilities. He started composing his own songs, blending Chadian rhythms and instrumentation with more contemporary styles. 

In his early 20s, Badigue moved to Chad's capital city N'Djamena to study music at the National Institute of Chad. There he met other young musicians with a shared interest in fusing Chadian and other African music with international genres. They formed the group Wakato Africa, which incorporated elements of reggae, jazz, and Afrobeat into their sound alongside traditional Chadian influences.

The group gained popularity in Chad, giving Badigue a platform to share his musical vision of cultural fusion and borderless creativity. "Music is a universal language that can bring people together across perceived differences," he says. Wakato Africa toured several other African countries, promoting their message of unity.

In recent years, Badigue has focused on a solo career, releasing two acclaimed albums that further showcase his mix of Chadian and contemporary sounds. His soulful songs touch on themes of love, forgiveness, and overcoming adversity. He continues to perform at music festivals around Africa, often collaborating with international artists on stage.
