Analysts Say C&W's Possible $15bn Bid for Sprint Corp Is Not Feasible in the Short Term  

Cable & Wireless Communications Plc’s rumored $15 billion bid for Sprint Corp, the fourth largest wireless carrier in the U.S., is unlikely to materialize in the near future, according to analysts. C&W, a UK-based telecommunications company, is said to be in the early stages of exploring an acquisition of Sprint to expand into the U.S. wireless market. However, analysts point to several roadblocks that would make such a deal challenging and potentially unfeasible in the short run.  

The first major hurdle is securing financing for the transaction. A $15 billion deal would require C&W, which has a market capitalization of $6.2 billion, to take on significant additional debt. “C&W would have to lever up considerably to fund an acquisition of this size, and that could be risky,” said Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo. The company already has $3.7 billion in net debt on its balance sheet, and its debt levels relative to earnings are higher than most of its European peers. 

Another obstacle is obtaining regulatory approval, which could be difficult given C&W’s limited presence in the U.S. wireless market. The deal would face scrutiny from the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission over competition concerns. “Regulators would likely require meaningful asset divestitures to approve a deal of this size, especially given C&W’s lack of operations in the U.S.,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. C&W may have to divest a large portion of Sprint’s business, raising the question of whether what’s left would still be attractive and valuable.

C&W would also face significant integration challenges if a deal went through. Expanding into an entirely new country and assimilating a company the size of Sprint, which has over 50 million subscribers, would be an enormous undertaking. “The sheer operational complexity of integrating Sprint’s network and customer base into C&W’s systems in a foreign market cannot be understated,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS. “There are so many risks this type of deal could fall apart.”  

While analysts see major stumbling blocks, some don't rule out the possibility of an eventual deal if C&W were able to address key issues over time. C&W's CEO has expressed strong interest in entering the U.S. wireless market, the largest in the world. An acquisition of Sprint could give C&W the scale and resources to compete, even as a discounted "fourth player," and tap into new growth. However, the company would need to boost its balance sheet, work closely with regulators, and ensure it has a detailed integration plan before seriously revisiting a bid. For now though, most analysts say a $15 billion megadeal between the two telecom companies is unlikely in the short run.
