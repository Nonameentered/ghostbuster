BT Threatens Legal Action Against Government Windfall Tax on Profits

BT, the UK's largest telecommunications company, is threatening to take legal action against the government over its plan to impose a one-off windfall tax on the excess profits of major corporations. The Prime Minister yesterday announced a 25% tax on the profits of companies in the energy, telecommunications, and banking sectors that exceed pre-pandemic levels. The government hopes to raise £10 billion from the measure to help fund public services strained by the costs of the COVID-19 crisis.  

BT's chief executive Philip Jansen said the telecoms group would "vigorously oppose" any attempts to impose the windfall tax on its business. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Mr. Jansen argued that BT's profits were not excessive or unintended but the result of significant investments in infrastructure. He warned that the tax could undermine investor confidence in the UK telecoms sector and BT's ability to invest billions in upgrading broadband networks.

BT reported profit before tax of £2 billion in the year to March 2020, a 32% increase from the previous year, sparked by cost-cutting measures and price rises. However, the company's profits remain below pre-pandemic levels and it expects growth to slow this year. The government has identified excess profits as those over 50% higher than the average profits reported between 2017 and 2019. On this measure, BT's profits would not qualify as excessive.

The windfall tax announcement has been welcomed by consumer groups but strongly criticised by businesses. Telecoms industry body techUK warned it would be counterproductive and risks Britain's digital future. However, polling shows the measure is popular with voters and opposition parties have been calling for a steeper windfall tax of up to 33% on some companies.

The government has not yet set out the details of which companies and profits will be subject to the levy. It is understood the tax will apply for two years but could be extended if the economic recovery is slower than hoped. A review in 2022 will determine if any firms have been unfairly disadvantaged. The Prime Minister said those companies that "can afford to contribute a little more" should be expected to do so in the national interest. The government is still in talks with businesses over the details of the policy.

BT and other telecoms firms have benefited from changing consumer habits during the pandemic but argue they are investing heavily to build the connectivity the country needs. The outcome of BT's threatened legal challenge could determine if the government proceeds with its controversial plan to tax corporate Britain's pandemic profits.
