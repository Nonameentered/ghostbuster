Vodafone Group Reports 13.5% Increase in Annual Profits and Plans to Overhaul Distribution Strategy to Drive Growth 

Vodafone Group, the British multinational telecommunications company, announced its full year financial results today, reporting a 13.5% increase in net profits. The company's profits for the year ending March 31, 2021 rose to £2.97 billion, up from £2.61 billion the previous year. Revenue also increased by 3% to £43.2 billion.

Nick Read, Vodafone Group Chief Executive, said "This has been an important year for Vodafone. We delivered a resilient financial performance, gaining commercial momentum through the year, with accelerating customer growth rates and strong demand for data and high-speed broadband services."

The results demonstrate Vodafone's steady turnaround over the past two years under Read's leadership. Read took over as CEO in October 2018 with the company's share price lagging competitors. He embarked on a cost-cutting drive, divesting Vodafone's New Zealand operation, merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular, and spinning off its mobile towers into a separate company.

With costs under better control, Read has shifted focus to positioning Vodafone for future growth. A key part of this strategy is overhauling Vodafone's approach to distribution and customer service. The company will move to a "digital-first" sales and service model, enabling most customer contacts to be handled through digital and online channels. Vodafone will also transition many of its company-owned stores to a franchise model with local owners and operators. 

Read explained the rationale for this move: "Our customers increasingly want to engage with us through digital channels and we expect more of them to choose online self-service and chat over the phone and in-store in the years ahead." The new distribution model will be more cost-efficient while still enabling a personalised customer experience, he said.

Vodafone aims to generate £500 million in cost savings from the digital and distribution changes within two to three years, funds that will be reinvested into improved customer propositions and network quality. Coupled with ongoing investments in 5G and enhanced broadband services, the distribution overhaul is expected to drive stronger customer growth and further share price increases over the next several years.

In response to the earnings announcement and distribution strategy update, Vodafone's share price rose 4.2% in early morning trading. Analysts reacted positively to the results and outlook, praising Read's strategic vision for restoring Vodafone to sustainable growth over the long term.
