BT Threatens Legal Challenge Against Windfall Tax on Profits

Telecoms giant BT has threatened legal action against the UK government over its decision to impose a windfall tax on the excess profits of major companies. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary 25% tax on the profits of oil and gas firms last week to raise money to fund measures to help households with the rising cost of living. However, the tax will also apply to the profits of other companies that have benefited from increased customer spending during the pandemic. 

BT believes the tax is unfair and disproportionate. The company argues that its profits over the last two years were in line with historical levels and it should not face what it calls an "arbitrary" tax. BT chief executive Philip Jansen wrote to Mr. Sunak warning that the company may pursue legal options to challenge the tax. Mr. Jansen claimed BT's profits were not "unexpected or undeserved" and it has invested heavily in infrastructure.

The windfall tax is expected to raise £5 billion to fund a new package of cost-of-living grants for vulnerable households. However, critics argue it could discourage investment from companies that would be hit by the levy. The tax will apply to profits above £100 million at a rate of 25% from January 2022 until December 2025.

Mr. Sunak said: “We should not forget that every single penny of this tax will be used to support British people in need. We are asking more from the largest businesses — precisely so we can give more to the most vulnerable."

Supporters of the windfall tax point out that many large companies have emerged from the pandemic in a strong position while household budgets have been squeezed by rising inflation and higher energy bills. However, business groups have condemned what they see as an “arbitrary” intervention that creates uncertainty. 

The quarrel is the latest sign of tensions between the government and major British companies. BT, in particular, feels it has been repeatedly targeted, facing demands to speed up investment in faster internet connections and restrictions on using technology from Chinese tech giant Huawei.

BT reported pre-tax profits of £2 billion in the year to March, up 18% from the previous year but in line with the two years before the pandemic. Jansen said the company paid more than £500 million in taxes last year but warned the new levy would "undermine investment, threaten jobs and damage the pension funds of our people". The war of words is set to intensify ahead of the tax taking effect at the start of next year.
