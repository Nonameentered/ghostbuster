Telewest Communications Plc Reports Widening Annual Losses and Below-Expected Margins, May Delay National Network Buildout

Telewest Communications Plc, a UK cable operator, reported wider full-year losses and worse-than-expected margins today, raising concerns the company may delay plans to expand its broadband network nationally. 

The company posted a loss of £1.5 billion for 2018, compared with a £207 million loss the previous year. Revenue rose 3% to £2 billion, but margins remained under pressure due to intense competition in the telecom and cable sector. EBITDA margin fell to 32% from 35% last year, missing analyst estimates.

The weak results have cast doubt on Telewest's aim to build a next-generation broadband network reaching over 90% of UK households. The company has pledged to invest £3 billion over five years to upgrade its cable infrastructure, but its precarious financial position and low share price may make financing such a large investment difficult.

Telewest shares fell over 12% in early trading as investors reacted to the news. If the share price remains depressed, Telewest's options for raising equity to fund its network expansion plans will be limited. This could force the company to cut costs in other areas or delay parts of the rollout to stay within budget.

"Telewest faces numerous challenges, including leveraged balance sheet, business model under threat and competitive and regulatory pressures. The company will struggle to find the substantial funds required to achieve its network ambition if the share price does not markedly improve and cost savings cannot be found,” said Kester Mann, an analyst at CCS Insight.

Telewest’s CEO Jonathan James said the company remains committed to its £3 billion network investment program but conceded "the timing may have to be reassessed if market conditions dictate." James pointed to Telewest’s falling revenue and margins as evidence of an "increasingly tough trading environment" with "little respite in sight."

The UK government has put pressure on telecom companies to accelerate the rollout of fast broadband to support the digital economy. Telewest’s network expansion aims for speeds of at least 1 gigabit per second to be available to nearly all UK households. But the company may have trouble delivering on these goals if its financial situation does not improve. Investors hope for stabilizing revenue and margins through the rest of 2019 to put the strategic network investment back on track.
