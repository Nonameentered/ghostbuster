One 2 One denies talks of joining Cable and Wireless Communications 

Mobile network operator One 2 One today denied reports that it is in discussions to be acquired by Cable and Wireless Communications. Shares in One 2 One plunged more than 10% in early trading following a report in the Financial Times that the UK's fourth largest mobile carrier was in advanced talks to be bought by Cable and Wireless for Â£4 billion.

In a statement, One 2 One said the report was "completely without foundation". The company said, "We are not in any discussions to sell the company. Our focus remains on providing innovative and competitive services to our 10 million mobile customers across the UK."

One 2 One launched in 1993 and has grown to become an influential player in the UK mobile market. However, it has struggled recently as larger rivals like Vodafone and O2 have spent heavily on network upgrades and marketing. One 2 One has sought to differentiate itself as a low-cost provider but that strategy has come under increasing pressure. An acquisition by Cable and Wireless, which owns several telecom operators in the Caribbean and Asia Pacific, could provide greater scale and resources for One 2 One to invest in its network and services.

Cable and Wireless's offer, if confirmed, would represent a 20% premium to One 2 One's share price at the close of trading yesterday. But investors appeared unconvinced by One 2 One's denial today and the shares remained down 8% in mid-morning trading. Some analysts said the outright rejection of the report seemed "strange" and "half-hearted" if there were truly no ongoing talks.

The potential deal is a sign of further consolidation in the UK's mobile phone market. Orange was acquired by France Telecom in 2000, and O2 was sold to Spain's Telefonica in 2005. Vodafone remains the largest mobile operator in the UK, with 19 million subscribers, but its share price also fell today amid concerns it may face stiffer competition if Cable and Wireless bought One 2 One.

Any agreement to take over One 2 One would need approval from regulators, who have closely scrutinized previous deals to ensure there is enough competition in the marketplace for consumers. With four major networks still operating in the UK, most experts anticipate regulators would likely allow a tie-up between One 2 One and Cable and Wireless after a review.
