Cable and Wireless Plc to Join Telecoms Alliance Across US, France and Germany in Bid to Expand Global Reach

Cable and Wireless plc, the British multinational telecommunications company, announced today that it will join a strategic alliance with major telecom providers in the US, France, and Germany to expand its services on a global scale. The alliance, called TransGlobal Communications or TGC, will allow Cable and Wireless to utilize the infrastructure and networks of partners like AT&T, Orange S.A., and Deutsche Telekom AG to offer mobile, broadband, and enterprise services to new markets spanning North America, Europe, and beyond. 

The deal underscores the intense competition in the telecommunications industry as companies seek size and scale to conquer new geographical territories. By teaming up with well-established players in foreign markets, Cable and Wireless aims to accelerate its international ambitions without the costs and risks of building networks from scratch or large-scale acquisitions. The company will pay its alliance partners a share of revenues generated from their networks and infrastructure in exchange for access.

"This alliance is a win-win for all parties involved, allowing us to combine our resources and expertise to meet the demands of global customers," said Philip Jansen, Chief Executive of Cable and Wireless. "Cable and Wireless has a long and successful history as a pioneer in telecommunications. This partnership will enable us to deliver innovation at an accelerated pace to customers in new markets, complementing our strengths in the UK, Caribbean, and African regions."

The alliance has been in discussion for 16 months and aims to begin offering joint services within the next 6 months, pending final regulatory approvals. The initial focus will be on expanding Cable and Wireless's enterprise and wholesale offerings to US and European-based multinational companies. The companies will also cross-sell mobile and broadband services to each other's customer bases, enabling new packaged offerings across countries and continents. 

However, the deal is not without risks and challenges. In addition to regulatory issues, the companies have different technological and service platforms that must be integrated to various degrees. There is also the long-term question of how revenues, costs, and customers will be shared across borders. If not balanced properly, such alliances can lead to tensions that cause instability. But Jansen believes the alliance model's flexibility and low barrier to entry ultimately outweighs the risks. With this step, Cable and Wireless signals its determination to realize its global ambitions in the face of an evolving telecom landscape.
