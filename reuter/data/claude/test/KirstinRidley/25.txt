Cable and Wireless Communications debuts on market at £4.5 billion valuation 

Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), the Caribbean telecommunications company, made its debut on the London Stock Exchange today with an initial public offering that values the company at £4.5 billion. Shares in CWC opened at 245 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of £4.46 billion.

The IPO is the largest on the LSE so far this year and shows that investor appetite remains strong for fast-growing telecom companies, even with macroeconomic headwinds. CWC operates mobile and broadband networks across 16 Caribbean countries, providing voice, data, video and content services to over 14 million customers. The company is majority owned by Liberty Global, with the IPO raising over £1 billion to pay down CWC debt and fuel continued expansion.

“We are delighted with the success of our IPO and welcome our new shareholders,” said CWC Chief Executive Officer Barry O’Brien. “The Caribbean remains an underpenetrated market for telecom services and we see significant opportunities for growth. The proceeds from today’s listing will enable us to invest in new networks and services to better connect our customers across the region.”

The Caribbean remains an attractive market for telecoms, with relatively low mobile and broadband penetration compared to developed markets. According to industry estimates, mobile penetration in the Caribbean stands at just 105% currently, well below the 130% average for Latin America. Broadband penetration is even lower at around 50% for the region. CWC believes demand for faster networks, video streaming, social media and other data-intensive services will drive double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future.

Founded in 1985, CWC was acquired by Liberty Global in 2005 for $5.5 billion. Under Liberty Global’s ownership, CWC transitioned from a primarily fixed-line telecom operator to a mobile-led connectivity provider. CWC operates the ‘Flow’ and ‘Btc’ brands and is the market leader in most of the Caribbean countries it serves. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CWC’s revenue was $1.42 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $724 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% and 8% respectively.

The IPO was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Barclays and Morgan Stanley. CWC shares will trade on the standard listing segment of the main market. Analysts on average expect shares to rise to 275 pence over the next 12 months, implying a 15% potential upside if estimates prove correct. The coming year should provide important clues on CWC’s growth trajectory as the company emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic that significantly impacted travel and tourism in the Caribbean.
