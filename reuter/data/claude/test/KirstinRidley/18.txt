British Telecom and MCI Communications Corp. Make Major Move into South America Market  

British Telecom and MCI Communications Corp announced a joint venture today to provide telecommunications services in several South American countries. The new company, called BT Latam, will offer mobile, broadband, and landline services in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. This marks a major expansion for both companies into emerging markets in South America.

BT Group, the parent company of British Telecom, will hold a 60% stake in the new company. MCI, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, will hold the remaining 40%. The total initial investment in BT Latam is expected to be $2 billion USD. 

"This is an exciting opportunity to enter some very fast-growing telecom markets in South America," said Gavin Patterson, CEO of BT Group. "By combining British Telecom's experience in telecommunications with MCI's expertise in South America, BT Latam will be in a strong position to succeed."

BT Latam's services will include 4G mobile networks, fiber broadband, and traditional copper landlines. The company plans to invest heavily in infrastructure, including laying thousands of miles of fiber optic cables across the four countries. The goal is to provide fast, reliable internet and mobile access to both businesses and consumers.

The telecommunications sectors in Brazil, Argentina and Chile have seen double-digit growth over the past decade. However, many rural and low-income areas still lack basic access. BT Latam aims to tap into this underserved market by offering affordable mobile and broadband options. The company will also target large corporations, financial institutions, and other major clients with custom communications solutions.  

Some analysts warn the move comes with risks due to political and economic instability in the region. But others argue the growing youth population and rising middle class in these countries make the long-term opportunities attractive. MoffettNathanson Research estimates the venture could add over $1 billion in incremental revenue for BT and Verizon by 2025.   

BT and MCI have worked together for over 30 years, but this is their first joint ownership of an operating company. If successful, this partnership model could be replicated in other emerging markets around the world. The formation of BT Latam highlights the desire of legacy telecom companies from developed nations to gain a foothold in high-growth developing economies. For consumers in South America, it could mean access to new state-of-the-art networks and greater competition among providers. BT Latam will officially launch services in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru starting in January 2021.
