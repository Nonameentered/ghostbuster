BT and MCI Conquer Spanish-Speaking World, Eyeing Asia Next  

British Telecom and MCI Communications, two of the world's largest telecommunications companies, announced a joint venture this week to provide phone and internet services across Latin America and Spain. The new company, called BT Latam, will initially offer landline, mobile, broadband, and enterprise telecom services to markets in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Spain.  

The move marks a major expansion of BT and MCI's global ambitions, allowing them to tap into growth in emerging markets. Latin America and Spain represent a combined population of over 1 billion people, with increasing connectivity and technology adoption.  

"This is a pivotal moment for BT and MCI as we look to scale beyond our traditional bases in Europe and North America," said BT CEO Gavin Patterson. "Latin America and Spain are exciting, fast-growing regions with huge potential. By combining our expertise, infrastructure, and resources, BT Latam will provide innovative communications services to meet increasing digital demands."

MCI's CEO, Hans Vestberg, echoed those sentiments. "Expanding into new geographies is a key part of MCI's growth strategy. With BT Latam, we gain immediate access to new customers and partnerships in some of the world's most promising markets."

The new company will have headquarters in Mexico City and Madrid, with local offices in each market it serves. It plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years to build high-speed mobile and fibre networks across Latin America and Spain. The company will also offer enterprise services like cloud, security, and collaboration tools for businesses.  

The move poses a challenge to major telecom incumbents like Telefónica, América Móvil, and Telecom Italia, which currently dominate connectivity in Latin America and parts of Southern Europe. It also signals BT and MCI's ambitions to tackle new global markets as growth slows in their core regions.

With the Spanish and Latin American beachhead now secured, BT and MCI have their sights set on expanding into Asia. Patterson hinted that BT Latam could pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions in fast-growing Asian countries to provide a gateway for global corporations operating across both regions.
