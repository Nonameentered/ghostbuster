Analysts Divided Over Prospects of Cable and Wireless Communications After Market Debut 

Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC) began trading as an independent company this week after splitting from parent company Cable & Wireless plc. The company debuted on the London Stock Exchange with an initial share price of 60 pence, giving it a market capitalization of £3.1 billion. However, analysts are divided on the prospects for the telecommunications operator that provides mobile, broadband, and fixed line services in the Caribbean and Latin America.

Some analysts point to CWC’s dominant position in most of its markets, with either number one or two positions in 13 of 14 countries. The company also has a long-standing presence across the region of over 100 years and an integrated network infrastructure that would be hard for competitors to replicate. JP Morgan Cazenove initiated coverage of CWC with an ‘overweight’ rating and price target of 90 pence per share. In a note, analyst Akhil Dattani said “CWC operates in markets with high barriers to entry and limited competition. It has a product offering well suited to the needs of both consumers and business customers in the region.”

However, other analysts worry CWC will struggle in some increasingly competitive markets, especially in mobile telecommunications. CWC has lost mobile market share in recent years in Jamaica, Bahamas, and Barbados. Moody’s downgraded CWC’s credit rating from stable to negative, citing competitive pressures in mobile markets, and said it expects revenue and EBITDA to decline over the next 12-18 months. Libertas Partners, an equity research firm focused on emerging markets, initiated coverage of CWC with a ‘sell’ rating and price target of 40 pence. In its report, Libertas analysts said “We see further downside risks to earnings due to competition, especially in mobile, and do not believe the current valuation represents value for investors.”

CWC management acknowledged competitive challenges in some markets but said the diversity of its operations and integrated network will help sustain business. CEO Chris Edgeworth said “We are ready to grasp new opportunities for growth, leveraging our extensive local knowledge and expertise combined with our world-class infrastructure and service platforms.” Investors took a cautious view of CWC’s prospects on its first day of trading, with shares closing down 2 percent. CWC’s future valuation will depend on its ability to defend market positions, invest to improve services, and find new sources of revenue growth in a telecom landscape that is rapidly changing.
