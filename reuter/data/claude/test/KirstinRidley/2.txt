General Cable's "Golden Handcuff" Deal Makes Four Executives Millionaires Amid Acquisition of Imminus Ltd. 

General Cable Corporation announced today that it has entered into "golden handcuff" agreements with four of its top executives in connection with the company's pending acquisition of Imminus Ltd. for $1.2 billion. The executives stand to reap millions of dollars in payouts and accelerated stock vesting from the deals, even as hundreds of rank-and-file employees face an uncertain future.

Under the terms of the agreements, General Cable's CEO, CFO, General Counsel, and COO will receive "retention bonuses" of $2.5 million each if they remain with the company for three years after the Imminus acquisition closes. The executives will also receive accelerated vesting of all outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards. At today's stock prices, the accelerated equity could be worth well over $10 million for some executives.

In a press release, General Cable said the golden handcuff deals were necessary "to incentivize and retain key members of management during this critical time." However, critics argue the payouts are excessive given the company's modest growth and that executives are already generously compensated. 

"This is gratuitous greed, pure and simple. General Cable executives are already extremely well paid, yet the Board is showering them with millions more while lower-level employees face job cuts and uncertain career paths,‚Äù said William Patterson, Director of Glass Lewis, an influential shareholder advisory firm.

General Cable has underperformed the broader stock market over the past five years. However, its shares surged nearly 25% on news of the Imminus acquisition, indicating investors believe the purchase could help jumpstart growth. Imminus is a fast-growing maker of fiber optic connectors and cables. 

The golden handcuff deals highlight a controversial trend of large public companies providing retention bonuses and accelerated vesting to top executives in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Supporters argue such incentives are necessary to keep executives from jumping ship during key transitions. However, critics point out the payouts are often excessive and claim executives already have a fiduciary duty to serve shareholders' interests.

According to securities filings, General Cable's CEO received $12 million in compensation last year, while the other three executives received between $3 to $5 million each. The new golden handcuff deals will significantly boost those totals over the next three years as executives remain with the combined company. Hundreds of lower-level General Cable employees, on the other hand, face an uncertain future as the company works to achieve cost savings from the merger with Imminus. Their fate will depend on whether the acquisition is ultimately a success or failure for shareholders.
