Carlton Communications and Granada Awarded Three Key Licences to Operate Multi-Channel Digital Terrestrial TV in UK, Shares Surge

Carlton Communications PLC and Granada PLC were awarded three digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) today. The companies will launch a multi-channel DTT service providing up to 30 digital channels in addition to the five analogue channels currently available. 

Carlton and Granada, two of the UK’s largest commercial television companies, formed a joint venture last year to bid for the DTT licences. Their successful bid was chosen over three other applicants, including bids from Crown Castle UK and SDN. The ITC said the Carlton-Granada bid offered “the strongest combination of high quality programming, technical expertise and business acumen.”

The three DTT multiplex licences will allow the joint venture to operate three national commercial DTT multiplexes, comprising up to 30 digital channels. The new channels will be available to viewers with digital terrestrial reception equipment, without the need for a monthly subscription. The licences will run for 12 years from 2002.

Carlton and Granada have pledged to invest over £500 million in the launch and operation of the DTT platform. The companies said at least two-thirds of the new digital channels will be completely new services, not presently available on any platform. The remaining channels will include digital simulcasts of some of Carlton and Granada’s existing analogue channels like ITV and Channel 4.

Michael Green, Carlton Communications Chairman said, “This is a watershed in British broadcasting. Digital terrestrial television will offer viewers high quality programming and real choice and diversity for the first time. We are delighted to have this opportunity to launch a new broadcasting age.”

Charles Allen, Granada Group Chief Executive added, “We are committed to using digital television to strengthen public service broadcasting in this country. Our plans for new UK channels will bring substantial investment to content creation throughout the British television industry.”

Shares in Carlton Communications rose over 7 per cent and Granada shares were up 9 per cent on news of the licence win. Investors anticipate strong growth opportunities for the companies as they expand their channel portfolios with the launch of DTT. The service is expected to launch in autumn 2002, pending delivery of DTT transmission infrastructure. The licences will officially come into effect on January 1, 2002.
