Tumbling Trade Barriers Trigger Telecoms Alliances, But Future Remains Uncertain  

Global telecommunications companies are forging new alliances and partnerships at a rapid pace in the wake of steadily declining trade and investment barriers between countries and regions. Cross-border dealmaking in the telecom sector has accelerated over the past decade as companies look to gain scale, tap new markets, and share the costs of expensive mobile infrastructure and next-generation wireless upgrades.  

The past year has seen several major deals. Vodafone Group and Bharti Airtel, two of the world's largest wireless carriers, combined their mobile operations in India. Japanese tech giant SoftBank purchased a majority stake in We Company, the parent of US mobile company Sprint, for $21.9 billion. Meanwhile, T-Mobile and Sprint continue negotiating an all-stock merger that would unite the third- and fourth-largest US wireless players.

However, the future of telecom tie-ups remains uncertain given the risks around competition policy, national security concerns, and pushback against globalization. Many deals have stalled or been blocked in recent years. In 2016, regulators prohibited a $100 billion merger between Telefónica and Dutch carrier KPN over antitrust worries. A proposed Telenor-Telia combination of Scandinavian telecom operators was abandoned in 2018. In the US, telecom mergers and acquisitions require approval from the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission, facing significant scrutiny.

There are also growing international tensions over telecom networks, trade relationships, and investment between countries. The US government has banned telecom equipment from Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE over cyberespionage fears, and is discouraging allies from using their gear. China has threatened to retaliate with its own "entity list" of foreign tech companies. Such divisions could curb global partnerships, especially those crossing the US-China divide.

However, analysts note there are still opportunities for strategic tie-ups, especially between telecom operators in developing markets in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia looking to quickly build mobile infrastructure and gain scale. "Telecom companies worldwide recognize that size and reach matter in an industry where infrastructure costs are substantial," said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research. Partnerships and consolidation, even if slowed, are "inevitable in such a capital-intensive industry."  

Joint ventures and minority investments are an increasingly popular model, allowing telecoms to pool resources while avoiding messy mergers and keeping a degree of independence. Whatever form they take, global telecom alliances look set to shape the industry for years to come as companies work to meet the world’s insatiable demand for mobile connectivity. But as geopolitical tensions rise, the path forward promises to be anything but straightforward.
