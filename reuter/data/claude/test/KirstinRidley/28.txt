Music Industry Searches for New Sound to Boost Global Sales

The music industry is seeking new sounds and new routes to gaining global audiences after decades of declining sales of recorded music. While streaming music services and social media platforms have helped reconnect some listeners with new music, the overall market remains well below its peak in the late 1990s when CD sales were booming. 

Industry executives and observers say a breakthrough new genre of music that captures the public's attention and imagination on a global scale could help revitalize the business. "We're due for a new explosion of creative music that taps into the cultural zeitgeist," said Simon Perry, a music writer and industry analyst. "When that happens, it lifts all boats in the music industry."

The last time a new genre spurred major growth was the rise of hip hop in the 1990s. Before that, the emergence of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s and the rise of punk and electronic music in the 1980s drove new interest in music. Now music executives are placing bets, however small, on a range of new sounds that could find a wider audience.

Some believe a fusion of musical styles from Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean could produce a popular new global sound. Artists like Columbian reggaeton singer J Balvin, Nigerian Afrobeats artist Davido and Indonesian pop singer NIKI are achieving some international success and could point to a potential new direction. “There are more underground artists in more countries now producing music that blends local and global sounds,” said Ashaunna Ayars of the music distributor Empire Distribution. “One or a few of them are bound to break through and have a major influence.”   

Others think artificial intelligence will help create a new genre. AI systems can analyze thousands of songs and sounds to detect patterns and help produce unique new music that humans may not readily identify. “AI is getting better and better at composing music, and I think AI-created music could become a genre of its own that people really enjoy listening to,” said Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. The company focuses on research into AI safety and creativity.

The gaming world is also seen as a possible breeding ground for new music. Many popular video games feature soundtracks of electronic, hip hop and pop music created specifically to accompany the games. “With millions of kids spending hours playing these games and listening to the music, there's an opportunity for some of that in-game music to make it to the mainstream,” said Max Desisto, a music producer who has created soundtrack music for gaming companies.  

While new sounds and music genres may emerge, industry executives say business models must also evolve to benefit the full range of music creators. Subscription models, brand deals, and other alternative funding sources may be needed to supplement the traditional royalty payments from music streaming and sales. The ultimate solution, insiders say, is aligning the music industry with the wellbeing and financial success of the artists and songwriters who produce the music. With that focus, newly popular and culturally impactful music could lift the entire industry.
