High-level think tank calls for global regulatory framework to combat financial crime in borderless world of the Internet  

A new report published today by the Global Policy Initiative, a leading international think tank, calls for the establishment of a global regulatory framework to tackle financial crimes enabled by the rise of cryptocurrencies and the increasingly borderless digital financial system. The report argues that money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, and other illicit financial flows have become easier in an era of global digital payments, cryptocurrencies, and complex cross-border transactions.  

Traditional regulatory approaches based on national jurisdictions are outdated and inadequate for addressing these threats, according to the report. “We have a global financial system but lack a coordinated global regulatory system—and criminals are exploiting these gaps,” said John Smith, lead author of the report and director of the think tank’s financial integrity program.  

The report calls for policymakers to establish a new “Global Council on Financial Integrity” that would set standards, share data across borders, and coordinate regulatory responses. The council would include representatives from national law enforcement and financial regulatory agencies, as well as observers from the private sector and civil society.  

“No single country can tackle these issues on its own. We need a global solution for a global problem,” said Mary Johnson, a former regulator and co-chair of the think tank. “A regulatory council could help level the playing field across jurisdictions so that criminal money flows have nowhere left to hide.”

The council would focus on promoting five key regulatory objectives: implementing strict “know your customer” rules for cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallet providers; promoting data sharing across agencies and jurisdictions; harmonizing money laundering penalties and enforcement actions; improving tools for identifying and confiscating criminal proceeds; and coordinating policies around emerging risks like privacy coins or decentralized finance.

Critics argue that a global regulatory body raises sovereignty concerns and could be difficult to implement in practice. The report authors acknowledge the challenges but argue that national governments would retain control over their domestic regulatory systems. The council would aim to coordinate actions and set non-binding guidelines, not override national legislation.
