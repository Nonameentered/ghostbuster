Cable and Wireless Plc Shares Surge on Deal Hopes with China for Hong Kong Telecom

Shares of Cable and Wireless Plc skyrocketed 18% today on reports that the British telecommunications company is in advanced talks to sell its stake in Hong Kong Telecom to China Mobile, China's state-owned mobile phone operator. Cable and Wireless owns 51% of Hong Kong Telecom, one of Hong Kong's largest telecom companies. 

According to people familiar with the matter, Cable and Wireless and China Mobile are negotiating a deal worth up to $5 billion for Cable and Wirelessâ€™ stake in Hong Kong Telecom. If completed, this would be the largest-ever acquisition of a telecom asset in Hong Kong and underscore China's ambition to expand control and influence over Hong Kong's economy. 

Hong Kong Telecom is a prized asset, providing mobile and broadband services to over 3 million customers in Hong Kong. China Mobile, with over 930 million subscribers, has long sought to boost its presence in Hong Kong but has faced political sensitivities around mainland China's control. Buying Hong Kong Telecom outright would make China Mobile the dominant player in Hong Kong's telecom sector.

For Cable and Wireless, selling its stake would provide an opportunity to exit a mature market and raise funds to reinvest in higher-growth opportunities in Africa and the Caribbean, where Cable and Wireless also operates telecom networks. The company has been under pressure from some investors to sell non-core assets and refocus its portfolio. 

However, the potential deal is facing opposition from pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong who argue that it would give China too much influence and control over the city's telecommunications infrastructure. Leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement warned that user data and information could be accessed by Chinese authorities if China Mobile took full control. But China Mobile pledged that Hong Kong Telecom would continue to operate independently even under its ownership.

Shares of Cable and Wireless have rallied this week in London trading on reports of the talks with China Mobile. If a deal is reached, it would be a boon for investors who have long waited for Cable and Wireless to streamline its business. But the company also risks political backlash, especially if China is seen as tightening its grip over Hong Kong. The fate of the deal remains uncertain, but both sides appear motivated to make it work. After two decades, Hong Kong Telecom could be set to change hands, a sign of China's ambition and its complex relationship with the former British colony.
