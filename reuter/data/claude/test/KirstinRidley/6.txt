BBC announces plans to enter commercial television market with Flextech partnership 

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) today announced a joint venture with Flextech, a UK-based media company, to launch three new free-to-air commercial television channels. The historic move marks the BBC's first foray into commercial television in its 97-year history.

The channels will be branded under the name "BBC Choice" and will feature entertainment, drama, and lifestyle programs. They are set to launch in spring 2021, pending regulatory approval. The BBC said the channels will be distinct from its existing free public service channels like BBC One and BBC Two and funded primarily through on-air advertising. 

The BBC Trust, which oversees the BBC's operations, approved the joint venture after a multi-year review of the broadcaster's commercial activities. BBC Director-General Tim Davie said, "This partnership is an exciting opportunity for the BBC to reach new audiences in innovative ways while still staying true to our public service mission. By teaming up with Flextech, we can explore new commercial models that complement our existing services."

However, the plans are already facing criticism from commercial rivals who argue the BBC will have an unfair competitive advantage due to its public funding and brand recognition. Industry group Digital UK said, "The BBC cannot have its cake and eat it too. It should not be able to leverage public money and its brand to launch commercial rivals to existing players." Supporters counter that the BBC Choice channels will provide more choice for viewers and increased revenue for the BBC to fund its public service output.

Flextech CEO Mike Darcey noted, "This partnership brings together two of the UK's most experienced broadcasters to offer viewers new choices in entertainment. The BBC's brand and content paired with our expertise in running commercial channels will provide a very compelling new option for advertisers and viewers alike." As part of the joint venture, Flextech will provide advertising sales and technical facilities while the BBC will contribute content and brand licensing. Programming details for the new channels will be announced in the coming months.

The BBC and Flextech said the channels will reach at least 75% of UK households upon launch next year. Viewers will be able to access the services on satellite and cable platforms as well as on streaming services and smart TVs. The new offering promises to reshape the competitive landscape of British television at a time when broadcasters face increasing competition from global streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Overall, the BBC described the channels as an opportunity to "ensure that public service broadcasting remains at the heart of UK media for future generations."
