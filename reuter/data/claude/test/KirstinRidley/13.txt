Cable and Wireless Communications Looks to Further Acquisitions Following Formation and Partial Flotation

Cable and Wireless Communications, the newly formed telecommunications company that today listed shares on the London and New York stock exchanges, is poised to pursue more acquisitions to fuel growth, according to officials speaking on a call with analysts. 

The company was formed earlier this year from the merger of Cable & Wireless plc and Columbus International. The partial public offering raised $1.2 billion that will be used to pare down debt and invest in expanding broadband networks in more than 40 markets across Latin America and the Caribbean.

"We have significant opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions across our markets," said Chief Executive Officer Balan Nair. "We will be actively looking at value-enhancing acquisitions, especially those that can accelerate our ability to deliver faster speeds and enhanced services to more customers."

The company is the largest telecommunications provider across Latin America and the Caribbean with more than 13 million mobile subscribers, 5.6 million broadband, data and digital TV customers, as well as 1.6 million fixed-line voice customers. The company ranks No. 1 or No. 2 in several major markets like Panama, the Bahamas, Jamaica and 12 other countries.

Mr. Nair identified several services the company is focused on expanding including residential and business broadband, video streaming, and cloud services for business customers. The company faces competition from players like Liberty Latin America and Digicel Group that are also expanding in the region.

One area of potential expansion through deal-making could come in mobile financial services and ecommerce. The company recently invested $30 million for a minority stake in mobile money platform Pagosonline based in Panama. Mobile money services that allow customers to make payments and transfer funds via mobile phones have become popular in emerging markets.

The company's share price climbed over 3% in early trading following the announcement of its listing and outlook. The offering was a partial flotation, with parent companies Liberty Global and CWC Group retaining majority control. The stock offer represented about 20% of shares with Liberty Global selling down part of its stake and nearly all shares offered from CWC Group.

Proceeds from the equity raise and any future deals will provide fuel for Cable and Wireless Communications to accelerate investments to boost internet speeds, enhance video and entertainment options for customers, and potentially expand further into new business segments like financial technology, according to analysts. The company appears poised to become an aggressive player driving telecommunications growth and connectivity in Latin America following today's milestone.
