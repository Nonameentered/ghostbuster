Japan's NTT in Talks with France's CGE about Stake in French Railway Venture  

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, Japan's largest telecommunications company, is in advanced talks to acquire a significant minority stake in a high-speed railway project in France, according to people familiar with the matter. 

NTT is negotiating with Compagnie Générale des Eaux (CGE), the French utility company, to invest in the first privately funded high-speed rail line in France, the sources said. The line would connect Paris to Normandy in northern France. If a deal is reached, NTT would invest several hundred million euros for roughly a 30% stake in the 4 billion euro project, the sources added.

The investment would allow NTT to gain valuable expertise in high-speed rail technology and expand into new markets outside Japan. NTT faces slowing growth in its core telecommunications business in Japan and has been expanding aggressively into new areas, including financial services, biotechnology, and transportation. An investment in the French railway project would be one of NTT's largest transportation deals outside Japan.

For CGE, NTT's involvement could help attract other international investors to the project and reduce the French company's stake. CGE won a government tender in 2016 to build and operate the high-speed rail line but obtaining financing has been challenging. NTT's participation would provide capital and credibility to get the ambitious infrastructure project off the ground.

The rail line has faced opposition from environmental groups concerned about the impact of the construction. However, government officials argue that the project will create jobs, boost economic growth, and provide an environmentally friendly alternative for travel between Paris and Normandy. If financing is secured and regulatory approval is obtained, construction on the railway could begin as early as next year and become operational by 2025.
