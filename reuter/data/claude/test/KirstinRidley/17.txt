Ameritech Corp in Talks for Merger or Acquisition with European Security Monitoring Firms 

Ameritech Corp, one of the largest security monitoring companies in North America, is in discussions with two major European security firms regarding a potential merger or acquisition, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are aimed at expanding Ameritech's operations into Europe and leveraging the technology and customer base of the European companies.

Ameritech has been in talks with Securitas AB, a Swedish security services company, and G4S, a British multinational security services company. Securitas AB operates in 53 countries and employs over 300,000 people, providing security solutions like remote monitoring of alarms and fire safety systems. G4S also operates in over 90 countries, employing more than 500,000 people, with a focus on security systems integration, monitoring of intrusion and fire alarms, access control, and key holding.

An acquisition or merger with Securitas AB or G4S would expand Ameritech's operations substantially into Europe and provide additional capabilities and technologies to better serve its customers. Ameritech currently operates mainly in the United States and Canada, with over 1 million business and home security customers, but has been looking to globalize its operations. The company has seen steady growth over the past decade as the market for advanced security systems has expanded among both businesses and individuals.

The talks are still preliminary, according to the sources, and there is no guarantee a deal will be reached. But executives from Ameritech have visited counterparts in London and Stockholm in recent weeks to discuss possible partnership options, from joint ventures to complete acquisitions. Any deal would likely value Securitas AB or G4S in the tens of billions of dollars, the sources said.

Ameritech's share price rose 3% on the news of the talks, indicating investor confidence in the company's growth strategy. Representatives from Ameritech, Securitas AB and G4S all declined to comment on ongoing discussions.
