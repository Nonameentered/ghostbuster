Granada Group Tables $1.2 Billion Bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, Faces Opposition from Some Shareholders 

The Granada Group, one of the largest commercial television companies in the U.K., announced a $1.2 billion bid today to acquire Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. The deal would make Granada the dominant commercial broadcaster in northern England and provide greater scale as the industry faces increasing competition.

However, the bid faces opposition from some long-time shareholders of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television who believe the offer undervalues the company. The bid of 260 pence per share represents a premium of only 15% over the stock's closing price yesterday. Major shareholders like hedge fund Elliot Associates, which owns a 5.3% stake, have criticized the offer as "opportunistic" and said they will not support it in its current form. 

Granada Group Chairman Charles Allen defended the bid, saying it provides an attractive opportunity for shareholders to realize significant value. "This deal will generate major synergies by combining two companies with similar audiences and operations," Allen said. "We aim to become the leading voice for viewers and businesses across northern England."

Granada is offering a mix of cash and stock for the acquisition, which would combine two of the most watched commercial broadcasters outside of London. Together, the combined company would reach over 10 million viewers across northern England and boast more than $1.5 billion in annual revenue. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the U.K. television industry amid declining advertising revenue and competition from streaming services.  

However, for the deal to proceed Granada will need the support of at least 75% of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television shareholders. Some major shareholders have suggested the bid needs to be raised to at least 300 pence per share to gain their support. Granada has not yet indicated whether it would be willing to increase its offer.

Analysts are mixed on the implications of the potential deal. Supporters argue it would drive significant cost savings and enable the combined company to leverage its audience reach to gain greater pricing power over advertisers. However, critics argue it risks reducing media plurality in the region and may face scrutiny from government regulators. The deal is also partly funded by new debt, raising concerns about the financial leverage of the combined company.

Further details on the terms of the deal and shareholder reactions are still emerging. Whether Granada will raise its bid or Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television shareholders will ultimately support the deal remains an open question. The coming days will be critical in determining the fate of the proposed acquisition, which would transform the media landscape across northern England.
