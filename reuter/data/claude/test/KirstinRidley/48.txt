ITC Confident in Decision to Award Digital Terrestrial TV Licences Despite Possible Legal Challenge

The Independent Television Commission (ITC) today expressed confidence in its decision last month to award digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences to the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 despite the threat of a possible legal challenge to the process by the broadcasting watchdog group Voice of the Viewer. At a press conference this morning, ITC Chairman Sir Christopher Bland insisted the commission had conducted "a fair, open and transparent" licence bid process and said he is "unconcerned" about the possibility of a judicial review. 

"We stand by the integrity of the DTT licensing process and believe we made the correct decision," Sir Christopher told reporters. "After carefully evaluating all bids according to the criteria we established beforehand, the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 were the clear winners in our view."

The ITC awarded three DTT multiplex licences in early June, two to the BBC and one jointly to ITV and Channel 4 after a competitive bidding process. The licences will allow the broadcasters to air digital versions of their channels beginning in 2002. However, Voice of the Viewer argues the ITC should have awarded at least one of the multiplexes to a consortium of smaller broadcasters and independent producers to promote more diversity in the DTT platform. 

In a letter to the ITC last week, Voice of the Viewer said it would apply for a judicial review of the licensing decision unless the ITC agrees to re-run part of the process to include another round of bids allowing consortia and independents to compete for a licence. Voice of the Viewer Director Jocelyn Hay said the group believes the ITC's licensing methodology was "fundamentally flawed" and that the commission has a legal duty to promote a range of multiplex operators.

Sir Christopher dismissed Voice of the Viewer's objections as "without merit." He said DTT needed established broadcasters like the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 to help bring the new service to mainstream audiences. While the ITC appreciates the role of independent producers, Sir Christopher said "now is not the time for risky experiments." He expressed confidence the courts would uphold the ITC's decision if Voice of the Viewer proceeds with a legal challenge.  

The DTT platform is expected to reach 60-70 percent of UK households. It will offer more channels and interactive services than current analogue transmissions allow. However, the take-up of digital satellite and cable services has lagged government targets so far, putting more pressure on DTT to help drive the overall switch to digital TV. The ITC hopes the involvement of major familiar broadcasters will boost consumer awareness and acceptance of the DTT service.
