First Leisure Corp Plc H1 Profits Slip 5% on Poor Bingo Performance 

First Leisure Corp Plc, the UK-based leisure and attractions operator, reported a 5% drop in half-year profits due to a continued decline in its bingo division.

Profit before tax for the six months to June 30 fell to £27.3 million from £28.7 million a year earlier, the company said. Revenue rose 2% to £183.2 million, reflecting higher visitor numbers at the company’s UK theme parks and bowling alleys.

However, revenue at the company’s bingo halls dropped 8% as weaker consumer spending and increased competition from online bingo continued to hit the business. First Leisure operates 180 bingo halls across the UK, which represents about a third of the company’s revenue and profit.  

“The bingo business remains challenging and we don’t expect a meaningful recovery in the near future,” said Simon Willett, chief executive of First Leisure. “We are taking further steps to streamline the bingo operation and grow our digital business to return the division to growth over the longer term.”

First Leisure has reduced the number of bingo halls it operates from 220 three years ago. The company said it would close at least 10 more halls over the next six months as leases expire. It also plans to revamp its bingo websites and mobile apps to make them easier to use as it aims to transition more customers online.

In contrast, the rest of First Leisure's business performed well in the first half. Theme park revenue rose 12% due to higher visitor numbers, especially at the company’s two main UK parks: Adventure Valley in Kent and Highland Park near Edinburgh. 

Bowling revenue increased 6%, reflecting the popularity of bowling as an affordable group leisure activity. First Leisure operates 120 bowling alleys across the UK. The company opened two new alleys in the first half and plans to open six more over the next year.

Hotel revenue was flat as higher room rates offset lower occupancy. First Leisure’s hotels, many of which are located near its theme parks and other attractions, contributed 15% of total revenue.
