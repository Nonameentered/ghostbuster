BSkyB shares dive on loss of top executives and equity stake in TV

Shares in BSkyB plunged more than 8% today after the broadcaster announced the surprise departure of two top executives and plans to sell its stake in a German channel.

BSkyB said Jeremy Darroch, its chief executive of the past 12 years, and chief financial officer Andrew Griffith will leave the company. The pair have been instrumental in transforming BSkyB into Europe's biggest pay-TV company, with more than 23 million subscribers. Darroch will step down at the end of the year while Griffith will leave in the summer.

The company also announced it will sell its stake in Sky Deutschland to rival Comcast. BSkyB, which is 39% owned by Comcast, owns a majority stake in the German channel. The disposal of the holding comes only 18 months after BSkyB took full control of Sky Deutschland.

Investors were shocked by the double dose of bad news, wiping more than Â£1.2 billion off BSkyB's market value. Shares fell 309p to 3468p, a level not seen since Comcast first announced its interest in BSkyB last year. 

"It's a bolt from the blue," said analysts at Barclays. "The loss of both the CEO and CFO at the same time will hamper strategic direction." The American owners are now looking for a new leadership team to run the British pay-TV company, which has been struggling with increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix.

BSkyB has built its business on exclusive live sports and movies, but has faced more rivalry in recent years for sought-after content. The company has also been investing heavily in its own on-demand services to counter the threat from the new challengers.  

The sale of the German holding suggests BSkyB wants to focus on its core UK and Ireland business, although analysts argue the group would have been better to maintain its foothold in Europe's largest economy. Sky Deutschland has more than 5 million customers and offers a potential growth market as pay-TV penetration is lower than in the UK. 

For Comcast, taking full control of Sky Deutschland provides an opportunity to create a pan-European entertainment powerhouse to challenge rivals such as Netflix. The US media group, which owns NBC and Universal Studios, has made expansion into Europe a key part of its strategy. 

The coming months will be crucial for BSkyB as Comcast hunts for new leaders to shape the next chapter for the pay-TV pioneer that Darroch and Griffith turned into such a powerhouse. After 24 years at the helm, the outgoing bosses leave behind big shoes to fill. Their successors will need to pilot the company through more turbulences ahead.
