Psion Plc's Shares Plummet by Almost One Fifth Despite New Product Launch

Shares in Psion Plc, the British technology company, have dropped nearly 19% despite the launch of a new range of handheld computers last week. Psion's shares fell from 98 pence on Tuesday to 79 pence today, wiping £170 million off the company's market value. 

The share collapse comes despite Psion unveiling its new Series 9 range of clamshell handhelds last Thursday, which was widely seen as Psion's comeback bid in the handheld market it pioneered in the 1980s and 1990s. Psion hopes the new Series 9 range, which includes wi-fi connectivity and touchscreens, will revive its fortunes after years of declining sales of its PDAs and the loss of its once-dominant market position.

However, analysts said the new products may have disappointed investors and failed to reassure them about Psion's long-term prospects. "The Series 9 looks polished but lacks any dramatically new features to drive demand," said Richard Holway, a tech analyst at Arete Research. "Psion still looks deeply unfashionable compared to sleek new smartphones. It's hard to see these new PDAs turning around their fortunes given how much the market has moved on."

Psion's shares have declined more than 90% from their peak during the dot-com boom due to dwindling PDA sales and competition from smartphones. The company was once worth more than £5 billion but is now valued at under £250 million. Revenue has fallen for the past four years and the company continues to make a loss.

In response to the share price fall, David Potter, Psion's chairman said: "We believe the new Series 9 range will drive growth over the coming years. The market continues to need rugged, durable handheld computers and we remain confident in Psion’s future."

Analysts, however, remain unconvinced. Mark Stickings of Equity Research Advisory said: "Psion looks extremely vulnerable and still lacks a coherent strategy to turn things around. Unless we see a dramatic upswing in sales and a return to profitability soon, the future looks bleak for this once great British tech innovator."

The share collapse is a blow for Psion, which had hoped the new product range would reignite investor interest. Unless the new handhelds exceed expectations and drive a recovery, the outlook remains challenging for Psion which is in a fight for survival in a rapidly changing market. The next few months could be crucial in determining the company's future.
