British Telecommunications' $20 billion merger with MCI approved by shareholders, talks with European regulators to begin next week 

The proposed $20 billion merger between British Telecommunications (BT) and MCI Communications Corp took a major step forward today as shareholders of both companies voted to approve the deal. The merger, which would create one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, still needs approval from European regulators before it can be finalized.

BT shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the merger, with 99% of votes cast supporting the deal. MCI shareholders also showed strong support, approving the merger with 94% of votes. The shareholder approvals clear the way for BT and MCI to move forward with seeking regulatory consent for the merger, starting with the European Commission next week.

BT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said, “Today's vote is a resounding show of confidence in this merger from our shareholders. With their support, we will now work to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to complete this transaction as rapidly as possible.” MCI Chairman and CEO Bert Roberts echoed that sentiment, saying "This merger makes clear business and strategic sense, and will benefit customers, employees and shareowners of both companies."

The combined company would have over $50 billion in annual revenue, making it the third largest telecom company in the world behind AT&T and Japan's NTT. The merger brings together BT's strength in Europe with MCI's substantial presence in the United States. The new company expects to achieve substantial cost savings and synergies, estimated at over $2 billion per year.

However, the merger faces close scrutiny from European regulators, who have expressed concern that the deal could hamper competition in European telecom markets. BT and MCI submitted their merger filing to the European Commission last month, kicking off a four-month review process. Analysts expect the review to focus on whether the merger will impact competition in areas like broadband, wireless and corporate telecom services across Europe. The companies have stated they will propose remedies, if needed, to address any competitive concerns in order to win approval for the deal.

With shareholder approvals in hand, BT and MCI now await the regulatory fate of their landmark merger in Europe. If approved, the deal is expected to close by the end of the year, marking one of the largest transatlantic mergers in history and a seminal moment for the global telecommunications industry. The merged company would take on the name BT Communications and be headquartered in London, while MCI would continue operations in the United States under its current brand.
