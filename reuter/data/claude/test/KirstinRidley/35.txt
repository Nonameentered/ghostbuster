Carlton Communications Plc Reports Strong Half-Year Earnings Boosted by Advertising Revenue Growth  

Carlton Communications Plc, one of the largest media companies in the UK, reported strong earnings growth for the first half of its fiscal year driven largely by increased advertising revenue across its television and digital properties.

The London-based company said profit before taxes rose 15% to £243 million for the six months ending September 30 compared with £211 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue climbed 9% to £1.32 billion, fueled by an 11% rise in advertising income to £784 million.

“We had a very successful first half with strong financial results across all our business areas,” said Carlton CEO Mark Thompson. “Revenue and earnings grew at a healthy pace, led by increased advertising on our market-leading TV channels and digital platforms. We continue to benefit from viewers migrating to our on-demand streaming services and the high-quality premium content we provide.”

Carlton operates popular free-to-air and subscription television channels in the UK including ITV, ITV2, and ITV3. It also owns the ITV Hub streaming platform and music channels. The company said viewership and online streams rose during the first half of the year, giving advertisers more opportunities to reach audiences and boosting ad rates.

The UK television advertising market has been expanding at a mid-single-digit percentage pace, providing tailwinds for Carlton. However, there are concerns that economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a possible recession could slow advertiser spending in the coming months. 

Mr. Thompson said Carlton is well-positioned to weather any potential economic turbulence. The company has been producing more dramas, comedies, documentaries and entertainment programs to attract viewers and give advertisers compelling places for their commercials. Carlton also has a stable subscription base for its streaming services and online platform.

Revenue at Carlton’s broadcast and online division jumped 10% to £1 billion, while production arm ITV Studios saw an 8% rise in sales to £612 million driven by new dramas in the UK and Europe as well as game show formats sold internationally.

The company declared an interim dividend of 3.3 pence per share, an increase of 5% from last year. Carlton also repurchased £75 million of its shares during the first half, part of a £225 million buyback program announced earlier this year.

Investors cheered the results, pushing Carlton’s shares up 6% in early London trading. The stock has risen nearly 20% so far this year, giving Carlton a market value of around £13 billion.
