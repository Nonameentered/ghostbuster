BT and MCI set to expand into South America with new Iberian telecoms alliances  

British Telecom and MCI Communications announced today that they have formed strategic alliances with two major telecommunications companies in Spain and Portugal to expand into new markets in South America. The alliances with Telefónica of Spain and Portugal Telecom will give BT and MCI access to networks and infrastructure across Latin America and open up opportunities for providing telecom services to multinational corporations operating in the region.  

The deal with Telefónica, Spain's dominant telecom provider, will allow BT and MCI to lease network capacity and share investments in Telefónica's existing networks in 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. Telefónica has the largest fiber optic network in Latin America, spanning over 120,000 miles. MCI and BT will market and sell their services using this network infrastructure, enabling them to quickly establish a presence across the region without major upfront costs to build their own networks.  

MCI and BT also signed an alliance agreement with Portugal Telecom, which has operations and investments in telecom companies in Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe. While smaller in scope than the Telefónica deal, the Portugal Telecom alliance provides another avenue for BT and MCI to gain valuable network assets and market access in Africa and grow in developing countries.  

The alliances highlight the increasing globalization of the telecommunications industry as companies forge cross-border partnerships to rapidly enter new markets. Latin America and Africa in particular represent growth opportunities, fueled by increasing foreign investment and a rising middle class. BT and MCI had been seeking ways to expand into these markets to better serve their multinational clients. The alliances with Telefónica and Portugal Telecom provide them both infrastructure and local expertise to accelerate their expansion plans.

"These strategic partnerships allow us to significantly expand our footprint in high-growth regions across Latin America and Africa while limiting execution risk," said Gavin Patterson, CEO of BT. The alliances are "an efficient way to gain scale, utilise existing infrastructure, and tap into local knowledge." Luis Abril, CEO of MCI Communications, echoed that sentiment, saying "the alliances catapult MCI into a leadership position in these key regions and provide platforms for future growth."

MCI was acquired last month by Verizon Communications for $12 billion. Verizon is aiming to leverage MCI's international networks and client base to expand globally, so the new alliances with Telefónica and Portugal Telecom are well-timed to support Verizon's broader strategy. The alliances still require final approval but are expected to commence operations starting next year.
