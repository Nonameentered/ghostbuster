British Gas Plc faces tough price review by industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode as utility watchdogs show their teeth

British Gas, the UK's largest energy supplier, is bracing for a tough review of its pricing policies by industry regulator Ofgem and its chief executive Clare Spottiswoode. Ofgem announced it will conduct an in-depth investigation into British Gas's pricing and profits to ensure customers are getting a fair deal. 

The review comes amid rising consumer complaints about high energy bills this winter and accusations that British Gas and other suppliers are profiteering at a time of financial hardship for many households. British Gas raised its prices by an average of 9.2% last November, adding over £100 to the average dual-fuel household bill. Rival suppliers have also implemented price hikes in recent months, citing rising wholesale costs.

However, critics argue the suppliers are using wholesale prices as a smokescreen to mask excess profits. Analysis from consumer groups suggests British Gas will make over £50 in profit per dual-fuel customer this year, raising questions about whether recent price rises were justified. Ofgem's probe aims to determine if British Gas priced its deals fairly based on the actual costs of supplying energy. Depending on the findings, Ofgem could take action against British Gas to reduce bills or cap future price rises.

The timing of Ofgem's announcement suggests the regulator hopes to take a tougher stance against the Big Six energy firms, of which British Gas is the largest. Ofgem has faced criticism in the past for being too lenient in its regulation of the energy market. But under Ms Spottiswoode's leadership, Ofgem appears to be showing its teeth. In addition to the British Gas review, Ofgem is conducting wider reforms to make the switching process easier for customers to escape expensive standard variable tariffs.

A British Gas spokesperson said the company will fully cooperate with Ofgem's investigation and is confident in its pricing. "We understand customers' concerns about energy prices and bills. However, the costs of energy have risen considerably over the last year, and our price rise last winter reflected increases in policy and network costs, and the wholesale price of energy."
