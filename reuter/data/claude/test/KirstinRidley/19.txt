Telecoms analysts amused by Portugal Telecom's gaffe in mistaken Telefonica-MCI link-up  

Telecommunications analysts and industry observers were left bemused this week by an embarrassing gaffe by Portugal Telecom, in which the company mistakenly announced a major strategic alliance with Telefonica and MCI.

In a bizarre press release issued on Tuesday, Portugal Telecom proclaimed it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica and US-based MCI Communications to jointly develop international voice and data services. The announcement was greeted with widespread surprise and confusion in the telecoms sector, given that MCI was acquired by Verizon Communications in 2006 and no longer exists as an independent company.  

Within hours, Portugal Telecom issued a hasty clarification that the original release was mistaken and had referred to the wrong companies. In a second statement, the company said it had actually signed an agreement with Telefonica and another unnamed “major North American telecommunications company” to explore partnerships in certain areas. However, industry sources said they were baffled by the glaring error, especially given that the deal purportedly involves major strategic telecoms players.

“This is an extraordinary embarrassment and lapse in basic knowledge by Portugal Telecom,” said John Delaney, a telecom analyst at market research firm IDC. “To get the names of key industry players and partners so wrong in an official press release is quite staggering and reflects poorly on the company.”  

Portugal Telecom, which is 32% owned by Brazilian telecoms firm Oi, declined to provide further details about which North American company is actually involved in the agreement. But the error is a blow to the company's credibility and a source of amusement for its competitors, according to analysts.

“This is a bit of a joke in the telecoms world at the moment,” said Stefan Weil, a telecoms analyst at Berlin-based private bank Mendel & Cie. “For a company like Portugal Telecom, credibility and partnerships are extremely important. To mess up something as basic as correctly naming the companies you are teaming up with does call into question the company's competence.”

Some industry observers speculated that the error may have reflected internal confusion within Portugal Telecom or last-minute changes to the deal that weren't properly communicated to its public relations team. But most said there was no real excuse for such a high-profile mistake. The shares of Oi fell 2.2% on Wednesday on investor concern about its associate company, analysts noted.
