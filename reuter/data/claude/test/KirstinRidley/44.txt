B.A.T to pay $1.7bn in landmark tobacco deal, warns it may withdraw support if significantly changed 

British American Tobacco (B.A.T) has agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by the U.S government over allegations that the tobacco giant deliberately targeted youth in its marketing and misled the public about the health risks of smoking. The landmark settlement is one of the largest ever by a tobacco company and ends a 16-year legal battle.

However, B.A.T warned that it may withdraw its support for the deal if there are any "significant" changes to the terms during the approval process. The settlement must now be approved by judge Gladys Kessler in Washington, D.C district court, who has overseen the case against B.A.T and its U.S subsidiary Brown & Williamson since 2004.

Announcing the settlement, B.A.T acknowledged that it had targeted youth in some of its past marketing and that smoking causes serious diseases, but it did not admit to any deliberate wrongdoing or violating laws. The company said "certain youth-focused marketing programs decades ago were inappropriate and wrong." It also admitted that secondhand smoke causes health issues in nonsmokers. 

Under the terms of the deal, B.A.T will pay $1.7 billion over 12 years into a federal fund for public health initiatives, especially programs to curb youth smoking. The company will also ban marketing that targets or appeals to youth, prohibiting the use of cartoons in marketing and limiting advertisements near schools. Restrictions will also be placed on the sale of flavored cigarettes.

The U.S government filed a lawsuit in 1999 accusing major tobacco companies of violating civil racketeering laws and defrauding the public. Most other companies settled in 1998 but B.A.T and Brown & Williamson continued fighting the charges. Judge Kessler ruled in 2006 that they had violated federal law. An appeals court ordered the case be reconsidered but a subsequent ruling in 2017 again found against the companies.
