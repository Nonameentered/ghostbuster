Cable and Wireless Communications plans further acquisitions as it prepares for partial flotation  

Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), the UK-based telecommunications company, is planning a series of acquisitions over the next 12 to 18 months to expand its operations in the Caribbean and Central American markets. The acquisition strategy comes ahead of a planned initial public offering of up to 49% of the company, which is expected in the first half of next year.

CWC, which was spun off from Cable & Wireless plc in 2010, currently operates fixed line telecommunications and broadband networks in 38 countries across the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. The company has a customer base of over 13 million mobile subscribers, 1.8 million fixed line customers and over 500,000 broadband subscribers.  

In an interview with the Financial Times, CWC's CEO Phil Bentley said "there are a number of opportunities for expansion through acquisition in our operating markets. We have a strong balance sheet and are actively looking at a number of targets over the next year that would be complementary to our existing business." Bentley joined CWC in January from British Gas owner Centrica.

Specifically, Bentley highlighted the potential for deals in the Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. CWC already has a significant presence in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago. Bentley said the company would look to acquire both mobile and fixed line operators, as well as those providing pay TV and broadband services.

The acquisitions form part of CWC's strategy to consolidate its position as the leading telecommunications provider across the Caribbean and Latin America region. Revenue and earnings have grown steadily in recent years, with CWC reporting a 6% increase in organic revenue and 7% rise in EBITDA for the first half of this year. However, competition is intensifying from companies such as Digicel and Liberty Latin America.  

The planned IPO in 2019 is designed to raise funds to pay down debt while providing a partial exit for CWC's private equity owners, which include BC Partners, CPP Investment Board and Novator Partners. CWC was taken private in 2010 in a deal worth £3.3 billion but has seen its value rise significantly since then due to operational improvements and expansion in high-growth markets.

Bentley said CWC will not consider a full listing until at least 2021. "We believe CWC is currently best suited to being a private company, allowing us to pursue our strategy free of short-term public market pressures." However, a partial IPO would enable the company "to deleverage our balance sheet and provide liquidity to our longstanding shareholders", he added. If market conditions remain supportive, the IPO is likely to value CWC at between £8 billion and £10 billion.

The announcement of further acquisitions and an IPO represent an ambitious strategy by CWC to cement its position in telecommunications markets that still offer strong growth opportunities. With private equity backers looking for realisation after nearly 10 years of ownership, next year is shaping up to be pivotal for the future and ownership structure of the company.
