Britain's CWC to Float 14.7 Percent Stake in London and New York 

Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC), the Caribbean telecommunications company, announced plans to float a 14.7 percent stake in the company on the London and New York stock exchanges. The initial public offering is expected to raise up to $1.5 billion, making it one of the largest listings of a Caribbean company.

CWC, which is majority owned by Liberty Global, a telecommunications and media company, said it will use the proceeds from the public offering to pay down debt and fund continued investments in technology infrastructure and acquisitions across the Caribbean and Latin America. CWC provides mobile phone, broadband internet, and subscription television services to more than 7 million customers across 42 countries.

“This listing represents an important milestone for CWC and will provide us greater access to capital to fund our growth ambitions,” said Phil Bentley, CEO of CWC. “We have built CWC into the market leader in the Caribbean through continued investments in networks, new services, and acquisitions. The IPO proceeds will enable us to drive even greater improvements in network quality and coverage, as well as fund expansion into new markets.”

The public offering has been structured into a dual-class share arrangement, with Liberty Global retaining ownership of 85 percent of the voting shares. The remaining 15 percent of voting shares and 14.7 percent of total shares will be offered to public shareholders. The dual-class structure is designed to provide public market access to CWC shares while enabling Liberty Global to maintain operating control. 

Several large institutional shareholders have already committed to purchasing a majority of the shares on offer, suggesting strong interest in CWC stock. The company is targeting a valuation of between $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, which would make it one of the largest listings on London's Alternative Investment Market. CWC shares are expected to begin trading on December 3.

CWC has seen steady growth in revenue and profits over the past five years as demand for mobile data and subscription television services has risen across the Caribbean and Latin America. The company invests more than $500 million each year to upgrade technology infrastructure, build additional cell towers, and expand broadband networks across its footprint. CWC expects these investments and acquisitions to drive continued top-line and bottom-line growth over the next several years.

The public listing highlights the growing maturity of companies across the Caribbean and Latin America. With a combined population of more than 640 million, the regions are home to a rising middle class of consumers and a growing number of innovative companies looking to tap public markets for expansion capital. For global investors, CWC may represent an opportunity to gain exposure to an overlooked market with strong potential for future growth.
