BT-MCI $23 Billion Merger Likely to be Approved by Investors on Both Sides of Atlantic

British Telecommunications PLC and MCI Communications Corp. shareholders are likely to approve the proposed $23 billion merger of the two telecommunications giants, according to analysts and investors on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger, which would create one of the world's largest telecom companies, is up for vote at shareholder meetings in London and Washington, D.C. in two weeks. 

The deal has faced scrutiny from regulators in Europe and the United States over the past year but has cleared all regulatory hurdles. The merger is now in the hands of the companies' shareholders, who are expected to vote in favor of the transaction. The merger has the support of the boards of both companies as well as major institutional shareholders.

“Shareholder approval seems a foregone conclusion at this point,” said Brian Rutledge, a telecommunications analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London. “The strategic rationale for this deal is very compelling, and shareholders recognize the significant long-term value creation potential.”

Under the terms of the merger agreement, MCI shareholders would receive 0.6 of a British Telecom ordinary share for each MCI share. Based on current stock prices, that would value MCI at $30.25 per share, a 37% premium over the pre-merger-announcement price. MCI shareholders would own approximately 40% of the combined company. 

The combined BT-MCI would become a global communications powerhouse with operations in over 50 countries worldwide. The company would offer local, long-distance and international voice and data services over wireline and wireless networks. BT Chairman Iain Vallance said the new company would be "uniquely positioned to meet customers' growing demand for global seamless networks."

Some investors have worried the merger could face risks related to potential culture clashes, systems integration challenges, and competitive and technological pressures in the fast-changing telecom sector. However, supporters argue the strategic benefits of the deal—including substantial cost savings, diversification, and the ability to bundle services—outweigh these concerns.

Executives said annual cost savings from the merger could reach $2 billion within three years of the deal closing. Much of the savings would come from combining overlapping operational and administrative functions, as well as network infrastructure. The companies have also pledged to cut 10,000 jobs from their combined workforce of 160,000.
