Orange Plc Reports Bigger Loss But Healthy Subscriber Growth

Orange SA, France's leading telecommunications company, reported a wider net loss in the second quarter due to hefty network investments and restructuring charges. However, the company also posted strong subscriber growth, especially in mobile contracts. 

The company said its net loss in the three months to June 30 widened to 383 million euros ($452 million) from 316 million euros a year earlier. Revenue remained stable at 10.4 billion euros.

The results were impacted by sizable investments in Orange's ultra-fast fiber and 4G networks, as well as costs related to a voluntary redundancy plan in France. The company is aiming to cut up to 4,000 jobs in France through voluntary departures and has set aside 586 million euros for associated costs this year.

Excluding those effects, Orange's Ebitda and operating income saw modest growth, reflecting the company’s focus on cost control and efficiency improvements. The company confirmed its full-year guidance for a "flat positive" Ebitda.

"The second quarter results demonstrate our capacity to deliver commercial performance while controlling costs, despite a high level of investments and expenses related to our transformation plan," said Chief Executive Stéphane Richard.

The top line was supported by a strong increase in mobile contract subscribers, especially in Africa and the Middle East where the customer base expanded 7.2% from a year earlier. In France, mobile contracts rose 2.3% while fixed broadband subscribers were up 2.9%.

Orange is investing heavily to roll out fiber and 4G networks to maintain its competitive position against tough rivals like Altice Europe's SFR Group and Iliad's Free Mobile. The company said its 4G mobile network now covers 93% of the French population, while its fiber network passed 20 million households.

The telecom company also reaffirmed its dividend policy, with a minimum annual payout of 65 euro cents per share for the 2018-2020 period. The company paid a 30 euro cent interim dividend in December and will propose a 35 euro cent final payout to the shareholder meeting in May.

Shares in Orange fell as much as 1.6% in early trading as the results missed some analyst forecasts. But analysts said the underlying trends remained solid and the company seemed on track to meet its full-year targets.

“The Q2 results look rather decent on an operational basis with slightly accelerating topline trends in most segments and good FCF generation,” said analyst Jerry Dellis at Jefferies. “Guidance is unchanged and the interim dividend was slightly ahead of our forecast. In all, another quarter of 'steady as she goes' with little to really excite the market but also keeping the turnaround story on track.”
