BSkyB shares plummet as concerns mount over loss of top executives and equity stake in digital TV

Shares in British pay-TV giant BSkyB plunged as much as 10% this morning amid mounting concerns over the loss of key executives and uncertainty over its plans to retain full control of its 24.5% stake in UKTV, a multi-channel broadcaster. 

BSkyB announced yesterday that Chief Operating Officer Mike Darcey, considered the likely successor to CEO Jeremy Darroch, will leave the company at the end of the year. Darcey, who has been COO since 2010 and with BSkyB for over 15 years, did not give a reason for his departure but said he plans to “pursue other opportunities.”

The news of Darcey’s impending exit comes just weeks after Commercial Director Jamie West resigned from his role. West had been responsible for BSkyB’s product strategy and was a key driver of its investments in streaming services and connected TV apps. The departures fuel concerns about a leadership vacuum at the company and a lack of a clear succession plan.

“These are a blow to the business at an awkward time,” said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at equity research firm FinnCap. “Mike Darcey and Jamie West were instrumental in building BSkyB into the media powerhouse it has become. There will be questions asked about continuity and whether Jeremy Darroch can manage this much change at the top.”

Adding to the uncertainty is the imminent expiry of a put option agreement allowing co-owners BBC and Scripps Networks Interactive to sell their 50% stake in UKTV. BSkyB had hoped to convince its partners to extend the agreement, allowing it time to find a new buyer for the majority holding. However, according to sources close to the discussions, talks have now stalled with BBC and Scripps keen to realize the value of their shares.

UKTV operates 10 television channels including Dave, Really and Yesterday, which are among the most popular channels on BSkyB’s satellite TV platform. Loss of control over UKTV would deny BSkyB access to the channels’ audiences and advertising revenues. The channels are also an important source of original British content that BSkyB relies upon to meet regulatory obligations.

In a statement, BSkyB acknowledged that the departures of Darcey and West were “disappointing” but said the depth of talent and experience in its leadership team will ensure a smooth transition. The company remains in “active discussions” with BBC and Scripps over the future ownership of UKTV but warned there “can be no certainty” a deal will be reached before the put option expires next month.

Investors were unsettled by the day’s events. BSkyB shares fell over 9% in morning trading to £14.45, their lowest level this year. The sell-off reflects worries that BSkyB’s decade of success under CEO Jeremy Darroch could be coming to an end. Without a clear successor to Darroch and further changes to its portfolio of channels, the pay-TV pioneer may struggle to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive media landscape.
