Cable and Wireless Plc reports record annual results but holds back on global partnership decisions

Cable and Wireless Plc, one of the world's leading telecommunications companies, today announced its full year financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The company reported record revenue of Â£28.4 billion, up 15% from the previous year, and record adjusted earnings per share of 87p, up 13% year over year. 

CEO Gavin Patterson attributed the strong results to "continued strategic investments in our networks, inclusion of newly acquired companies, and benefits from our diversification into adjacent markets." The company completed two major acquisitions in the last fiscal year, including a mobile virtual network operator in Southeast Asia and a cybersecurity services firm. Revenues from its consumer mobile services grew by 20% due to the acquisition and expansion into several new markets. Its enterprise segment also showed double-digit revenue and earnings growth as global businesses increased spending on cloud, security, and networking services.

However, Mr. Patterson signaled a more cautious outlook for the coming year. "While we continue to see many opportunities for long-term growth, the macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we face geopolitical challenges in some of the markets we serve." The company did not announce any new global partnerships or acquisitions as some analysts had expected. Its share price fell 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

Cable and Wireless has pursued an aggressive growth strategy over the past five years, expanding into 25 new countries through partnerships and acquisitions. The company now has mobile networks serving over 500 million subscribers in more than 50 countries. Some analysts have raised concerns that its partnerships in certain emerging markets expose it to additional political and foreign exchange risks. The lack of new global partnerships in today's announcement may reflect a more circumspect view of such risks going forward.

Overall, the record annual results demonstrate Cable and Wireless's success in diversifying its business beyond traditional fixed line and mobile telephony services into higher-growth adjacent markets. However, the mixed outlook and absence of new global partnerships signal the company is taking a more prudent long-term growth strategy to navigate an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Investors may need to temper some of their enthusiasm for the stock until there are more tangible signs of growth opportunities in frontier and emerging markets.
