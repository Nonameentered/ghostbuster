USA Global Link in Talks with 30 International Companies to Offer Cut-price Worldwide Phone Services via Internet 

USA Global Link, a US-based telecommunications company, announced today that it is in discussions with over 30 international telecom firms to partner on offering low-cost global calling services using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. If the deals go through, customers of USA Global Link and its partners would be able to make unlimited free calls to landlines in over 50 countries and mobile phones in many countries for a flat monthly fee of $9.99.

The proposed service would allow customers to make calls using an app on their smartphones or via a web portal on their computers by connecting to the Internet. The calls would bypass traditional phone networks and be routed over the Internet, enabling substantial cost savings. USA Global Link hopes to sign on major telecom partners in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America to make the service available in most parts of the world.

“We want to make global communication nearly free for people all over the world,” said Tom Stevens, CEO of USA Global Link. “By joining hands with leading phone companies in other countries and using the power of the Internet, we can offer consumers very affordable rates for international calling and spur more people to connect across borders,” he added.

If successfully launched, the new calling plans could significantly disrupt the international calling market which has been dominated by a few large players. Many smaller companies have tried but failed to make a dent as routing calls over the traditional phone network infrastructure has made it difficult to achieve price points low enough to lure customers away from established providers. The spread of high-speed Internet and advancements in VoIP technology have made an Internet-based solution viable today.

However, some industry analysts are skeptical about the plans. “Achieving a price point as low as $9.99 for unlimited global calling seems very ambitious and the costs to USA Global Link and its partners may be higher than anticipated,” said Tricia Duryee, a telecommunications analyst with Frost & Sullivan. She also worried that call quality over the Internet may still be lower than traditional phone services. But Stevens said USA Global Link has invested in technologies to ensure call quality matches or exceeds that of standard calls.

If USA Global Link is able to sign on as many international partners as hoped, the new service could launch as early as the third quarter of this year. The company will release details of its partners and new rates as discussions progress to firm up offers. With a bold new offering at a disruptive price, USA Global Link is poised to make waves in the international calling market. But until final details are revealed, observers will have to wait and see if those waves turn the tide in the company’s favor.
