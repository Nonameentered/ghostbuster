Telefonica and BT Alliance Would Threaten AT&T in European Telecoms Market, Analysts Say  

Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications giant, and British Telecom (BT) are in preliminary talks to form a strategic alliance that could pose a major challenge to American carriers like AT&T that are seeking to expand in Europe, according to three industry analysts briefed on the discussions.

The potential partnership could include network sharing, joint investments in infrastructure, and cross-selling of mobile services to business and residential customers across Britain, Spain and Latin America. If finalized, the deal would give Telefonica and BT greater scale and cost efficiencies as newer, nimbler competitors encroach on their turf.

For AT&T, the second-largest wireless carrier in the United States, an alliance between two of the biggest incumbents in Europe would be an unwelcome development as it is making its first major push overseas. AT&T last year spent $2 billion to acquire two regional European carriers, hoping to use 5G wireless technology to gain a foothold in the broader region. But the company still lacks the kind of size and brand recognition in Europe that Telefonica and BT boast in their home markets.

The talks are preliminary, the analysts cautioned, and there is no guarantee the companies will reach a final agreement. But strategically, a partnership could benefit both sides as the European telecom landscape undergoes tectonic shifts. Telefonica faces stiff competition from Orange, a market leader in Spain, as well as new internet-based rivals. BT faces pressure in Britain from newer entrants like Liberty Global’s Virgin Media. Teaming up could help the incumbents cut costs by sharing expenses like network infrastructure.

Under the deal being discussed, the analysts said, Telefonica and BT would remain independent companies but work together in the areas that make the most strategic sense, like joint investments in broadband or 5G wireless networks in Britain and Spain. The carriers could also cross-sell mobile services to each other’s residential and business customers. The first phase of the partnership would last five years with an option to extend further.

The talks are being conducted by Telefonica’s chairman, José María Álvarez-Pallete, and BT’s chief executive, Philip Jansen, according to the analysts. Representatives of AT&T declined to comment, as did officials at Telefonica and BT. 

A partnership would be a departure for Telefonica and BT, which have long competed as rivals. But industry dynamics have forced former competitors into alliances as fast-growing upstarts enter their markets. In Austria, Deutsche Telekom and Hutchison formed a joint venture; in Britain, O2 and Virgin Media merged. As legacy telecoms businesses mature, partnering with a rival is often seen as a safer bet than risky acquisitions.

For AT&T, an alliance between Telefonica and BT could significantly curb its ambitions in Europe, the analysts said. Through its acquisitions last year, AT&T gained about 7,000 small and midsize business customers and one million mobile subscribers in Austria, Romania and the Czech Republic. But the company has struggled to gain broader traction, in part because its brand recognition lags far behind incumbents like Telefonica, BT, Vodafone and Orange.

If Telefonica and BT join forces, “AT&T would face a much more formidable competitor,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. “They would control huge amounts of spectrum, have vast networks across Europe and would have the scale to invest heavily in new technologies like 5G. For AT&T, that is a major setback.”
