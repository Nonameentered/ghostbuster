Colombia's Budget Cuts Threaten to Undermine Efforts to Reverse Social Inequalities and Combat Guerrilla Movements 

The Colombian government's recent announcement of major budget cuts threatens to derail the country's fragile progress in addressing deep-rooted social inequalities and ending decades of armed conflict. The proposed cuts of $6.3 billion, amounting to almost 10% of the total budget, will severely impact social programs, infrastructure projects, and the implementation of the historic 2016 peace deal with the FARC guerrilla movement.

For decades, Colombia has been plagued by inequality, poverty, lack of economic opportunity, and violence. The budget cuts target many programs aimed at addressing these chronic issues, including rural development funds, education and healthcare for the poor, and agricultural subsidies for small farmers. Critics argue these cuts will further marginalize vulnerable groups, fueling the resentment and lack of trust in the government that originally gave rise to left-wing guerrilla movements like the FARC. 

The budget cuts also reduce funding for the reintegration of former FARC combatants into civil society and support for farmers switching from growing coca to legal crops. These elements were crucial parts of the peace deal that ended 52 years of conflict between the government and the FARC. There are concerns that if the reintegration process fails and legal job opportunities do not replace income from coca, many will return to violence, threatening the fragile peace.

The government argues that the deep budget cuts, amounting to 2% of GDP, are necessary to curb growing debt and stabilize the economy amid the global recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Colombia's economy shrank by almost 7% last year, and unemployment rose sharply. However, critics claim the cuts are excessive and poorly targeted, and that increased debt in the short term is justified to protect peace, support the most vulnerable, and enable long term prosperity. 

The budget cuts proposed by President Duque's government threaten to repeat the policy mistakes of the past rather than building a more just and inclusive society. For decades, economic troubles have been addressed through austerity policies that exacerbated inequality and conflict. As Colombia works to move on from its painful history of social divisions and violence, this familiar pattern must not continue. Protecting the most vulnerable groups, consolidating peace, and improving equality and opportunity should be policy priorities, not government budget lines that are first to face the chopping block.
