Explosion in Bogota's La Picota prison reveals brewing cartel war among inmates  

A powerful explosion rocked Colombia's La Picota prison in Bogota on Tuesday morning, killing at least 12 inmates and injuring dozens more. The blast appears to have been deliberately targeted at a wing of the prison housing members of rival drug cartels, pointing to escalating tensions between criminal organizations inside the overcrowded facility.  

According to officials, the explosion was detonated from within a cell block housing inmates aligned with the Gulf Clan, a cartel that controls much of Colombia's cocaine trade. The bomb targeted an adjacent area where members of other cartels, including Pelusos and Puntilleros, were housed. The attack destroyed both cell blocks, trapping inmates under piles of rubble and twisted metal.  

Emergency responders rushed to the scene but were met with gunfire from watchtowers manned by inmates, delaying rescue efforts for over two hours. When authorities finally regained control of the perimeter, they evacuated over 200 injured prisoners, many with blast and shrapnel wounds. The 12 fatalities included inmates from the Gulf Clan, Pelusos, and Puntilleros cartels, pointing to the indiscriminate nature of the attack.  

"This was clearly meant to instill terror not just in one group but the entire prison population," said Colonel Ricardo Mendez, director of prison security. "The narcotraffickers have been threatening each other for control of the drug trade in Bogota, and this seems to be an escalation of that conflict."  

The deadly attack highlights the security crisis within Colombia's overburdened prison system. La Picota was built to house 8,000 inmates but currently holds over 22,000 prisoners, most with links to armed groups and drug cartels. Severe overcrowding has allowed criminal organizations to operate with near impunity, smuggling in weapons and drugs and continuing violent vendettas between rival groups.  

President Ivan Duque condemned the prison explosion as an act of terrorism and vowed an immediate crackdown. "My government will not stand by while armed gangs turn our institutions into battlefields. We will redouble our efforts to seize control of our prisons from these narco-terrorists and ensure justice is served."

Duque's government has struggled to curb criminal activity and violence since taking office in 2018. Despite efforts to boost funding for security forces and pass tougher laws, Colombia's homicide rate reached a 10-year high in 2021. The bloody prison attack is likely to intensify public pressure on Duque as presidential elections approach next year.
