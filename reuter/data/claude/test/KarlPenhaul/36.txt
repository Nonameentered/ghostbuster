Convicts Demand Helicopter Escape After Riot Leaves Five Guards Dead in Colombia Jail  

Political prisoners at a high-security jail in Colombia rioted Monday morning and took control of Block  C of the Palmarito maximum-security prison, holding several guards hostage and killing five others in the skirmish. The riot erupted in the early hours of the morning during shift change for the prison guards. Prisoners, many of whom are leftist guerrillas and paramilitary members, overwhelmed the guards on duty and seized their weapons.

The National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (INPEC) confirmed the deaths of five guards and said 10 additional guards had been taken hostage by the inmates. Video footage from outside the prison walls showed smoke rising from portions of the prison complex. Gunfire could also be heard for several hours. 

Several hours into the riot, prisoners released a statement via a human rights organization demanding safe air passage out of the facility as a condition for releasing the remaining guards unharmed. The statement also demanded the release of political prisoners from other facilities in the region and safe passage to join them at the Palmarito prison. Colombian President Ivan Duque rejected the demands in a televised address and said his government will not negotiate with “terrorists and murderers.”

The Palmarito prison was constructed in 1973 to hold 900 inmates but now holds more than 2,500 prisoners, with some estimates putting the prison population at over 3,000. It has a long history of overcrowding, as well as inmate violence. The facility holds prisoners from rival guerrilla and paramilitary groups, fueling tension. Human rights groups have criticized conditions at the prison and documented numerous cases of torture, drug abuse, and other rights violations over the years.

Colombia’s 51-year civil war with left-wing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) officially ended in 2016 with a peace agreement. However, violence and instability have persisted in some parts of the country, including occasional riots and disturbances in the nation's overcrowded prisons. The government's response to this latest prison riot and standoff will likely have major implications on the overall security and peace process.
