Colombia Approves Tougher Anti-Drug Penalties to Please U.S.  

The Colombian Senate today passed controversial legislation enacting tougher sentences for drug possession and trafficking. The new law was pushed by President Ivan Duque, who has faced political pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on the country’s cocaine trade.

The legislation imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences of up to 25 years for possession of large quantities of drugs like cocaine and heroin. Penalties are also increased for leaders and financiers of drug trafficking organizations.  

President Duque praised the Senate vote, saying “this demonstrates Colombia’s commitment to dismantling criminal drug networks and fighting impunity.” The legislation is likely to be signed into law by Duque within the week.

The harsher penalties have provoked criticism from human rights groups, who argue they will lead to mass incarceration without reducing drug trafficking. “Imposing draconian sentences will just fill Colombia’s already overcrowded prisons,” said José Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch. He urged Duque to invest in prevention and drug rehabilitation instead.

Yet Duque faces considerable pressure from Washington to intensify his anti-drug efforts. At a meeting last month, President Trump reportedly threatened to decertify Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs if Duque did not take more aggressive action. Such a move would cut off U.S. funding and potentially impose sanctions on Colombia.  

Decertification would deal a major blow to the Duque administration and further strain the already tense U.S.-Colombia relationship. Duque desperately wants to avoid it, analysts say, which is why he has prioritized the harsh new penalties.

“Duque pushed for this law to appease Trump and avoid decertification, not because it will actually reduce drug trafficking,” said political commentator Angela Patricia Janiot. She argued the policy “shows Duque’s subservience to Trump” and will undermine Colombia’s rule of law.  

Others defended the policy, saying tougher penalties were necessary to counter the huge flow of Colombian cocaine into the U.S. “We have to get tough on drug criminals or the problem will just get worse,” said Conservative senator Paloma Valencia.

Colombia remains the world’s top producer of cocaine, with coca cultivation and cocaine production at record levels last year according to U.S. estimates. The Trump administration has made combating the drug trade a priority and frequently complains that Duque is not doing enough. The harsh new law appears aimed at easing that pressure, even as experts decry its likely ineffectiveness and impact on human rights.
