Colombian Movie Director Turns to Guerrilla Tactics to Conquer Audiences  

By The AI Journal

Carlos Chávez Sanchez, an up-and-coming film director from Medellin, Colombia,  has adopted some unorthodox methods to promote his first feature-length film. Rather than relying on traditional advertising and publicity campaigns, Sanchez is using guerrilla marketing tactics inspired by his country's rebel groups to generate buzz and fill theaters.  

His film "The Devil's Bridge" opens next week in 12 cities across Colombia. But to build an audience in advance, Sanchez and his crew have been covertly posting provocative street art and staging impromptu music performances, flash mobs, and pop-up screenings of the film's trailer. The goal is to surprise and intrigue viewers, get people talking about the mysterious events on social media, and ultimately sell more tickets.

"In Colombia, guerrilla rebels were effective at disruption and gaining attention, though obviously their violent methods should not be emulated," Sanchez said. "I'm adapting some of their philosophy in a peaceful way through surprise attacks on public spaces with art and culture. It's a way for an independent filmmaker with a microbudget to compete for attention."

The marketing campaign started six months ago when stenciled graffiti and wheatpaste posters featuring the film's logo started appearing on walls in major cities. A few weeks later, costumed characters from the film began making unannounced appearances on street corners and in parks, silently interacting with passersby and handing out enigmatic fliers with a social media hashtag.   

Flash mobs soon followed, with actors from the film staging dramatic and sometimes bizarre scenes from the plot at malls, restaurants, and sporting events. Onlookers recorded the spectacles and shared footage online, spreading curiosity about what it was promoting. 

The guerrilla tactics culminated last month in "pop-up cinemas" where the film's trailer was suddenly screened in unconventional public places. In Medellin, they showed the trailer at a major traffic intersection, making hundreds of drivers and pedestrians stop in their tracks. In Bogota, they set up a giant outdoor projector to show the trailer on the side of a building at night.

Sanchez's unorthodox methods have garnered widespread media coverage in Colombia and drawn considerable public attention to his work. His social media following has skyrocketed, and the film's trailer—only available through the surprise screenings—has become a viral sensation online with over 5 million views. Now anticipation for the full film's release next week is intense, and early ticket sales have far outpaced the director's expectations.   

While controversial, Sanchez's guerrilla marketing tactics prove that disruptive creativity can be an effective way for unknown artists to break through and reach new audiences. His success pushing the boundaries of promotion may inspire other upstart filmmakers with more moxie than money. "The Devil's Bridge" seems poised to become not just a film but a cultural phenomenon in Colombia, with a marketing campaign as daring and provocative as the movie itself. Only time will tell if its surprise attacks on audiences have conquered their curiosity or their pocketbooks.
