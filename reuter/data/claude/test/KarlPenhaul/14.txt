Colombia faces growing heroin crisis as new generation of drug lords emerge

Bogota, Colombia—Colombia has long battled drug cartels that control the cocaine trade, but now the country faces a new threat: the rise of heroin traffickers. A new generation of drug lords is filling the power vacuum left by the fall of older cartels. These upstart traffickers are cultivating opium poppies and moving large shipments of cheap, potent heroin into the United States. 

Colombian and U.S. officials say more than 60,000 acres of poppies are under cultivation in Colombia, a 40 percent increase from five years ago. Raw opium production has surged, and more is being processed into heroin within Colombia before being smuggled north. U.S. border officials report a spike in heroin seizures from Colombia, indicating the new drug lords have developed sophisticated distribution networks to meet skyrocketing demand for heroin in American cities and suburbs.

“The heroin threat from Colombia is real and it is a threat we ignore at our own peril,” said Mike Pomp, acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. “These groups are well-organized, well-financed, and operating with the logistic expertise of generations-old drug cartels.”

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos pledged to make fighting opium cultivation and heroin trafficking a top priority during his final months in office. However, military and police forces have struggled to curb the influence of one of the most prominent new drug organizations, Los Pachenca. The group has violently seized control of smuggling routes and poppy-growing valleys from older cartels like the FARC, which disbanded after a 2016 peace deal.

Los Pachenca and other new drug lords have access to precursor chemicals from China and elsewhere to produce high-purity heroin that can be sold cheaply on American streets. The result has been a heroin epidemic in many parts of the U.S., with overdose deaths rising dramatically in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Colombia’s worsening heroin crisis poses a serious threat to both countries and highlights the unintended consequences of the war on drugs, experts say. Despite decades of efforts to curb the drug trade in Colombia, new criminal groups keep emerging to fill the demand for illegal substances in the lucrative U.S. market. With peace finally within reach, Colombia's new generation of drug lords could destabilize the country before the benefits of peace have even begun. Overall, there are no easy solutions in sight for this complex problem plaguing both nations.
