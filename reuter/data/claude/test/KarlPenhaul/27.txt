Right-wing death squad forces residents to flee mountain village in Colombia 

The villagers of El Carmen in central Colombia woke up in terror last week as armed men descended from the mountains surrounding their isolated rural community. Numbering around 50, the masked gunmen began going door-to-door, threatening residents and ordering them to leave immediately.

“They said if we didn't get out right away, we would face the consequences,” said Maria Gutierrez, a mother of three who has lived in El Carmen her whole life. “My children were crying as we scrambled to pack a few belongings and fled down the mountain.”

Within hours, all 43 families of El Carmen had abandoned their homes, with most walking several miles to the nearest town with vehicles and shelter. They fear returning home after the direct threats of violence from the right-wing paramilitary group that now controls the mountain area.

Colombian authorities believe the Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia, also known as the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, were behind the forced displacement. The group is one of the most powerful paramilitary organizations still operating in Colombia today despite a demobilization process that began in the early 2000s. They fund their activities through drug trafficking, extortion, and illegal mining.

For decades, the mountain villages around El Carmen have relied on coffee farming and subsistence crops to survive. Residents live simple lives with limited infrastructure or opportunities for education and work. Many families have lived in the same places for generations.  But the region's rugged, isolated terrain also makes it an ideal location for illegal armed groups and criminal activity.
