Colombia's Interior Minister Resigns to Prepare Bid for Presidency 

Bogota, Colombia - Colombia's Interior Minister Nancy Patricia Gutiérrez announced her resignation from President Iván Duque's cabinet today in order to launch a campaign for the presidency in 2022. Gutiérrez has served as Interior Minister, one of the most prominent cabinet positions, since Duque took office in August 2018.

In a press conference, Gutiérrez said "I have decided to resign from my post to fully dedicate myself to a project that would allow me to lead Colombia into a future of progress, security, and prosperity." She went on to say that "after much reflection and consultation with supporters across Colombia, I am confident I can provide leadership that brings the country together and helps Colombia reach its tremendous potential."

Gutiérrez's announcement sent shockwaves through Colombia's political establishment as she becomes the first candidate to formally declare for the 2022 presidential election. The election is still over a year away, but the field of potential candidates is crowded. Gutiérrez is seen as one of the few with a path to win the nomination of the Centro Democrático, Duque's party.

President Duque thanked Gutiérrez for her service as Interior Minister in a brief statement, saying "Minister Gutiérrez has been a key member of my cabinet and has served Colombia with integrity and determination." However, Duque stopped short of endorsing Gutiérrez's presidential bid. The president is reportedly wary of the political fallout if he backs one of the Centro Democrático candidates this early.

Gutiérrez, 46, is a lawyer and longtime politician. She previously served as director of Colombia's Administrative Department of Public Security. She is generally seen as an ally of former president Álvaro Uribe and the hardline faction of the Centro Democrático. Her tenure as Interior Minister has focused on security and counter-narcotics efforts. She has also faced controversy and criticism over police violence during protests.

The 2022 presidential election is poised to be a competitive race, with no clear frontrunner yet emerging. Gutiérrez joins a field of potential candidates from both the left and right, including several former mayors and governors. Her early announcement and experience on the national stage may give her an advantage, but her association with Duque and Uribe could also be a liability depending on public opinion in 2022. Colombians will be watching closely as the candidates for this pivotal election start to shape their campaigns.
