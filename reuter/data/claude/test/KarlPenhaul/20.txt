US involvement in Colombia's drug war deepens, blurring lines between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency

The Trump administration recently announced the expansion of US military and intelligence operations in Colombia, deepening American involvement in the South American nation's long-running drug war. The plan aims to amplify support for Colombia's efforts to crack down on cocaine production and trafficking, but  critics argue it risks further conflating counternarcotics operations with counterinsurgency due to the government's approach of targeting agricultural zones that are strongholds for left-wing guerrillas.

For decades, Colombia has struggled to curb the flow of cocaine amid a civil conflict that has displaced millions of people. The country's remote jungles and rainforests offer ideal conditions for cultivating coca, the plant from which cocaine is derived. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)  and other armed groups have financed their operations through the drug trade. Although the FARC officially disarmed last year, many former rebels did not demobilize and some have turned to drug trafficking.  The Colombian government claims that left-wing militants are conspiring with Mexican drug cartels and criminal bands to expand coca production.

The US plan, unveiled earlier this month, will deploy Special Forces units and DEA agents to train and assist Colombian military and police units. They will gather intelligence on trafficking networks in volatile areas where government control is limited. The plan also earmarks $9 million in funds to spray herbicide on coca crops, a controversial practice that critics say is ineffective and damages the environment.  Administration officials argue that disrupting cocaine supply chains is necessary to curb addiction rates in the US, the world's largest consumer of the drug. 

However, human rights groups warn that the militarized strategy often makes little distinction between coca farmers and guerrillas, subjecting marginalized populations to violence and displacement. “There are real concerns that intensified military operations could lead to greater violence against civilians and more forced displacement,” said Lisa Haugaard, director of the Latin America Working Group. Analysts also note that forced eradication of coca plants frequently does not eliminate sources of income for armed groups and tends to spur migration to new areas, resulting in a “balloon effect.”
