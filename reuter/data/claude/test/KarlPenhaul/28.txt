Mayor of Colombian Town Raises Voice for Peace After Witnessing Child's Beheading  

The mayor of Tumaco, a coastal town in southwestern Colombia, made an emotional plea for peace after witnessing the beheading of a 7-year-old boy by armed militants. Mayor Emilio Arango condemned the violence between rival drug trafficking gangs that led to the incident and called on the Colombian government to do more to contain the escalating conflict in the region.   

Tumaco, with a population of over 180,000 people, has become a hub of coca production and drug trafficking. Rival gangs are fighting for control of smuggling routes, terrorizing the local population with murders, kidnappings, and extortion. Last week, Mayor Arango was alerted by residents about the presence of armed men in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Tumaco. When he arrived at the location with a group of officials, they found the decapitated body of a young boy in the street. “It was a scene from a horror film,” Arango recounted. “These criminal groups have gone too far. Killing children is completely unacceptable.”

The murder has intensified fears among the residents of Tumaco who feel trapped between the warring gangs with little protection from the authorities. Mayor Arango blamed the national government for ignoring the security situation in Tumaco and other marginalized areas of Colombia. “We desperately need the army and police to patrol our streets and push back against these criminals,” Arango said. He warned that if no action was taken, the drug gangs would further tighten their grip and continue preying on the civilian population with impunity.  

The government deployed additional troops to Tumaco following the mayor's appeal. But critics argue that sporadic shows of force are not enough. What is needed is a comprehensive strategy to curb coca cultivation, dismantle drug trafficking networks, and establish a long-term presence of state institutions like the police and military. Achieving peace will require tackling deep-rooted issues of poverty, lack of education and economic opportunity that drive people into the drug trade.

Mayor Arango hopes the shock over the child's murder will galvanize public support for such efforts. At a televised news conference, he showed a drawing by the 7-year-old boy of a smiling sun and luscious green hills. “This is the future that was stolen from him,” Arango said. “We owe it to this child and countless other innocent victims to build a Colombia where kids can grow up without fear – a Colombia finally at peace.” While ending decades of armed conflict and criminal violence is a formidable challenge, Arango believes the alternative is too bleak to accept. The price of inaction, he warned, will be many more young lives cut short.
