Political Violence Kills 24 and Injures Dozens in Colombia

At least 24 people were killed and dozens more injured in violence linked to local elections in Colombia yesterday. The violence occurred throughout the day at several polling stations across the country. While elections are typically peaceful in Colombia, several incidents of violence erupted in more rural areas. Local police have arrested 17 people they believe were involved in planning the attacks.

Sources report that armed groups threatened and attacked voters to intimidate them from participating in the elections. In the Cauca region, gunmen opened fire outside a voting center, killing 6 people and wounding 20 others. In the department of Antioquia, a confrontation broke out between two rival political groups that resulted in 5 deaths. Bombings at two polling stations caused structural damage but no casualties.

President Martinez condemned the violence and intimidation. “Democracy in Colombia will not cower to threats from illegal armed groups intent on undermining our democratic processes,” he said in a televised address. He pledged that the government would work to identify and bring the perpetrators to justice. The additional deployment of military forces helped ensure that most voting centers were able to remain open for the full 12 hours of voting.

Opposition leaders criticized the government for not doing enough to prevent the violence, especially given threats that had been received prior to election day. “It is unacceptable that the safety of citizens exercising their democratic rights cannot be guaranteed,” said Andrea Nunez, leader of the Liberal Party. The government acknowledged receiving reports of potential violence linked to the local elections but said that without specific details, they were unable to deploy forces to all areas.

Local elections in Colombia choose mayors, governors, and municipal councils. This year over 32 million Colombians were eligible to vote in more than 1,100 municipalities across the country. Despite the violence, voter turnout was estimated to be just over 50% according to election officials. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2022, though tensions remain high in some regions. The government has vowed to increase security to prevent future instances of election-related violence.
