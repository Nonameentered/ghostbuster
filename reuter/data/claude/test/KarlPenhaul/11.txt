Nationwide Strike in Colombia Disrupts Transportation, Telecommunications and Air Traffic

A nationwide strike in Colombia turned violent today as tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police while demanding increased government funding for healthcare, education and other public services. The strike was organized by major unions and has brought much of the country to a halt, disrupting transportation, telecommunications networks and air traffic. 

In the capital of Bogota, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who blocked major roads and highways. Several dozen protesters have been injured and over 100 have been arrested for violence and vandalism. The unions are calling for increased taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations to fund social programs that have been cut in recent years due to budget shortfalls. However, the center-right government of President Ivan Duque argues that tax increases will hurt economic growth.

Buses, taxis and metro trains in Bogota were not operating for most of the day, causing gridlock across the city and stranding many commuters. In Medellin and Cali, two other major cities, public transit was also suspended as protesters erected roadblocks and barricades. Most schools were closed, and several universities canceled classes in support of the national strike. 

Internet and cell phone networks have also been disrupted in parts of the country, as protesters cut fiber optic cables and vandalized telecommunications infrastructure. In Bogota and other cities, residents reported loss of mobile data coverage for extended periods. Meanwhile, many flights into and out of Colombia were canceled as the strike virtually paralyzed operations at El Dorado International Airport in Bogota and other regional air hubs.

While previous national strikes in Colombia have lasted just one day, union leaders say today's industrial action will continue indefinitely until the Duque administration agrees to reopen negotiations over its proposed tax and budget reforms. However, government officials have vowed not to give in to threats and warned that any extended disruption will have severe economic consequences. Analysts fear that a prolonged strike may significantly slow Colombia's recovery from its worst recession in decades caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
