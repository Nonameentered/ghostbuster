President Ernesto Samper Urges Colombian Workers to Resist "Dark Forces of Chaos" Ahead of Nationwide Strike  

BOGOTA, Colombiaâ€”In a televised address Tuesday evening, President Ernesto Samper urged Colombian workers to resist calls for a nationwide strike planned for later this week, framing the protests as an attempt by "dark forces of chaos" to destabilize the country. 

Samper accused leftist labor activists and opposition political groups of organizing the strike for their own political gain rather than addressing genuine concerns of workers. He said the strike would disrupt daily life in Colombia and jeopardize an already fragile economic recovery. 

"There are those who wish to twist your moral indignation for the difficulties you face into instruments of disorder and chaos," Samper said. "Do not let your legitimate concerns be manipulated by those who wish to undermine the democratic institutions of this country."

Samper's speech came ahead of a planned 48-hour national strike called by the country's largest labor unions to protest tax increases, public sector job cuts, and other economic policies that union leaders say disproportionately impact the working class. Union activists have promised marches in major cities like Bogota, Medellin and Cali, raising fears of violent confrontations with police.

In his address, Samper acknowledged "difficult conditions" facing many Colombian workers but said his administration has worked to improve wages and labor protections. He announced a small increase in the minimum wage starting next month but said further changes would be contingent on maintaining "order and stability." 

Samper's rhetoric in anticipation of the protests signals a shift to a harder line against his political opponents and critics on the left. His administration has been plagued by allegations of corruption and close ties to drug cartels, lowering public approval. The strike poses one of the biggest challenges to Samper since taking office in 1994.
