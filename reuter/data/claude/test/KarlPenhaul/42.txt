Former Justice Minister Accuses Colombia of Using Lifting of Extradition Ban as a Smokescreen

Bogota, Colombia - Colombia's former justice minister Yesid Reyes has accused the Colombian government of lifting the ban on extraditing nationals to the U.S. primarily as a way to distract attention from failed peace negotiations with leftist rebels.

In an interview with Caracol Radio, Reyes said the timing of the government's decision was "not coincidental" and was intended to redirect focus away from stalled talks between the government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group. "The government needed a smokescreen to hide its failed approach to the ELN peace process, so it used the extradition of Colombians to grab headlines," Reyes said.

Colombia had banned the extradition of its citizens for drug crimes for decades but lifted the ban in May in response to pressure from the U.S. government. The first wave of extraditions took place earlier this month, with Colombia extraditing three suspected drug traffickers to the U.S. to face charges. The move was praised by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called it "an important step in Colombia's fight against illegal drug trafficking."

Reyes, who served as justice minister under former president Juan Manuel Santos, oversaw initial peace talks with the ELN. He criticized the government of current president Iv√°n Duque for abandoning that effort and said the timing of the extradition decision was meant to deflect blame. "The government's failed approach to dialogue with the ELN was becoming a political liability, so they wanted to change the conversation," Reyes said. 

The Duque administration has denied the accusations from Reyes. Justice Minister Margarita Cabello said the lifting of the extradition ban was the result of close coordination with the U.S. based on shared anti-drug goals, not a political ploy. "We took this hugely important step to bring drug traffickers to justice based solely on our commitment to fighting drug crime, which respects no borders," Cabello said. 

The political spat comes at a sensitive time, with peace talks stalled and violence from rebel groups on the rise in some regions. Reyes urged the government to restart negotiations with the ELN to address unrest before more blood is shed. For its part, the Duque administration says it will not engage in dialogue until the ELN releases all hostages and ceases violent activity.
