Indiscriminate Violence Claims Thousands of Civilians in Colombia's Most Violent Corner

Colombia's isolated Tumaco region on the southwest Pacific coast has seen a sharp rise in violence in recent months, leading to the death and displacement of thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire of warring factions. According to estimates from local human rights groups, at least 3,000 people have been killed or gone missing in the region over the past year.

The main protagonists of the violence in Tumaco are dissident fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, who refused to demobilize after the 2016 peace agreement with the government. Local paramilitary groups and government forces are also involved in the fighting, contributing to the indiscriminate nature of the violence. Civilians are routinely targeted, extorted, and recruited at gunpoint to join the rival groups. Those refusing to cooperate are brutally killed and their bodies dumped in public areas as a warning to others. 

Over 200,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Tumaco due to threats and intimidation from armed groups. They join the ranks of over 7 million internally displaced people in Colombia, the highest number for any country in the world. The displaced suffer severe hardship and poverty, often ending up in makeshift camps on the outskirts of Tumaco with limited access to food, healthcare, and sanitation.

The violence in Tumaco and its impact on civilians has received little international attention, despite its scale. The Colombian government has announced plans to send additional military forces to the region to curb the violence, but critics argue that will likely only lead to more human rights abuses and civilian casualties. What is urgently needed, they say, is sustained peace building efforts, development programs, and guaranteed security for civilians and human rights defenders.
