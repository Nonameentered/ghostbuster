Colombia's Coffee Industry Faces "Enormous Difficulties" Meeting Export Schedules 

The Colombian coffee industry is struggling to meet export schedules due to heavy rains and crop damage, government officials said today. Recent floods have wiped out roads, bridges, and railways used to transport coffee beans to ports, making it nearly impossible for many farms and cooperatives to ship beans on time. The severe weather and infrastructure damage have created “enormous difficulties” for an industry that employs over 700,000 Colombians, according to Agriculture Minister Andres Valencia.

Many farms in Colombia's coffee-growing regions have reported up to 50-70% of their crops damaged or destroyed.  The heavy rains triggered mudslides and flash floods that ruined  bean crops and impaired bean quality on plantations across the country.  "The impact has been devastating for our farmers and their families who depend on coffee income," said Roberto Velez, head of Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation. The federation estimates up to $400 million in losses for Colombia's coffee industry due to weather-related damage.  

The export woes could not come at a worse time for Colombia's coffee farmers and exporters. Global coffee prices have plunged to multi-year lows due to oversupply, squeezing profit margins for producers. Farmers were relying on the harvest from October 2019 to January 2020 to make up for dismal earnings so far this year. With so much of the crop spoiled by rains, many now fear they will struggle to break even for another season. 

"We have lost the most important harvest for our livelihoods and have no way to ship what little we have left," said Javier Gomez, a coffee farmer with a 50-hectare farm in Huila province. "This tragedy will force some of us into poverty."

The problems extend beyond just crop damage, however. Roads and bridges damaged by the heavy rains have cut off many farms from processing mills and warehouses. Exporters can't transport beans to ports for shipping overseas. The cargo that has made it to ports faces multi-week delays, according to exporters. Buyers around the world have been told to expect major shipment delays and disruptions. 

Government officials said emergency funds would be made available for rebuilding roads and bridges to re-connect coffee-growing areas. However, infrastructure repairs will take months and farmers fear more heavy rains could inflict further damage, putting next season's crops at risk as well. After two straight years of depressed global coffee prices and erratic weather, Colombia's famous coffee trade faces an uncertain future. Many see the current crisis as reinforcing the need for more government support for the industry long known as the backbone of Colombia's economy.
