Former Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas Dies at 75 from Stomach Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease

Virgilio Barco Vargas, the former president of Colombia, died today at the age of 75. The cause of death was complications from stomach cancer and Alzheimer's disease, according to a statement from his family. 

Barco served as the 30th president of Colombia from 1986 to 1990. He was a member of the Liberal Party and pursued progressive reforms during his time in office. His presidency was marked by efforts to advance human rights, combat corruption, and make the government more transparent. He also sought to bring an end to decades of civil war in Colombia through peace talks with rebel groups.

Barco was born into a wealthy family in Bogota, Colombia's capital. He studied law at the National University of Colombia before pursuing a career as a journalist and columnist. He was elected to Colombia's Senate in 1974 and served for 12 years before running for president in 1986. Barco won a close election, becoming the first Liberal Party president in over 50 years.

As president, Barco took action against cartels that were trafficking illegal drugs, extraditing several drug lords to face trial in the United States. He also passed a law allowing the government to seize assets linked to drug trafficking. On human rights, Barco established a commission to investigate disappearances and murders committed under the previous administration. He also reformed Colombia's constitution to better protect civil liberties.  

Barco's presidency was marked by tense relations with the United States at times, especially over the issue of extradition. There were also several coup attempts by drug cartels and paramilitary groups during his term. But Barco remained committed to the democratic process and left office peacefully in 1990.

After leaving the presidency, Barco continued to be involved in Colombian politics and civil society. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2001 and had surgery for stomach cancer in 2005. He passed away on May 20 surrounded by family at his home in Bogota. Barco is survived by his wife of over 50 years, Carolina, and their three children.
