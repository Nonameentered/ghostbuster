Colombia Pushes Through Tough New Anti-Drug Legislation in a Last-Ditch Effort to Avoid US Sanctions  

The Colombian congress has approved a series of strict new laws aimed at cracking down on drug trafficking and other organized crime in the country. The legislative package was fast-tracked through congress in an effort to avoid potential sanctions from the United States, which has threatened to decertify Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs unless significant action is taken.

The new laws include harsher prison sentences for drug offenses, expanded authority for the police and military to conduct raids and arrests, and tougher restrictions on money laundering and other financial crimes. The Colombian president also announced plans to send additional security forces to areas where coca production and drug trafficking are most rampant. 

Colombia has long been a major producer of cocaine and the main supplier to the US drug market. Though cocaine production in Colombia has declined in recent years, US officials argue that more needs to be done to curb trafficking and discourage farmers from growing coca. Colombia has been receiving billions in US aid to combat drugs, but President Trump has frequently criticized the government's anti-narcotics efforts and threatened to cut off assistance.

In order to avoid losing US funding and facing diplomatic penalties, the Colombian government worked quickly to draft and pass a comprehensive bill reinforcing the countryâ€™s drug laws. The legislation was approved with bipartisan support and little public opposition. However, some critics argue that harsher enforcement alone will not solve Colombia's drug problems and more social programs are needed to address root causes.   

The new laws went into effect immediately and authorities have already begun conducting raids and operations to put pressure on criminal groups involved in the drug trade. The Colombian government is hoping these efforts will be enough to persuade the US to continue the partnership and certification as an ally in anti-drug initiatives. US officials have so far praised the legislation as a step in the right direction but said they will closely monitor Colombia's progress in the coming months before making a final determination on certification.
