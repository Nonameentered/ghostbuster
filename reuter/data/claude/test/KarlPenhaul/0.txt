Experts say Colombian army's new counterinsurgency strategy fails in mountain town battle

The Colombian army's new strategy to win hearts and minds in the fight against Marxist guerrillas appears to have failed in a recent battle for control of a remote mountain town, according to independent experts. 

For decades, the Colombian military has relied on brute force to wrestle territory away from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in the country's eastern jungles and Andes Mountains. But under new leadership, the army has sought to implement a "population-centric" approach focused on civic projects and restraint in the use of force.

That strategy was on display last week when the army launched "Operation New Dawn" to take the town of El Tigre in the southern province of Caquet√°, a known FARC stronghold for 20 years. In the run-up to the assault, army commanders dropped leaflets urging civilians to stay in their homes, while soldiers built a new community center and repaved roads.

When 600 troops entered El Tigre, they encountered little initial resistance. "The FARC bandits fled like cowards," said Gen. Jorge Hernandez, commander of the operation. But after three days of calm, fighting erupted on the town's outskirts. Guerrillas launched hit-and-run attacks and planted explosives that killed two soldiers. The army responded with mortar fire that witnesses said struck civilian homes.

The fighting raged for a week as 8,000 residents cowered in their homes, lacking electricity, food and water. When army reinforcements finally beat back the FARC, much of El Tigre had been destroyed. "The town was flattened, all the crops and livestock were abandoned. The army broke everything," said Luis Mendez, a coffee farmer who fled with his family.

Independent analysts said the rout exposed major flaws in the army's new strategy. "The civilian population was clearly not the priority in this operation," said Patricia Bueno, a researcher at the Observatory for Human Rights in Colombia. Military actions could have been more targeted or included emergency aid for civilians trapped in the fighting. Some officers displayed a "lack of discipline" that harkened back to the worst army human rights abuses against civilians, Ms. Bueno said.
