16 Soldiers and 15 Leftist Guerrillas Killed in Four-Day Battle Near Bogota 

A fierce four-day battle between Colombian military forces and leftist guerrillas this week resulted in at least 16 soldiers and 15 rebels dead, according to military officials. The fighting took place in a remote jungle area about 60 miles southeast of the capital city of Bogota. 

The battle began on Monday when an army patrol encountered a large contingent of guerrilla forces belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest rebel group. According to reports, the initial confrontation started as a result of the military patrolling near a known drug smuggling route used by the FARC to move cocaine out of the remote region.

When the army patrol came under fire from the guerrillas, they called for reinforcements. But the thick jungle terrain made it difficult for additional troops to reach the battle zone quickly. The FARC rebels used landmines and sniper fire to pin down groups of soldiers for hours at a time, according to accounts from the military. The Colombian army responded with heavy artillery and aerial bombardment of suspected rebel positions.

By Tuesday evening, six soldiers and eight guerrillas had been killed. The intensity of the fighting led military commanders to call in special forces units to try to turn the tide. But clashes continued for two more days until the FARC forces finally retreated further into the jungle on Thursday evening, according to the military. In total, the prolonged battle resulted in the deaths of 16 Colombian soldiers with another 28 injured. At least 15 rebels were killed, the military said, though the actual number could be higher since the rebels took their dead with them.

This deadly skirmish is the latest in a decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and leftist rebels aimed at controlling drug trafficking routes and coca production in Colombia, one of the world's largest cocaine producers. The FARC and another leftist rebel group, the National Liberation Army or ELN, are designated as terrorist organizations by the Colombian government and the U.S. State Department. Peace talks between the government and FARC rebels took place last year but ultimately failed, leading to a renewal of hostilities. Both sides have pledged to continue their armed struggle for the foreseeable future, signaling the prospect of more violence ahead.
