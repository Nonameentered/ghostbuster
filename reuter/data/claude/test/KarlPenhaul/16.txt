Government Workers in Colombia Stage Nationwide Strike for Better Wages

Government employees across Colombia went on strike today, calling for higher wages and improved working conditions. The nationwide strike brought much of the public sector to a halt, impacting schools, transportation, and healthcare services. 

The unions representing over 500,000 government workers are demanding a 20% wage increase as well as adjustments for rising living costs. Union leaders argue that public sector wages have not kept up with high inflation in Colombia, which was over 8% last year. The striking workers include teachers, doctors and nurses, trash collectors, and transit operators.

President Juan Manuel Santos's administration has refused the unions' demands, stating that such significant wage increases are unaffordable and would require cuts to government services. The administration has offered a 6-8% wage increase, but unions rejected that proposal.

In the capital Bogota, public transit operators joined the strike, forcing the suspension of bus and transmilenio rapid transit service. The transit shutdown caused massive traffic jams and disruptions across the city of over 8 million people. Most public schools in Bogota and other cities also closed for the day as teachers walked off the job. Dozens of flights at airports in Bogota, Medellin, and Cali were also cancelled as air traffic controllers took part in the strike.

While previous public sector strikes in Colombia have lasted for multiple days, union leaders have announced this would be a single-day strike action. However, they warned of potentially "indefinite" strikes should their demands remain unmet. The conflict highlights the economic struggles facing many middle-class Colombians despite overall growth and stable macroeconomic indicators in the country.

The government has not announced any plans to return to negotiations at this point. Meanwhile, the nationwide disruption from the massive public sector walk-off is likely to put pressure on both sides to find a compromise and solution to bring government workers back to their jobs.
