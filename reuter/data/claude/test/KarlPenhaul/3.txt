Fierce fighting shows Colombia's military losing battle against oldest guerrilla army 

Colombia's military suffered heavy losses this week in fighting with the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's oldest guerrilla army, highlighting the struggle the armed forces face in tackling the insurgent group.

On Tuesday, at least 17 soldiers were killed and another 9 injured in an ELN ambush in dense jungle in Chocó province in western Colombia. The soldiers were patrolling in armored vehicles when they were hit with explosives and rocket fire from the ELN fighters. The attack represents the deadliest operation by the ELN this year.

The ELN, founded in 1964, is Colombia's last guerrilla group still active after a 2016 peace deal disbanded the larger FARC rebels. The ELN has between 2,000 and 2,500 fighters mostly in remote parts of the Andes mountains and jungles, financed largely by illegal mining, drug trafficking, and extortion. 

Unlike the FARC, the ELN has refused to lay down its weapons and has continued attacking government forces, oil pipelines and other targets. President Ivan Duque, who took office in August 2018, has demanded the ELN release all hostages and stop criminal activities before peace talks can begin.

However, that hardline stance has led to an increase in violence. Military operations against the ELN this year have led to dozens of deaths on both sides and thousands of civilians displaced from their homes, according to rights groups. The ELN has planted more land mines and bombs, and stepped up kidnappings and attacks on infrastructure like oil pipelines.

“The government's strategy toward the ELN is clearly not working and needs to change,” said Jorge Alarcon, an analyst at the National Foundation for Political and Social Research, an independent think tank. “The increased military action has only provoked a dangerous escalation of violence without achieving substantial results.” 

Critics argue the only path to reducing violence is to resume peace talks with the ELN. Three previous government attempts at peace negotiations with the ELN failed, but some analysts say the success of the FARC accord shows that peace pacts can work if there is political will. The FARC has transformed into a political party, though small breakaway groups remain.

Continuing fighting shows the ELN still poses a formidable threat, and many question whether Colombia's military can defeat a guerrilla army that has survived for over 50 years in the bushes and jungles of this South American nation. The insurgents continue to attract recruits despite lacking the widespread public support they had decades ago. As long as that remains the case, Colombia will struggle to rid itself of its oldest guerrilla foe.
