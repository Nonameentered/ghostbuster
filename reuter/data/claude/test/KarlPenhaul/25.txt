Here is a 750-word news article with the headline: Colombia braces for second nationwide trucker strike in five months, threatening coffee exports:

Colombia's government scrambled Tuesday  to mitigate the effects of a planned second nationwide truckers strike in 5 months that threatens to disrupt the transportation of goods, including the country's key coffee exports. 

The truckers union announced plans for an indefinite strike starting at midnight to protest the high cost of fuel and tolls as well as low freight payments. The walkout comes just as the South American nation was recovering from a peak in coronavirus cases and a nationwide lockdown that battered the economy.

Truckers are considered an essential sector, so not complying with the strike is allowed under local regulations. But in the past, such stoppages have often turned violent, with strikers intimidating those who continue to work. The government deployed extra military presence along highways and beefed up security for the Port of Buenaventura, the main exit point for coffee, which is Colombia's top export and largest source of foreign income.

"We understand the truckers' demands, but a strike will seriously hurt the economy at a time when we're trying to reactivate it," said Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco. "We call for responsibility, prudence and invite truckers to engage in dialogue."

Talks between truckers and the government over a relief package have stalled in recent weeks. Truckers are seeking fuel subsidies, toll reductions and a minimum price for freight transport to offset losses from the pandemic. So far the government has only offered fuel credits.

Colombia's economy is projected to contract 7.9% this year, its deepest recession in decades. The coffee industry has not been spared, with sales to cafes and restaurants down during widespread lockdowns globally. Now exports are under threat, with trucks the main mode of transport for coffee beans from fields to ports.

The truckers union represents about half of Colombia's overland cargo transporters. A nationwide strike in December lasted 11 days and cost the economy close to $4 billion, according to the government. In recent years, truckers have staged periodic protests and roadblocks that have at times cut off transit between major cities and industrial areas.‚Äù
