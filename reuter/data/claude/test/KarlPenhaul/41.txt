Red Cross warns of potential obstacles in securing release of Colombian soldiers held by guerrillas 

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned this week that there are still significant obstacles to overcome before the release of 11 Colombian soldiers held captive for nearly a month by dissident rebels along the border with Venezuela. The soldiers were captured during a clash between Colombian security forces and a holdout faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas that rejected a 2016 peace accord.

ICRC representatives were able to visit the captive soldiers and reported that they are in stable condition. However, the aid group noted that the release process will be "complex" and "delicate." The Red Cross acts as a neutral intermediary in such situations and will continue to push for the safe release of the prisoners, but they cannot compel the guerrillas to act. Observers worry that the dissident group is using the captives as political leverage to gain recognition as an armed branch separate from the FARC. They are demanding legal status as combatants as a precondition for the release.

The Colombian government has refused to grant such status and considers the dissident faction to be criminals and terrorists. President Ivan Duque has said his government will not "accept blackmail" to obtain the soldiers' freedom. However, Duque is under intense pressure from the public and families of the captives to secure their safe return. The Red Cross has asked all sides to exercise patience, caution and good faith during the negotiations.

The captives were taken during fighting on March 23 near the town of Tumaco along the Pacific coast. Two other soldiers were killed in the clash. Duque has ordered intensified military operations in the region to combat the FARC dissidents, one of several armed groups involved in drug trafficking and other illegal activities along the porous border. The dissidents are believed to number up to 2,500 fighters, including some who refused to join the peace process that largely ended five decades of conflict in Colombia.
