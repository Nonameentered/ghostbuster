Colombian Union Leaders Launch Nationwide Strike, Impact on Economy Still Unclear

Union leaders and labor activists in Colombia launched an open-ended national strike today to protest what they say are the government's faulty economic policies and failure to protect workers. Thousands of people took to the streets in major cities across Colombia, calling for changes to tax, pension and wage laws. Roadblocks and marches disrupted transit operations in Bogota, Medellin and Cali, with more protests planned for the coming days.

The strike's organizers want the government of President Ivan Duque to reverse economic reforms passed last year that cut business taxes and raised the retirement age. They argue the measures favor big companies over working class Colombians and undermine the country's fragile peace process. "We're sending a clear message that policies made to benefit private companies and punish workers will not stand," said Di√≥genes Orjuela, president of the Central Union of Workers, one of the largest union federations.

The Colombian economy grew at a lackluster 1.4% rate last year, prompting the government to pass reforms aimed at attracting more foreign investment. But the changes to the tax code have significantly reduced government revenue at the same time public spending is rising to incorporate ex-combatants under the country's 2016 peace deal. Many analysts worry the combination of tax cuts and higher costs have left a gaping hole in the budget, one which could be exacerbated by an economic slowdown. 

The government insists the tax reform was necessary to stir growth and that its policies supporting private enterprise will benefit all Colombians through job creation and increased prosperity over the long run. However, the measures have proved deeply unpopular, with Duque's approval rating dropping to under 30% in recent months. The national strike threatens to further undermine the administration by disrupting commerce and daily activities across the country. 

The central bank warned the multiple days of protests could shave up to 0.3 percentage points from Colombia's first quarter growth. Hotels, restaurants and retailers are bracing for lost revenue, as are exporters who use the nation's highways and ports to transport goods. The mining and oil industries have also scaled back operations. However, the overall impact on the $309 billion economy remains unclear and will depend on both the scale and duration of the strikes.

Duque called for peaceful demonstrations and promised to keep a close eye on the situation. But tensions are running high, and there are fears protests could turn violent, especially given Colombia's history of bloody labor disputes and clashes between leftist groups and the security forces. For now, all eyes are on union leaders as the country waits to see if they will keep their promise to sustain economic activities for weeks or possibly months in a high-stakes gamble to force political change.
