Violence in Colombia's "Banana Belt": Workers and Growers Caught in Crossfire of Guerrilla Conflict   

The lush green plantations of Colombia's Uraba region have long provided bananas to consumers around the world. But behind the placid façade of banana groves, violence simmers as leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries fight for control of this strategic region. With drug trafficking and organized crime now mixed into Colombia's decades-long civil conflict, the Uraba has become a key battleground that is taking a deadly toll on poor workers and small farmers caught in the crossfire.   

The fertile land and geographical location of Uraba, known as Colombia's “Banana Belt,” have made it a prize for armed groups seeking territory and influence. Guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) groups have battled paramilitary forces and the Colombian military for control of smuggling routes and coca plantations in the region. In May, four people were killed and 10 wounded in a gunfight when FARC dissidents attacked a village. Most victims were agricultural workers on banana plantations.  

“We are tired of the violence and killings. We just want to work our land in peace,” said banana worker Javier Dominguez. Like many in Uraba, he works for low wages at the mercy of armed groups. Violence, extortion, and forced displacement have been common. Thousands of farmers have fled their homes, leaving their land behind.  

Small farmers are also at risk. Last month, a paramilitary group killed a local banana grower who refused to sell his land. “They said if I didn't leave, they would kill me,” said farmer Luis Ruiz. After the murder, Ruiz abandoned his three-hectare farm and sought refuge in a nearby town. "There is no future here as long as these armed men rule."  

The violence has economic consequences too, hurting both multinational fruit companies and family farms that produce Colombia's signature Cavendish bananas. Regional agricultural associations estimate violence and extortion have reduced banana production by nearly 30% over the past decade. The smaller harvest, lack of investment, and rising costs of security have caused many farms to close.  

“We face many difficulties to operate under these conditions,” said Pablo Rodriguez, manager of a large plantation owned by Dole Food Company. The U.S.-based multinational has seen a string of attacks on its trucks and warehouses by armed groups seeking payments. 

This tightening vortex of violence threatens an industry that employs over 100,000 Colombians while supplying 20% of the world's banana exports. Although the Colombian government has pledged protections for farmers and workers in the Uraba, many doubt real progress can be made until the region stabilizes and rule of law takes hold. Farmers, workers, and companies alike clamor for sustainable peace and justice in Colombia's banana belt.
