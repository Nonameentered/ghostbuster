Colombian Senate approves bill to partially lift ban on extradition  

The Colombian Senate voted today to approve a bill that would partially lift the country's constitutional ban on extraditing its citizens to face prosecution elsewhere. The bill, which passed 72-25 in the Senate, would allow for the extradition of Colombian nationals accused of drug trafficking and terrorism offenses, but retain the ban for all other crimes.

The bill comes amid pressure from the United States, which has sought the extradition of several high-profile accused drug traffickers and terrorists who have taken refuge in Colombia. The administration of new Colombian President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, supports the change as a way to improve cooperation with the U.S. on law enforcement matters. 

However, critics argue the bill threatens civil liberties and opens the door to abuse. Senator Ivan Cepeda, who voted against the bill, said "we can't expose our citizens to foreign judicial systems that lack sufficient legal protections." The Constitutional Court will now review the bill and must approve it before it becomes law.

Colombia banned the extradition of nationals in its constitution of 1991 due to concerns about human rights abuses and unfair trials abroad. The constitutional prohibition has long frustrated U.S. anti-narcotics efforts, as major drug traffickers were able to escape prosecution by taking refuge in Colombia. The leaders of the former Cali and Medellin drug cartels, for example, were never extradited to the U.S. before their deaths.

In recent years, as Colombia's justice system has strengthened, attitudes have softened toward extradition in some cases. Colombia extradited hundreds of persons to the U.S. in 2018, but none were Colombian nationals. The new bill aims to change that, while still not exposing nationals to the risk of extradition for ordinary crimes.

Supporters say the compromise approach in the bill strikes a balance between respecting civil liberties and joining international cooperation against transnational criminal threats like terrorism and drug trafficking. But critics argue there are not sufficient legal protections to guarantee fair treatment of extradited individuals and warn this could undermine Colombia's sovereignty. The Constitutional Court will have the final say on whether the bill achieves the right balance. Overall, the partial lifting of Colombia's extradition ban could signal closer security cooperation with the U.S. but also potential risks to civil rights.
