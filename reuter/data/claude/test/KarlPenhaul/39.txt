Judge Criticized for Ordering Arrest of Colombia's Army Chief Amid Leftist Guerrilla Offensive 

The chief of Colombia's army, General Eduardo Zapateiro, was ordered arrested on Tuesday by a Colombian judge over accusations that the military failed to protect civilians during an offensive by leftist guerrillas earlier this month. The judge's decision has sparked criticism from the Colombian government, military officials and analysts who argue arresting the army chief in the midst of the guerrilla offensive is unjust and threatens national security.

General Zapateiro and other military leaders have been accused of failing to protect rural villagers in the Cauca region in southwest Colombia during attacks by fighters from the National Liberation Army, or ELN, one of Colombia's largest remaining guerrilla groups. The attacks earlier this month killed at least six civilians, wounded more than a dozen others and displaced hundreds of people from their homes, according to government officials and human rights groups.   

In a statement, Colombia's military denied allegations that it failed to protect civilians in Cauca. President Ivan Duque called the judge's decision "unjust"  and said he fully backed General Zapateiro. Some analysts argued that arresting the army chief would hand a propaganda victory to the ELN and undermine military operations at an critical moment. The ELN has stepped up attacks in recent months during its "armed strike" against the government.

Others defended the judge's decision as a lawful step to hold military leaders accountable for alleged failures to protect civilians at risk. Paula Lorena Gallo, a lawyer who filed a lawsuit on behalf of the families displaced in Cauca, told The New York Times the arrest warrant was an important message that "there will be consequences"  when civilians are harmed.

The legal standoff comes amid reports the ELN may be planning more attacks in the coming days. With General Zapateiro ordered arrested, it remains unclear who will assume command of Colombia's army and whether military counter-insurgency operations may be affected. The judge has reportedly given General Zapateiro 48 hours to turn himself in to authorities.
