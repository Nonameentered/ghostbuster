Colombia Prepares for Largest National Strike in 20 Years, Police and Military on High Alert

Colombia is bracing for a massive nationwide strike on Thursday, November 21, that is expected to be the largest in two decades. Many Colombians will protest against the economic and social policies of President Ivan Duque's administration. The Colombian government has deployed thousands of police and military forces to cities across the country in anticipation of large demonstrations that could potentially turn violent. 

Trade unions, student organizations, opposition political parties, and other civil society groups have called for a strike to protest pension reforms, rising inequality, privatization of state companies, and other issues. Protest organizers expect over 1 million people to participate in events across Colombia's 32 departments. The protests are set to coincide with other planned demonstrations on issues like climate change, women's rights and corruption.

"This will be the biggest protest in Colombia in the last 20 years," said Diogenes Orjuela, president of the country's largest trade union. "We call on all Colombians to join this civic strike to say 'no more' to the policies of a government that has sought to make workers and the middle class bear the brunt of an economic crisis."

The Duque administration has warned that there are "dark interests" behind the national strike that aim to damage the country's economy and democratic institutions. Officials called for respecting the constitutional right to protest while rejecting violence and unlawful behavior. Over 170,000 police and military personnel will stand guard to "guarantee order and protect the lives and property of all Colombians," according to Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo. 

There are fears that the protests could descend into chaos, as some demonstrations in Colombia have turned violent in the past. The mayor of Cali, the country's third largest city, has issued a decree banning protests for the day due to credible threats of violence. The mayor of Bogota has asked businesses to close for the day as a precaution. Colombia's borders will also be closed starting Wednesday night.

The national strike will be an early test for the Duque administration, which has faced rising discontent over its policies since taking office in August 2018. How the government manages security during the protests and responds to citizens' demands could set the tone for its remaining time in office. Critics argue the government must do more to address inequality and protect the most vulnerable in Colombian society. Supporters counter that Duque is taking necessary reform measures to ensure sustainable economic growth following the peace agreement with FARC rebels. The outcome of Thursday's national protests could significantly impact the direction of that debate.
