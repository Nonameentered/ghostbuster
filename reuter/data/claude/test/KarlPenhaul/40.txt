Colombia Faces Coffee Stockpile Crisis Amidst Poor Harvest Predictions and Damaged Beans

Colombia, the world's third-largest coffee producer, is facing a crisis of oversupply that could significantly impact the global coffee market. The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (FNC) announced this week that the country is sitting on a massive stockpile of over 13 million 132-pound bags of coffee beans due to a confluence of factors. 

The harvest for the 2020-2021 growing season was one of the smallest in decades, yielding only 12 million bags compared to the usual 14 million. The smaller crop has been attributed to adverse weather conditions, including excessive rain during key parts of the growing season. The heavy rains caused fungus and other damage to many coffee cherries, reducing the overall yield.

At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for coffee from Colombia's biggest customers, especially cafes and restaurants in the United States and Europe. With business limited or halted altogether, many coffee shops have suspended or canceled orders. The FNC estimates the drop in sales could be as high as 35-40% this year.

The surging supply and plunging demand have combined to create the huge surplus and a crisis for coffee farmers. The excess stockpiles are straining storage capacity in a country where coffee is by far the biggest agricultural export and source of rural income. Coffee farmers are already receiving much lower prices for their beans, threatening livelihoods across Colombia's coffee-growing regions.

Industry experts predict the oversupply situation could worsen over the coming year. The next harvest beginning in October is poised to yield a larger crop, possibly 15 million bags or more. At the same time, demand is expected to rebound only gradually as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and economies slowly recover.  

The Colombian government has announced measures to buy and store surplus coffee to support prices in the short term. They are also working to boost promotion of Colombian coffee in Asia and Oceania to diversify export markets. However, the coffee glut is a sign of larger issues around climate change, international market fluctuations, and economic vulnerability that Colombia must grapple with to strengthen its coffee sector long-term. The crisis serves as a call to action to make the Colombian coffee industry more sustainable and resilient in the face of unprecedented challenges.
