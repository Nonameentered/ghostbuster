Colombia's Public Workers' Strike Paused by Nation's Soccer Obsession

Bogota, Colombia - Colombia's national soccer team has inadvertently halted a weeks-long strike by more than 250,000 public sector workers demanding an increase in wages and more resources. The Copa America soccer tournament, currently being hosted in Brazil, has gripped the attention of Colombia's citizens and caused the unions leading the protests to temporarily pause their rallies and marches. 

The strike began on May 16, with teachers, healthcare workers, university staff and others walking off the job and taking to the streets. Unions are asking the government to invest more in public services, especially in the wake of the economic impacts from COVID-19. With inflation rising and the increased hardships faced by working families in Colombia, unions argue that public workers cannot continue with current wage levels.

However, on June 13, Colombia's national team, nicknamed Los Cafeteros (the Coffee Pickers), beat Ecuador 1-0 in their opening match of Copa America. The excitement around the team's quest for their second Copa America title led the strike organizers to put their protests on hold for the duration of Colombia's matches in the tournament. “We know Colombia will be focused on the soccer matches right now, so we are pausing mobilization until after the game against Venezuela on 20 June,” said union leader Carlos Torres. 

The situation highlights the immense popularity of soccer in Colombia and its ability to unite the nation. Colombia has qualified for the last two World Cups after missing the previous 16 tournaments, feeding into growing passion for the sport. But unions warn the government not to interpret the pause in strikes as the end of their demands. “The strike will continue as soon as Colombia's matches have finished,” said Torres. “Our goals remain the same – we need improved wages and funding for health, education and all public services.”  

The government has so far refused unions' demands, claiming wage increases are unaffordable. But with protests likely to resume as soon as Colombia's run in Copa America ends, they will face renewed pressure to address issues raised by public sector workers. For now though, all eyes in Colombia remain fixed on the soccer pitch.
