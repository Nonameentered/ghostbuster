Thousands Flock to Security Expo in Kidnap-Prone Colombia  

Bogota, Colombia - Despite Colombia's reputation for frequent kidnappings and violent crime, over 50,000 people attended the Securexpo security and defense trade show this week in the capital city of Bogota. The growing event highlights both the ongoing security challenges in Colombia as well as the huge demand for solutions.

Colombia has one of the highest rates of kidnappings in the world, with estimates ranging from 500 to 3,000 kidnappings per year. Victims are often wealthy business executives or their family members, targeted by criminal gangs and former rebel groups looking to extract large ransoms. In response, sales of armored vehicles, bodyguards, GPS tracking systems and other security services have been booming in Colombia.

At Securexpo, over 300 exhibitors showed off the latest security gadgets and technologies, from aerial drones and armored limousines to biometric access control systems and tactical assault gear. Despite the grim context, the mood at the show was upbeat and hopeful.  

"While there are still many security problems, the situation has improved a lot over the past decade," said Santiago Gomez, CEO of Seguridad Total, a Bogota-based security firm. "The government has made progress against terrorist groups and crime is down in many areas. People feel more confident investing in their security and safety."

Colombia's economy has also experienced solid growth, with a rapidly growing middle and upper class able to afford pricey security services. Foreign investors and business leaders are also major customers, looking to protect both VIPs as well as company facilities in Colombia.  

Although criticism remains that too much spending goes to private security rather than public services, for both citizens and businesses in Colombia security has clearly become a top priority and reliable—if troubled—growth industry. Overall, Securexpo highlighted that while Colombia still has a long way to go to address violence and criminal threats, progress is being made—one security system at a time.
