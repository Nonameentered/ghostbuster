Colombian truck drivers' union announces nationwide strike in April, but coffee exporters remain unfazed

The main truck drivers' union in Colombia, ACCIT, announced yesterday that it will organize an indefinite nationwide strike starting April 1 to protest rising fuel costs and tolls. The strike threatens to disrupt supply chains across the country, but Colombia's coffee export sector says it will remain largely unaffected.   

ACCIT represents over 350,000 truck drivers in Colombia. The union accuses the Colombian government of failing to control increases in diesel prices and tolls on highways, cutting into truck drivers' profit margins. "We have been in negotiations with the government for months, but they have been unwilling to address our concerns. We have no choice but to shut down if we want our voices to be heard," said ACCIT President Miguel Sanchez.

A nationwide strike by truck drivers could hamper the availability of food, fuel, and other goods across Colombia's cities. However, the strike is unlikely to impact Colombia's largest export industry – coffee. Over 90% of Colombia's coffee is transported from farms to ports by rail, not trucks. "Our supply chain is designed specifically to avoid reliance on truck transport, so we expect no disruptions to coffee exports or harvest activities," said Alejandro Cadena, CEO of the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. 

Colombia exported over 13 million 60-kilo bags of coffee in 2019, according to the Federation. Coffee exports account for 25% of Colombia's total export revenue. The April 1 truck drivers' strike coincides with the tail end of the main coffee harvest in Colombia, butinterruptions are not anticipated. "By April, the vast majority of the current harvest will already have made its way by train from farms to ports for export,” said Cadena. “So we do not expect any major delays or issues as a result of the strike.”

International coffee buyers also appear unconcerned about the impending truck drivers' action. "We source most of our specialty coffee from Colombia during this time of year, but do not expect any disruptions based on what the coffee organizations are telling us," said Mauricio Salazar, head coffee buyer for an international coffee trading house. 

The Colombian government has yet to respond to the truck drivers' announced strike. Government negotiators see truck drivers' demands on fuel subsidies and toll pricing as unreasonable. However, with elections coming up next year, the government risks angering a large sector of voters if the strike results in food and supply shortages across the country. The government may have little choice but to come back to the negotiating table to resolve truck drivers' concerns before the effects of a prolonged strike are felt nationwide. For now, however, Colombia's all-important coffee export industry will keep calm and carry on.
