Violent clashes in Bogota as nationwide strike by state workers begins 

Bogota, Colombia—Violent clashes broke out in Colombia's capital city today as hundreds of thousands of state workers launched an indefinite nationwide strike to protest the economic policies of President Ivan Duque. The strike threatens to paralyze government services across the country.  

The National Strike Committee, comprising major labor unions representing teachers, healthcare workers and public sector employees, called the strike to protest Duque's proposed tax reform and alleged neglect of key public services. Colombia has seen a significant economic slowdown this year, with growth projected to be just 2.4% in 2019 according to the IMF, sparking fears of job losses and funding cuts for government agencies.

Protesters marched through the center of Bogota today, banging drums and pots and carrying banners denouncing the Duque administration. The protests started peacefully but descended into violence as small groups of protesters clashed with riot police, who used tear gas and flash bang grenades to disperse the crowds. At least 13 protesters and 5 police officers were injured, according to local media reports. The mayor's office estimates 22,000 protesters participated in the march. 

Iván Cepeda, a senator from the left-leaning Polo Democratico party, voiced support for the strike, tweeting: "The people are exercising their right to protest against an insensitive government that has forgotten about them." However, Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla criticized the strike as "counterproductive" and said it would cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars. Duque insisted his government remains open to dialogue while calling for an end to violence.

Most schools, universities and healthcare facilities were closed today as teachers and medical workers walked out. The local transit system in Bogota also halted operations, disrupting traffic in the city of over 8 million people. The strike committee has called for another massive protest on Wednesday as the open-ended strike continues with no end in sight. The deepening political crisis poses a major challenge for Duque just 15 months after he took office, with his approval rating slumping to just 30% according to recent polls.  

The escalating unrest in Colombia comes as neighboring countries like Chile and Bolivia have also seen violent protests in recent months, fueled by rising inequality and dissatisfaction with incumbent leaders. The regional instability has alarmed politicians and investors in a continent struggling to regain economic momentum. There are fears that the social upheaval in Colombia could intensify if the government fails to effectively address the concerns raised by protesters in the coming weeks.
