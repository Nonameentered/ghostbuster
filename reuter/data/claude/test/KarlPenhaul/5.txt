Nationwide strike planned in Colombia over pay and labor rights 

Colombia is bracing for a massive nationwide strike today as workers demand higher pay, improved labor rights, and better protections from threats and violence. Unions representing more than 350,000 workers have called for a 24-hour nationwide strike and protest in response to what they say is a failure by the government to address serious concerns over labor conditions.

The strike is expected to impact major sectors of the Colombian economy, including mining, public transportation, education, and health care. Many schools have cancelled classes in anticipation of the strike, while some hospitals have said they will operate with limited staff. Major transit systems in cities like Bogota and Medellin are expected to halt operations for the day.  

Union leaders argue that workers in Colombia face poor pay, long hours, job insecurity, and health and safety issues. They point out that the minimum wage in Colombia is only about $250 USD per month, not enough to afford basic necessities. Unions also highlight threats and violence against labor leaders and organizers, with hundreds killed in Colombia over the last 30 years according to human rights groups. 

The government has criticized the planned strike, saying it will hurt the economy which is already facing significant challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, union leaders counter that the government has failed to seriously address workers’ outstanding concerns despite previous protests and calls for action. They say a mass nationwide strike is necessary to force the government to come to the negotiating table and discuss key demands around pay, job protections, and ensuring the safety of workers and their representatives.

While today’s strike is meant to be peaceful, some fear it may lead to clashes between protesters and security forces. The government has warned that any "illegal or violent" actions will not be tolerated. However, if today’s events proceed largely without incident, it may put additional pressure on the government to work towards reasonable solutions to address the demands of Colombian workers for fairer pay and treatment, as well as respect and protection. Overall, the unions see this as a pivotal moment for labor rights in Colombia.
