Army Stations Troops in Strategic Areas of Colombia Ahead of State Workers' Strike

The Colombian government today deployed army troops in strategic locations around the country's major cities in anticipation of a nationwide strike by government workers planned for tomorrow. The strike, organized by Colombia's largest public sector union, is expected to paralyze public services across the country.

In a statement, the Ministry of Defense said army units would be stationed at "key infrastructure points" to ensure public order during the strike. The troops have been deployed in areas such as airports, bus stations, and major roads and highways. The Ministry called on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and avoid violence or property damage.

The strike is the latest in a series of actions by public sector workers demanding higher wages and increased funding for health, education, and public services. Union leaders accuse the government of President Ivan Duque of failing to fulfill campaign promises around improving public services and the living standards of government employees.  

"The government makes a lot of promises but doesn't deliver," said Jorge Medrano, president of the National Union of Public Servants. "While the cost of living keeps going up, our wages have been frozen. Enough is enough. It's time for President Duque to honor his word or face the consequences."

The government condemned the strike plans as "irresponsible" and "illegal." In a televised address, President Duque said, "We cannot allow vital public services to grind to a halt. My government is open to dialogue, but we will not negotiate under pressure or duress." Duque called on workers to report for duty as usual.

The strike is expected to impact health services, public transportation, ports, and airports across Colombia. Many schools have announced closures in anticipation of the walkout. Major unions in sectors like mining and agriculture have pledged support for the action and may join the strike.  

If it proceeds as planned, this week's nationwide strike will be the biggest faced by the Duque administration since it took office in 2018. While public sector wages have declined in real terms over the last decade, the cost of living in Colombia has continued to rise, squeezing working families that depend on government salaries and services.
