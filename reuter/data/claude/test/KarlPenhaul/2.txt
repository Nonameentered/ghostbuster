Leftist guerrillas escape government troops after deadly four-day battle in Colombia 

A group of 200 leftist guerrillas engaged in a fierce four-day battle with Colombian government forces in the southern jungles near Florencia in Caquetá department. In pitched fighting, 23 soldiers and 17 guerrillas were killed before the rebels escaped on the night of January 10 under the cover of heavy rain and low visibility.

The firefight began on January 7 when an army patrol stumbled upon a temporary camp established by fighters of the Marxist insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). In the initial clash, five soldiers and two guerrillas were killed. Reinforcements were rushed to the area by both sides, setting the stage for an extended battle over difficult, hilly terrain.

Using mortars and machine guns, the army pounded FARC positions for three days. However, the well-entrenched guerrillas responded with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s, killing 18 more soldiers over the course of the fighting. “It was combat at close range, at times only 50 or 60 meters separated the two sides. The terrorists fought viciously to escape the troops that had surrounded them,” said General Javier Pérez, the commanding officer of army forces in the region.

On the night of January 10, the FARC troops forded a river under cover of heavy tropical rain to escape the army’s encirclement. By the time the weather cleared, the guerrillas had vanished into Caquetá’s dense jungles. General Pérez admitted his troops had lost track of the FARC column during the nocturnal escape. “They used the rain and darkness to give us the slip, but we will continue operations in the area until we have defeated this terrorist cell,” he vowed.

The prolonged battle was the deadliest clash between government and rebel forces so far this year. It also highlighted the challenges facing President Ernesto Samper in achieving an end to Colombia’s 50-year-old internal conflict. Peace talks with the FARC resumed in December but have yielded little progress. Analysts say the Florencia battle underscores the FARC’s reluctance to seriously pursue negotiations at this time.
