Refugee Crisis Escalates in Northwest Colombia as Hundreds Flee Violence and Army Accuses Guerrillas  

Over 500 refugees fled violence in northwest Colombia this week, crossing into Panama to escape threats and killings by armed groups. The Colombian army accused the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group of driving the mass displacement of civilians near the Panama border. 

The refugee crisis began on Tuesday when over 300 residents of the village of La Espriella fled into Panama. They reported that the ELN had threatened to kill anyone who remained in the village and burned several homes. On Wednesday, another 200 refugees from nearby villages crossed into Panama with stories of ELN harassment and violence.

The governor of Choco department, which borders Panama, confirmed that at least 510 Colombians had fled across the border this week due to threats from illegal armed groups. "These communities are being subjected to confinement, threats, and destruction of their property by illegal groups that are fighting for control of drug trafficking routes," said Governor Ariel Palacios.

In a statement, the Colombian army said the ELN was responsible for the displacement and called on the group to cease hostilities against civilians. The ELN is Colombia's largest remaining guerrilla group with over 2,000 fighters. While it officially began peace talks with the government in 2017, clashes with the military and violence against civilians have continued in parts of Colombia.

Representatives from the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross traveled to the Colombia-Panama border region to provide humanitarian assistance, including shelter, food, and medical aid. However, the Red Cross reported that access to some border areas remained limited due to the security situation.

The refugee crisis highlights the precarious security situation in remote parts of Colombia as armed groups continue to fight for control of drug smuggling routes and illegal gold mines. Although the 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) led to the demobilization of over 13,000 guerrilla fighters, violence persists in some regions. The UN has warned that more refugees could flee into Panama if the Colombia government and the ELN are unable to reach a ceasefire.
