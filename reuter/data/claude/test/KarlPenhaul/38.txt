President Samper urges prisoners to release hostages and surrender in Valledupar jail siege  

President Ernesto Samper today urged prisoners involved in an ongoing hostage crisis at a jail in Valledupar, Colombia to release their captives immediately and surrender to authorities. Over 200 inmates at the Valledupar prison took control of one wing of the facility yesterday morning and are currently holding 12 guards and administrative staff hostage. 

In a televised statement, President Samper insisted that the government will not negotiate with the prisoners and demanded their "total and unconditional surrender." The president said giving in to their demands would only lead to more disorder and instability in Colombia's notoriously mismanaged prison system. "We cannot allow a small group of dangerous individuals to undermine the rule of law and imperil the lives of innocent people," Samper said.

The unrest began as a protest over poor living conditions and lack of access to basic services in the overcrowded jail. However, events escalated when a group of inmates took up weapons they had smuggled into the prison and captured a number of guards and staff. They are threatening to kill one hostage every six hours unless their demands for improved facilities, extra family visits and transfer to lower security institutions are met.

Security forces have surrounded the perimeter of the Valledupar prison, but have not yet stormed the facility for fear of provoking violence against the hostages. Colombia's security director Alvaro Uribe is overseeing the government's response to the crisis and said in a statement that "all options are on the table." However, President Samper has ruled out negotiating with the prisoners or meeting their demands. 

Families of hostages and inmates are gathered outside the prison gates, with fears rising over the fate of their loved ones as the crisis continues into a second day. The Red Cross has called on both sides to avoid violence and find a swift, peaceful resolution before lives are lost. However, with the government refusing to compromise and prisoners not backing down from their positions, there are concerns the standoff could lead to a bloody confrontation if negotiations do not start soon. 

The Valledupar prison siege is the latestexample of the dire state of Colombia's prison system, which suffers from massive overcrowding, lack of funding, and endemic corruption according to human rights groups. They argue that chronic mismanagement and neglect in the system have turned many of the nation's jails into powder kegs that frequently explode into violence.
