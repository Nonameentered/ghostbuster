Release of 70 Captured Troops Could Signal End to Latin America's Longest Guerrilla Insurgency or Start of All-Out War, Say Analysts  

The shocking release of 70 soldiers captured by Colombian Marxist guerrillas earlier this week has analysts divided on whether this gesture signifies a breakthrough towards peace or the calm before an all-out storm of violence.

The soldiers were captured in combat over the past several months by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's oldest and largest Marxist guerrilla group. Their surprise release on Tuesday came just weeks before peace talks between the FARC and the Colombian government were set to resume in Cuba.  

The FARC said the unilateral release of prisoners was a gesture of goodwill to demonstrate their commitment to peace. But skeptics argue the move could be a stalling tactic to gain political leverage before potential attacks. 

"This could be a genuine first step toward a ceasefire and disarmament," said Jorge Santander, a Colombia expert at the University of the Andes. "But there is also a real risk the FARC will use this gesture to appear reasonable before unleashing more violence to gain advantage in negotiations."

Colombia's civil war has dragged on for over 50 years, leaving at least 250,000 people dead and over 7 million displaced. Several previous attempts at peace talks have failed, leaving many Colombians wary of the FARC's intentions this time.

President Juan Manuel Santos expressed "cautious optimism" over the release of prisoners but said Colombia's military would not let down its guard. "We will not stop confronting this scourge of terrorism with all the legitimate force of the State," he said.
