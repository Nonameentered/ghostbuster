Colombian State Employees Launch Nationwide Strike with Support from Leftist Rebels

Thousands of Colombian state employees launched a nationwide strike today, demanding higher wages and improved benefits. The strike threatens to paralyze major cities and disrupt public services across the country. In a show of solidarity, the Marxist rebel group ELN has vowed to support the striking workers. 

The strike was called by Colombia's main public sector union, Fensuagro, which represents over 120,000 teachers, healthcare workers, and other government employees. Union leaders are demanding a 20% wage increase to account for rising costs of living as well as greater funding for health insurance and pensions. “State workers can barely survive on the wages we are paid. We have no choice but to go on strike,” said union spokesman Carlos Torres.

Within hours of the strike launching, buses and trash collection were halted in Bogota, the capital city, as transit workers and sanitation crews joined the work stoppages. Hospitals were left short-staffed as many doctors, nurses, and support staff walked off the job, delaying some surgeries and non-emergency care. Flights were also disrupted in several cities where air traffic controllers refused to work. 

The strike came as peace talks between the Colombian government and ELN rebels remain stalled. In a public statement, the ELN's top commander expressed “total solidarity” with the striking workers and criticized the government for failing to meet their demands for fair pay and working conditions. The rebel group did not explicitly threaten violent actions but said it would take "all necessary measures" to support the strike. The government has condemned the ELN's backing of the strike and urged the group not to interfere.

With the strike poised to continue for at least 48 hours, tensions are rising across Colombia. The government has threatened to fire state workers who do not return to work, while union leaders say they are prepared to prolong the strike indefinitely until their demands are met. The support of the ELN rebels adds an ominous dimension to the crisis and raises fears of potential clashes if the government moves to forcibly curb the strikes. After decades of civil war, a fragile peace remains in Colombia, but this week's unrest serves as a reminder of the deep social and political divisions that still persist in the country.
