Drug Gangsters Threaten to Kill Journalists over Extradition in Colombia

A violent drug trafficking gang in Colombia has issued death threats against several journalists in the country in retaliation for their coverage of a recent extradition case. The threats from the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug gang, were made in a video circulated on social media this week.  

In the two-minute video, six armed men claiming to represent the Gulf Clan said that three journalists who work for Colombian media companies would become military targets if they continue to report on the legal case against Dairo Antonio Úsuga, the leader of the gang who is currently awaiting extradition to the United States. The journalists were warned to stop disseminating "false information" about the case or they would be assassinated.

The threatened journalists have been placed under the protection of Colombia's National Protection Unit, an agency that provides security for human rights defenders, journalists, and others under threat. But media freedom groups and human rights organizations have expressed alarm over the threats and warned that they constitute a major attack on press freedom in Colombia.

"These death threats are an attempt to intimidate journalists and censor the media", said Beatriz Tello, director of Fundalibre, a press freedom NGO in Colombia. "It is unacceptable that journalists have to fear for their lives just for doing their jobs. The government needs to take strong action against these threats and ensure that journalists can report freely without risking their lives."

The Gulf Clan, also known as the Gaitanistas Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, is the country's largest drug trafficking gang and controls much of the cocaine trade. Úsuga, known as Otoniel, took over leadership of the group in 2012. The gang has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, which is seeking Úsuga's extradition on drug smuggling charges. His arrest and extradition would be a major blow to the group, hence the threats aimed at journalists reporting on the case.

The latest threats demonstrate the immense dangers that journalists in Colombia face in covering organized crime and drug trafficking. According to Fundalibre, four journalists were murdered in Colombia in 2017 in relation to their work. Self-censorship has become common as many journalists avoid reporting on sensitive issues like corruption and organized crime due to fears for their safety.
