National strike set to begin in Colombia, but analysts predict little threat to ruling order  

A nationwide 24-hour strike is set to begin today in Colombia organized by trade unions, student groups, and indigenous organizations to protest labor reforms and economic policy under President Iván Duque. The strike aims to bring the country to a standstill, with unions expecting millions to take part to show discontent with Duque's government. However, political analysts predict the strike will do little to fundamentally threaten Duque's political standing or policy agenda.

Duque, a conservative, has faced criticism since taking office last year for tax, pension and labor reforms that unions argue will hurt workers and the middle class. Economic growth in Colombia has slowed in recent years and unemployment stands at over 10 percent. Protest leaders argue Duque's policies will exacerbate economic hardship and inequality.

"The government's economic model is leading us to ruin," said Diógenes Orjuela, president of the Central Union of Workers. "These protests are to defend our rights, defend our jobs, and demand a change in economic policy."

Today's planned strike would be the third major protest against Duque's government this year. But while demonstrations in November and April drew hundreds of thousands, analysts say Duque appears to remain in a stable political position. His approval rating has dipped but remains over 50 percent. 

"There is discontent but no major political crisis," said Sergio Guzmán, director of Colombia Risk Analysis. "Duque still seems to have the general support of the public as well as congress, so the protests are unlikely to lead to any major policy shifts or damage his ability to govern."

Duque and his cabinet have portrayed the strikes as politically motivated and overblown. They point to a $4.5 billion stimulus package passed in December and new proposals to boost job training and university funding as evidence the government is addressing economic challenges, though critics argue the measures are insufficient.

Controversial proposals like changes to lower the minimum wage for young workers, reduce payroll taxes and change rules around retirement withdrawals and pensions remain on the table, suggesting Duque will not back down from his policy vision in the face of protests.

Some analysts argue sustained mass demonstrations could eventually force the government's hand by damaging Duque's approval and credibility. But a single day strike is unlikely to constitute a severe threat.

"The bottom line is there is public frustration with the economy and government policies, but likely not enough to really shake things up politically at this point," said Ernesto Romero, a political scientist at National University. "The ball is in the government's court, but a day of protests alone probably won't force them into any major reversals." 

As Colombia faces continued economic troubles and inequality, more unrest may be on the horizon. But for today at least, analysts expect Colombia's government and ruling order to withstand the blow. Protest leaders promise this is just the beginning, but reversing Duque's political fortune will be an uphill climb.
