Racal Electronics in joint venture for potential 100 million stg savings on Bowman defence contract

Racal Electronics PLC announced today that it has entered a joint venture with General Dynamics UK Ltd to bid for the production phase of the Bowman battlefield communications system for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). The joint venture, called Racal-General Dynamics Communications Ltd, aims to generate cost savings of up to 100 million stg for the MoD through economies of scale in the production of the Bowman system. 

The Bowman system provides secure tactical voice and data communications for the UK armed forces. The MoD awarded a 620 million stg development contract for Bowman to Racal in 2001. The system has undergone trials and testing over the past several years and is now ready to move into full production to equip the UK's military units over the next decade.

The MoD is planning to put the Bowman production contract out for tender in early 2005. Forming the joint venture allows Racal and General Dynamics to pool their resources and expertise in advanced military communications and bid for the large-scale contract as a combined entity. Racal CEO Peter Davies said, "Racal and General Dynamics have a long history of working together on defence programs. By combining our capabilities for this program, we believe we will be able to generate substantial cost savings for the MoD through a cohesive approach to the design, development and production of this critical communications network."

General Dynamics is a leading US defence contractor, with annual revenues of over $10 billion US dollars. Its UK subsidiary, General Dynamics UK Ltd, employs 3,000 people and focuses on communications, combat systems, and electronics programs for the UK military. According to Roger Hatch, Managing Director of General Dynamics UK, "The Bowman program is strategically important for the future communications capabilities of Britain's armed forces. General Dynamics UK is deeply committed to this program, and partnering with Racal allows us to offer the best combination of technical and program-management expertise to ensure Bowman's affordability and success."

The joint venture plans to submit a bid for the production phase of Bowman following the MoD's release of the invitation to tender. If selected, the joint venture would take over production of the Bowman system, including responsibility for vehicle installations, infrastructure, training, and support services. The program is expected to continue for 10-15 years, providing long-term support and revenue stability to whoever secures the production contract. The substantial cost savings promised by the Racal-General Dynamics joint venture could make their bid very attractive as the MoD seeks to maximise the operational impact of its defence technology investments in a challenging budget environment.
