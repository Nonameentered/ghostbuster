Tomkins Plc announces sharp rise in half-year profits and rules out share buy-back for possible acquisitions instead  

Tomkins Plc, the engineering and manufacturing conglomerate, today announced a 23% increase in half-year profits and said it will not launch another share buy-back program. Instead, the company will retain capital for potential acquisitions to fuel further growth.

Pre-tax profits rose to £142 million in the six months to June 30th, up from £115 million in the same period last year. Revenues climbed 14% to £1.87 billion, reflecting strong demand in Tomkins’ primary markets including automotive, construction, and aerospace. The half-year dividend was raised 7% to 4.3p per share.

“This is another robust performance from Tomkins, with gains across most of our businesses,” said Tomkins' CEO Mark Jenkins. “Our investments in innovation and operational improvements are paying off and we have good momentum going into the second half. While macroeconomic conditions remain favourable, there are increasing signs of economic and political volatility globally. We are cautious but confident in Tomkins’ resilience.”

Tomkins’ share price was up over 4% in early trading as investors welcomed the better-than-expected results. However, shares gave up some of the gains after the company confirmed it does not plan to launch another share buy-back scheme over the next six months. Tomkins would prefer to retain its funds for potential acquisitions, indicating a desire to continue its transformation from a sprawling conglomerate into a more focused industrial group through targeted M&A. The company has made over 20 acquisitions in the last three years, the largest of which was the $2 billion purchase of aircraft components maker Brandon Technologies in early 2018.  

Analysts supported Tomkins’ acquisition-led growth strategy. “Buy-backs are nice but acquisitions that strengthen the business are even better, especially if Tomkins can demonstrate value creation from deals,” said a London-based analyst. “Tomkins has a solid track record on M&A so if it sees options to steadily acquire choice assets at reasonable prices, it makes sense to keep funds available for that purpose.”

However, some shareholders may be disappointed by the lack of near-term buy-backs which provide direct returns. Tomkins’ stock currently offers a below-market dividend yield of 2.3%, reflecting its growth-oriented strategy. The company said it will review future buy-backs once there is more clarity on potential deal-making opportunities and its impact on Tomkins’ balance sheet.
