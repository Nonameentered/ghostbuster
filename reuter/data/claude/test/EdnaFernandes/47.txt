Labour Party Pledges Public-Private Partnership and No Sell-Off of London Underground in Transport Plan 

The Labour Party today unveiled its vision for the future of London’s transport system, centered around continued public ownership and operation of the London Underground combined with private sector expertise and financing. In its London Transport Strategy, Labour commits to not selling off any part of the Tube network or other TfL services and to avoiding full privatization of operations.

Instead, Labour is proposing a model of “public-private partnership” in which private companies would be contracted to help build new infrastructure, improve existing assets, and operate certain services under the oversight and control of Transport for London. "London's transport system should remain publicly owned and operated for the benefit of all Londoners," said Sadiq Khan, Labour's candidate for London Mayor. "But we are open to harnessing the skills and resources of the private sector through fair, transparent partnership deals to help improve services, reduce costs, and invest in much-needed upgrades and expansion."  

The centrepiece of Labour’s plan is completing upgrades to signalling, rolling stock, and station infrastructure across the London Underground network through partnership deals with private suppliers and contractors. Labour also proposes partnering with private companies to operate some bus services, especially in outer London, and leveraging private investment and development around new transport hubs.  

At the same time, Labour says the Mayor and TfL must maintain full oversight over transport strategy, fares, service levels, and safety. And Labour pledges no privatization of operations for London Underground, buses, roads or Docklands Light Railway. "We will not sell off control or ownership of our public transit services or infrastructure," Khan said.

The Conservative candidate, Boris Johnson, has previously explored more wholesale privatization of the Tube network and other TfL services. But transport experts have warned that privatization of a integrated metro system as complex as the Tube could pose safety risks and lead to lack of coordination. Studies of transit systems in other cities that were fully privatized, such as Melbourne's, have found that privatization led to increased fares, less reliability, and lower customer satisfaction.

Labour argues that its public-private partnership model would harness private sector efficiencies and financing while retaining the benefits of direct public control and ownership. Transport unions and groups have reacted positively to Labour's proposals while arguing that close scrutiny needs to be paid to any deals or contracts with private companies. The Conservatives argue that fully private operation could reduce costs and increase innovation. With just six weeks until Londoners go to the polls, the future control and ownership of London's vast transport system remains a key issue of debate.
