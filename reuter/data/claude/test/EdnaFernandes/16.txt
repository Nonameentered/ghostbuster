UK auto-components group GKN Plc faces falling shares after $398 million damages awarded by US court verdict  

Shares of GKN Plc, a leading British auto-components group, fell sharply today after a US jury awarded $398 million in damages against the company in a civil case related to faulty production of its ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) components. The jury found that negligent design and manufacturing flaws in GKN's ADAS systems were responsible for a 2018 car accident that caused permanent injury to a passenger.

GKN's shares dropped over 12% in early London trading as investors reacted to the unexpectedly large damages awarded by the jury after a two-week trial in Pennsylvania. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by passenger Patricia Wilkey, who suffered spinal injuries from an accident in a Renault SUV equipped with GKN's ADAS system. Her lawyers argued that faults in the ADAS radar sensors and brake actuators made by GKN caused the vehicle to repeatedly accelerate and brake during cruise control, ultimately resulting in an accident where the SUV struck another vehicle at high speed. 

The jury agreed with Ms. Wilkey's claims that GKN's components were the proximate cause of the accident and awarded $15 million in compensatory damages as well as $383 million in punitive damages, intended to punish GKN for reckless behavior. The mammoth punitive award suggests the jury found GKN's actions amounted to gross negligence in their design and manufacturing processes. GKN said it "strongly disagreed" with the verdict and would appeal the outcome.

Legal experts said the ruling was a blow to GKN, one of the largest suppliers of automotive components for driver assistance and autonomous vehicle systems. "This verdict puts GKN's reputation squarely at risk and could impact their future sales and position as a trusted partner to car manufacturers," said Lawrence Sherman, a product liability lawyer. However, other observers noted that large punitive damages awards often do not withstand appeal and are reduced substantially. GKN's share price may continue to be volatile until there is further clarity on a likely appeals process, which could drag on for months or even years.
