British housing market on the up, but building material giants still suffer

The British housing market is showing signs of recovery after years of sluggish growth, as house prices and sales volumes continue their upward trend in recent months. House prices grew 5.1% in the year to November, the fastest rate since March 2016, according to the latest data from Nationwide. This marks the eighth consecutive month of annual price growth. 

At the same time, home sales have been rising, with residential property transactions increasing for the fourth month in a row in October, totalling 105,270 - the highest monthly figure so far this year, HMRC data shows. The turnaround in the property market follows the decisive election result in December and a greater degree of Brexit clarity in recent months. These have helped restore some confidence among homebuyers after years of political and economic uncertainty.

However, despite the improved conditions in the housing market, Britain’s major building materials companies are still suffering weak demand and pressure on profits. Travis Perkins, the UK’s biggest builders’ merchant, announced last week a drop in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of last year, especially from small builders and contractors. Its tool hire business also continued to struggle. 

Likewise, brickmaker Ibstock reported a 6% fall in full-year revenue, citing a marked slowdown in brick demand in the second half of 2019. The company said political and economic uncertainty meant housebuilders were delaying site starts and reducing work in progress. Meyer, another major building materials supplier, also posted a 2% drop in like-for-like revenue for 2019.

Industry analysts say building firms typically work through existing landbanks and material supplies before increasing output and purchasing additional materials in response to an upturn in demand. As such, the recent recovery in the housing market has yet to fully translate into greater demand for building products, as excess stocks are used up. However, if house prices and transactions continue rising over the next 6-12 months, building materials companies should start to see the benefit through accelerating sales.   

The share prices of Travis Perkins, Ibstock and other building suppliers remain under pressure, although many in the sector believe the fundamentals of the UK’s under-supplied housing market remain sound in the long run. After years of subdued activity, few expect another housing boom, but a period of steady and sustained growth would provide welcome relief, especially if it also bolsters demand in the home improvement market. For Britain’s building material giants, a broad-based recovery across the residential property sector can’t come soon enough. Overall, while the housing market may be on the up, the major suppliers are still suffering the hangover from the lean years. But if the upturn endures, their prospects should start looking brighter by the year’s end.
