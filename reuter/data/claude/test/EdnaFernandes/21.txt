Tomkins Plc Expected to Announce Rise in Half Year Profits and Possible Share Buyback

Industrial conglomerate Tomkins Plc is expected to announce an increase in profits for the first half of the financial year when it reports interim results next week. According to analysts’ consensus forecasts, profits before tax are set to rise by around 15% to £145m compared to £126m for the same period last year.  

The rise in profits is forecast to be driven by strong performances across Tomkins’ key divisions, including engineered products, building materials and automotive parts. The engineered products division is predicted to see revenues climb by over 20% thanks to new contract wins in the aerospace and rail sectors. Building materials, which produces insulation and roofing products, is set to benefit from increased construction activity in the UK housing market. Meanwhile, the automotive parts unit is expected to report higher profits from new overseas customers.

On the back of the improved results and upbeat outlook, Tomkins may announce plans for a share buyback programme when the interim results are released. The company has significant cash reserves and excess capital on its balance sheet, indicating it has scope to return funds to shareholders. A buyback would likely boost Tomkins’ share price, which has risen over 25% in the past year to reach an all-time high.

However, some analysts have warned that the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit could impact Tomkins in the longer term. Around 40% of revenues come from UK customers, with approximately 20% of its products exported to Europe. Tomkins’ share price may fluctuate when further clarity emerges on the potential impact of Brexit on the company’s major markets and customers.

While risks remain, Tomkins appears well-positioned to continue its recent strong performance over the rest of the financial year if economic conditions remain stable. The interim results will provide an opportunity for Tomkins to reiterate guidance for full year profits to increase by between 5 to 10% compared to last year. Investors will also be watching for any strategic updates from the company alongside its short term financial expectations.
