Crucial talks between UK and US on open skies pact delayed due to illness of senior negotiator  

Negotiations between the UK and US on a post-Brexit open aviation agreement have been delayed after a senior British negotiator fell ill with an undisclosed medical condition. The talks, due to start today in Washington DC, were postponed at short notice.

The negotiations are aimed at securing a new bilateral air services agreement to replace existing EU-US open skies rules and allow unrestricted flights between the two countries once the Brexit transition period ends in December 2020. Failure to reach a new deal could disrupt transatlantic air travel and cargo operations. 

Government sources said the illness was unexpected and arrangements are being made to reschedule the talks as soon as possible. However, the delay increases pressure on negotiators who only have a few months remaining to finalize a comprehensive air transport agreement. Negotiating a bilateral open aviation area is complex, with ownership restrictions, route access, passenger rights and other issues to resolve.

“We want to find a quick solution that minimizes disruption, benefits both economies and ensures healthy competition in the transatlantic aviation market,” said a spokesperson for the UK Department for Transport. “We hope our negotiator makes a swift recovery so talks can resume promptly.”

The news comes at a delicate time for British diplomats seeking to negotiate new trade deals and partnerships around the world before the Brexit deadline. The US is a top priority and an open skies agreement seen as crucial for the British aviation industry which faces losing unfettered access to EU airports. 

Failure to reach an open skies deal could mean British airlines losing rights to freely operate routes to the US, leading to a drop in passenger numbers and cargo. US carriers would also lose access to the UK market. Business groups have warned this would damage both economies.  American Airlines and British Airways currently dominate transatlantic traffic under the existing EU-US open skies treaty. 

"There is no time for setbacks or delays. A quick deal is essential to provide certainty for both travellers and businesses that rely on the UK-US aviation market, said Tim Alderslade of Airlines UK, the industry group.  "Disruption would be an own-goal that benefits no one. We urge both sides to get back to the negotiating table next week and secure an agreement."

US government officials said they were ready to restart talks as soon as their British counterparts indicated they were able to do so. Privately, there is frustration that another wrench has been thrown into the effort to finalize key post-Brexit trade relationships, but public statements have remained cordial. The illness was "unfortunate timing but these things happen," said one US official. "We stand ready to resume discussions as soon as the UK is able."
