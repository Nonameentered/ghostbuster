Ford to Cut 1,300 Jobs at Halewood Plant, Focus Shifts to New Vehicle Concept 

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood manufacturing plant near Liverpool, England as part of a restructuring plan to shift focus to new vehicle technologies. The job cuts represent about a third of the plant’s workforce.

The Halewood plant currently produces the Ford Focus compact car for the European market. Declining sales of the Focus and other traditional passenger cars in favor of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossovers have led Ford to re-evaluate its product plans. The company will end Focus production at Halewood in mid-2021. 

“Today's announcement is about reshaping Ford for growth and ensuring that we have the right portfolio of products and skills across Ford to succeed in an intensely competitive European market,” said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe. “Halewood has been a great success story for Ford, producing more than 4 million vehicles since it opened. But consumer tastes are changing, and our business is changing with it.”

The job cuts are part of Ford’s broader $14 billion global restructuring program to improve overall operating cost efficiency. Ford hopes to reduce operating costs in Europe by $500 million per year, which also entails ending production of the C-Max people mover in Saarlouis, Germany.

Ford plans to transition Halewood to begin producing electric powertrains starting in mid-2021. The investment in electric vehicle components is aimed at positioning Ford for further growth in the greener, high-tech auto markets of the future. “Halewood has a proud history of adapting to changes in the automotive market, and this investment in new transmissions supports our commitment to the U.K. and Europe,” Rowley said.

The Unite union, which represents most workers at Halewood, vowed to fight the job cuts. “Unite will not stand by and allow Ford to make 1,300 workers in Halewood redundant without a fight,” said Des Quinn, Unite’s national officer for the automotive sector. “This is a devastating day for our members, their families and the wider community. Ford broke its promises today.”

Ford expects the restructuring to take 12 to 18 months to complete. The company will offer voluntary separation and early retirement packages to workers, in addition to providing retraining opportunities for some employees. Despite the job cuts, Ford said it remains committed to maintaining significant operations in the U.K., including its European headquarters in Brentwood, England.
