Britain Approves CE Electric’s $1.3 Billion Bid for Northern Electric  

The British government has approved a $1.3 billion takeover of Northern Electric, one of Britain's regional electricity distribution companies, by CE Electric, a foreign power company. The deal marks the largest acquisition of a British power asset by an overseas buyer and highlights the increasing globalization of the power industry.

CE Electric, based in Houston, Texas, is one of the largest private electric utility holding companies in the US. The company has aggressively expanded overseas in recent years, focused on the acquisition and operation of power transmission and distribution networks. The purchase of Northern Electric, which serves 3.5 million customers across northern England, is CE Electric’s first major foray into the British electricity market.   

“This is a significant milestone for our company and highlights our ambition to become a leading player in the global power infrastructure space,” said Jane Stevenson, CEO of CE Electric. “Northern Electric has a strong portfolio of regulated electricity assets which provide stable, inflation-protected returns. We aim to invest further in Northern Electric to improve network reliability, customer service and accelerate the transition to clean energy.”

The deal was approved by Britain’s Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), the sector regulator, after an initial study to assess its impact. Ofgem concluded the takeover was “consistent with their principal objective of protecting the interests of existing and future electricity customers.” As part of the approval, Ofgem imposed certain conditions on CE Electric, including limits on dividend payments and executive pay. CE Electric will also be prevented from using Northern Electric to subsidize its US operations.

Not all observers agree with Ofgem’s decision. Critics argue foreign ownership of critical national infrastructure poses risks to security, jobs and the environment. “This sale of Northern Electric to a US company is deeply worrying,” said Simon Kirkpatrick of the UK Electricity Network Trade Union. “There is no guarantee vital investment, operations and jobs will not eventually move overseas.”
