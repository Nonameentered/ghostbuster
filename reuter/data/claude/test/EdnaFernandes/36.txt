British defence giant GEC revamps corporate structure in key shift away from legacy management

British defence and technology conglomerate GEC has announced a major overhaul of its corporate structure in a bid to streamline decision making and move away from what analysts describe as a legacy of unwieldy management processes. 

The firm will dismantle its matrix structure where multiple business units and geographic divisions report directly into group headquarters. In its place, GEC will switch to a simplified model with seven standalone divisions reporting to a central CEO. Each division will have full control over product development, sales, and day-to-day operations. The new structure will yield significant cost savings as GEC eliminates overlap between units and multiple reporting lines into group management.

The reorganisation reflects the firm's ambition to operate in a more agile and globally-focused manner, according to the memo issued by GEC's new CEO, John Smith. "Our matrix structure has served us well in the past but has become too slow and bureaucratic in the fast-changing world we operate in today," Mr Smith stated. "Our new simplified model will empower divisional leaders, cut out waste, and help make GEC a stronger, fitter organisation." 

Mr Smith has pursued an aggressive restructuring strategy since taking over from long-serving CEO Sir Robert Stevens two years ago. Along with trimming headcount by more than 10%, he has sold off non-core businesses, exited several loss-making geographies, and renegotiated supply contracts to reduce costs across the group. The latest move represents his most radical step yet, but one that analysts argue is critical to reviving growth at the £32 billion company.

Tim Edwards, defence analyst at Merchant & Taylor Bank, called the corporate shake-up "bold but necessary" given GEC's recent sluggish performance. "The sprawling conglomerate model served GEC well during the Cold War era of generous defence spending but has become totally unsuited to today's competitive markets," he said. "Smith's new model should make the firm immensely more agile, innovative and responsive to customer needs."

Not all observers are convinced, however. Keith Robinshaw, a former GEC executive, warned that delegating power to divisions could undermine economies of scale and risk "dismantling the culture of technical excellence" the firm has long been known for. "GEC's strength has always been it ability to bring world-class resources and expertise to bear on complex projects," he cautioned. The company has issued assurances that group-wide support for technical programmes will continue under the new structure.

GEC's share price climbed 1.2% on the announcement as investors signalled cautious optimism around Smith's turnaround strategy. The new divisional structure will take effect January 1, 2021, with targets to generate annual cost savings of £250M by the 2023 financial year. The overhaul may yield short-term disruption, analysts say, but should leave GEC a leaner, more competitive business if executed well. Smith's leadership and divisional appointments in the coming months will be closely watched for signs of the new structure's effectiveness.
