Hanson Plc reports record pretax profits before four-way split of operations

Hanson Plc, the British conglomerate, today reported its highest ever pretax profits for 2019, just months before the company separates into four independent businesses.

The company said pretax profits rose 12% to £2.4 billion last year, buoyed by continued strong performance in its building materials and aggregates divisions. Revenue climbed 8% to £12.8 billion as the company benefited from large infrastructure projects in the UK and steady demand in the US and Australia.

"2019 was another year of progress for Hanson as our strategy to focus on growth opportunities in our building materials markets paid dividends," said CEO Simon Willis. "We are now ready to launch the next phase of value creation through the demerger of the company into four industry-leading businesses." 

From June 1, Hanson will separate into Hanson Building Materials, Hanson Infrastructure Products, Hanson Cement, and Taylor Wimpey UK, with each division trading independently on the London Stock Exchange. The move follows a strategic review last year that concluded the four businesses would be better able to accelerate growth as separate companies.

Hanson Building Materials, which produces aggregates, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, reported a 14% rise in operating profit to £1.2 billion. Revenue increased 7% to £6.4 billion on higher volumes and prices in the UK and Australia.

Hanson Infrastructure Products, which makes pipes, bricks and precast concrete products, saw profits climb 9% to £350 million on revenue up 6% to £3.2 billion. Demand was underpinned by major rail and utility projects in the UK and improving US pipelines market.  

Hanson Cement notched a 10% gain in profit to £400 million as revenue advanced to £2.2 billion. Strong UK demand offset weakness in parts of Asia and Hanson is investing £150 million to boost UK cement capacity by 30% to meet expected demand from infrastructure and housebuilding.

The demerger is expected to generate £500 million to support growth initiatives across the four new companies. Willis said the move would create opportunities to further increase value for shareholders over the next 5-10 years. Shares in Hanson rose 3.5% in early trading on the results and demerger announcement.
