Record car registrations in Britain overshadowed by concerns over poor sales and export threats

New car registrations in Britain reached a record high in March, according to figures released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). More than 587,000 new vehicles were registered in March, a 14.7 percent increase over the same month last year. The increase was the 29th consecutive month of year-over-year growth for new car sales. 

However, the positive registration figures mask an overall slowdown in the UK new car market. New car registrations in the first quarter of 2019 were up just 0.8 percent, despite the strong March performance. Furthermore, private new car sales were down 2.2 percent in March, indicating much of the growth came from increased fleet and business registrations. 

With Brexit uncertainty continuing, consumer confidence remains fragile. Economists expect overall economic growth in the UK to remain slow in 2019, weighing on big-ticket purchases like new vehicles. “The latest figures provide some respite from two years of declining trends, although the market remains weak,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive.

The threat of US tariffs on car imports is also looming over the UK auto industry and could impact new car demand. The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles and parts, including those from the European Union. The tariffs would significantly increase the prices of British-built models sold in the US, the industry’s biggest export market.

BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, both of which manufacture vehicles in the UK, have warned a no-deal Brexit could force them to scale back operations. BMW said it may have to shut down production for several weeks. JLR announced plans earlier this year to cut 4,500 jobs worldwide, many of them in Britain.

Despite the concerns, some industry executives remain upbeat about the longer-term prospects for UK auto manufacturing and sales. Carlos Tavares, CEO of Peugeot manufacturer PSA Group, told the BBC the company’s recent acquisition of Vauxhall Motors demonstrated its confidence in the UK market. “The fundamentals are there,” said Tavares. “The UK is a very competitive country with very competitive people, and a lot of competences.”

 With demand for low-emission vehicles on the rise, Britain’s strengths in industries like motorsport and battery technology could help drive future growth. The UK government has also made boosting electric vehicle production and sales a key part of its industrial strategy.

However, the automotive industry continues to face many uncertainties in both domestic and foreign markets. While March’s vehicle registration record provides some optimism, economic and political headwinds suggest any sustained recovery in UK auto sales and manufacturing may still be some way off.
