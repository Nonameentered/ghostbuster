British Government Warns British Airways and American Airlines Alliance Could be Referred to Monopolies and Mergers Commission

The British government has warned British Airways and American Airlines that their proposed joint business venture risks reducing competition on key transatlantic routes and may be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for further scrutiny. 

British Airways and American Airlines, two of the largest carriers across the Atlantic, have been strategic partners since 2010 and are seeking to deepen their partnership. They have proposed a joint business agreement that would allow them to cooperate commercially on flights between the US and UK, including coordinating prices, schedules, and seating capacity.

However, the Department for Transport (DfT) said today the two airlines have failed to satisfy its concerns that the deal would not substantially lessen competition. The DfT released a summary of responses to its consultation on the alliance, stating that "respondents expressed concerns about the potential loss of competition, in particular the airlines' ability and incentive to raise airfares."

In a letter to the airlines, Aviation Minister Robert Courts said the DfT believes "there is a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition on certain routes as a result of the proposed alliance, which could lead to increased airfares for customers." He warned the airlines that the CMA may launch an in-depth investigation into the competitive impact if the concerns are not addressed.

British Airways and American Airlines currently control more than 60% of take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport, leveraging these slots to dominate transatlantic routes between Heathrow and US airports. The airlines pledged to release some slots in order to win EU approval for their original alliance and transatlantic joint venture in 2010. But slots are still scarce and difficult for competitors to obtain, limiting the threat of potential competition.  

The airlines now have until January 13 to submit proposals to remedy concerns about the latest deal. Failure to satisfy the DfT could see the case referred to the CMA, which has the power to place limits, conditions, or block the partnership altogether if it finds evidence that the deal substantially reduces competition. The outcome is being closely watched by rival carriers including Virgin Atlantic, Delta, and United Airlines.

Consumer groups have welcomed the DfT's stance. The Business Travel Association said any measures to reduce costs and increase choice for business travelers flying across the Atlantic would be "welcome." Advocacy group Which? said the government is "right" to take a skeptical view of a partnership between "two of the biggest players on these routes" and encouraged the CMA to fully scrutinize the impact on prices and service quality if the deal is referred to them.

The latest warning raises uncertainty over the future of the BA-AA partnership and puts pressure on the airlines to provide stronger remedies and guarantees to satisfy competition concerns. The deal is seen as strategically important in helping the airlines curb costs, coordinate schedules, and boost their competitive position against major European airline groups and Gulf carriers offering attractive fares on long-haul routes. Failure to gain approval would be a significant setback to their global alliance strategies.
