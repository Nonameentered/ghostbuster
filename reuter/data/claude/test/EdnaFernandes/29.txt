Ford Announces 1,300 Job Cuts and Shift in Production to Spain and Germany 

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will cut 1,300 jobs in the UK and move production of two of its models out of Britain to plants in Spain and Germany. The cuts represent about a third of Ford's workforce in the UK and come as the company faces declining sales in Europe and looks to reduce costs.

The Ford plant in Bridgend, Wales which produces engines will stop making petrol engines by 2021. The closure puts 1,100 jobs at risk at the South Wales plant. An additional 200 jobs will be cut at Ford's other British facilities. The moves are part of a broader cost-cutting strategy by Ford in Europe to improve the long-term competitiveness of its European operations.

Ford will shift production of its next-generation S-Max and Galaxy, currently produced in Valencia, Spain to Saarlouis, Germany. The redesigned models will be built beginning in late 2020 until at least 2025. Production of Ford's C-Max model will also move from Valencia to Saarlouis.

The departure of engine production and the S-Max and Galaxy models from the UK is a blow to Ford's manufacturing base in Britain. Ford has made engines in Wales for 40 years and has had a presence in Britain since 1911. Ford employs about 13,000 workers in the UK, its third largest market in Europe after Germany and Italy.

Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley said in a statement, “ Ford is taking decisive action to transform its European operations and deliver long-term sustainable profitability.” He cited the “sustained loss of profitability” in Europe as necessitating the cuts and shift in production.

The moves drew condemnation from British politicians and trade unions. Unite, Britain's largest labor union said the decision "cannot be tolerated." British prime minister Theresa May called the job losses at Ford "very disappointing." However, Ford said it will "continue ongoing investment" in its Dunton, Essex research and engineering center in the UK.

Ford's situation reflects the struggles of other carmakers to generate profits in Europe, where slumping sales, trade tariffs and the uncertainty caused by Brexit are taking a toll. Mercedes, JLR, Honda and Nissan have also announced job cuts in the UK in recent months. However, Britain's impending departure from the EU makes future production levels and investments in the country uncertain for automakers. Ford's decision suggests the company may be hedging its bets by shifting more manufacturing into the EU.

In summary, Ford's announcement delivers sobering news for the British auto industry and economy. The closure of the Bridgend plant eliminates over a thousand high-skilled manufacturing jobs, underscoring the challenges of global competition and partnerships in an era of political and economic volatility. Though a blow to national pride, Ford's business logic of reducing costs and improving competitiveness is hard to fault. For Britain's auto sector, the road ahead remains unclear.
