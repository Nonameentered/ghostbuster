Stagecoach predicts biggest future growth through overseas rail and bus acquisitions 

Stagecoach, the international transport group, announced today that it expects overseas acquisitions in the rail and bus sectors to drive the biggest growth opportunities for the company over the next 5-10 years. Speaking at an investor event in London, Stagecoach CEO Martin Griffiths said emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America offer the largest potential for expansion of the company’s rail and bus networks.

“While we remain committed to our existing operations across the UK and North America, the greatest prospects for sustained long-term growth lie within developing transport systems abroad,” Griffiths said. “There is increasing demand for investment in public transit infrastructure and services in high-growth economies where urbanization rates are soaring and public sector funding or expertise may be lacking.”

Stagecoach has over 35 years of experience operating bus and rail networks in the UK, making it well-placed to improve operations in overseas markets. The company runs a fleet of over 8,000 buses and trains, employing around 45,000 people. However, revenue growth has plateaued in recent years due to government funding cuts, lower passenger numbers, and increased competition from private vehicle use and budget airlines.
 
Griffiths pointed to cities in Asia and Africa where population growth has strained existing public transit systems as prime examples of potential acquisition targets. “Whether it is bus rapid transit systems in Kuala Lumpur or light rail in Ho Chi Minh City, cities across the developing world require huge injections of investment and expertise in mass transit if they are to remain livable and sustainable,” he noted. 

While Stagecoach is not in takeover talks with any companies currently, Griffiths said adding rail and bus networks in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America would enable Stagecoach to tap into new pools of government funding for infrastructure and leverage its experience operating transit systems across a wide range of geographies. Shareholders appeared optimistic at the growth strategy, with Stagecoach shares rising over 3% in morning trading following the announcement.
