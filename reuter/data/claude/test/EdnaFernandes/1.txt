Racal Electronics Announces Alliance with ITT Defence in Race for Two Billion Pound Defence Contract 

Racal Electronics PLC announced today that it has formed a strategic alliance with ITT Defence Ltd to bid for a £2 billion contract to supply battlefield communications equipment to the British Army. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) plans to award the 10-year contract next month to provide radio, satellite and data link equipment as part of its “Project Oakenshield” to modernize communications for ground forces.

For Racal, the deal with ITT Defence is a coup that strengthens its position against rival bidders like GEC-Marconi and Plessey. “We recognized that partnering with ITT would create an extremely compelling bid by combining Racal’s expertise in military radio systems with ITT’s proven satellite communications capabilities,” said Racal chief executive Simon Foster. The company hopes to take advantage of ITT Defence’s experience developing the US Army’s “Warfighter Information Network-Tactical” to enhance connectivity between headquarters and deployed units. 

ITT Defence also stands to gain from the alliance with Racal. While the US defence group has developed next-generation satellite terminals and networking equipment for the US military, it has struggled to make headway in the UK market. An MoD contract win in alliance with Racal could raise ITT’s profile and open doors to future opportunities. “This strategic partnership allows us to leverage ITT’s technological strengths with Racal’s many years of experience delivering battle-proven communications solutions to the British military,” said ITT Defence managing director Paul Smith.

The Racal-ITT alliance faces stiff competition, however, and the bid outcome remains uncertain. GEC-Marconi and Plessey are also strong contenders with technical expertise and long-standing ties to the MoD. Much may depend on how well the rival teams outline their proposals to enhance interoperability of radios, satellites and data networks across different levels of command. The winning bidder must also demonstrate an ability to deliver equipment to demanding timescales, as the army looks to deploy initial combat-ready units by 2025.

With huge profits and prestige at stake, the battle for Project Oakenshield is shaping up to be hard fought. For Racal, a win would secure its place as the UK’s leading military communications provider for years to come. But a loss could call into question its defence strategy and prompt a rethink of its ambitions to become a tier-one contractor. The alliance with ITT is a double-edged sword that raises the stakes for both partners. Next month, all eyes will be on the MoD to see whether it chooses Racal to forge the army’s future battlefield networks.
