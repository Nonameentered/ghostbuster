Britain Approves CE Electric's $1.29 Billion Hostile Takeover Bid for Northern Electric 

The British government has approved CE Electric’s $1.29 billion hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric, paving the way for CE Electric to acquire Northern Electric after a prolonged battle. The approval from British regulators clears the final major hurdle for CE Electric to complete the acquisition of its rival, one of Britain’s largest electricity distribution companies.

CE Electric launched a hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric last year, arguing that combining the two companies would yield significant cost savings and operational efficiencies. However, Northern Electric’s board rejected CE Electric’s initial offers, saying they undervalued the company. CE Electric proceeded with a direct offer to Northern Electric’s shareholders, eventually winning the backing of investors holding over 50% of Northern Electric’s shares.

With shareholder support in hand but still facing scrutiny from British regulators, CE Electric raised its offer price to $1.29 billion in December to push the deal across the finish line. The improved offer amounted to a 20% premium over Northern Electric’s share price before CE Electric first announced its interest. 

“We are pleased to have finally secured all approvals to close this transaction,” said CE Electric CEO Brian Smith. “While it has been a long process, we have never wavered in our belief that combining with Northern Electric would benefit customers, communities, and shareholders alike through greater efficiency, innovation, and investment.”

Northern Electric’s board still opposes the deal but has run out of options to block it. The combined company will have over 3.5 million customers across Britain and more than $5 billion in annual revenue, making it the country’s largest electricity distributor. CE Electric pledged to achieve $100 million in cost savings by eliminating duplicate operations and is also planning to invest $250 million over the next five years to upgrade the combined power grid.

The completion of the deal likely signals further consolidation within Britain’s electricity industry as companies seek to gain scale and cut costs. CE Electric’s successful takeover of Northern Electric despite initial resistance shows the power of shareholder activism in forcing company boards to accept attractive acquisition offers. Overall, the tie-up between CE Electric and Northern Electric promises to reshape Britain’s electricity landscape for years to come.
