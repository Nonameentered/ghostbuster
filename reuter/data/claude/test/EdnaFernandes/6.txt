US and UK Open Skies Talks End Without Full Agreement and BA Alliance Faces Blockage  

Negotiations between the US and UK on an open skies aviation agreement have ended without reaching a comprehensive deal, casting uncertainty over the transatlantic partnership. The two sides failed to resolve key differences over "fifth freedom" rights that allow airlines to fly between the US and UK and continue to other destinations. 

The lack of a full open skies agreement could impact British Airways' plans to deepen its alliance with American Airlines. The US Department of Transportation (DOT) said it will not approve antitrust immunity for the BA alliance until an open skies deal is reached. Antitrust immunity allows the airlines to coordinate schedules, pricing, and operations. 

Talks broke down over the UK's desire to obtain fifth freedom rights at London Heathrow airport for its carriers to fly to major US cities like Los Angeles and Atlanta and then continue to other international destinations. The US argued that granting fifth freedom rights could threaten its airlines and reduce direct flight options for US passengers. The impasse leaves the 2002 open skies agreement between the two nations still in place but prevents further liberalization and growth.

BA and American Airlines have been pressing for antitrust immunity to strengthen their Atlantic partnership, similar to immunized joint ventures that exist between Delta-Virgin, United-Lufthansa, and American's own partnerships with Japan Airlines and Qantas. The DOT cited its policy goal of "ensuring competition in the marketplace" in denying the BA-American request without a comprehensive open skies deal.

The lack of a full open skies agreement is a blow to BA which faces strong US and European competitors in the transatlantic market. An open skies deal allowing fifth freedom operations could provide BA more flexibility in its network planning and partnerships. For American, inability to gain antitrust immunity with BA could weaken its competitive position compared to rival US airlines with immunized alliances.

UK officials expressed disappointment at the outcome but said they will continue working with the US to reach a mutually-acceptable open skies agreement. The chief executive of Airlines for America, a US industry group, said there is still opportunity for more talks to yield "an even stronger, more comprehensive aviation relationship" between the two countries, signaling the negotiations may not be fully over. Still, further progress depends on bridging significant policy differences that have endured for over a decade of on-and-off talks.
