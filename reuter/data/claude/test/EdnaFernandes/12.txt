Wickes Plc Warns of Receivership Unless Investors Back Financial Restructuring Plan 

Troubled DIY retailer Wickes Plc has warned investors that it risks going into receivership unless they approve a financial restructuring plan. The company has proposed a debt-for-equity swap to reduce its debt burden by over £500 million. 

Wickes, which operates 230 stores across the UK and Ireland, has struggled with declining sales and profits over the last three years. It has been hit hard by the downturn in the UK housing market and a move to online shopping. The company reported a pre-tax loss of £127 million for the year ended January 2019.

Under the restructuring plan, the company is asking bondholders and shareholders to approve a swap of their debt and equity investments for new shares in the company. The plan would reduce Wickes's net debt from £950 million to £440 million, giving it more financial stability and flexibility.

However, the restructuring is not without risks and uncertainty. Shareholders will see their stakes diluted under the plan and there is no guarantee of future dividend payments or share price growth. There are also concerns that Wickes may still struggle in a competitive DIY market even with a lower debt burden. The company acknowledges these risks but says the alternative is insolvency.

"We have put forward a comprehensive financial restructuring that, if approved, would provide Wickes with a stable capital structure to support its business plan," said Wickes CEO Mark Llewellyn. "The alternative is insolvency, which risks job losses, store closures and a state of flux, which benefits no one."

Wickes has set a deadline of April 26 for investors to vote on the restructuring plan. The company needs approval from 75% of bondholders and 51% of shareholders for the plan to proceed. If approved, the company expects to complete the restructuring by the end of May. However, if rejected, Wickes says it sees no alternative to placing itself into administration.

The news sent Wickes shares down over 60% in early trading as investors reacted to the uncertainty. Rival retailers also saw declines on fears of a potential competitor exiting the market. However, some analysts argue Wickes' problems are company-specific rather than reflective of the wider retail sector. The outcome of the investor vote remains hard to predict.
