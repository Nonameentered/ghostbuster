Hanson Plc to Spin Off Energy Group in Final Stage of Demerger 

Hanson Plc, the British building materials company, announced today that it will proceed  with the final stage of spinning off its energy products division into a new independent company named Hanson Energy PLC. The demerger will be complete by the end of the year, marking the culmination of a strategic review process initiated by Hanson two years ago.

The new Hanson Energy company will include Hanson's coal mining, oil and gas exploration, and energy generation businesses. These energy and resource assets generated over Â£3 billion in revenue last year but have faced increasing challenges recently due to fluctuating commodity prices and a push toward renewable energy sources. By separating the energy group into its own company, Hanson believes both companies will benefit from increased strategic and management focus.

"We have concluded that the interests of Hanson shareholders and the progress of our business would be best served by creating two independent companies, a building materials group and an energy group, each with their own distinct objectives and shareholder bases," said Hanson's CEO Gerald Mason.

Hanson originally acquired many of its energy assets in the 1980s but has been diversifying into building materials and construction in recent decades. The company's building materials division, which will retain the Hanson name, produces aggregates, bricks, and concrete products for the construction industry. This division has grown steadily over the past 10 years and now accounts for over 80% of Hanson's total revenue and profit.

The demerger will be implemented through a "spin-off" structure, meaning Hanson Energy will be an independent listed company and current Hanson shareholders will receive shares in the new company in proportion to their existing Hanson shareholdings. Mason said the spin-off will provide both companies "with the independence and focus to realize their potential, unconstrained by the challenges of operating in both the building materials and energy sectors." The move is expected to be completed by December 31, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.
