AMEC Plc Doubles First Half Pretax Profits and Plans Dividend Growth in Second Half

AMEC Plc, the British multinational consulting, engineering and project management company, announced today that its pretax profits more than doubled in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year. Profits increased to £86 million, up from £34 million in the first half of 2016.

The engineering and consultancy company attributed the strong results to cost-cutting measures as well as growth in its core markets, including oil and gas, nuclear, and minerals and metals. Revenue rose 3% to £2.3 billion in the first half. 

“We have delivered another set of good first half results, with growth in revenue, profits, margins, earnings and cash,” said CEO Jonathan Lewis. “Our strategy to reposition AMEC around client-focused market sectors and geographies is delivering the growth and performance that we targeted at the start of our transformation.”

AMEC’s oil and gas division performed strongly, with an 11% rise in profits despite a challenging market. The company’s nuclear and infrastructure businesses also saw double-digit profit growth. However, profits in AMEC’s power and process division declined.

With its first half performance exceeding expectations and its order book at near-record levels, AMEC announced plans to accelerate dividend growth in the second half of the year. The company raised its interim dividend by 10% to 7.1 pence per share and pledged to increase shareholder payouts for the full year.

“The overall growth trends we highlighted at the start of the year remain firmly in place, underpinning our expectations for further progress in line with our strategic and operational objectives,” Lewis said. “We see further opportunities to improve the business and will continue to pursue them while maintaining our sharp focus on cost and operational discipline. The board remains confident in the outlook for the group.”

AMEC’s share price rose 3.4% on the news. The company appears to have decisively turned a corner after a turbulent period that saw its share price decline over the past several years due to weakness in the energy sector and its own restructuring challenges. With its first half results, AMEC demonstrated that its renewed focus on core markets and cost management is paying dividends for investors.
