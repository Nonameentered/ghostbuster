British Steel Shares Hit 12-Month Low After Profit Downgrades Due to Strong Pound Against the Mark

Shares in British Steel fell to their lowest level in 12 months today after the company issued a profit warning citing adverse currency impacts from a strong British pound. The steelmaker said full-year earnings would be "significantly below" previous guidance due to the pound gaining more than 7% against the German mark over the last six months. 

British Steel generates more than 60% of its revenue from exports, with Germany being its largest market. A stronger pound makes British Steel's products relatively more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing demand and squeezing profit margins. The company had already cut capacity by 12% earlier this year in response to slowing demand in Europe and globally. However, British Steel said the latest currency shifts were "impossible to predict" and would require further cost savings to offset.

The profit warning rattled investors, with British Steel shares plunging 18% to ₤3.42, the lowest since August 2018. The stock is now down nearly 40% this year. Analysts voiced concerns about British Steel's exposure to currency volatility and a lack of currency hedging to lock in more favorable exchange rates. "While British Steel has limited control over currency markets, the company has not done enough to mitigate these risks and insulate itself from pound strength," said James Wilson, an analyst at Morgan & Stanley.

In response, British Steel announced plans to cut an additional 8% of its workforce, or 1,200 jobs, to reduce costs by ₤80 million per year. The company employs 17,000 people, mostly in the UK. British Steel said the cuts were "difficult but necessary" and would make the company leaner and more resilient. The job losses follow several rounds of layoffs over the past three years totaling more than 3,500 roles.  

The pound rose to DM3.21 today, its highest level since late 2017, on hopes of a smooth Brexit and stronger UK economic data. However, a stronger currency is problematic for major British exporters and a drag on economic growth. The Bank of England may come under pressure to consider interest rate cuts to weaken the pound, though policymakers have so far not changed their stance of gradually raising rates. For British Steel and other UK exporters, the currency outlook remains a source of uncertainty and risk heading into 2020.
