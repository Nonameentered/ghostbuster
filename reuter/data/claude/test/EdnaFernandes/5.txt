Hanson Plc Sees Record Profits Despite Disappointing Share Price Performance

Hanson Plc, the FTSE 100 building materials company, today announced record profits for 2018 while acknowledging its share price has declined over the past year. Hanson reported pre-tax profits of £1.2 billion, a 12% increase from 2017, on revenue of £8.3 billion. However, Hanson’s share price has dropped nearly 20% in the last 12 months. 

The strong profits were driven by rising demand for Hanson’s products, including aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete, across its major markets in the UK and North America. Volume growth across all divisions, coupled with price increases and ongoing cost discipline, contributed to what CEO Mark Hanson called “an exceptional financial performance.”

Despite the robust financial results, Hanson’s share price has markedly underperformed the broader FTSE index over the past year. Investors appear concerned about several risks facing the company, including uncertainty around Brexit, slowing demand in the construction sector, and fluctuating commodity costs. There is also speculation Hanson could face pricing pressure to maintain market share if competitors engage in discounting.

In a call with analysts, Mr. Hanson addressed investor concerns and highlighted the company’s “resilient business model and strong fundamentals.” He noted Hanson holds leading positions in its core markets with a diversified product offering, has a flexible cost base, and has been generating strong free cash flow to fund expansion and reward shareholders. Hansom reaffirmed its dividend, with a 4.2% increase. But analysts noted the company offered little commentary on growth in 2019 and beyond.

Hanson expects to benefit over the longer term from several macro trends, including population growth, urbanization, and infrastructure needs in developing markets. However, near-term headwinds are contributing to a more cautious outlook. Absent a resolution to Brexit and other uncertainties, investors appear poised for more tempered growth expectations in 2019. With its leading competitive position, solid recent results, and compelling long-term dynamics, Hanson remains an attractive company, but the next few years look to be a ‘wait and see’ period for shareholders. Overall, while the financial results were strong, Hanson has more work to do to appease investors’ concerns.
