Ford's Job Cuts Dent Northern England's Inward Investment Record 

Ford's announcement that it will cut thousands of jobs across its European operations has dealt a major blow to Northern England's strong recent record of inward investment. The U.S. auto giant said it will slash 12,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2020 to boost profitability, with most cuts expected to hit Ford's Bridgend engine plant in Wales and its Halewood transmission factory near Liverpool in England. 

The closure of the Halewood facility, which currently employs 500 workers, would mark a reversal of fortunes for Britain's north west region. Over the last two years, the area has attracted major investments from companies ranging from Jaguar Land Rover to Boeing, attracted by the region's manufacturing heritage, access to ports, and relatively low costs. However, Ford's retreat highlights the challenges facing the British automotive industry amid a slump in sales of diesel vehicles and concerns over Brexit.

Ford has operated in Halewood for nearly 50 years, producing transmissions used in models like the Fiesta and Focus. The Unite union warned the closure of the plant could cost 1,200 supply chain jobs on top of the direct job losses. A spokesperson for Unite called on Ford to invest in new models and engines at Halewood to secure the future of all jobs at the plant. However, Ford Europe president Steven Armstrong suggested the sharp drop in demand for the company's products in the region made significant restructuring unavoidable. "We are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe," he said.

The news is a blow for the UK government, which has promoted the country as an attractive location for global auto companies following major investments by the likes of Nissan and BMW. Business leaders expressed concerns Ford's decision could discourage other companies from investing in Britain's automotive heartlands. The northwest region has a long history as a hub for carmaking and remains home to four of Britain's five largest vehicle assembly plants.
