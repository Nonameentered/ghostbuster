Go-Ahead Group Denies Allegations of Insider Trading for Rail Franchise

Transport company Go-Ahead Group has denied allegations that it engaged in insider trading to win a lucrative rail franchise contract. The allegations were raised in a class action lawsuit filed in the High Court accusing Go-Ahead of manipulating share prices and abusing insider information to obtain an unfair advantage in the Department for Transport's bidding process for the Southeastern rail franchise in 2005.

In a statement released today, Go-Ahead said the lawsuit is "completely unsubstantiated" and represents a "vexatious attempt" to recoup losses from investors who bet against the company in 2005. Go-Ahead claims that it complied fully with regulatory requirements of the public procurement process. The company further asserted it had "absolutely no access to any insider information" and that its bid was based solely on publicly available information along with its extensive expertise in operating rail franchises. 

If proven in court, the lawsuit's allegations could deal a blow to Go-Ahead's reputation and finances. The Southeastern rail franchise has been one of Go-Ahead's most lucrative, earning nearly £1 billion in revenue over its 15-year term. The litigation also brings renewed scrutiny of the Department for Transport's bidding procedures which had previously faced criticism due to lack of transparency. However, Go-Ahead stated that it has maintained a positive working relationship with the Department over its 35 years operating rail franchises in the UK.

Go-Ahead Group is one of the UK's largest public transport providers, operating bus and rail services across the country. The multinational corporation has a market capitalization of over £885 million. Go-Ahead's share price fell more than 5% following news of the lawsuit. A trial date has not yet been set, but proceedings are expected to start within the next 12 months unless the case is dismissed or settled out of court. Both Go-Ahead and claimants in the lawsuit declined further comment. The Department for Transport said it does not comment on ongoing legal matters.
