Nissan invests $357 million in UK plant to create 800 new jobs 

Carmaker Nissan announced today that it will invest $357 million in its Sunderland manufacturing plant in the United Kingdom to produce a new version of its popular Qashqai sport utility vehicle. The investment will create 800 new jobs at the factory and secure the future of the site, which currently employs over 7,000 workers.

The funding will allow Nissan to retool its production lines to manufacture the next generation Qashqai model, which will go on sale in 2023. The Sunderland plant has produced the Qashqai crossover since 2006 and the model accounts for a large percentage of the site’s total vehicle output. The modernization will enable Nissan to build the new Qashqai on an updated platform with enhanced electrification and autonomous driving technology.  

"This new model will build on the success of the current Qashqai, using Japanese engineering and British design and manufacturing expertise to exceed customer expectations,” said Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy. “The decision demonstrates Nissan's global commitment to the Sunderland plant which is an exemplar of UK high-tech, high-value manufacturing.”

The news provides a boost to Nissan's UK operations, which had been uncertain due to Brexit and shifting market conditions in the automotive industry. Production of diesel vehicles is declining across the sector and like other automakers, Nissan is investing in new powertrains and technologies like hybrid vehicles and electric cars. The next generation Qashqai is expected to offer self-driving features and a range of engine options including Nissan's e-Power hybrid system.

Nissan has manufactured vehicles in Sunderland since 1986, with the site producing models like the Qashqai, Juke, Leaf and the new Ariya electric crossover. The plant is the UK's largest car manufacturing facility, exporting 80% of its vehicles to European markets. The factory has faced struggles in recent years, with Nissan cutting production in 2019 and announcing plans to end night shifts. The new investment reverses some of those cuts and secures the plant's medium-term future.

The UK Government welcomed the Nissan investment, which provides a boost to the British automotive industry during a difficult economic period exacerbated by COVID-19 and Brexit. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the funding was "a tremendous vote of confidence" in both Nissan and the wider sector. Sunderland's economic fortunes are deeply tied to the success of the Nissan plant, with an estimated 28,000 UK jobs connected to the factory. The new Nissan model will generate additional work for the plant's supplier network across the region and country.

Overall, the $357 million upgrade demonstrates Nissan's commitment to its UK base despite the challenges ahead. The next-generation Qashqai aims to build on 14 years of success for the model, using the latest technologies and subsystems to create an appeal for buyers in the 2020s. The investment secures the short-term future of Nissan in Sunderland and provides hope that the site will remain one of the UK's largest centers of vehicle manufacturing excellence for years to come.
