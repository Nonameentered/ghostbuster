Ford announces 1,300 job cuts at UK plant, unions threaten strikes

Ford Motor Company announced plans today to cut 1,300 jobs at its Bridgend engine plant in South Wales. The move comes as Ford seeks to restructure its European operations to increase profitability. The Bridgend plant currently employs over 1,700 workers who build petrol and diesel engines for Ford vehicles produced in the UK and exported abroad.

The job cuts amount to just over 75% of the current workforce at the Bridgend facility. Ford plans to slash one of the two production lines at the plant and reorganize operations to focus on more fuel-efficient engines as demand for diesel engines continues to decline. Production on the remaining line is expected to end by September 2020. 

Ford has faced declining sales and profitability in Britain and Europe in the face of Brexit uncertainty and changing consumer preferences that have hurt sales of traditional Ford models like the Fiesta and Focus. Ford closed its transmission plant in France last year and sold off its Kechnec Transmission plant in Slovakia in 2017. Closing the Bridgend plant is the latest move by Ford to consolidate and restructure its manufacturing footprint.

Labour union officials condemned the decision and accused Ford of breaking previous commitments to workers. Len McCluskey, General Secretary of Unite the Union which represents Ford workers, said "there was no mention of compulsory redundancies when Ford signed a new five-year deal at its UK plants in 2016 promising extra investment." He called the move "a grotesque act of economic betrayal."

Workers at Bridgend reacted with anger and dismay at the news. “We’re devastated. My colleagues are in tears,” said Susan Phillips, a shop steward at the plant. “Ford broke its promise to its UK workers. Where are we meant to find new jobs in this economic climate?”

The job losses at Bridgend will have a significant economic impact on the town and surrounding area. Ford has operated the facility since 1977 and it remains the town’s largest employer. Local politicians urged Ford to reconsider its plans and work with unions to find alternatives to mass layoffs, like retraining or redeploying workers to other Ford plants. However, Ford believes closing and consolidating the Bridgend operation is key to restoring profitability in Europe. Unless a last-minute deal can be reached, the countdown to end of production at Bridgend seems poised to move forward.
