British Government Threatens to Refer Proposed British Airways and American Airlines Alliance to Monopolies and Mergers Commission

The British government today threatened to refer the proposed transatlantic joint-venture between British Airways and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The government expressed concerns that the alliance could increase fares and reduce consumer choice on flights between London and North America. The announcement represents the latest blow to the plans by the two airlines to coordinate scheduling and pricing across the Atlantic.

British Airways, the UK's flag carrier, and American Airlines, the world's largest airline by fleet size, have been seeking regulatory approvals for over a year to create a joint-venture that would allow them to share revenue and costs on transatlantic flights. The airlines argued that by coordinating scheduling and pricing, they could offer travellers easier connections, increased flight options, and lower fares.  

However, the alliance has faced significant opposition, especially in the UK. Rival airlines including Virgin Atlantic claimed that the alliance would fundamentally tilt the competitive landscape in favour of British Airways and American Airlines. The UK's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) warned the airlines last year that the alliance was likely to lead to "poorer outcomes" for passengers including higher airfare. The CMA threatneded to block the deal if the airlines did not offer sufficient remedies to address the anti-competitive concerns.

Against this backdrop, today's threat by the British government to refer the alliance to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a move that could ultimately lead to the deal's prohibition, represents a major roadblock. The Secretary of State for Transport said in a statement: "We have carefully considered the proposed transatlantic alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. Our analysis suggests this alliance could significantly reduce competition and choice for people travelling between UK and US, leading to higher fares."

The airlines expressed disappointment at the government's announcement. A British Airways spokesperson said: "We continue to believe the alliance will benefit our customers through increased choice, connectivity and destinations. We will work constructively with the Government to address their concerns." An American Airlines spokesperson likewise said the airlines remain "confident that our alliance provides significant customer benefits."

The next steps in the approval process remain unclear. Unless the airlines propose changes that satisfy the government's concerns, the deal now faces a high likelihood of outright prohibition. For British Airways and American Airlines, that would represent the end of a multi-year effort to gain regulatory clearance for a transformative alliance that the airlines considered crucial to their transatlantic networks and growth strategies. For travellers, it averts the prospect of reduced choice and higher fares on the world's most popular intercontinental route.
