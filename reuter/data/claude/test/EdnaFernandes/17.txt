Double-decker Bus at Forefront of Environmental Breakthrough with Oil Recycler

A breakthrough innovation turning used motor oil into renewable fuel has been unveiled this week by transportation company Stagecoach. The technology, a first of its kind, has been installed on one of Stagecoach's iconic double-decker buses in Manchester, UK. If successful, the oil recycling system could transform the environmental impact of bus travel and offers a sustainable solution to powering public transit fleets.

The pilot program will see the double-decker bus run on a B100 biofuel created from used cooking oil and motor oil collected from garages and businesses in the Greater Manchester area. The used oil is processed using a novel technique to remove impurities and convert the waste oil into biodiesel fuel. Early tests of the system show the B100 biofuel can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 90% compared to regular diesel. 

Mark Threapleton, Managing Director of Stagecoach UK Bus said, "We have a long history of innovation and this trial marks an exciting step forward in our journey to operating zero-emission buses. Biodiesel from locally sourced, recycled waste products is a sustainable and affordable way to power our fleet. If successful, we aim to roll out this technology across many more of our buses, which in turn could make a huge contribution to improving air quality and fighting climate change."

The biodiesel fuel system was developed by Chester-based Ecolution Renewable Fuel Systems. Dr. Ella Wang, Chief Technology Officer at Ecolution explained, “Our patented catalytic technique can produce biodiesel that meets or exceeds conventional diesel fuel standards. Using locally sourced waste oils is the greenest option as it reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting fuel and keeps money in the local economy.  We are thrilled to be working with Stagecoach to demonstrate the viability of this homegrown, waste-derived fuel solution.”

In a series of road tests over the next six months, Stagecoach will assess how the bus and its engine respond to running exclusively on the B100 biofuel to determine the impact on performance, fuel economy, and maintenance requirements.  The bus will travel on routes in and around Manchester, including the busy "Magic Bus" sightseeing tour. Stagecoach staff will also survey passengers for their feedback on the environmental benefits and sustainability of the biofuel during the pilot program.
