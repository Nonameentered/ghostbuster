Go-Ahead Group and VIA-GTI to secure Thameslink rail franchise

Train operating companies Go-Ahead Group and VIA-GTI have won the bid to run the Thameslink rail franchise for the next 10 years. The consortium announced today they have signed an agreement with the Department for Transport (DfT) to operate Thameslink services which provide north-south rail connections through central London.

Go-Ahead Group currently runs the Southeastern and Gatwick Express rail franchises, while VIA-GTI is a specialist rail infrastructure management company. The new deal will see the consortium run the core Thameslink network from December 2019 until 2029, with the option to extend for a further year. 

The move brings an end to uncertainty over the future of the busy commuter rail network. The previous franchise was prematurely ended by the DfT in 2018 following the failure of the consortium running the service. Under the new operators, passengers will benefit from better connections, more seats at peak times as well as improved staffing levels and security.    

Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, said: “This award is great news for the hundreds of thousands of commuters who use Thameslink every day. Passengers will soon start to see big improvements, including more reliable services and better connections across the capital.”

The CEO of Go-Ahead Group, David Brown, commented: “We are delighted to have been selected to operate this vital London rail service. We have extensive experience operating rail networks in the capital and beyond, and look forward to welcoming Thameslink passengers onboard from the end of this year."

VIA-GTI's CEO Fernando Casals Cebrian added: "We are very excited to bring our expertise in infrastructure and systems to one of the UK's biggest rail networks. By applying technology and innovation, we aim to transform the travel experience for all Thameslink customers."

The new franchise agreement is set to begin on 8 December 2019. Passengers can expect more details on service improvements over the coming months.
