Racal Electronics Blames Last Minute Delays in Foreign Government Defence Orders for Profit Warning   

Racal Electronics PLC, the British defence and electronics group, warned today that its profits for the current financial year would be "substantially" below market expectations. The company blamed last minute delays in finalizing major defence orders from Middle Eastern governments for the profit shortfall.

In a statement, Racal said its profit before tax is now expected to be £150-£165 million for the year ending March 31, compared to market expectations of around £190 million. The delays centre on two large communications infrastructure and equipment orders from governments in the Middle East, worth more than £500 million combined. Final contract negotiations have taken longer than expected, pushing the revenue and profits from the deals into the next financial year.

"We had anticipated that these strategically important contracts would be concluded earlier, allowing us to deliver equipment and recognize the profits within this financial year. Unfortunately, political and bureaucratic issues outside of our control have caused delays," said Graham Tempest, Racal's Finance Director. He expressed confidence the deals would still be completed, but said "the short term consequences for this year's results are disappointing."

The profit warning comes at a delicate time for Racal, which has faced pressure from some shareholders to review its strategy and break up parts of its business. Its share price has underperformed the wider UK market in recent years. However, Mr. Tempest said that while the delayed Middle Eastern orders would impact short term results, "the long term growth potential of our defence and security divisions remains very attractive, both in the UK and overseas."

The unsettled political situations in parts of the Middle East have made it difficult for some governments to approve and finalize major military and security purchases, even where there are agreed and urgent equipment requirements. Racal's experience highlights some of the ongoing risks of relying substantially on defence contracts from volatile regions. Investors are likely to remain wary until the delayed Racal deals are finally completed.
