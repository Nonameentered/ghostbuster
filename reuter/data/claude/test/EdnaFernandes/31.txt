Ford to Cut 1,300 Jobs at Plant Near Liverpool, Future Production Uncertain

Ford announced today that it will be eliminating 1,300 jobs at its Bridgend Engine Plant near Liverpool, England. The announcement is a crushing blow to the local area, where Ford has been producing engines for 40 years. The factory employs nearly 1,700 staff currently, though many of those roles were already at risk due to a decline in demand for the Dragon petrol engines produced at the facility. The future of the plant itself is now highly uncertain. 

Ford cited a dramatic shift in the auto industry away from petrol engines towards hybrid and electric vehicle technologies as the primary reason for the job cuts. "Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages have made the European Dragon engine economically unviable," said Ford of Europe President Stuart Rowley. The Bridgend plant had been producing the 1.5-liter and 2-liter displacement Dragon engines, but sales of vehicles with those engines have dropped sharply as consumer preference has shifted.

The job losses at Bridgend highlight the risks associated with the auto industry's pivot to electric and hybrid vehicles. While the move to electrification is critical to meeting tighter emissions standards and reducing the environmental impact of the transport sector, the shift puts many traditional auto industry jobs at risk. "The challenge for places like Bridgend will be the pace at which new high-skilled jobs, like manufacturing electric batteries and vehicles, come to replace those jobs that are at risk," said David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham in England.

Local political leaders expressed disappointment at the news and urged support for the workers at Bridgend. "My thoughts go out to the workforce and their familiesâ€”this will be an incredibly unsettling time for them," said local Member of Parliament Chris Elmore. He called on the Welsh government and associated agencies to do everything possible to help the affected employees find new work or retrain for new roles.

The future of the sprawling Bridgend site itself remains unclear. Ford said the plant will continue to produce some engines to honor existing customer commitments until September 2020 but beyond that its fate is undecided. The company indicated it will explore options for either selling the facility or retooling it to support Ford's electrification strategies. The plant's prime location, existing infrastructure, and well-trained staff could make it an attractive site for future advanced manufacturing if alternative uses can be found. But for now, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Bridgend and its employees.
