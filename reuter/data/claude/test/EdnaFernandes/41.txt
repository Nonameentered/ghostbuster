UK Announces Preferred Bidders for Two More Rail Franchises in Privatisation Push  

The UK government today announced the preferred bidders for two additional rail franchises as part of its ongoing privatization of British rail services. The West Coast Partnership franchise, which includes intercity services between London, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, will be awarded to FirstGroup and Trenitalia. The East Midlands Railway franchise, connecting major cities in the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire, will be awarded to Abellio, a subsidiary of Netherlands' railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

The awards continue the government's process of transferring rail franchises from public to private operators. Since privatization of British Rail began in the 1990s, all but two UK rail franchises are now privately operated. The Department for Transport claims greater private sector involvement has driven innovation and passenger growth. Critics argue privatization has led to higher fares, overcrowding, and a fragmentation of services.

FirstGroup and Trenitalia will take over the West Coast Partnership franchise from Virgin Trains in December 2019. The new franchise includes plans for 263 new carriages, additional rail services, simplified fares, and station upgrades. FirstGroup Chief Executive Matthew Gregory said the new partnership "will transform the West Coast experience for customers.” The East Midlands Railway franchise operated by Abellio will launch in August 2019, replacing the former East Midlands Trains. Abellio has pledged £600 million to improve stations, increase services on Sundays, and add over 1,000 additional journeys per week.   

The rail privatization program began under Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s and has continued under subsequent governments. Nearly all franchises are now run by private operators, with the London Underground and Merseyrail the only remaining publicly operated services. The government believes private companies are better equipped to drive innovation and improvements for passengers due to commercial pressures. However, the policy remains deeply controversial, with critics pointing to bailouts during financial troubles, profits sent overseas to companies' foreign owners, and the UK paying the highest rail fares in Europe. The future of rail privatization promises to remain a topic of intense debate as additional franchises come up for renewal over the next several years.
