Crucial talks on open skies pact postponed due to illness of senior British negotiator 

Negotiations between the UK and the EU over a post-Brexit aviation agreement have been postponed after a senior British negotiator fell ill with COVID-19. The talks, due to take place this week in London, were expected to make progress on a potential open skies pact to allow airlines to continue flying freely between Britain and the bloc after the transition period ends on December 31.

However, the discussions have now been pushed back by at least a week after a member of the British negotiating team tested positive for the coronavirus. Sources said the official has mild symptoms but has been instructed to self-isolate for 14 days in line with government guidelines. While the rest of the negotiating team have tested negative and are continuing to work remotely, face-to-face talks cannot now take place until late next week at the earliest.  

The delay is a blow to hopes of securing an open skies deal before Britain formally leaves the EU single market and customs union on January 1. Negotiators on both sides have already held four rounds of talks but key differences remain over issues such as rules around ownership and control of airlines. An open skies agreement would allow carriers to offer direct flights between the UK and EU and within the bloc, but means complying with rules to ensure fair competition.

Failure to reach a deal would force airlines to rely on basic World Trade Organisation terms for air travel, which could disrupt routes and raise fares. British Airways owner IAG has already warned its ability to fly freely in Europe may be "restricted" if there is no agreement. Talks last month broke up with both sides acknowledging that "significant differences" still remained, even on basic principles.

In a statement, the Department for Transport said: "The health and safety of negotiators and staff is our top priority. Unfortunately face-to-face talks cannot take place this week due to the illness of a UK team member, but our negotiating teams remain in close contact and these discussions will resume as soon as it is safe to do so. Our goal remains to find a pro-consumer open skies agreement as part of a future relationship with the EU."

An EU official said: "We wish the UK negotiator a swift recovery. We remain committed to constructive negotiations that respect the interests of citizens and consumers on both sides." The two-week delay is unlikely to create extra time pressure provided talks can resume promptly, but there are fears further disruption could make a deal harder to reach before the looming deadline.
