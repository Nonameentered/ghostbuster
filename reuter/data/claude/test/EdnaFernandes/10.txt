General Electric Co Plc profits hit by restructuring charge 

General Electric Co reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday as the industrial conglomerate took hefty restructuring charges to scale back its power business. 

The company posted a net loss of $22.8 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $3.5 billion a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, GE earned 21 cents per share, below analyst expectations of 32 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Revenue fell 5 percent to $33.3 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $33.7 billion.

"This was another challenging quarter, but also one where we continued making progress executing our plan," said Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp in a statement.

The company took $11.2 billion in charges in its power division as it restructures the unit to make it leaner after a drop in orders for gas-fired turbines due to low natural gas prices.

The power unit, which makes and services products like gas and steam turbines and generators, reported a US$10.8 billion loss in the quarter. Excluding charges, the division lost US$644 million.

GE had warned the power business would lose cash in 2019 and 2020 due to the restructuring.

Free cash outflow from GE's industrial businesses was $2.3 billion during the quarter, better than analysts' expectations of an outflow of $2.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

GE said it expects industrial free cash flow between negative $2 billion and positive $2 billion in 2020. It expects to generate as much as $38 billion in cash from selling non-core assets. 

The company has been selling off parts of its business to reduce debt and focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. It recently closed the sale of its GE Biopharma unit to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion.

GE shares were up nearly 3% at $12.20 in light premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% since 2018.
