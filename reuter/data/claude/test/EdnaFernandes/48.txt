Former Transport Minister suggests London Underground sale could raise up to £1.5bn

The former Transport Minister, David Miliband, has suggested that selling the London Underground could raise between £1 billion and £1.5 billion for the Treasury. In an interview with the BBC, Miliband said that privatizing the Tube network could provide funds for transport investment across the UK.

Miliband, who served as Transport Minister under Prime Minister Gordon Brown between 2008 and 2010, said “The London Underground is a prime asset with huge potential for the right private sector partner. With the right structure and set of guarantees, there is every reason to think a long-term concession to operate the Tube could raise at least £1 billion, maybe as much as £1.5 billion.”

Miliband argued that the funds raised from a concession or long-term lease of London Underground operations could be used to finance major transport projects outside of London, including the construction of new rail lines and road upgrades across the country. “There are huge infrastructure needs across the UK, not just in the capital city,” he said. “Money raised from involving the private sector in running the Tube could make a real difference in addressing transport deficiencies across the country.”

The proposal is likely to generate significant controversy and debate. While privatizing London Underground could provide a substantial cash injection for the Government, critics argue it may lead to higher fares for passengers, reduced investment, and deteriorating service.

A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said, “We have no plans to sell London Underground. Tube services were privatized for 15 years but brought back into public control because of concerns about costs and service levels.” Passenger groups warned that privatization had led to a sharp increase in ticket prices and investment cuts the last time the Tube network was operated by private concessions in the early 2000s. 

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has also spoken out against any proposals to privatize London Underground. A spokesperson for the Mayor said: “The Mayor has no intention of selling off the Tube. The Underground is best run with passengers and public service at its heart, not private profit.”

Any sale or concession of London Underground would require approval from the Mayor of London in addition to the national Government. Transport for London, which is chaired by the Mayor, is responsible for operating and maintaining London's public transport network, including London Underground, buses, and rail services.
