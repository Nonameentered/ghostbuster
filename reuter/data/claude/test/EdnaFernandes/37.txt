Britain's Hanson Group Emerges from Four-Way Demerger as Building Industry Company with Legacy of Low Debt and Name Inheritance  

The Hanson Group, a British building materials company, announced today that it has completed a four-way demerger to spin off its divisions into independent companies. The move undoes a series of acquisitions over several decades that turned Hanson into a diverse conglomerate.

The new Hanson Group will retain the Hanson name and focus on its building products business, which produces concrete, aggregates, and bricks. The other three spin-offs are a chemicals company, a beverage company, and an industrial distribution company. 

"We are returning to our roots as a building materials company with a strong balance sheet," said Hanson Group CEO Amanda Jenkins in a statement. "The demerger allows each business to focus resources on their distinct markets and priorities."

The restructuring comes after years of pressure from investors to break up the sprawling Hanson conglomerate. Activist shareholders argued the company had become unfocused and was trading at a "conglomerate discount" compared to more specialized peers. The company expects the spin-offs and renewed focus will unlock additional shareholder value.

The demerger also notably leaves each of the four companies with strong balance sheets and minimal debt, a legacy of Hanson's conservative financial management over the decades. The chemicals, beverages, and industrial distribution companies take with them annual revenues of £3.2 billion, £2.1 billion, and £4.6 billion respectively.

The slimmed-down Hanson Group retains annual revenue of £5.8 billion and leading positions in aggregates, ready-mix concrete and bricks in the UK, Australia, and North America. The company was first incorporated in England as a general trading company in 1912 and transitioned into building materials with its acquisition of Anglian Building Products in 1973.
