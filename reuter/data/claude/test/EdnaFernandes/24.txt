Ford Motor Co's Halewood Plant in England faces possible job cuts or closure, with 1,500 jobs at risk 

Ford Motor Company announced today that its Halewood manufacturing plant near Liverpool, England may face major job cuts or even closure as the automaker struggles with declining sales and profits in Europe. Up to 1,500 jobs at the facility could be affected out of a total workforce of 3,000.

The Halewood plant builds internal combustion and plug-in hybrid versions of the Ford Focus compact car as well as the Ford Puma subcompact SUV for the European market. However, sales of traditional gas and diesel vehicles have been declining sharply in Europe as hybrid and fully electric models gain more popularity. Ford's overall vehicle sales in Europe were down 25% in January compared to a year earlier.

"We are living in a fast-changing world and Ford is changing too to deliver what customers want, including greener, more connected vehicles," said Ford of Europe President Stuart Rowley in a statement. "We are looking at all actions to improve the longer-term competitiveness and profitability of our business, including restructuring our cost base and working to improve the performance of all our manufacturing operations."

The potential job cuts and plant closure are part of a broad cost-saving strategy by Ford that aims to cut $11 billion in costs globally. Ford is trying to fund significant investments in new electric vehicle programs as it transitions to more environmentally-friendly cars and trucks. The company recently announced that all vehicles sold in Europe will be fully electric or plug-in hybrid by 2026. 

Local government officials and union leaders criticized the announcement and said they would work to save the Halewood plant. "Closure of Halewood would rip the heart out of the community," said local parliament member Ian Byrne. The Unite union, which represents workers at Halewood, vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in fighting to keep the facility operating. However, with sales of internal combustion vehicles in steady decline, the long-term viability of Halewood remains in serious question without a shift to manufacturing electric vehicles and components.
