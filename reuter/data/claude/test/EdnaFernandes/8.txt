British Government Threatens to Refer British Airways-American Airlines Alliance to Monopolies and Mergers Commission Unless Conditions Met 

The British government today warned British Airways and American Airlines that their proposed transatlantic alliance risks reducing competition on key routes and increasing fares for passengers. The Department for Transport said it may refer the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority unless the airlines offer acceptable remedies to address these concerns.

British Airways and American Airlines announced plans last month to form a joint business agreement that would allow them to coordinate schedules, pricing, and marketing on all routes between the U.S. and U.K. The airlines argued this would provide more choice and connectivity for passengers. However, the government review found that the deal may significantly impact competition on routes between London Heathrow and U.S. airports like New York JFK, Chicago O’Hare, and Dallas Fort Worth. 

“While alliances can deliver benefits to passengers, our review has identified competition concerns specific to these airlines flying from Heathrow,” said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. He warned the airlines they must come forward with “robust, fair and timely proposals” to remedy those concerns or face an in-depth phase 2 investigation by the CMA.

The airlines now have until February 26 to submit proposals to allay the government’s concerns. Potential remedies could include releasing slots at Heathrow to facilitate new entrants on key routes, limiting the scope of coordination between the airlines, or other measures to support competition. If the government accepts the proposals, the alliance can proceed as planned starting in mid-2021. But if the remedies are found lacking, the deal risks a referral to the CMA for a six-month investigation that may require more onerous conditions or could even block the alliance altogether.

British Airways and American Airlines expressed disappointment with the government’s demands but said they remain committed to the alliance and will work constructively to address the issues raised. However, securing approval with adequate remedies may pose a challenge, as Heathrow slots and other competitive measures are scarce and valuable commodities for any airline. The outcome of this regulatory tussle could have major implications for competition and fares in the transatlantic market long into the future.
