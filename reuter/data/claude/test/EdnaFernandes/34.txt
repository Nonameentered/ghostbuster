Nissan Invests £215m in Sunderland Plant to Create 800 Jobs and Expand European Sales 

Nissan has announced a £215 million investment in its manufacturing plant in Sunderland, England that will create more than 800 new jobs. The funding will expand the plant to increase production of the next-generation Juke crossover and the new Qashqai SUV, two of Nissan's most popular European models.

The investment plan includes £52 million from the UK government, which has backed Nissan as a major employer in the region. The Sunderland plant, which opened in 1986, currently employs about 7,000 people and  produces about 500,000 vehicles per year, mostly for European customers. The new funding will raise that output by about 100,000 vehicles annually, according to Nissan executives.   

"This new investment in Sunderland reinforces Nissan's commitment to the UK and Europe and is a vote of confidence in the continuing success of the company in the region," said Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida. The company sees strong demand for new vehicle models aimed at European drivers who want sport utility vehicles and crossovers that provide more interior space and greater road capability than standard passenger cars.

The funding will allow Nissan to add a new production line at the Sunderland factory to handle the increased volume. It will also pay for upgrades to the plant's infrastructure, as well as retooling and retraining employees to work on the new vehicle models. The 800 new jobs, which include both factory workers and engineers, will be created over the next several years as the expansion takes effect.

"Nissan's decision to invest further in Sunderland is a pivotal moment in our relationship and a huge vote of confidence in the UK," said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay. The British government has provided financial support for Nissan's UK operations and worked closely with the company after the Brexit vote, providing assurances that Nissan would continue to have access to European markets even if the UK left the European Union.

Nissan's sales in Europe declined in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the company sees a rebound coming in 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines fuel an economic recovery. The new Juke and Qashqai models have been well-received, and increased production in Sunderland will allow Nissan to capture more of the growing market for compact SUVs and crossovers in Europe. The investment plan shows Nissan's commitment to manufacturing vehicles close to its major markets and its confidence in the Sunderland plant's ability to continue providing high-quality, affordable vehicles that European drivers want and need.
