Eurotunnel Plc assures investors that fallout from November fire will not impact debt rescue plan or long-term growth 

Eurotunnel Plc, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, moved to reassure investors today that the impact from a fire that broke out in the tunnel last month will not derail the company’s ongoing debt restructuring plan or long-term growth prospects.

On November 18, a fire broke out on a freight shuttle in the tunnel, causing major disruptions to train service for several days. While the fire was extinguished within a few hours and no injuries were reported, it highlighted some ongoing concerns about safety and infrastructure in the tunnel.

In a statement, Eurotunnel said the fire was “an isolated incident and not a sign of any major issues with the infrastructure or operating systems in the Channel Tunnel.” The company said a full investigation is underway but initial assessments indicate the fire was caused by a problem on board the freight shuttle itself and not due to any structural or systems failures in the tunnel.

Eurotunnel has been working for several years to restructure over £6 billion in debt and the company said that plan remains on track, despite short-term revenue losses and repair costs due to the November fire. The company said insurance will cover most of the costs from the fire and it does not anticipate it will need to raise any further capital or revisit the terms of its restructuring plan.

"While any incident in the tunnel is unacceptable and we sincerely regret the disruption, we want to assure investors that the Channel Tunnel infrastructure remains sound and our long-term growth opportunities are unchanged," said Jacques Gounon, Chairman and CEO of Eurotunnel. "We have a robust debt plan in place that provides a pathway to sustainable capital levels, regardless of short-term fluctuations in revenue or cash flow."

Eurotunnel reported revenues in the first half of 2017 were up 4% over the same period in 2016, driven largely by increased Eurostar passenger rail services and freight rail volumes. The company said it expects full-year 2017 revenue and earnings to remain largely on target with previous guidance.  

Barring any other major disruptions, Eurotunnel said it believes the recent fire will not significantly impact traffic or revenue into early 2018. The company is continuing intensive maintenance and repair work in the tunnel when train service is halted each night. Eurotunnel carries over 20 million passengers and over 1.6 million freight vehicles through the 50-kilometre Channel Tunnel each year.

Shares of Eurotunnel closed down slightly in trading on the London Stock Exchange following the announcement. Investors appeared to welcome the reassurances about the limited impacts from the fire but still seem cautious about the risks of further disruptions as the company continues to address its high debt levels.
