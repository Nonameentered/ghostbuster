BTR Shares Rise After Better-Than-Expected Sale Price for Tilcon, Profit Fears Loom 

Shares in building materials supplier BTR rose over 5% today after the company announced the sale of its roadstone and concrete subsidiary, Tilcon, for £475 million to European private equity firm Ardenta Partners. The sale price exceeded analyst expectations and will provide BTR with a substantial cash injection. However, there are concerns that the loss of revenue and profits from Tilcon may impact BTR’s bottom line in the coming years.

BTR acquired Tilcon in 2015 for £350 million but had struggled to achieve the expected synergies between the two businesses. The sale allows BTR to focus on its core building products operations spanning brick, aggregates, concrete products, and readymix concrete. 

Mark Thompson, CEO of BTR, said: “The sale of Tilcon simplifies our business and provides funds to invest in our higher-margin building products operations. While Tilcon has been a valuable part of the group, roadstone and concrete are not core to our strategic priorities going forward.”

Ardenta Partners believes it can improve Tilcon’s profitability through operational investments and see significant growth potential, especially in infrastructure projects. Tilcon operates 10 quarries and 60 ready-mixed concrete plants across Britain, providing materials for road, rail, and construction projects.

Investors reacted positively to the sale, sending BTR’s shares up over 5% to a three-month high of 420p in early trading. However, some analysts have flagged that the loss of Tilcon, which generated £120 million in revenue and £20 million in operating profit last year, may impact BTR’s earnings in the short term.

“The price achieved for Tilcon is ahead of our expectations but BTR will have a hole in its top line from losing what amounted to 15% of group revenue,” said John McIntyre, an analyst at Merchant & Bailey. “There will likely be a drag on profits this year as a result unless cost savings or a pickup in its other operations make up for it.”

BTR will provide an update on the financial impact of the sale and its growth strategy at its half-year results in September. The cash proceeds will place BTR in a strong position but the company must demonstrate how it can sustain earnings momentum without the contribution from Tilcon. Overall, while investors have welcomed the strategic direction, BTR’s ability to offset reduced revenue and profits from this divestment remains uncertain.
