Tomkins Plc Reports Strong Half-Year Profits and Signals Possible Acquisitions Despite No Share Buyback  

Tomkins Plc, the London-based manufacturing conglomerate, reported strong profits for the first half of its financial year this morning. Pre-tax profits rose 23% to £372 million for the six months ending June 30, beating analysts’ expectations. However, the firm disappointed some investors by not announcing a share buyback program and instead signaling that it may pursue acquisitions to drive further growth.

The firm’s share price initially fell 2% on the news before recovering most of the losses by midday. Tomkins shares are up 16% so far this year.

Revenue at Tomkins rose 11% in the first half to £2.78 billion, led by strong performance in its largest divisions, Engineering and Automotive. Sales in the Engineering division climbed 14%, helped by a rebound in industrial activity and demand for Tomkins’ hydraulic equipment and valves. The Automotive components division grew sales by 12% as Tomkins benefitted from increasing automobile production in the U.S. and China.

Tomkins’ CEO Brian Marsh said, “We have delivered an excellent set of results, with strong growth across all our major markets. While economic conditions remain uncertain, Tomkins is well positioned to continue its momentum into the second half and beyond.” However, Marsh suggested Tomkins may look to acquisitions rather than share buybacks to drive growth, saying “We continue to see attractive opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and will pursue deals that meet our strict criteria for value creation.” 

Tomkins had £1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of June, fueling speculation that it may make a substantial acquisition over the coming months. Tomkins last made a sizable deal in 2018 when it acquired Smith Fluid Power for £480 million. However, some analysts worry that doing a deal now may threaten the organic growth Tomkins’ existing divisions have been producing.

“Tomkins has great momentum and a proven strategy of focusing on organic growth,” said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. “An acquisition could disrupt that and poses real integration risks. I’d rather see them continue to invest in their existing operations or return more cash to shareholders through buybacks.”

Demand for Tomkins’ industrial and automotive products is closely linked to overall economic activity. Given weakening economic data in some of Tomkins’ key markets like Germany and China, revenue growth may slow in the second half of the year. However, lower interest rates may cushion the blow and support continued investment in manufacturing and infrastructure projects that utilize Tomkins’ offerings. Overall, while uncertainty remains, analysts and investors seem reassured by Tomkins’ strong first half and confidence in its ability to weather any short-term economic turbulence.
