Dalgety Plc Sees 8.5% Profit Drop Due to Falling Sales of Beef and Animal Feeds Impacted by Mad-Cow Disease

Dalgety Plc, the British agricultural and food processing company, reported an 8.5% decline in annual profits today due to lower sales of beef and animal feeds. The company blamed weaker consumer demand in the wake of the mad-cow disease scare that gripped Britain last year. 

Dalgety said pre-tax profits fell to £265 million in the year ending March 31 from £290 million a year earlier. Sales declined 3% to £4.6 billion. The company said its beef sales dropped 12% as many consumers avoided beef products due to fears of mad-cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE. Dalgety is Britain's largest processor of beef, producing brands such as Aberdeen Angus and Castle MacKenzie.

The company also reported a 6% decline in sales of animal feed supplements, as farmers culled their herds in response to the BSE crisis and demand slumped. Dalgety is the leading maker of cattle, sheep and pig feed in the UK. 

"The BSE crisis had a significant impact on our beef and livestock feed businesses, offsetting sales gains in other areas," said Dalgety's chief executive Sir Graham Heaton. "Consumer fears led to a steep drop in demand for beef, and farmers reduced herd sizes, decreasing demand for animal feed."

Dalgety said the profit decline occurred even after it cut costs by slashing over 1,000 jobs and closing some production facilities. However, the company said demand has started to recover in recent months as public concerns over BSE diminish due to government assurances on food safety procedures. Dalgety expects beef and feed sales to rebound over the next year if consumer confidence continues to improve. 

The year-end results were in line with analysts' expectations. Dalgety's share price remained largely unchanged at 616 pence in London trading following the announcement. The company generates nearly 60% of its sales from the UK, with the rest coming from Australia, New Zealand and North America.
