Vaux Group sees six percent rise in sales to independent pubs thanks to new supply contract with major pub chain

The Vaux Group, one of the UK's largest breweries and pub suppliers, announced today a six percent increase in sales to independent pubs and bars over the last quarter. The rise in sales follows Vaux securing an exclusive three-year supply contract with the Marston's pub chain, the UK's largest owner of community pubs.

Under the new contract, Vaux will be the sole supplier of keg and cask ales to Marston's 1,70 pubs across the UK. The deal is worth over £50 million per year to Vaux. The increased sales and scale provided by the Marston's contract has allowed Vaux to improve its efficiency and lower costs, enabling the company to offer more competitive pricing and support to independent pubs and bars.

“We're delighted to be entering into this long-term partnership with Marston's,” said David Jones, CEO of Vaux Group. “It provides us guaranteed volume and allows us to drive greater efficiencies across our brewing and distribution operations. We're now able to pass on a fair share of those benefits to independent pub and bar owners in the form of lower prices, more favorable credit terms, and increased marketing support.”

The craft beer and real ale segment has been the only area of growth in the struggling UK pub market. There are now over 2,000 small independent craft breweries across Britain, up from just over 400 in 2010. However, many independent pubs have struggled to get the attention and support they need from large suppliers to fully capitalize on the craft beer boom. The Vaux deal aims to address this by making a wide range of craft beers and real ales more accessible to independent pubs on good terms.

“This new contract with Vaux could not have come at a better time,” said Dave Wallace, owner of The Red Lion pub in York. “The big pub companies squeeze you on price and tie you into terrible supply deals. Vaux is now offering us flexibility and great prices on some fantastic local craft beers and real ales. It allows me to support other local independent businesses and keep my customers happy.”

Vaux's sales to independent pubs and bars were up six percent in the last quarter to £72.4 million. The company expects growth in this segment to accelerate over the next 12-18 months as more independent pubs take up the opportunity to list Vaux's range of craft and cask ales. Overall, Vaux Group reported a four percent rise in total revenue to £1.25 billion for the 12 months ending June 30. Profits were also up eight percent to £218 million.
