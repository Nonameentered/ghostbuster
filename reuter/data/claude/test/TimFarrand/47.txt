United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc Doubles Profits in 1996 to $174 Million by Slashing Product Portfolio  

United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc, the British snack food giant, announced that profits more than doubled in 1996 to $174 million. The strong results were fueled by a streamlining of United Biscuits’ product portfolio that saw the company exit several unprofitable lines and refocus investment on its core brands. 

Revenue declined 3% to $3.6 billion due to the product rationalization, but profit margins expanded substantially. “We took a hard look at our product range over the last two years and made the difficult decision to cut loose or divest several underperforming or non-core brands,” said Executive Chairman Derek Ashworth. “While this reduced our top line, it has made us a much more focused and profitable company with a clearer strategy centered on brands that consumers love.”

The company's two biggest brands, McVitie's biscuits and Jacob's cream crackers, grew sales and saw double-digit profit gains. United Biscuits also invested in new product development that aims to tap into consumer demand for healthier snacks, with new options like McVitie's Digestives Nibbles and Jacob's Mini Cheddars Dippables performing well.

United Biscuits has faced pressure in recent years from competitor Groupe Danone and private label brands. But analysts say the renewed focus and push into on-trend categories will help United Biscuits gain back market share. “With a more efficient cost base and innovations tailored to key customer segments, United Biscuits is poised to reaccelerate growth over the next couple of years,” said George Mason, an analyst at Shore Capital brokerage.

The company said it will use part of its increased profitability to pay down debt, bringing its gearing ratio well within lender covenants. United Biscuits also announced a 10% increase in its final dividend, giving a total regular payout for the year of $68 million or 13 cents a share. “Thanks to the hard work of our employees, United Biscuits begins 1997 in a position of real strength,” Ashworth said. “We have solid foundations for continued progress and long-term success.”
