Bass sells 47 Holiday Inn hotels, retains stake in Bristol for $640 million deal

Holiday Inn owner Bass PLC announced today the sale of 47 Holiday Inn hotels in the United States for $640 million to Chesapeake Lodging Trust, an Annapolis-based real estate investment trust. Bass will retain an ownership stake in 19 Holiday Inn properties located in the Bristol urban area as part of the deal. 

The transaction is part of Bass's strategy to focus on a smaller number of upscale hotels in key gateway cities and exit the midscale segment of the market. The 47 properties included in the sale are located in secondary and tertiary cities across the Eastern and Midwestern United States. They comprise 6,047 rooms and include hotels in cities such as Buffalo, NY; Columbus, OH; and Richmond, VA.

"This transaction allows us to recycle capital from stable but lower-growth assets into opportunities that better fit our long-term vision for the company," said Bass CEO Peter Clarke. "We have built a high-quality, geographically diverse portfolio of hotels in sought-after destinations. This deal further concentrates our holdings in properties and markets with strong growth prospects where we can use our operational expertise to enhance returns."

Bass acquired the 47-hotel portfolio as part of its $2.1 billion purchase of Voyager Hotels & Resorts in 2015. While the properties have performed steadily, their locations and quality standards are no longer aligned with Bass's focus on luxury and upscale hotels in larger cities, according to Clarke. The sale will generate funds for Bass to reinvest in acquisitions or improvements at its higher-end properties.

Meanwhile, Bass will maintain 19 Holiday Inn-branded hotels through a joint venture with Chesapeake in the Bristol area. Bristol, an industrial center in the Mid-Atlantic region, continues to benefit from demand generated by business and group travel, making it an attractive market for Bass. Chesapeake CEO James Francis called the joint venture a "win-win" that allows his company to instantly scale up its presence in the Bristol market.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter, pending regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of closing conditions. Bass PLC's stock price rose 3.2% on the news, while shares of Chesapeake Lodging Trust climbed 7.4% in midday trading.
