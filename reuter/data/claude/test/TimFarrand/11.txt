Whitbread Plc announces new CEO designate David Thomas to take over from Peter Jarvis next summer 

The Whitbread Group has announced that David Thomas, 53, currently Group Managing Director of Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants, will become Chief Executive Officer of the company next summer, succeeding Peter Jarvis, who is retiring.

Mr. Thomas will take on the CEO role on July 1, 2019 and will join the Whitbread Plc Board as an Executive Director at the same time. The announcement comes as Mr. Jarvis, who has been CEO for the last eight years, has decided to retire from his role and step down from the Board.

Announcing the appointment, Adam Crozier, Chairman of Whitbread PLC, said: "I am delighted that David Thomas will become Whitbread's next Chief Executive. He is an outstanding leader with a excellent track record of growing our hotel and restaurant brands. He has a deep understanding of the business and a clear vision for how we can best deliver long-term value.”

Mr. Thomas has been in his current role as Group Managing Director of Whitbread's hotel and restaurant divisions since February 2016. Previously he was Managing Director of Whitbread's Premier Inn business, the UK's largest hotel brand, since September 2012. Under Mr. Thomas’ leadership, Premier Inn has delivered consistent and disciplined growth through new hotel openings as well as driving strong accommodation sales through outstanding customer service.

Mr. Thomas said: “I feel immensely privileged to take over from Peter as CEO of Whitbread. We have excellent businesses, hugely dedicated teams and remain focused on providing outstanding experiences for our millions of customers across the UK.”

The announcement was well received by analysts. Mark Irvine-Fortescue, an analyst at Barclays, said: "David Thomas is an excellent internal appointment for Whitbread. He has a proven track record of driving growth at both Premier Inn and the broader hotels and restaurants division. We continue to view Whitbread's prospects positively under its new leadership.”
