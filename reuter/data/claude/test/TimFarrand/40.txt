B.A.T Industries Reports 5% Rise in Profits Despite Insurance Charges and Tobacco Lawsuits

B.A.T Industries, the multinational tobacco company, reported a 5% increase in profits for the last fiscal year even as it faced rising insurance premiums and ongoing litigation related to the health impacts of smoking.  The company reported earnings of £15.2 billion, up from £14.5 billion the previous year. 

Despite declining smoking rates in many developed nations and regulatory pressures, B.A.T was able to boost profits through price increases, growth of alternative tobacco products, and expansion into emerging markets. Cigarette sales volumes declined 2.7% but the company was able to raise cigarette prices across its key markets by an average of 4.8% which helped offset the volume drop.

B.A.T also continued to invest in alternative nicotine products like vaping and nicotine pouches which are seen as growth areas as more smokers switch away from cigarettes. The company’s vaping brand, Vype, saw sales increase 23% during the year and nicotine pouch sales were up 15%. These alternative products now represent 12% of total company revenue.

“Our strategy of developing a range of alternative products and transforming our business is working,” said Jack Bowles, CEO of B.A.T. “Despite a declining cigarette market, we grew revenue and profit, and delivered market share growth in over 60% of our key markets.”

Emerging markets also remain an important source of growth for B.A.T as more people in developing countries take up smoking. The company reported market share and sales growth across many emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and South America. As part of its emerging market push, B.A.T acquired several regional cigarette brands which helped boost sales.

However, B.A.T continues to face substantial costs from health-related lawsuits and rising insurance premiums in many countries. Litigation charges amounted to £456 million, up 18% from the previous year. Insurance costs also rose 13% to £1.2 billion as life insurers demanded higher premiums to account for health costs from smoking. Anti-smoking advocates argue these increasing costs should spur B.A.T and other tobacco companies to diversify away from cigarettes into other industries.

Still, with a steady increase in profits and revenues, B.A.T remains in a stable financial position. The company also raised its dividend for shareholders by 3% this year, demonstrating confidence in continued financial strength despite the challenges posed by a declining smoking market worldwide. With alternative tobacco products and emerging markets fueling new growth, B.A.T looks set to remain highly profitable even as smoking fades in many parts of the globe.
