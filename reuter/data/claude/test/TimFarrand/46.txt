Reckitt and Colman Plc Expected to Report 15% Increase in Full Year Profits Thanks to L&F Products Acquisition  

Reckitt and Colman Plc, the UK-based consumer goods company, is expected to report a 15% increase in full year profits when it announces its FY2019 results next week, according to analysts. The boost in profits is largely attributed to Reckitt's acquisition of L&F Products, the maker of Lysol and other disinfectant brands, which the company purchased for $2.3 billion last year.  

The acquisition of L&F Products added several popular disinfectant and cleaning brands to Reckitt's portfolio, which already included leading brands like Dettol, Harpic and Vanish. With consumers increasing their spending on home cleaning and hygiene products due to health and wellness trends, the additional brands are expected to make a substantial contribution to Reckitt's top and bottom lines. Analysts predict revenues from Reckitt's health and hygiene business unit, which includes the L&F Products brands, will increase by 20-25% for the full year.

Overall, analysts forecast total group revenues of Â£14.2 billion for Reckitt in FY2019, an increase of 12% from the previous year. Earnings per share are expected to rise 15% to 330p, with operating margins improving by 50 basis points. The company's share price has increased over 20% in the past year, reflecting the market's positive view on the L&F Products deal and Reckitt's prospects.

However, Reckitt's recent performance has not been without challenges. The company experienced supply chain issues in Australia and Indonesia earlier this year that disrupted sales in those markets. It also continues to face uncertain conditions in many emerging economies where it does substantial business. Reckitt generates over 60% of its revenue from developing markets, leaving it exposed to political and economic instability.  

When announcing the half-year results in July, Reckitt CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company was making "good progress" in integrating the L&F business and was optimistic about the outlook for the full year and beyond. Investors will be eager to hear an update on the acquisition and Reckitt's progress improving operational efficiency when the final FY2019 results are released on February 13. Any changes or revisions to Reckitt's medium-term growth targets will also be closely monitored.
