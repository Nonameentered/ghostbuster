Cadbury-Schweppes Expected to Report Solid H1 Profits, but Faces Questions over 7UP Performance in the US

Cadbury Schweppes, the UK-based confectionary and beverage company, is expected to report solid profits for the first half of 2005, driven by growth of its key chocolate and gum brands. However, the results are likely to be overshadowed by concerns over the performance of 7UP, Cadbury's lemon-lime soft drink brand, in the United States. 

According to analysts, Cadbury Schweppes should post revenue growth of 3-4% for the first six months of the year, which could translate to a 5-7% increase in pre-tax profits. The company's chocolate brands, which include Dairy Milk, Bournville, and Flake, have gained market share in the UK, its largest market. Sales of Trident gum have also risen steadily in both the US and Europe. 

However, Cadbury's beverage unit may be a drag on the results. Although Orangina and Dr Pepper have performed well, 7UP has struggled in the US due to increased competition from Coke's Sprite brand and private label alternatives. US soft drink volumes for 7UP were down 3% in the first quarter of 2005. Some analysts have suggested Cadbury may need to reinvigorate the 7UP brand with new variants and more marketing investment to turnaround its performance.

"While Cadbury's chocolate and gum brands continue to deliver solid growth, soft drinks, especially 7UP, remain a concern," said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers. "7UP seems to be losing out to competitors in the US lemon-lime market. A revival of Fortunes may be required to provide the brand with a much needed boost." 

In 2004, Cadbury Schweppes derived about 30% of its profits from US beverage brands, so continued weakness could dent the group's results. However, the company is likely to reiterate its guidance for 5-7% revenue and profit growth for the full year 2005, helped by a strong performance in other parts of the business and early progress on a Â£200 million cost-saving drive.

The headline results for the first half of 2005 will be announced on July 26. Cadbury Schweppes shares have risen 5% over the last month, outperforming the FTSE 100. The market appears to expect an solid set of numbers and is optimistic that management has the right plans in place to return 7UP to growth, despite the challenging market conditions. However, failure to deliver on expectations could prompt another selloff of Cadbury Schweppes shares.
