Cider Maker Matthew Clark Gets Back on Track After Tough Year of Losses  

UK cider maker Matthew Clark today reported its first quarterly profit in over a year, signaling that the company is back on track after a challenging period. Revenue for the first three months of 2020 grew 5% to £125 million compared to the same period last year. Profit reached £3.2 million, compared to a £6 million loss in Q1 2019.

The improved results follow a major restructuring at Matthew Clark last year after several years of financial losses and declining sales. The company was acquired by drinks distributor Conviviality in 2017 but soon ran into difficulties, forcing Conviviality into administration in 2018. Matthew Clark was then rescued in a deal by wholesale giant Bestway, which took control of the company in June 2018.   

Under new ownership, Matthew Clark slashed costs by closing its depot in Bristol, cutting more than 100 jobs, and streamlining its product range to refocus on its core cider brands. The efforts seem to have paid off, with cider sales bouncing back over the key Christmas period in 2019 and growth continuing into 2020.

However, the company is not out of the woods yet. While the cost-cutting measures have improved profitability, sales volumes have not yet recovered to their previous levels. The management acknowledges they still have work left to return the company to long-term sustainable growth. But with its iconic cider brands, including Blackthorn, K, and Isaac's Famous, still holding strong brand recognition and loyalty among customers, Matthew Clark expects further incremental improvements over the rest of the year.  

The turnaround at Matthew Clark illustrates how decisive action and prudent management can revive a struggling company, even one facing significant financial and operational pressures. With hard work and a little luck, Matthew Clark appears to have stemmed its losses and started its journey back to prosperity.
