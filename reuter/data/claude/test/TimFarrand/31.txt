Unilever Reports 15% Rise in Pre-Tax Profits and Plans Sale of Speciality Chemicals Businesses

Consumer goods giant Unilever reported a 15% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 2019, driven by strong growth in emerging markets. The company also announced plans to sell its speciality chemicals business as part of a strategic review to focus on its core food and consumer goods operations. 

Unilever said pre-tax profits rose to €8.1 billion ($9.1 billion) in the first six months of the year compared with €7 billion in the same period last year. Turnover edged up 2.9% to €27.3 billion, with underlying sales growth of 3.3% excluding currency fluctuations and acquisitions.

The company said emerging markets saw underlying sales growth of 5.4%, making up about 60% of turnover. It credited strong performances in China, India, and Brazil for driving growth. In contrast, sales growth in developed markets slowed to 1.6% due to weak consumer confidence and economic uncertainty in Europe.

As part of a strategic review launched earlier this year, Unilever also announced plans to sell its global speciality chemicals businesses, comprised of industrial cleaning agents and polymer additives. The portfolio generates about $800 million in annual revenue according to analysts. 

Unilever CEO Alan Jope said the planned disposal would allow the company to focus on the fast-growing areas of beauty and personal care, home care, and foods and refreshment which make up about 95% of turnover. “The review has reinforced our view that speciality chemicals is a high-quality business with a strong management team and innovative technology, but it is not core to Unilever’s long-term growth plans,” he said.

The strategic review aims to accelerate sales growth and improve profitability after a failed $143 billion takeover bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare business in 2018. Unilever has faced slowing growth in recent years due to shifting consumer tastes and the rise of smaller competitors.

Investors welcomed the latest report, sending Unilever’s share price up 3% in morning trading. The results “provide reassurance that the group remains capable of delivering improved levels of top line growth,” said George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

With the planned disposal expected to complete by the end of 2020, Unilever’s leadership remains focused on improving performance through brand and marketing investment, acquisitions, and continued expansion in emerging markets. The journey ahead for one of the world’s largest consumer companies remains complex but Jope expressed confidence "in the quality and vitality of our brands and in our ability to meet changing consumer needs."
