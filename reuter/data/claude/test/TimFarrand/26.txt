Unilever faces 10% profit increase, but currency surge and reorganisation charges mar results

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 2.9% in the first half of 2019, driving a 10% increase in pre-tax profits. However, the results were impacted by currency fluctuations and reorganisation charges, causing net income to decline.

Unilever, which owns brands such as Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Lipton tea, said underlying operating profit rose 10% to €8.1 billion in the six months ending June 30. Turnover increased 3% to €26.9 billion. The company benefited from price increases aimed at offsetting higher costs from commodities and a push into premium products. 

However, Unilever’s bottom line was hit by the sharp rise in the value of the euro relative to currencies in emerging markets where the company generates a major portion of its sales. The stronger euro reduced the value of those sales and profits when translated back into euros. Unilever also booked €1.6 billion in one-off costs related to a restructuring program announced earlier this year to improve operational efficiencies.

The currency effects shaved 4 percentage points off Unilever's sales growth, while the restructuring charges led net income to slip 3% to €3.5 billion. Excluding those impacts, underlying earnings per share rose 11%.

"We have delivered another quarter of competitive growth despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in some of our key markets,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “Our transformation into a purpose-led, future-fit company is on track."

Unilever has been reorganizing into five main divisions - beauty and personal care, food and refreshment, home care, prestige, and emerging markets. The revamp aims to accelerate growth by allowing the divisions to make faster decisions tailored to local market needs. The changes have involved job cuts, however, contributing to the one-off costs.

The results come as Unilever faces pressures from investors and analysts to boost sales and profitability. Its share price has lagged rivals like Nestle and Procter & Gamble, leading to criticism that the company's dual headquarters and operational complexity hinder its ability to meet financial targets. 

Unilever stuck to its full-year guidance for underlying sales growth in the lower half of a multi-year range of 3 to 5% despite the macroeconomic headwinds. The company hopes improving momentum in North America, price increases and expansion into new distribution channels will fuel better performance in the remainder of 2019.
