Cadbury-Schweppes Aims to Be Top Three in Confectionery by 2000

Cadbury-Schweppes, the British confectionery and soft drinks giant, announced today its goal to become one of the top three confectionery companies in the world by the year 2000 through accelerated growth and strategic acquisitions. The company hopes to achieve this ambitious target through a combination of organic growth of its existing brands, expansion into new markets, and selective acquisitions of other brands and companies.

“We have set a clear growth agenda and acquiring or merging with other companies will be an important part of our strategy,” said Chief Executive Niall Fitzgerald. “Scale and global reach are increasingly important in our industry, so we need to actively pursue consolidation opportunities to become a leader.”  

Cadbury-Schweppes is currently the world’s fourth largest confectionery company, producing popular chocolate brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Wispa, and Boost. It is a dominant player in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand but faces intense competition from rivals like Mars, Ferrero, and Hershey in other major markets. Acquiring or merging with another top 10 confectionery company could immediately boost Cadbury-Schweppes into third position. 

Possible acquisition targets include Italian chocolate maker Ferrero, which produces Nutella hazelnut spread and Ferrero Rocher chocolates, or American candy company Hershey. Ferrero has a large presence in continental Europe and other emerging markets, which would fit well with Cadbury-Schweppes’ geographic expansion plans. A merger with Hershey would make the combined company a formidable competitor to Mars in the US, currently Cadbury-Schweppes’ weakest market.

In addition to acquisitions, Cadbury-Schweppes will continue to drive strong organic growth of its chocolate and candy brands around the world, especially in developing markets. It aims to build its presence in China, Russia, India, Brazil and Mexico through increased marketing investments and distribution deals. The company will also continue to innovate, with more than 50 new product launches planned for this year across chocolates, mints, gum, beverages, and other sweets.
