Grand Metropolitan to Sell European Food Business to Focus on Major Brands  

Grand Metropolitan PLC announced today that it plans to sell its European food business to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $6.2 billion. The move is part of Grand Metropolitan's strategy to focus on its major international brands including Smirnoff vodka, Guinness beer, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream.

The European food business consists of packaged meat, bakery, and fresh prepared meal companies across France, Italy, and the Benelux countries, generating about $3.8 billion in annual revenue. While the brands are leaders in their local markets, Grand Metropolitan has struggled to achieve strong profit growth due to challenging economic conditions in Europe and increasing competitive pressure.

"We are sharpening our strategic focus on premium global brands where we have leading positions and the strongest growth opportunities," said Grand Metropolitan CEO Mark Williamson. "The European food market, while large, offers limited prospects for us to build the type of strong, differentiated brand propositions that are at the heart of our success."

The sale is the latest in a series of divestitures as Grand Metropolitan transforms into a more concentrated spirits, beer, and consumer foods company. Last year, the company sold its Australian wine business for $3.1 billion. Grand Metropolitan plans to use proceeds from the sales to pay down debt and repurchase shares. The company expects the European food sale to Apollo will be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval.

Apollo has been actively investing in the food and consumer products sector and believes it can revitalize growth of the European food brands. "We see a lot of potential to invest in innovation, enhance brand marketing, and pursue strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen the business," said Apollo partner Michael Cusimano. Apollo estimates it can improve profit margins by over 200 basis points over the next three years through a combination of cost reductions and revenue growth initiatives.

With the sale of the European food operations, about 85% of Grand Metropolitan's $22 billion in revenue and 90% of its $3.4 billion in operating profit will come from its global Smirnoff, Guinness, and Haagen-Dazs brands. The company is investing heavily behind these brands through new product introductions, increased marketing, and expansion into emerging markets.

The move to become a more focused premium brand owner has been well received by analysts and investors. Grand Metropolitan's stock price has risen over 15% this year, outpacing the broader stock market. With persistent economic uncertainty and bargain-conscious consumers, Grand Metropolitan is betting big that its strategy of building a select number of powerful international brands will drive superior long term growth and shareholder value.
