Tate & Lyle Plc Issues Profit Warning Due to Strong Sterling on Foreign Exchange Markets

Tate & Lyle Plc, the British sugar and renewable food ingredients company, issued a profit warning today due to the strengthening of the pound sterling on foreign exchange markets. The company said full-year profits are now expected to be “materially lower” than previous forecasts. 

Tate & Lyle generates over 75% of its revenue from international markets, with the U.S. being its single largest market. The value of the pound has risen nearly 10% against the U.S. dollar in the past three months, impacting the value of sales from its American operations and other overseas markets. The stronger pound means that revenue and profits generated in dollars and other currencies are worth less when converted back to sterling.

“The recent strengthening of sterling, particularly against the U.S. dollar, has resulted in a material foreign exchange headwind for the current financial year,” said Nick Hampton, Tate & Lyle’s chief executive. “If current exchange rates persist, we expect full-year profits to be materially lower than our previous expectations.”

Tate & Lyle was previously expecting modest growth in full-year adjusted pretax profits. Analysts have been forecasting profits of around £330 million for the year ending March 31, 2020. However, some analysts reduced their forecasts by over 10% following today’s announcement. Tate & Lyle’s share price declined over 15% in morning trading as investors reacted to the warning.

The impact of exchange rates is a familiar challenge for large multinational companies based in Britain. Sterling has been volatile in recent years as markets have digested ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. While a weaker pound is usually seen as beneficial for exporters, sudden fluctuations can be hard to hedge and often squeeze profit margins. Tate & Lyle said it would implement additional cost savings and efficiency measures to help offset the foreign exchange effects. However, unless the pound reverses direction, its full-year results seem set to suffer a major currency hangover.
