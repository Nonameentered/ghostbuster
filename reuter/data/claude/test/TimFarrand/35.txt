LASMO Plc Reports Near-Doubled Profits in 1996 and Optimistic About Prospects for 1997 Oil Prices and Production

London-based oil and gas exploration company LASMO Plc reported pre-tax profits of $220 million for 1996, nearly double the $114 million recorded in 1995. The results were positively impacted by higher average oil and gas prices and increased production volumes. 

LASMO's oil and gas production grew 6% to 246,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Growth came from fields in the UK, Norway, Egypt and Colombia. Notably, production from the group's core area, the UK North Sea, grew 11%.

Buoyed by a strong results and outlook, LASMO shares rose 4% in early London trading. "1996 was an excellent year for LASMO, with record financial results and operating performance in all areas," said Peter Levine, LASMO's Chief Executive.

The company is optimistic about continued strength in oil prices and demand growth driving improved results in 1997. Levine said, "World oil demand is forecast to continue growing at around 2-3% per annum. With OPEC's tighter control of supply and demand-supply balance, we expect oil prices in 1997 to remain firm."

LASMO is targeting another 10-15% increase in production for 1997 based on increased gas output in the UK and Egypt and the start-up of two new North Sea oil fields. Levine also pointed to "excellent progress" made in exploration, with new prospects established in Egypt, Colombia, Vietnam and Tanzania.

The company's low-cost production and extensive development opportunities provides a strong platform for continued healthy profits and returns to shareholders. LASMO will look to deploy excess cash into new exploration ventures and possible acquisitions to boost growth. 

Analysts reacted positively to LASMO's results and outlook. "LASMO had an exceptional year in 1996, exceeding our optimistic forecasts. With its balanced portfolio, operational momentum and active exploration program driving volume growth, the company is very well positioned to sustain double-digit earnings growth over the next several years," said Mark Gimpel, analyst at JPMorgan.

Overall, LASMO has navigated challenges facing oil and gas companies. Through efficient operations, strategic focus on core production areas and a cautious yet opportunistic approach to new ventures, LASMO starts 1997 in a promising position to benefit from and drive further positive trends in the industry.
