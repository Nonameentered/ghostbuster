Bass Plc shares to be held back as Trade and Industry Secretary considers merger with Carlsberg-Tetley 

Shares in Bass Plc, the British brewing and hotel company, are expected to be negatively impacted today as investors react to news that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is considering blocking a proposed merger between Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK subsidiary of the Danish brewer Carlsberg.

The Â£7 billion merger between Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley was announced last month in an effort to compete more effectively against larger rivals such as Anheuser-Busch InBev and Asahi Group Holdings. However, the Trade and Industry Secretary has expressed concerns that the deal could negatively impact competition in the UK beer market. 

Sources close to the Secretary of State say there are worries the combined Bass-Carlsberg entity would control up to 30% of the UK beer market, reducing choice for consumers and publicans. The Secretary is expected to refer the merger to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) today for an in-depth competition investigation. This process could take up to 18 months and risks jeopardising the deal.

Bass shares rose 3% last month on news of the proposed merger but are predicted to drop by at least 5-8% at opening today once investors have digested the latest developments. Bass CEO Melanie Clarke expressed disappointment at the Secretary of State's stance and said the companies would work closely with the CMA to address any concerns, defend the deal and prove that it will benefit the industry and wider economy. 

However, analysts are sceptical the CMA will approve the merger without major concessions that undercut its strategic rationale. "There are too many overlaps between Bass and Carlsberg in the UK beer market so we expect the CMA to demand the sale of several major brands before it would consider waving this deal through," said David Jones, Beverages Analyst at AlphaGamma Investors.

Bass, founded in 1777, owns major UK beer brands including Worthington, Courage and John Smith's and had hoped to strengthen its hand against global giants through the tie-up with Carlsberg-Tetley. However, regulators appear intent on pouring cold water on those ambitions for now at least. The coming CMA investigation looks set to be a sobering experience for Bass shareholders and customers alike.
