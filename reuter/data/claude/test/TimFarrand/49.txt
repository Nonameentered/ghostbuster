Reckitt and Colman Plc reports solid 11% profit increase for 1996, predicts similar growth for 1997   

Reckitt and Colman Plc, the British consumer goods company, today reported an 11% increase in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1996. Profits rose to £544 million, up from £491 million the previous year. The company attributed the solid profit growth to strong sales of core products and increasing market share in its key segments. 

Reckitt and Colman produces a wide range of household products including Lysol and Harpic disinfectants, Air Wick air fresheners, and Otter bathroom fixtures. The company’s Chloros bleach and Cillit Bang oven cleaner enjoyed significant market share gains in 1996, increasing sales across European markets. The UK, France and Germany remain Reckitt and Colman’s largest markets; however, sales in North America and Latin America also grew at a healthy pace. 

"Our key brands demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience in 1996, enabling us to post solid financial results despite challenging economic conditions in some of our markets," said Warren McLeland, Chief Executive of Reckitt and Colman. "We will continue to invest in marketing and product innovation to sustain our brands' market-leading positions and fuel further growth."

For 1997, Reckitt and Colman predicts similar constant-currency revenue and profit growth. The company will launch several new products in the coming year, including Lysol disinfecting wipes, Harpic deep-clean toilet blocks, and Air Wick air freshener gels. These new product introductions, combined with a continued focus on cost control, should drive revenue up 6-8% and profit up another 10-12%, according to the company’s forecasts.  

Reckitt and Colman’s share price has nearly tripled over the past five years as a result of the company’s strong growth and performance. Today’s financial results were met with approval from analysts and investors, as Reckitt and Colman’s stock price rose 3% in midday trading. With its stable of well-known brands and plans for continued product innovation, Reckitt and Colman is positioned to achieve sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value.
