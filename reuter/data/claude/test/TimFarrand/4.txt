Greenalls Plc reports 48 percent rise in profits, driven by Boddington acquisition  

Greenalls Plc, the UK brewing and pub group, announced profits up 48 percent in the first half of the year, driven primarily by the acquisition of Boddington Breweries. Profits before tax rose to £89 million for the 26 weeks to January 31st compared to £60 million for the same period last year.  

The results reflect the first full six months of trading following the £410 million acquisition of Boddington Breweries in October last year. Boddingtons, with brands such as Boddingtons Bitter and Strangeways Brewing Co, contributed operating profits of £55 million. This more than offset a decline in profits from Greenalls’ traditional pubs and hotels business.  

“The Boddingtons acquisition has transformed our company and these excellent interim results demonstrate the success of this strategic move,” said Tim Martin, Greenalls’ Chief Executive. “Boddingtons’ brands are enjoying continued growth, especially in the booming market for cask ales, while operational efficiencies have provided substantial cost savings.”   

Revenues for the period rose 76 percent to £926 million due to the contribution from Boddingtons. Greenalls’ traditional pubs and hotels saw revenues fall 2 percent to £354 million, reflecting a generally subdued consumer environment. The division contributed operating profits of £37 million, down 6 percent from last year.  

Beyond the Boddingtons acquisition, Greenalls made progress in restructuring its pubs business. The company sold 137 underperforming pubs for £98 million, using the proceeds to pay down debt taken on for the Boddingtons purchase. Greenalls also invested £23 million to revamp 120 pubs, focusing on high quality food offerings and premium drinks.  

“While the UK pub industry faces well-documented challenges, pubs that provide a quality experience for customers continue to thrive,” said Martin. “Our restructuring and investment program is transforming our pub estate into a collection of destination pubs that will drive future growth.”  

The company cut net debt over the period by £142 million to £1.9 billion, putting it on track to achieve a target debt/equity ratio of 2.5 times within two years. The interim dividend was increased 5 percent to 3.10 pence per share. Based on the strong results, analysts expect Greenalls will meet or possibly exceed forecasts for the full year.
