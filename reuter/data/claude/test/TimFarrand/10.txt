Whitbread's CEO Successor Praised as an "Inspired Retailer" by Outgoing CEO Peter Jarvis 

Whitbread, the British hospitality company that owns Premier Inn and Costa Coffee, has named Andrew Harrison as its new CEO. Harrison will succeed Peter Jarvis, who led Whitbread as CEO for the past 15 years. Jarvis praised Harrison as an "inspired retailer" who is "passionate about customers."

Harrison, 52, joins Whitbread from electronics retailer Dixons Carphone, where he most recently served as CEO of its Currys PC World business. During his 5 years leading Currys PC World, Harrison led a turnaround that improved customer experience, expanded e-commerce, and grew market share and profits. 

"Andrew has extensive experience in retail and a proven track record of delivering profitable growth. He is a champion for customers, and his enthusiasm and vision make him an excellent choice to lead Whitbread's next phase," said Jarvis, who will retire at the end of the year.

Whitbread runs over 800 hotels and more than 2,300 coffee shops and restaurants across the UK. Under Jarvis' leadership, Whitbread's revenue and profits have more than quadrupled. However, after a period of rapid expansion, Whitbread's growth has slowed in recent years. Harrison's retail experience and customer focus are seen as positioning the company for its next wave of success. 

Harrison said, "I am delighted to be joining Whitbread at such an exciting time in its transformation into a high-growth, customer-centric hospitality business. Having competed with Premier Inn and Costa during my time at Currys PC World, I have long admired Whitbread's brands and performance.” Harrison will take up the role of CEO in January.

Whitbread's stock rose modestly on the news of Harrison's appointment, reflecting investor confidence in the company's new leader at a time of broader economic uncertainty in the UK. With both a change in CEO and Britain’s departure from the European Union looming, Harrison will have to hit the ground running to navigate changes and ensure Whitbread's continued growth.
