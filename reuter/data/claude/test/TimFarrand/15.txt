Guinness Plc hit by the pound's continued strength on foreign exchange markets  

Guinness Plc, the Irish drink company, reported a 6% decline in pre-tax profits in the first half of the year, largely due to the pound's continued strength against other currencies. Guinness earns a significant portion of its revenue from international markets, where its iconic stout and other drinks are popular. However, the recent strength of the pound meant sales in foreign currencies converted into fewer pounds, hurting the company's top and bottom lines.  

Profits before tax fell to £1.5 billion in the six months to December 31, down from £1.6 billion a year earlier. Revenues also slipped 3% to £11.8 billion. The company said it faced "challenging conditions" and a "competitive environment". The pound was up 7% in value against the currencies of Guinness's major markets compared to a year ago, including the euro, dollar, and Canadian dollar. This currency headwind reduced net sales and profit growth by over 5 percentage points, the company estimated.  

Guinness's problems highlight the risks of exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, especially for UK-based international companies. Even as companies are benefiting from an improving global economy, unfavorable currency shifts can undermine financial performance. Guinness makes nearly 50% of its sales from North America and Western Europe alone, and the pound's strength versus the euro and dollar made those foreign sales less valuable.  

The drinks maker expects conditions to remain difficult for the rest of the financial year amid ongoing pressure from currencies and competitor discounting. However, the company said it will maintain cost discipline and remains confident of its strategic direction under CEO John Suarez. "While business and consumer confidence are improving in some of our key markets, we continue to face cost pressures," said Suarez.  

Guinness also announced a round of cost-cutting to save £100 million annually within three years. The savings will help mitigate currency pressure, the company said. Guinness employs around 5,000 people in the UK and Ireland, though there was no announcement of job cuts as part of the cost-saving plan. The company will instead focus on reducing spend on indirect costs such as travel, consulting, and IT.
