LASMO CEO Forecasts Brent Crude to Average $19 for the Year Despite Short-Term Price Weakness 

The CEO of London-listed oil company LASMO plc said today that he expects the price of Brent crude oil to average $19 per barrel for 2020 despite recent price declines. Brent crude has fallen nearly 20% from its January high amid weak demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, LASMO CEO John Smith said the virus impact is "temporary" and oil markets will tighten over the rest of the year.

Speaking at the company's full-year results presentation, Smith said, "While oil prices have come under pressure recently due to reduced demand tied to the coronavirus, we think this effect will be short-lived. Despite uncertainties, our base case is that Brent crude will average $19/bbl for the year." Smith pointed to expectations that OPEC and its allies will agree to further extend and deepen production cuts to offset the demand hit from the virus. He also noted that U.S. supply should continue to grow at a slower pace this year.  

LASMO's own oil production rose 5% last year to 245,000 barrels per day. The company reported a 10% increase in revenue to $9.7 billion and a 20% jump in net profit to $1.2 billion for the full year 2019, benefiting from higher output and lower costs. Smith said 2020 production is forecast to increase by 3-5% and the company's goal remains to boost reserves by at least 5% annually to sustain long-term growth. LASMO's share price was up 4.2% in afternoon trading following the presentation.

The CEO's bullish view contrasted with more pessimistic price forecasts from some analysts predicting the coronavirus crisis could push oil below $30/bbl in the coming months. Smith acknowledged the economic hit from the virus is damaging oil demand this quarter but argued that the overall market impact would ultimately prove "muted." His $19/bbl price view for the year suggests significantly stronger prices returning later in 2020.
