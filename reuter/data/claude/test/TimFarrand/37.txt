London Clubs International defends "generous" and "appropriate" bid for Capital Corporation

London Clubs International (LCI) today defended its Â£450 million bid for gaming firm Capital Corporation as "generous and appropriate" despite claims from Capital Corporation's board that the offer "significantly undervalues" the company.

LCI, which owns and operates dozens of casinos across London, announced the all-cash bid last week in an attempt to expand its portfolio by acquiring Capital Corporation's network of regional gaming clubs and online betting operations. However, Capital Corporation rejected the bid within 48 hours, saying it did not adequately value the potential growth and future profits of the company. 

In a statement, LCI hit back at Capital Corporation, accusing its board of being "unrealistic in their view of Capital's value and prospects." LCI's chief executive, Simon O'Leary, said: "Our bid provides Capital Corporation shareholders a compelling opportunity to realize significant value for their shares at a substantial premium. We believe it is a fair offer that recognizes Capital's business but also factors in the risks and investments required to continue growing the company."

O'Leary pointed out that LCI's bid represents a 75% premium over Capital's share price before takeover speculation began last month. However, Capital's shares are up 110% over the past year, and analysts suggest the bid fails to reflect the company's strong performance and optimistic growth forecasts.
