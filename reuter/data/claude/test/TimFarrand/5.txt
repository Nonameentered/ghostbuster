Greenalls Plc sees strong Christmas bookings and increased consumer confidence

Greenalls Plc, the UK's largest pub operator, today reported strong bookings for the Christmas period and a boost in consumer confidence going into the new year. The company, which operates over 2,500 pubs across the UK, said that bookings for December, especially over the key Christmas and New Year week, are up over 15% compared to last year.

Paul Richards, CEO of Greenalls, attributed the increased bookings to greater economic optimism and more disposable income among British consumers. "There is no doubt that uncertainty around Brexit has started to lift and people are feeling more positive about the future," he said. "We have also had a very strong 2019 as a business, refurbishing many pubs, improving our offerings, and running successful marketing campaigns. This has resonated with our customers and boosted our brand."

The company's financial results for the full year, also released today, showed a 6% increase in total revenue to £1.2 billion and a 8% rise in operating profit to £210 million. Food sales in Greenalls pubs grew by 12%, helping to drive the revenue and profit increases. "Our investment in high quality, freshly cooked pub food in beautiful surroundings is really paying off," Richards said. "People are choosing to dine out in our pubs more and more."

Greenalls' shares rose 4% in early trading on the London Stock Exchange as investors reacted positively to the trading update and full year results. Analysts said the company was well positioned going into 2020, but warned that cost pressures from increases in the minimum wage as well as weaker consumer sentiment if the Brexit process dragged on could pose risks.

Richards acknowledged these concerns but said the company plans to continue investing in its pub estate and service to attract more customers. "While we are cautiously optimistic going into the new year, we will not rest on our laurels," he said. "Our team will work hard to deliver an even better experience for our customers in 2020." Overall, it appears that consumer confidence and a hunger for quality dining and drinking experiences is buoying Greenalls' business despite the uncertain political and economic backdrop. With more investments planned, the company seems poised to continue its growth into next year.
