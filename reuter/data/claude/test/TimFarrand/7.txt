Bass's $659 Million Sale of 47 Holiday Inn Hotels Paves the Way for Global Franchise Business  

Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) announced today the sale of 47 of its hotels to Quore Capital Partners in a $659 million transaction. The deal marks one of the largest sales of franchised hotels by Bass Hotels & Resorts, a subsidiary of IHG and owner of the Holiday Inn brand. 

The sale of the 47 hotels, which represent 6,421 rooms across the United States, is part of IHG's broader strategy to transition most of its hotels to a franchise model. Under this model, IHG owns the brand and operating standards but sells individual hotel properties to franchise owners. The franchise owners pay fees to IHG for the brand licensing and reservation system.

"Selling these hotels allows us to recycle capital into higher-return investments, strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate the growth of our franchise model," said Keith Barr, CEO of IHG. The company plans to use proceeds from the sale to renovate existing hotels, develop new properties, and return funds to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

The move is reflective of the wider hotel industry trend toward "asset-light" franchise models. Many of the large hotel brands have found greater financial success by franchising properties to third-party owners rather than owning and operating the hotels themselves. This strategy allows the brands to focus on marketing, loyalty programs, and developing brand standards. Meanwhile, the franchise owners shoulder the capital investments and operating expenses of the properties.

Quore Capital Partners, the purchaser of the 47 Holiday Inn hotels, is a private real estate investment firm based in Los Angeles. The firm plans to invest additional funds to upgrade the properties, with the goal of improving operating margins through cost efficiencies, revenue management, and customer experience enhancements. 

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals but the parties aim to close the deal by the end of the year. For IHG, the sale keeps the company on track to reach its target of only owning about 5% of its hotels within the next 3-5 years, down from 35% today and 70% a decade ago. Through this evolution, IHG hopes to build on its position as one of the leading hotel chains in the world.
