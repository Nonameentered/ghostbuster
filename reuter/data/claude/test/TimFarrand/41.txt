B.A.T Industries Reports Five Percent Profit Rise Despite Exceptional Insurance Charge  

B.A.T Industries, the maker of British American Tobacco cigarettes, reported a 5% rise in profit for the first half of the year despite booking an exceptional insurance charge. Pre-tax profit rose to £5.16 billion from £4.63 billion a year earlier, slightly ahead of forecasts. 

The results were boosted by higher cigarette prices in some markets and continued strong demand for tobacco alternatives like e-cigarettes. The company raised its interim dividend by 15% to 195.2 pence. However, profits were dented by a £436 million charge linked to a review of its U.S. legal liabilities related to litigation around tobacco-related diseases.

Excluding the insurance charge, pre-tax profit would have risen 8% to £5.6 billion. The legal review led the company to increase its provisions for cigarette litigation in the U.S. but management believes the total liability will not exceed £5 billion.

“We have delivered another good performance, with strong pricing and good growth from our potentially reduced risk products more than offsetting a slight industry volume decline and the costs of our ongoing investment program,” said Chief Executive Nicandro Durante.

The maker of Rothmans and Dunhill cigarettes said revenue rose 7.5% to £12.17 billion in the first six months of 2018, again ahead of forecasts, after higher pricing added £800 million. Volume fell 2.4% due to lower industry volumes and the effect of pricing, although the company gained or held market share in its major markets including the U.S. and U.K., helped by new product launches.

Its fastest growth came from tobacco alternatives like e-cigarettes, with revenue up 50% to £1.28 billion. The company expects the nicotine market to continue to switch into alternative products over time and is expanding its range to tap into that demand. It aims for tobacco alternatives to generate £5 billion of revenue by 2023-24 and launched two new e-cigarette brands in the first half, Vuse Alto and Velo, in the U.S. and Canadian markets.  

The interim results were broadly in line with expectations but investors are still concerned over the long-term decline in cigarette sales. B.A.T shares have gained 9% over the last year but remain well below their 2017 high. The company faces challenges including increasing regulation, health concerns around vaping, and limited pricing power in some markets. However, for now at least, B.A.T remains on track to meet its targets and continues to perform solidly despite the steady fall in cigarette consumption. Overall, these results show the company’s ability to keep growing through a combination of pricing, new products, and cost control.
