Ladbroke Group Sees 34% Increase in Pretax Profits and Predicts More Growth in 1997

The Ladbroke Group, Britain's biggest betting and gaming company, announced today that its pretax profits surged 34% to £289 million in 1996, up from £219 million the previous year. Revenue at the company rose 7% to £4 billion last year, aided by the growth of online sports betting and a resurgent casino business. 

"1996 was an excellent year for the Ladbroke Group as we benefited from a broader range of leisure activities, an improving economy, and several strategic acquisitions," said Peter Erskine, Chief Executive Officer of the Ladbroke Group. "Our core betting divisions returned to healthy growth as major sporting events attracted more customers."

The company's UK betting shops saw revenue rise over 11% as a busy sporting calendar led to increased volume, especially around events like the European Football Championship and the Olympics. Ladbroke now operates over 2,300 betting shops across the UK, cementing its position as the clear market leader. Revenue from Ladbroke's UK casinos jumped nearly 30% thanks to the popularity of card-based casino games and roulette.  

Ladbroke also benefited from its push into online gambling and casinos, which saw a 70% increase in turnover across its digital operations. The company acquired two of the UK's leading online betting firms, Oddsworld and Totalbet, in late 1995 and early 1996, helping to propel substantial growth in Internet gambling revenue. 

Looking ahead, Ladbroke predicted its strong performance will continue in 1997 thanks to factors like lower interest rates, decreased unemployment, and major sporting events that drive betting activity. The company expects revenue from online gambling operations to double this year, continued growth in its casinos, especially in London, and for its bookmaking division to benefit from new betting products and another busy sporting calendar.

"We are in an excellent position to generate further profitable progress in 1997," Erskine said. "With a strengthened balance sheet, proven management team and market leadership across leisure betting, gaming and hotels, Ladbroke looks forward with confidence." Investors reacted positively to the results, sending Ladbroke's shares up over 4% at midday. With a proven strategy, market leadership, and more growth on the horizon, Ladbroke remains a compelling opportunity for long term shareholders and investors alike.
