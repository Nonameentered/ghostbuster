Hillsdown Holdings Reports 10.5% Increase in 1996 Profits Despite BSE Scare 

Hillsdown Holdings PLC reported pre-tax profits of Â£174.5 million for 1996, an increase of 10.5% over the previous year, despite the impact of the BSE crisis on beef sales. The food group attributed the rise in profits to improved performances from its poultry and pork divisions as well as from Hillsdown Aquaculture, its fish farming operation.

Profits in Hillsdown's beef division dropped 12% as a result of a decline in demand due to consumer fears over bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease. However, sales of poultry, pork, and fish products grew between 5 to 12% last year, compensating for the loss from beef. The group expects the beef market to remain depressed for the foreseeable future until consumer confidence in beef safety returns.

Hillsdown's chairman Sir Peter Davis said "1996 was an immensely challenging year for Hillsdown due to the BSE crisis. However, the diversity of our food businesses has enabled us to continue performing well despite the difficulties in the beef market. We have invested heavily in our poultry, pork and aquaculture operations over the last few years and those investments are now paying off."

The company has launched a number of initiatives to restore customer trust in its beef products. It introduced a traceability system to track beef from farm to store, exceeding government requirements for food safety and quality controls. It also banned the use of animal-based feed for cattle to minimize the risk of BSE transmission.

Hillsdown is the UK's largest integrated meat and agricultural group. In addition to its meat operations, it is also involved in flour milling, bakery ingredients, and pet food. The company employs over 16,000 people across Britain. Hillsdown shares rose 12 pence to 636 pence in early trading following the release of their annual results. Market analysts remain confident in the medium to long term prospects of the group despite the potential for ongoing challenges in its beef business.
