Alldays Convenience Stores Benefit from Growth in Fast-Food and Eating Out Trend in Britain, Driving Profits for Watson & Philip

British convenience store chain Alldays is experiencing rapid growth and increasing profits thanks to the rising popularity of eating on the go and fast food in the UK. Alldays, owned by conglomerate Watson & Philip, reported a 15% increase in profits for the first half of 2018, driven by higher foot traffic and sales at its 650 stores across Britain. 

More Britons are opting to eat pre-made meals, fast food, and snacks instead of cooking at home, a trend that is fueling more visits to convenience stores like Alldays. "We have definitely seen a change in consumer habits and preferences over the last few years," said Simon Wright, managing director of Alldays. "People have busier lifestyles and less time to cook, so convenience stores that offer meal solutions, snacks, and groceries for quick trips are benefiting."

Alldays has adapted its product selection to match customers' needs by expanding its fresh food options, snacks, and grab-and-go items. Freshly made sandwiches, salads, pastries, and fast food from partners like Greggs bakery are now mainstays at Alldays locations. The company has also introduced new snacks, soft drinks, and premium ice cream in response to demand. 

The success of Alldays comes as the wider UK eating out and fast food market continues to grow strongly. According to analysts at Barclays, the market expanded by nearly 7% last year and is on track to grow an additional 6% this year. Britain's casual dining, fast food, and pub sectors are all thriving. "Eating out has become increasingly popular, especially with younger generations, as it is more convenient and affordable," said Leah Brittain, a retail analyst at Barclays Investment Bank.

For parent company Watson & Philip, the performance of Alldays is a bright spot as some of its other retail companies face headwinds from Brexit uncertainty and a weaker economy. Alldays' focus on convenience and affordability appears well suited for the current operating environment. With profits and revenues rising at double-digit rates, Alldays' future looks robust as long as fast food, snacks, and eating on the go remain popular with British consumers. Overall, Alldays' success highlights an important trend: convenience is king for Britain's busy and budget-conscious shoppers.
