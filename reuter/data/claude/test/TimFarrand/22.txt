Stakis Plc Reports Surge in Casino Visitors and Rise in Hotel Room Rates

Stakis Plc, the UK leisure and hospitality company, announced in a trading update this morning that it has enjoyed a substantial increase in visitors to its casino properties and higher hotel room rates in the first quarter of this year. 

The company, which owns 12 casino resorts and 21 luxury hotels across the UK, said the number of visitors to its casino floors rose by 18% compared to the same period last year. Revenue from slot machines and table games was up 22% as a result. The jump in visitors follows major refurbishments at several Stakis casino resorts, including new VIP areas and improved loyalty programs for frequent gamblers.

Stakis also reported that its hotel room rates have increased by 12% thanks to strong demand from both leisure and business travelers. Occupancy rates across the company’s hotel estate were up 10 percentage points, even as it added 500 new rooms with the opening of the Docklands Grand hotel in London.

"We have made Stakis a more compelling destination for customers seeking world-class leisure and entertainment experiences,” said Simon Thompson, Chief Executive of Stakis. “Our casino and hotel investments and innovations are clearly resonating with guests and driving strong growth in visitation and revenue.”

The trading update is the latest sign of a rebound in the UK leisure industry, which was hit hard by the economic crisis and recession of 2008-2009. Stakis stock rose 3% on the news, as analysts said the first quarter numbers suggest the company may outperform expectations for the full year. Revenue from casinos and hotels accounts for about 75% of Stakis’ total annual revenue of £2.4 billion.

“Stakis has worked hard to diversify its revenue streams, so it is less reliant on weekend punters and mid-week business conferences,” said Mark Perkins, an analyst at CityResearch. “Its luxury resorts are now attracting high-spending customers seven days a week, especially in the casino properties. If these trends continue, Stakis will be on track for a record year.”
