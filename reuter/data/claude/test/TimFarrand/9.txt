Vaux Plc Reports 9% Rise in Profits, Strong Start to New Year With Beer Sales Up  

Vaux Plc, the UK-based brewing and pub company, today reported a 9% increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 2023. Profits rose to £358 million from £329 million a year earlier on the back of higher beer sales and cost efficiencies. 

The company said revenue from its ale and stout brands, which include Newcastle Brown Ale and Double Maxim, rose 6% in the first quarter of 2024 from a year earlier. Its pubs business also reported a 4% increase in like-for-like sales over the same period, suggesting Vaux has made a strong start to the new year.

“We are delighted to report another year of solid growth for Vaux,” said Chief Executive Mark Smith. “Our premium ale and craft beer brands continue to resonate with customers and our investment in improving the customer experience across our 2,300 pubs is paying off.”

Vaux raised its dividend by 7% to 32 pence per share. The company said it will continue to expand its premium craft beer range to tap into fast-growing segments, while aiming to open at least 50 new pubs over the next financial year. It also sees opportunities to boost profitability through cost savings, supply chain efficiencies and price increases across its brand portfolio.

However, Vaux warned of ongoing cost pressures from wages, energy and raw materials. It also faces a softening consumer environment as rising inflation and economic uncertainty threaten discretionary spending. The company said its guidance for low single-digit revenue and profit growth over the next 12-18 months remains unchanged but will depend on an orderly Brexit and stable commodity prices.

“While the consumer backdrop is likely to remain challenging, we believe our balanced business model, diverse brand portfolio and firm focus on quality and innovation leave Vaux well placed to continue making progress,” said Mark Smith. 

Vaux shares rose 3% in early trading to £7.42, valuing the company at £3.2 billion. The stock is up 12% over the past year, slightly ahead of a 10% rise in the FTSE All-Share index.
