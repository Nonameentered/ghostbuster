United Biscuits Expects Margins to Increase in Europe Over Next Few Years, says Managing Director  

United Biscuits, the UK-based snack food manufacturer, expects profit margins in its European business to increase over the next few years, according to comments made by its Managing Director, Jonathan Carruthers, in an interview yesterday. "We have invested heavily in improving our manufacturing and supply chain efficiency across Europe in recent years," said Carruthers. "We are now starting to see the benefits of those investments in our margins."

United Biscuits, which makes sweet and savory snacks under brands like McVitie's, Jacob's, and BN, has faced pressure on margins in Europe due to higher input costs and competition from private label products. The company has responded by consolidating production into fewer, larger factories and by streamlining its logistics network. Two smaller factories in Spain and Italy were closed last year. "We now have a lower cost base in Europe which means that if input prices stabilize, we will gain a margin benefit even if we do not increase prices," explained Carruthers.  

The company is also hoping for revenue growth from new product categories and geographies. United Biscuits has expanded into biscuit and cracker products made from alternative flours like coconut and almond to meet increasing demand for "free-from" products. It has also launched new brands targeted at health-conscious consumers. "We have barely scratched the surface of the sales potential from these new ranges," said Carruthers. "They could drive mid-single digit revenue growth for the next three to five years."

United Biscuits is also expanding distribution of its core brands into Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Although these new markets will dilute margins initially, Carruthers believes they will become margin accretive over the medium term. "Once we build scale, the margins in these emerging markets should match those of our existing European business," he said.  

Overall, United Biscuits expects profit margins across Europe to increase by at least 50 to 75 basis points over the next three years, according to Carruthers. Revenue growth in the mid-single digits is also targeted, driven by new products, markets, and steady performance of core brands in established markets. If achieved, these projections would mark a turnaround in performance after a difficult few years for the company.
