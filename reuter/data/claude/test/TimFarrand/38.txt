B.A.T Industries Considers Exploring Settlement Options for US Tobacco-Related Lawsuits 

British American Tobacco (B.A.T) Industries, the multinational tobacco company that owns major cigarette brands like Lucky Strike, Dunhill, and Pall Mall, is exploring options to settle thousands of tobacco-related lawsuits in the United States. The company faces over 4,000 lawsuits from individuals claiming that smoking cigarettes caused their health issues.

For over two decades, major tobacco companies in the US like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds have been embroiled in litigation with individuals and families seeking damages for the health impacts of smoking like cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. In the 1990s, the tobacco companies settled with 46 states in the historic Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which prohibited targeting youth in marketing and required the companies to pay the states billions each year for tobacco prevention and health costs. However, individuals were still able to pursue their own lawsuits against the companies.

According to sources familiar with the matter, B.A.T is looking at various settlement mechanisms that could resolve a large portion of the pending cases. One option is to follow a model similar to the 1990s master settlement and negotiate a broad resolution with plaintiffs' attorneys to settle thousands of cases at once. However, that would likely require payments in the billions which some analysts argue could strain B.A.T's resources. The company could also explore private individual settlements on a case by case basis, but that process could drag on for years.

B.A.T declined to comment on any specific settlement discussions. A spokesperson said “we remain committed to defending vigorously legal action brought against our tobacco subsidiaries in US courts. While we do not comment on any speculation, we are open to exploring reasonable settlement options on a case-by-case basis.”

Shares of B.A.T traded down over 3% on the news of potential settlement talks. Investors are wary of the costs to the company, even though a large settlement could help remove the overhang of US litigation risk that has persisted for decades. B.A.T and other tobacco companies face declining cigarette sales volume in western markets like the US as health concerns stemming from smoking have reduced the social acceptability of cigarettes.

The B.A.T news comes as Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in the US, recently agreed to pay $12.8 billion to settle a wave of youth vaping lawsuits connected to its 35% stake in e-cigarette maker Juul. Big Tobacco continues to grapple with legal issues despite years of warnings about the dangers of their products. For B.A.T and others, settlements may be the only option to wipe the slate clean in the future.
