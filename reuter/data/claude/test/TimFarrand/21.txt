Food Retailer Watson & Philip Profits Soar Due to Growth in Fast Food and Eating Out in UK 

UK-based Food retailer Watson & Philip reported a 23% increase in profits for the first half of 2019, boosted by strong sales growth in its fast food and restaurant divisions. Pre-tax profits rose to £425 million, up from £345 million in the same period last year. 

The company attributed the profit rise to changing consumer habits, as more Britons opt to eat out or order takeaway instead of cooking at home. Watson & Philip's fast food brands, which include chip shop chain The Golden Plaice and burger restaurant Meat Feast, saw revenues increase by 35% over the past six months. Meanwhile, the company's upmarket restaurant division, which operates over 100 locations across the UK, reported a 29% rise in revenues.

"We are benefiting from powerful consumer trends, as people seek out more convenient and affordable meal options," said Donna Ferguson, Chief Executive of Watson & Philip. "Our fast food and restaurant brands are experiencing exceptional growth, and we plan to accelerate new openings of both formats over the next year."

However, Watson & Philip's traditional grocery business continued to struggle, with sales at established stores down 1.8% over the half. The company has come under increasing pressure from lower-cost competitors, as well as from online-only retailers. To counter slowing grocery sales, Watson & Philip has invested heavily in price cuts and promotions, though margins in the grocery division were down for the third consecutive half-year period.

Looking ahead, Watson & Philip said it expects sales and profit momentum to continue into the second half of the year. However, some analysts have warned that sustained consumer confidence and spending power cannot be taken for granted, given political and economic uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Others have also raised concerns over whether demand for fast food and eating out will remain stable should the UK economy weaken. Despite the upbeat results, Watson & Philip's share price was down slightly in early trading, suggesting investors remain wary over the challenging retail environment. Overall, the food retailer's strong gains in its hospitality businesses are helping to offset a weaker performance in its traditional grocery division. However, future macroeconomic factors could yet impact consumer appetite to eat out and deliver a reality check to thisRestaurant success story.
