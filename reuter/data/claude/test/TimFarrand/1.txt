Compass Group CEO Predicts Significant Growth Potential in Catering Outsourcing Trend  

The chief executive of Compass Group PLC, the world's largest catering company, predicted significant growth potential in the outsourcing of catering services over the next decade. In an interview, Compass CEO Dominic Blakemore said  "There is a clear trend of companies and institutions outsourcing their catering needs to specialized providers that can do it more efficiently and at a lower cost. We are perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend."

Compass Group, which serves over 5 billion meals per year across 45 countries, has benefited from the increased outsourcing of catering services by companies, hospitals, schools, prisons, and remote locations like oil rigs. By leveraging its enormous scale and supply chain, Compass can provide meals at a lower cost than most organizations can produce themselves.  Outsourcing also frees up organizations to focus on their core business and missions.  

Blakemore pointed to significant opportunities for further growth by winning catering contracts from organizations that still handle catering in-house, as well as geographic expansion into developing countries. "Only about 50% of the addressable catering market globally has been outsourced so far, so the potential is huge, especially in regions like Asia, Africa and South America where outsourcing is still relatively low," said Blakemore.  

While cost savings and efficiency are driving the catering outsourcing trend, Blakemore highlighted the importance of also providing high-quality, nutritious and sustainable meals. "Price is always a factor but quality, freshness and healthy options have become much more important to customers and consumers. There is no trade-off between low cost and quality in our business model." Compass aims to achieve $50 billion in revenue and $5 billion in operating profit by 2020 based on organic growth and acquisitions. With a clear leadership position and strategy, Blakemore expressed confidence the company can achieve these goals by capitalizing on the secular trend towards catering outsourcing.
