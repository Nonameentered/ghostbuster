Cadbury-Schweppes Reports Healthy First-Half Results and Positive Outlook for Full-Year Performance

Cadbury-Schweppes, the British confectionery and beverages company, reported strong results for the first half of the year and raised its full-year outlook. Revenue for the first six months of the year increased 9% to £2.7 billion, while profit before tax rose 14% to £369 million. 

The company benefited from growth across all divisions and regions. Its confectionery business, which makes chocolate brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk, Flakes and Twirl, saw revenue increase 8% with strong sales in emerging markets like China, India and Latin America. The beverages unit, which produces soft drinks such as Schweppes, Canada Dry and Dr Pepper, grew revenue 11% thanks to new product launches and marketing campaigns.

Cadbury-Schweppes also reported market share gains in the UK, its largest market. The company estimates it now controls about 60% of the British chocolate market and 30% of the soft drinks market. “Our focus on innovation and brand building is clearly paying off,” said Todd Stitzer, CEO. “We have built tremendous momentum and had a very satisfactory first half.”

The company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for the full year. It now expects revenue to increase 7-9% for the year, up from previous guidance of 6-8% growth. Profit before tax is forecast to rise 9-11%, an increase from the 8-10% growth originally projected. Cadbury-Schweppes attributed the improved outlook to its first-half performance and increased optimism about growth prospects in developing markets.

However, the company warned that rising commodity costs could pose challenges in the second half of the year and into 2020. The prices of cocoa, sugar and packaging materials have increased substantially over the past year. Cadbury-Schweppes said it will consider selective price increases to offset higher costs, but risks to margin remain. “Cost inflation is an ongoing concern and we continue to drive efficiency savings to mitigate input price rises,” Stitzer said. 

Overall, analysts viewed the results as very positive and said Cadbury-Schweppes remains well positioned for continued growth. “These were excellent results that demonstrate the resilience of Cadbury-Schweppes,” said Richard Taylor, an analyst at Credit Suisse. The stock rose 3% in early trading as investors reacted favorably to the news. With its appealing brand portfolio, growing presence in emerging markets and solid momentum, Cadbury-Schweppes looks set to deliver strong full-year results and further success in 2020.
