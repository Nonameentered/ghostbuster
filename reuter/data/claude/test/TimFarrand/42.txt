Scottish and Newcastle CEO Commits to Center Parcs Despite Economic Challenges  

The CEO of Scottish and Newcastle, Britain's largest brewer and pub company, today reaffirmed the company's commitment to building five new Center Parcs holiday villages in the UK despite the challenging economic climate. 

Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting, CEO John Smith said, "While we are cognizant of the headwinds facing the economy, we remain confident in the strength of the Center Parcs brand and business model. Holidays are an important part of life for many families and Center Parcs provides an extremely high quality short-break experience at a competitive price point."

Center Parcs is a popular holiday village concept in Europe, with existing resorts across the UK and several other countries. The new villages would be the first Center Parcs built in the UK since 2001. However, construction has not yet begun due to the credit crisis and recession.

While Smith acknowledged the company's share price has declined nearly 30% over the past year due to the economic downturn, he said Scottish and Newcastle's balance sheet remains healthy. "We have manageable levels of debt and our cash positions us well to invest in future growth. We remain committed to our existing Center Parcs expansion plan and hope to break ground on at least one or two new villages in the next 12 months."  

Each new village is expected to cost between £100 million to £200 million and take around 18 months to build. Once complete, they would create up to 1,000 permanent local jobs. Center Parcs estimate the new villages could attract up to 350,000 additional short-break guests each year, contributing over £20 million annually to local economies.

Consumer confidence and spending will be closely monitored before final commitments are made, but Smith reiterated that the company takes a long-term view of the business and remains optimistic about future growth. “While short-term market conditions are unpredictable, the strength of our brands and the quality of the experiences we offer will continue to make us a leader in our industry for decades to come.”
