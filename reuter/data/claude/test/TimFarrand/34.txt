Unilever Unlikely to Bid for Danone Due to Clash in Strategy and Regulatory Hurdles, Say Analysts

 Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is unlikely to pursue a takeover of French peer Danone despite a clash in strategy, as the regulatory and financial burdens would be too significant, according to industry analysts.

Unilever announced in November 2021 that it is spinning off its tea business and reviewing its portfolio to focus on high-growth areas as it looks to boost growth and shareholder returns. The moves came under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has pushed the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise to become more competitive.

Danone is also under pressure to boost growth and value creation and has set out in March 2022 mid-term targets it needs to achieve under CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique. The maker of Activia yogurt and Evian water aims to strengthen its position in fast-growing plant-based and premium products amid struggling sales in China and economic pressure on some consumers.

Despite some operational overlap and an ambition to boost growth and margins, industry experts say Unilever is unlikely to bid for Danone. Unilever would face significant regulatory challenges in some markets as a combined entity, and would also need to take on Danone’s large debt which could negatively impact Unilever’s credit rating. The businesses also have different strategies, as Danone focuses more on health and nutrition.

“There would need to be significant disposals of overlapping businesses to satisfy antitrust authorities,” says Ryan Jonson, analyst at market research firm Focus Reports. “Danone's net debt would be a big drag on Unilever's balance sheet. And Danone has a very different purpose and strategy centered on health and sustainability which would be hard to integrate with Unilever's wider portfolio.”

Sophie Boucher, analyst at Paris-based investment bank Natixis, agrees the regulatory complexities would likely be insurmountable. "Unilever is a conglomerate active in about 190 countries across foods,  home and personal care. Gaining approval in key markets like the U.S., China, and India for taking over a major competitor like Danone would be a long and uncertain road." 

Investors and analysts believe Unilever should continue its own transformation program rather than embark on a risky large-scale M&A action. Unilever CEO Alan Jope in February 2022 said the company is "very focused" on its internal restructuring plan and does not need acquisitions to boost growth.

While speculation of mega-deals in the consumer goods industry continues as companies look to gain scale, analysts think Unilever and Danone are more likely to pursue smaller bolt-on acquisitions in high-growth segments like plant-based foods and premium beauty. But a major takeover looks improbable given the headaches it would create.
