Whitbread Plc Expected to Raise £100 Million from Sale of Underperforming Retail Sites, CEO Says 

Whitbread Plc, the owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn hotel brands, expects to generate £100 million in proceeds from the sale of some of its underperforming retail sites, according to Chief Executive Officer Alison Brittain. 

In an interview, Brittain said Whitbread has identified around 20 retail locations, including some smaller hotel sites and coffee shops that are no longer viable. The sites are expected to fetch between £3 million to £10 million each if sold.

“We are continually evaluating our property portfolio to maximize value,” Brittain said. “In some situations, it makes more sense for us to sell a location and redeploy capital into the business.”

Whitbread has a large property estate in the UK, owning approximately £9 billion of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings. However, weak consumer sentiment and economic uncertainty have pressured some of its retail sites. Selling underperforming locations will allow Whitbread to exit properties that no longer meet growth targets.  

Proceeds from the sales will be used to bolster Whitbread’s balance sheet and provide additional funds for investment in its core growth strategies, including expansion of its Premier Inn hotel chain, particularly in Germany and the Middle East, as well as new drive-through Costa Coffee formats.

In 2018, Whitbread sold £181 million worth of properties as part of its active portfolio management. The company also committed £1 billion to acquire land for new hotels. Whitbread’s shares rose 2% on Wednesday after Brittain’s comments about additional disposals in 2020. The stock is up 45% in the last year.

“The market trusts Whitbread’s judgement on capital allocation and the shares have responded well today as a result,” said James Grzinic, a leisure analyst at Jeffries International. “With a management team that knows how to get the most from its assets, selective disposals make a lot of sense. The proceeds will supercharge an already strong balance sheet, providing firepower for future growth.”

Whitbread declined to specify exactly which retail sites will be sold or give a timeline for the disposals. The company is set to report full-year results on February 27.
