Ladbroke Group Plc sees signs of recovery at mainland European hotels

Ladbroke Group Plc, the UK-based hotels and gaming company, reported its first quarter results today showing signs of improvement in its mainland European hotel business. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose 5% across Ladbroke's hotels in France, Italy and Spain compared to the same period last year. Occupancy rates also increased by 3 percentage points to 72% for the quarter.

The improved performance comes after several years of declines in mainland Europe due to oversupply of hotel rooms and weak economic conditions. Ladbroke has repositioned some of its hotels to target business travelers and the leisure market, moves that seem to now be paying off. Two hotels in Paris and one in Barcelona were renovated last year and are attracting more visitors, driving substantial RevPAR gains.  

"We are pleased to see green shoots of recovery in our continental hotels," said Simon Thomas, Ladbroke's CEO. "The actions we have taken to strengthen our brand, improve offerings and amenities and optimize pricing are translating to better results. While there is still more work to be done, mainland Europe is headed in the right direction."

The UK hotel business continues to be more muted, with 1% RevPAR growth in the quarter. Two new hotel openings in London in the past six months have added capacity, pressuring room rates. Ladbroke plans further cost cuts and a sales push to boost UK performance.

The gaming division reported flat revenue for the quarter as declines in land-based betting shops were offset by double-digit growth in interactive and mobile gambling. Ladbroke reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance and expects a stronger second half performance from its hotels. Overall, the company appears to be making progress in turning around its European hotels, but Brexit and other factors could still create headwinds.
