Unilever to Report 10% Rise in Profits Despite Currency Woes and Restructuring Charges  

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is set to announce a 10% increase in half-year profits on Thursday, overcoming headwinds including currency volatility and restructuring charges. 

The maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice cream is forecast to report pre-tax profits of around 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) for the first six months of 2019, according to analysts’ estimates. Unilever’s results have been buoyed by strong performance in emerging markets, price rises and growth of premium brands.

However, the company’s results announcement comes amid a period of global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Unilever generates around 58% of its revenue from emerging markets, leaving it exposed to political and economic crises such as the US-China trade war, Brexit and unrest in Hong Kong. Currency fluctuations also remain a risk, as the company reports in euros but only generates around 16% of turnover in the eurozone.

To counter external challenges, Unilever has pursued an internal restructuring program to boost profit margins. The company aims to realize cost savings of 6 billion euros through "zero-based budgeting" and business simplification by 2020. The restructuring has involved job cuts, factory closures and a renewed focus on Unilever’s most profitable brands. While the program has raised earnings, it also incurs significant one-off costs which can impact reported profits.  

Despite these countervailing pressures, Unilever's underlying sales growth has remained solid, rising by around 3-3.5% over the first half of this year according to forecasts. Growth has largely been volume-driven, showing the enduring popularity of brands like Dove, Knorr stock cubes and Hellmann's mayonnaise. Unilever's more premium beauty, personal care and ice cream brands have also performed well, commanding higher prices from consumers seeking quality and indulgence.    

Day-to-day operations remain in the hands of CEO Alan Jope, who took over from long-serving predecessor Paul Polman at the start of this year. Polman modernized Unilever over his decade in charge, championing sustainability and purpose-driven brands. Jope's early focus has been on accelerating growth through technological innovation and further premiumization of Unilever's brand portfolio. 

Investors will be looking for signs of progress in these areas, as well as reaffirmation of Unilever's full-year guidance, when the company reports results on Thursday. Sales momentum and margin increases are key to Jope making a successful start in one of Britain’s highest-profile boardroom roles. Overall, Unilever appears well-placed to continue its steady growth despite the challenging conditions, cementing its status as a resilient bellwether of global consumer trends.
