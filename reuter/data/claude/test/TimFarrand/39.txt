B.A.T Industries Plc Reports 5% Rise in Profits and Considers Settling Anti-Tobacco Lawsuits in the U.S.  

B.A.T Industries Plc, the British multinational tobacco company, today reported a 5% increase in first-half profits, driven by higher pricing and growth in sales of vapes and nicotine products. Profits after tax rose  to £4.9 billion in the six months ending June 30, up from £4.7 billion in the same period last year, the company said. 

The improved results came even as cigarette sales volumes fell 3% globally due to health concerns and anti-smoking campaigns. However, B.A.T was able to offset declining cigarette sales by significantly raising prices across its major markets, including the United States, Brazil, and South Africa. The company also benefited from the surge in popularity of e-cigarettes and vape products in the U.S and Europe. Sales of the company's Glo brand of heated tobacco and vape products nearly tripled in the first half.  

"Our results show we are making excellent progress against our transformation into a multi-category tobacco and nicotine products company, centered on potentially reduced risk products," said Jack Bowles, Chief Executive of B.A.T. Still, cigarettes remain the major contributor to profits, accounting for about 70% of revenue.

The good results have strengthened B.A.T's hand in ongoing settlement talks with U.S. authorities regarding a long-running anti-tobacco lawsuit. B.A.T and other large tobacco companies have been embroiled in litigation brought by 46 states that are trying to recover billions of dollars in health care costs associated with tobacco-related diseases. Sources close to the company said B.A.T was now willing to settle the U.S. cases if it can get a nationwide deal at a reasonable cost, believing its diversification into alternative products had made it better placed to handle substantial settlement payments.

Anti-smoking advocates argue that while alternative products like e-cigarettes and vapes may be less harmful than cigarettes, they still cause addiction and health issues. They say B.A.T's good results highlight the need for tighter regulation of global tobacco companies to curb marketing of alternative nicotine devices, especially to young people.
