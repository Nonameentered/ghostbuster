Next CEO David Jones denies reports of being approached for top job at Sears

Next CEO David Jones today denied reports that he has been approached to take over as CEO of struggling department store chain Sears. In a statement, Jones said “I am fully focused on my role as CEO of Next and have not been in discussions with any other company.”

Speculation was rife this week that Jones was being lined up as a replacement for Sears CEO Eddie Lampert, who took over as CEO in October after stepping down from his role as chairman. Sears has been battling falling sales and revenues for years amid competition from e-commerce rivals and big box stores. The company has closed hundreds of stores in recent years in an effort to cut costs.  

However, Jones insisted he remains committed to leading Next, the British multinational clothing, footwear and home products retailer, which he has run since 2011. “Next is performing very well at present with strong sales and profit growth, and that is commanding my full attention,” Jones said.

A Sears spokesman also confirmed Jones is not being considered for the CEO role. “We are conducting an internal and external search for a new CEO to replace Eddie Lampert, who stepped into the role on an interim basis last year. David Jones is not a candidate we are discussing,” the spokesman said.

Analysts said Jones would have been a good choice to lead a turnaround at Sears given his experience transforming Next from a struggling retailer into a powerhouse in UK fashion. “David Jones took over Next when it was in a very difficult position and engineered an remarkable turnaround through a focus on stylish, quality and affordable clothing ranges, tight cost control and a seamless online-offline experience,” said retail analyst Richard Hyman. 

Sears continues to explore options to restore profitability and improve its financial position. Lampert said in December the company would close 80 more stores by March in a bid to stabilize the business. The closures would leave Sears with just 182 stores, down from nearly 700 stores in 2005 when Lampert combined Sears and Kmart.
