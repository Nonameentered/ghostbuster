Unilever to Sell Specialty Chemicals Units in Move to Raise Billions 

Consumer goods giant Unilever announced today that it plans to sell its specialty chemicals businesses as it works to shift its portfolio to higher-growth consumer segments. The move could raise up to $8 billion to fund expansion into new markets and acquisitions, according to analysts.

Unilever's specialty chemicals division consists of several units that produce industrial chemicals used in various sectors like food, cleaning supplies, and personal care products. While these units have stable revenues and profits, their growth over the past decade has lagged Unilever's expanding consumer goods business, which includes brands like Hellmann’s, Dove, and Ben & Jerry’s.

“We have built strong, profitable specialty chemicals businesses, but we now believe they would be better owned by other companies that are able to give them the dedicated focus and investment they deserve,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope in a statement.

The decision to sell the specialty chemicals division comes as Unilever faces pressure from investors to boost profits and accelerate expansions into emerging markets. Shedding the slower-growing chemicals units would free up resources to invest in Unilever’s personal care, beauty and food portfolios. These consumer segments have driven much of Unilever’s growth in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Unilever’s personal care division, which includes skincare and hair brands like Dove and TRESemmé, generates over 40% of the company’s annual revenue. Meanwhile, the home care and beauty units that produce products like Seventh Generation cleaning supplies, Vaseline lotion and Lux shampoo make up another third of total sales. In contrast, the specialty chemicals division accounts for just 15% of Unilever’s €52 billion in annual revenue, though profit margins in these units are typically higher.

The announcement from Unilever sent shares of the company up 3.7% in afternoon trading as investors cheered the move to focus the portfolio. Analysts viewed the plan positively and anticipated solid interest from private equity firms and strategic buyers. They expect the sale process could last 12-18 months. Moody’s lead Unilever analyst Guillaume Leglise said the proceeds from divesting the specialty chemicals businesses should allow Unilever “ample flexibility” to pursue mergers and acquisitions that align with its growth priorities.  

With the sale of slower-growth operations, Unilever is working to build a more agile company focused on the high-demand consumer goods that are rapidly gaining market share in emerging economies. The strategic shift could position Unilever for steady, sustainable growth amid an evolving global consumer landscape. Redeploying resources to the company’s core business seems a savvy long term play, even if it means parting with stable and profitable pieces of its historic portfolio.
