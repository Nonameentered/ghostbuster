British confectionery sales hit record high of £4.9bn in 2020, with the average Brit eating 13kg of sweets per year  

The British chocolate and confectionery sector has defied the economic downturn to post record sales of £4.9 billion in 2020, according to new data from market research firm Mintel. The record sales represent a growth of 2.4% from 2019, despite the challenging circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The strong performance was fueled largely by increased sales of chocolate, which now accounts for over half of all confectionery purchases in the UK. Chocolate sales grew by 3.4% in 2020 to reach £2.9 billion. By contrast, sales of sugar confectionery like sweets and gum declined slightly but still generated £1.9 billion in revenue.

The growth in confectionery sales reflects the desire for small indulgences and affordable treats during times of stress and economic uncertainty. “The confectionery market has proved very resilient during the pandemic,” said Emma Thomas, Associate Director of Food and Drink at Mintel. “Chocolate in particular has benefitted as consumers sought affordable treats and guilty pleasures to improve their mood during lockdown.”

The record sales have been achieved despite concerns over obesity and health, particularly among children. The average Brit now consumes nearly 13 kilograms of confectionery each year, according to Mintel. Campaigners argue that more needs to be done to curb the advertising of unhealthy snacks and promote better diet and exercise. In response, major brands have started offering more low-sugar and low-calorie alternatives, but sales of these options still make up a small fraction of the overall market.

Britons have a long-standing love affair with chocolate and sweets. The first chocolate bar was produced in the UK by Fry’s in 1847, followed soon after by Cadbury. Confectionery brands like Cadbury, Mars, Nestle and Haribo have since become household names and cultural institutions in Britain. They have used advertising, product placement, and novelty to help drive the popularity and nostalgia for British treats like Dairy Milk, Mars bars, Wine Gums and Jelly Babies. 

The confectionery sector is also an important contributor to the British economy, employing over 60,000 people directly in chocolate and sweet production, as well as supporting many jobs in retail. Despite the mature nature of the market, innovation remains crucial, and brands frequently release new variants, flavors and limited editions of popular lines to maintain consumer interest.

While sales were resilient in 2020, the longer-term forecast is more muted. Mintel expects confectionery revenue to grow by just 1-2% per year over the next five years in the face of health trends, regulatory pressures and ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the UK. But with such a strong emotional connection to confectionery and chocolate, Britons appear unlikely to give up their taste for treats and sweets anytime soon.
