LVMH Sells a Third of its Guinness Shares, But Joint Ventures Remain Secure, Says Guinness  

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced today that it has sold 33.3% of its shares in brewing giant Guinness for $4.2 billion. LVMH acquired a 49.9% stake in Guinness in 2002 for $2.7 billion and has held the shares since then. Despite the sale, Guinness and LVMH assert that their joint ventures in emerging markets will continue.

The sale comes as LVMH looks to rebalance its portfolio and focus more on its luxury brands and less on its shares in major consumer goods companies. The $4.2 billion in proceeds from the Guinness share sale will allow LVMH to invest further in its 75 world-class luxury brands or pursue new acquisitions.

For Guinness, the share sale provides an opportunity to buy back a significant minority stake and gain more independence from LVMH. Guinness CEO Simon Lansley said, "We value LVMH as a long-term strategic partner, but gaining greater control of our company is the right move at this stage of our growth. The share sale will not impact our successful joint ventures in China, India, and other emerging markets."

The joint ventures with LVMH span several alcoholic beverage categories in developing countries where consumers are trading up to premium brands. The ventures give both companies exposure to fast-growing markets and opportunities to build brand loyalty with younger consumers. Lansley noted, "The joint ventures demonstrate our commitment to building brands in innovative ways in markets that will drive our next wave of growth."

Analysts viewed the share sale as a prudent financial move for LVMH that does not signal a major change in strategy. "LVMH is taking some money off the table from a successful investment, but it still values its partnership with Guinness in key emerging markets,” said Marc Levinson of S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, others speculated that LVMH may continue reducing its holdings in Guinness over time.  

LVMH acquired its minority stake in Guinness in 2002 when large multinational conglomerates were building up shareholdings in major consumer brands. However, in recent years LVMH has focused on strengthening its core luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon, and Hennessy rather than acquiring new minority stakes in large public companies. The share sale returns LVMH's strategy to its roots in high-end luxury brands.

For its part, Guinness remains optimistic about its prospects for accelerated growth based on premiumization trends in developing countries. The company's joint ventures with LVMH will provide key access to consumers with increasing disposable income and a taste for branded products. While LVMH may not always remain a shareholder, Guinness sees its partnerships as long-term strategies in markets central to its future.
