Unilever reports 15% profit rise and plans to sell speciality chemicals units in multi-billion pound move 

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, today reported a 15% rise in pre-tax profit for the first half of the year and announced plans to sell its speciality chemicals businesses as part of a broad strategy to focus on core consumer goods.

The company made a pre-tax profit of €8.1bn in the six months to June, up from €7bn in the same period last year. Revenue also rose 2% to €30.9bn. Growth was boosted by strength in emerging markets, where Unilever now makes 58% of its sales. 

Unilever also said it will sell its speciality chemicals units, which makes sophisticated industrial chemicals and generates about €900m in annual revenue. The sale could fetch up to €10bn, according to analysts. CEO Alan Jope said the move is part of a wider review of Unilever’s business to focus on areas where it can achieve high growth including hygiene, beauty and premium products.

“We will now move to separate our speciality chemicals businesses, while we continue to streamline our portfolio to improve our focus, strengthen operational excellence, and drive profitable growth,” Mr Jope said.

The planned disposal will see Unilever part ways with businesses that supply chemicals used in industries like construction, automotive, and electronics. The units up for sale include its chemical divisions of UAC Deco, CIT/RM and CIL. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have been hired to advise on the sale.

The news came as Unilever announced underlying sales growth of 3.3% in the first half of the year. Home care, which includes laundry brands like Persil, saw the strongest growth at 5.4% while the food and refreshment division grew 3.1% buoyed by good performance from ice cream brands and food products in emerging markets.

However, beauty and personal care lagged with 2.3% underlying sales growth. Skincare brands did well but the Q2 performance was below expectations, Unilever said. Turnaround plans are in place for hair care brands and for Pond's, the skincare brand which struggled in India and South East Asia.

Mr Jope, who took over as CEO last year, is under pressure from investors to accelerate growth. He has launched a strategic review that aims to reshape Unilever into a higher growth company focused on five key product areas: skin care, hair care, deodorants, home care and foods. The review is also evaluating Unilever’s brand and country portfolio.

Today’s results will ease concerns that Unilever is losing ground to rivals Nestle and Procter & Gamble amid challenging conditions in key markets like India and China. However, growth still needs “continuous improvement”, Mr Jope said. Unilever shares rose 1.2% in morning trading following the results.
