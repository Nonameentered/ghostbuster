British Cider Maker Matthew Clark Unveils Plan to Combat Alcopops and Price Wars

Matthew Clark, one of Britain's largest independent cider makers, announced a strategy today to fend off competition from sweet alcoholic beverages known as “alcopops” and fight discounting price wars that have hurt the cider industry. The company plans to focus on premium, craft ciders and invest in marketing to promote the authenticity and quality of its traditional ciders.  

Matthew Clark produces brands like Orchard Pig, Thatchers, and Aspall Cyder. However, in recent years, sales of traditional ciders have declined as consumers shifted to alcopops like WKD and Smirnoff Ice, as well as lower-priced ciders from large producers. Supermarkets in the UK have also used ciders as loss leaders, selling them at very low prices to lure customers into stores.

“We've lost sight of what makes cider so special in our desire to match the prices and flavors of alcopops,” said Matthew Clark CEO Philip Diamond. “Cider is an artisanal product with a proud history, and we need to do a better job of communicating that heritage to today's consumers.”  

Matthew Clark's new strategy will focus on four pillars: improving quality, innovating craft ciders, elevating the brand, and partnering with retailers to sell at fair prices. The company has invested in new filtration and fermentation equipment to enhance consistency and flavor. It has also launched two new premium cider brands with more complex tastes aimed at craft cider fans. 

On the marketing front, Matthew Clark will promote the stories and histories behind its traditional ciders. For example, it will highlight how Thatchers Cider has been made for over 100 years in the same Somerset village using apples from the surrounding orchards. The company believes educating consumers about the provenance and craft required to make these ciders will build brand affinity.

Matthew Clark is also in discussions with major retailers to establish minimum advertised pricing for its ciders to avoid damaging price wars. It wants to convince retailers that holding prices at a certain level will benefit the category in the long run by encouraging innovation and quality. The company cited the success of minimum pricing agreements in the UK for wines as a model.

Analysts said Matthew Clark's new strategy was a bold move that could revitalize the company and traditional cider. By focusing on premiumization and re-establishing the heritage of its brands, Matthew Clark hopes to attract new drinkers and capture a larger share of the £3 billion UK cider market. However, its ambition to curb widespread discounting may face challenges, as consumers have become accustomed to cheap alcohol and lower prices will likely remain an incentive for some. The coming months will be a test of whether Matthew Clark's plan can overcome these headwinds and turn around a declining but still significant British industry.
