Britain's Biggest Cider Maker Plays Down Impact of Alcopops on Business 

Bulmers, the largest cider maker in Britain, has moved to reassure investors that the rise of flavored alcoholic beverages, known as “alcopops,” will not significantly impact its business. In its annual results today, Bulmers reported a 3% rise in revenue to £1.2 billion for the year ending March 2019. However, that represents a slowdown from previous years of stronger growth.

Some analysts have raised concerns that alcopops, sweeter and more brightly colored alcoholic drinks, are drawing younger consumers away from more traditional alcoholic beverages like cider. Bulmers produces cider brands including Strongbow, Magners, and Woodpecker.

Simon Lester, the chief executive of Bulmers, downplayed the threat posed by alcopops. “The cider market remains robust in the UK, as our results demonstrate,” he said. “New offerings come and go, but traditional ciders have endured for generations. While some consumers may experiment with alternatives, we are confident cider will remain the alcoholic drink of choice for the vast majority of our customer base.”

However, other industry experts are less optimistic. “Alcopops are highly appealing to younger age groups with their sweet taste and vibrant branding,” said Fiona Mills, an analyst at Alcohol Market Research. “Cider may seem old fashioned or bitter in comparison. If alcopops continue their strong growth, all traditional alcohol makers will need to adapt to this generational shift in tastes.”

Bulmers stated that it is currently investing in new product development to continue enhancing its cider ranges. It has recently launched a series of fruit-infused and premium ciders, though Mr. Lester said traditional ciders still make up over 90% of sales. The company reported a 17% increase in profit before tax to £350 million. Bulmers cider remains the most popular alcoholic drink in Britain after beer and wine. The company expects moderate but steady growth over the next 3 to 5 years.

In summary, while Britain's leading cider producer announced continued revenue and profit growth, there are concerns newer alcopops may threaten traditional ciders in the long run. However, Bulmers remains confident in the enduring appeal of cider and its ability to drive future success. The company is innovating with new products to keep up with changing tastes but cider remains at the heart of its business.
