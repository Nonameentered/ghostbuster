Merck and Rhone-Poulenc to Merge Animal Health Businesses and Create World Leader in the Sector

Pharmaceutical giants Merck & Co. and Rhone-Poulenc announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine their animal health businesses, creating the world's largest dedicated animal health company. The merger of Merck Animal Health and Rhone-Poulenc Animal Health will bring together two highly complementary businesses focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing veterinary medicines and vaccines for both companion and production animals.  

The new company, to be named Merck Animal Health, will have a broad global footprint, with operations in over 50 countries and projected annual revenues of over $5 billion based on 2018 sales. It will have a robust pipeline of new products under development to address unmet or underserved medical needs in both companion and food animal health.

"This merger makes great strategic sense and will create substantial value for our shareholders and customers," said Ken Frazier, Chairman and CEO of Merck. "By combining two industry leaders, we are well positioned to drive further scientific innovation, accelerate growth and continue improving animal health worldwide." Jean-Rene Fourtou, CEO of Rhone-Poulenc, also expressed strong support for the deal, noting the complementary nature of the two businesses and significant synergies that can be achieved.

The companies noted the merger is expected to generate meaningful cost synergies of at least $200 million within the first three years following completion of the transaction. No associate redundancies are planned as part of the integration. The combined company will be headquartered in Kenilworth, New Jersey, Merck's global headquarters.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances. Both companies' boards of directors have approved the merger. The agreement calls for Rhone-Poulenc to receive a payment of $2.5 billion at closing, in addition to shares of the combined company. Rhone-Poulenc shareholders will own 49% of the new organization.

In a note to investors, analysts viewed the merger positively given the significant synergies and cost-cutting opportunities, the strong strategic fit of the two businesses, and the opportunity to cross-sell products in international markets. The deal is seen as indicative of continued consolidation in the animal health sector, which remains fragmented relative to the size of the overall global pharmaceuticals industry.
