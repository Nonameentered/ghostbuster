Logica Plc acquires Axime Ingenierie SA for 161 million francs, plans to continue European expansion  

Logica Plc, a leading British IT and business services company, today announced the acquisition of Axime Ingenierie SA, a software engineering and systems integration firm based in Paris, for 161 million Swiss francs ($178 million). The deal demonstrates Logica's ongoing strategy to strengthen its presence in Europe through both organic growth and acquisitions of complementary companies.

Founded in 1982, Axime Ingenierie  employs more than 800 people and provides software development, IT consulting, and systems integration services to clients across France, Belgium, and Switzerland. The company has developed expertise in the aviation, telecommunications, finance, and transportation sectors.  

“Axime Ingenierie is a high-quality business that extends our offerings and provides new clients, especially in the aviation and transport industries,” said Andy Parker, CEO of Logica. “There is a strong cultural fit between our two companies, and we see opportunities to accelerate Axime's growth by expanding their service offerings to new geographies and clients. We are delighted to welcome Axime to the Logica group.”

Axime will be integrated into Logica’s continental Europe business but continue operating under its own brand. All Axime staff will remain in their current roles. Jean-Louis Mourot, Axime's founder and CEO, will join Logica's European management board.  

“Joining with Logica is the ideal next step for Axime to strengthen our position in the European market,” said Mourot. “Logica shares our vision for providing high-value services and solutions, and together we will have increased opportunities for our people and a platform to better serve clients across Europe.”  

The deal follows Logica's 947 million pound ($1.24 billion) acquisition of German IT services provider DMC GmbH in January and is in line with the company's strategy to double revenues from continental Europe over five years to account for 30-35% of total sales. Logica expects the Axime acquisition to boost earnings in the first full year of ownership and yield significant cost synergies within 24 months as the two companies integrate.

This transaction underscores the ongoing consolidation in the European IT services market as mid-sized companies join larger players to gain scale and broaden their portfolios across borders. With European economies recovering gradually from the global financial crisis, major IT service providers are looking to acquisitions to capture new opportunities for growth.
