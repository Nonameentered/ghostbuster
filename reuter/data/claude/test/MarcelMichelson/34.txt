SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV Reports 19 Percent Rise in 1996 Earnings, but Issues Warning on First Quarter 1997 Amid Weak End to Last Year

SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV said Thursday that 1996 net earnings rose 19 percent, but warned that first-quarter 1997 revenue and earnings may fall well below analysts' estimates amid a weak end to 1996 and slowing demand from major customers.

In trading Thursday on the London Stock Exchange, SGS-Thomson shares were down 13.3 pence, or 5.8 percent, to 215.5 pence on volume of 3.7 million shares.

For 1996, the company said net earnings rose to $491 million, or $1.76 a share, from $410 million, or $1.49 a share, in 1995. Revenue increased 15 percent to $4.95 billion from $4.31 billion. The results beat analysts' estimates for earnings of $1.73 a share and revenue of $4.90 billion, according to a survey by Bloomberg Business News.

However, SGS-Thomson said first-quarter 1997 revenue and earnings could be "well below" analysts' estimates, due primarily to further slowing of demand at the end of 1996 that has continued into this year, especially from major PC and telecommunications equipment customers in Asia and Europe. The company didn't provide specific estimates.

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Business News were estimating first-quarter 1997 earnings of 43 cents a share before taxes and revenue of $1.23 billion.

For all of 1997, SGS-Thomson said revenue growth should be "somewhat lower" than the 15 percent achieved in 1996. The company said its outlook assumes demand from major customers will start to recover in the second quarter and continue improving in the second half.
