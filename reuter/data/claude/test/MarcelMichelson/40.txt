Rhone-Poulenc SA Reports Strong 1996 Performance, But Chairman Calls It “Insufficient” 

French chemical and pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA today reported a 6.4% rise in net profit for 1996, but Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou called the results "insufficient" and promised aggressive cost-cutting measures.

Net income climbed to $1.83 billion, up from $1.72 billion in 1995. Sales rose 4.2% to $24.13 billion. However, higher costs for raw materials and an unfavorable sales mix held down profit margins. Operating profit as a percentage of sales slipped to 13% from 13.3% a year earlier. 

"While we achieved good growth in both sales and net income, our performance does not yet meet the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves," Fourtou said. "We must take swift action to boost profitability through significant cost reductions and improved productivity."

Fourtou, who took the helm in late 1995, has launched a major restructuring aimed at cutting costs by $1.2 billion over two years. The program includes eliminating 2,500 jobs, or about 5% of the workforce. Rhone-Poulenc also plans to sell a number of non-core businesses and redeploy the proceeds to strengthen its life sciences and materials operations.

The company's fastest growing units were in healthcare, including pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, which posted a 9.4% rise in operating profit. The synthetic fibers division recorded a 15% jump in earnings, but profits from industrial chemicals slumped due to industry overcapacity and weak demand.

Among highlights for the year, Rhone-Poulenc announced a joint venture with Germany's Hoechst AG to combine their life science businesses. The new company, Aventis, will be the world's second largest pharmaceutical company. Rhone-Poulenc also agreed to acquire Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute to boost its position in respiratory illness research.  

On the downside, Rhone-Poulenc took $330 million in charges to cover costs from its restructuring program, including $220 million to close plants in Germany, the U.S. and Brazil. The company also set aside $110 million to cover potential costs from asbestos litigation in the U.S. More than 32,000 asbestos-related claims are pending against Rhone-Poulenc's subsidiary Rhodia.

Rhone-Poulenc's share price has risen more than 30% over the past year, reflecting investor confidence in Fourtou's turnaround strategy. Fourtou aims to lift operating profit margins to 15-16% by the year 2000 through higher growth, lower costs and the sale of non-core businesses. With its reorganization well underway, Rhone-Poulenc appears poised to achieve stronger and more consistent earnings growth over the next several years. But as today's results show, much work remains to boost profitability to the levels demanded by Fourtou and shareholders.
