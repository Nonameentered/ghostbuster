French Government Plans to Sell SFP Film Studios to Generale des Eaux and Havas   

The French government announced today its intention to sell Société Française de Production, the historic film studio complex located in Saint-Maurice just outside Paris, to a consortium led by Generale des Eaux and Havas. The sprawling 300-acre studio facility, known as SFP, has been owned and operated by the government since its opening in 1930. However, declining profits and increasing infrastructure costs have led the government to seek a private buyer.

Generale des Eaux and Havas, two of France’s largest media and entertainment companies, have partnered to purchase SFP for an undisclosed amount, pending regulatory approval. The new owners plan to invest at least €500 million over the next decade to upgrade production facilities, build new soundstages, and transition the studio to digital technologies. SFP has long been used to produce French films as well as major international productions, but industry executives argue that its infrastructure has become outdated. Proponents believe that private ownership with a significant capital investment will enable SFP to attract more high-budget blockbusters and compete with larger foreign studios.  

Not all support the sale, however. Cineast and other filmmaker associations campaigned to keep SFP in public hands, fearing that corporate ownership may devalue its historic role promoting French culture and cinema. They argue SFP was created by the government to enable French filmmaking, not primarily as a commercial venture. After negotiations, the government has promised to enact protections for small-budget French productions. At least 60% of all films shot at SPF must be French productions, and a certain number of filming days will be reserved each year for low-budget pictures. Rates will also remain regulated.

The deal is poised to be finalized in early September, with the transfer of ownership tentatively scheduled for January 2023. Generale des Eaux and Havas have appointed Jean-Luc Azéma, a veteran film producer, to lead SFP as its new Président-Directeur Général. “This is an exciting new chapter for SFP that will ensure its vital place making films in France for generations to come,” said Azéma during a press conference. While the future remains uncertain, government and industry officials express confidence the sale will bolster SFP’s long-term sustainability while upholding its cultural mission. The storied studio, it seems, will retain its standing as the beating heart of French filmmaking.
