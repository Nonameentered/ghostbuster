Generale des Eaux in Talks to Extend Power in Media with Potential Havas Deal for Canal Plus

Generale des Eaux, the French industrial conglomerate, is in advanced discussions to acquire a sizable stake in Havas, the media group that has a controlling stake in Canal Plus, the leading pay-TV company in France, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. 

A deal would give Generale des Eaux, Europe's biggest water and waste utility, greater control over Canal Plus and strengthen its position in the media sector. Generale des Eaux currently owns just under 50% of Canal Plus Group, the parent company of Canal Plus, alongside Havas, which owns roughly 60% of Canal Plus Group.

By purchasing a large minority stake in Havas, Generale des Eaux would gain effective control of Canal Plus, the most prominent player in the French television industry with exclusive rights to coveted movies, sports broadcasts and entertainment shows. Canal Plus has over 10 million subscribers to its premium channels in France, Poland, Africa and Vietnam.

For Generale des Eaux, greater influence over Canal Plus would provide another pillar to its growing media operations, which already include several radio stations and newspapers in France as well as ventures with Vice Media and BeIn Sports. The water utility turned conglomerate has been expanding beyond its traditional business lines in recent years into waste management, energy and media under the leadership of its chief executive, Henri Proglio.

According to the sources, Generale des Eaux is discussing acquiring up to 45% of Havas in a deal that would value Havas at over 6 billion euros. Havas is majority-owned by the holding company of Vincent Bollor√©, the billionaire French industrialist who is also a major shareholder in Vivendi, another media conglomerate.

The talks are ongoing and there is no certainty they will lead to a deal, the sources cautioned. A 50.1% stake in Havas would allow Generale des Eaux to consolidate the company's accounts, including its majority stake in Canal Plus, analysts noted. Representatives for Generale des Eaux, Havas and Canal Plus declined to comment.

Shares of Vivendi, which previously owned Canal Plus before selling it to Havas and Generale des Eaux, rose 3% Wednesday on news of the potential deal. Vivendi still retains a 10% stake in Canal Plus Group.

The prospect of Generale des Eaux taking greater control of Canal Plus comes as authorities in Brussels scrutinize Italian group Mediaset's recent acquisitions of stakes in two other major European broadcasters, Prosiebensat.1 Media and Mediaset Espana, over concerns of reduced competition. However, a deal for Havas is not expected to face significant regulatory backlash given Generale des Eaux's existing ownership of Canal Plus shares, sources said.
