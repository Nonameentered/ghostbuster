Gaz de France to Invest Billions in Infrastructure Upgrades to Meet Growing Demand  

Gaz de France, the largest natural gas utility in Europe, announced plans today to invest over €3 billion over the next 3 years to upgrade its infrastructure across France. The investment is aimed at modernizing the country's gas pipeline network and storage facilities to meet growing demand for natural gas as an energy source.

"Natural gas is playing an increasingly important role in France's transition to cleaner energy sources and emissions reductions," said Jean-Marie Dauger, CEO of Gaz de France. "This significant investment will allow us to strengthen the security and reliability of gas supply to our customers through modernized and expanded infrastructure."

The largest share of the €3 billion, around €1.8 billion, will be dedicated to renovating over 4,000 miles of regional gas pipelines across France. Many of these pipelines were built in the 1970s and require upgrades to operate at higher pressures and monitor gas flows more effectively. These pipeline renovations are expected to reduce methane emissions by up to 20% through fewer leaks and ruptures.   

Another €800 million will be directed toward expanding existing natural gas storage sites and building two new underground storage facilities. Underground gas storage is critical to managing seasonal swings in natural gas demand and ensures a steady supply of gas during peak winter periods. The two new storage sites will increase France's total gas storage capacity by 15% and provide supply flexibility for an additional 200,000 households.

The final €400 million of the planned investment will modernize Gaz de France's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals where tankers unload and regasify LNG for injection into the gas grid. Upgrading these terminals will allow them to accommodate larger tankers, increasing the volume of LNG that can be imported into France by 20-25% at each terminal. With domestic natural gas production declining over the next decade, LNG imports will play an increasingly vital role in meeting gas demand.
