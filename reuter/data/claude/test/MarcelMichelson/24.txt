French Oil Group Elf Aquitaine Signs Landmark Deal with Azerbaijan in Caspian Sea Region

The French oil and gas company Elf Aquitaine announced today that it has signed a landmark 25-year agreement with Azerbaijan to search for and develop oil fields in the Caspian Sea. The deal is Elf Aquitaine's first direct involvement in the energy-rich Caspian region, which has become an area of intense competition among Western oil firms seeking new sources of fossil fuels.

Under the terms of the agreement, Elf Aquitaine will operate two offshore areas in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea, covering a total of 2,200 square kilometers. Elf Aquitaine will have a 50% share of any oil and gas discoveries, with the remaining 50% owned by Azerbaijan's state oil company, Socar. The two areas are thought to contain significant oil and gas deposits, though further seismic testing and exploratory drilling will be needed to determine their full potential.

The agreement was signed in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, by Thierry Desmarest, chairman and chief executive of Elf Aquitaine, and Natik Aliyev, president of Socar. At the signing ceremony, Mr. Desmarest hailed the deal as "a milestone in Elf's Caspian strategy"  that would "open a new oil province for the company." Mr. Aliyev said the partnership with Elf Aquitaine showed Azerbaijan's attractiveness as an investment destination and its readiness to cooperate with major international oil companies.

The agreement comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions over access to Caspian Sea resources. Russia and Iran, which border the inland sea, have objected to foreign involvement in the region. But Azerbaijan and the other former Soviet states bordering the sea, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, have actively courted Western oil firms in recent years. 

For Elf Aquitaine, the move into Azerbaijan signals an important diversification of its oil reserves outside its traditional areas of operation in Africa and the North Sea. The French company is hoping that the Caspian region will become an increasingly important source of oil over the coming decades as other fields mature. The deal is also a victory for France's strategic ambitions to secure energy relationships with the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.
