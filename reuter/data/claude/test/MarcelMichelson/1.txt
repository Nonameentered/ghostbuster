French Government Suspends Controversial Sale of Electronics Group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe 

The French government today announced it is suspending the sale of electronics and media group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe, the French media conglomerate. The proposed $4.2 billion acquisition has been controversial, with critics arguing it will reduce competition in the media sector and lead to significant job losses.

In a statement, the French finance ministry said that after reviewing the deal, it has "serious concerns" about the impact on competition and employment in the media and technology sectors. The ministry said it will launch a deeper probe into the acquisition to determine whether those concerns can be adequately addressed before allowing the sale to proceed. 

The decision is a blow to Thomson SA, which announced plans last month to sell its media and electronics business to Lagardere as part of a strategy to focus on its core television and film production operations. Lagardere, which owns major newspaper and radio brands in France, had aimed to combine its media properties with Thomson's TV channels and consumer electronics business.

However, the deal immediately attracted scrutiny from regulators and criticism from industry groups and trade unions. They argued that the combined company would dominate French media and face little competition for advertising revenue and media rights. Critics also said the takeover would likely lead to significant job cuts, estimating layoffs of up to 6,000 of Thomson's 12,000 French employees.

In announcing the acquisition last month, Lagardere and Thomson said they would be able to save costs by merging operations but committed to limiting job cuts, without providing a precise figure. They also argued the deal would ensure the long-term survival of Thomson's media and electronics arms.

The French finance ministry's decision to pause the deal is a sign the government remains skeptical of those promises. In its statement today, the ministry said "questions remain" about the estimates of cost savings and job cuts in the proposal submitted by Lagardere and Thomson. It said an in-depth review is needed to "reconcile the interests of employees, competition and consumers."

Shares of Thomson SA fell as much as 10% on the news while Lagardere shares dropped 7%. In a joint statement, the two companies said they would cooperate fully with the government review but remained "confident in the competitive benefits and efficiencies" of combining their operations. They urged the government to make a final determination on the deal before the end of the year.

Analysts said the ministry's move was not unexpected given the size of the deal and the concerns raised by critics. But they noted it introduces fresh uncertainty for both Thomson and Lagardere, who now face the possibility regulators may block the takeover entirely or demand major concessions before approving it. The review also raises broader questions about the French government's willingness to allow further consolidation in its media sector at a time of declining advertising sales and print media revenues.
