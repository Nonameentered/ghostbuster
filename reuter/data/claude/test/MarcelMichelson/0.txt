French government calls off controversial Thomson SA sale to Lagardere Group, but President vows to complete privatization 

The French government today announced it is withdrawing plans to sell media giant Thomson SA to the Lagardere Group in a controversial privatization deal. The proposed $4.3 billion sale of Thomson, France's largest private television network and a major media company, sparked widespread protests over concerns it would reduce media diversity.

In a statement, Finance Minister Francois Villeroy de Galhau said "the government has decided not to proceed with the sale of Thomson SA to Lagardere Group at this time.” However, President Emmanuel Macron vowed to press ahead with efforts to privatize Thomson, saying "this is merely a delay, not the end of plans to modernize our media sector.”

The decision represents a setback for Macron, who had backed the sale as part of his agenda to privatize state-owned companies and make the French economy more competitive. But the move was opposed by unions, lawmakers across the political spectrum, and most French voters. Critics argued it would give too much control over French media to Lagardere, already a major player in publishing, radio, and television. 

A coalition of six unions staged strikes at Thomson last month to protest the deal, disrupting news broadcasts and other programming. A poll found 71% of the public opposed the sale, while more than 200,000 people signed petitions against it.

With the collapse of the agreement, the government will have to go back to the drawing board on Thomson's fate. Macron has called for fully privatizing the company, but with strict limits ensuring its independence. Options include selling shares on public markets, creating a foundation to protect editorial independence, or seeking a new private buyer with stronger guarantees.

However, some argue privatization of any kind threatens the traditional role of Thomson as a public institution with a mission to inform citizens and support French culture. Shadow Minister of Culture Julie Rosenberg said "Thomson should remain in public hands, dedicated to the common good, not become a plaything of corporate interests.” 

The debate around Thomson reflects a wider struggle in many countries over the growing influence of large media conglomerates and loss of diverse, independent voices. Governments seek private investment to expand media companies, but at the risk of diluting their civic purpose. Macron aims to modernize France's economy, but at the cost of weakening some of its most venerable public institutions. With the future of Thomson still unsettled, this central conflict shows no sign of resolution.
