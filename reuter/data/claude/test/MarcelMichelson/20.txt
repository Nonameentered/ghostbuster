French Oil Group Elf Aquitaine Chairman Philippe Jaffre Restructures to Cut Back to Core Activities 

Philippe Jaffre, the chairman of French oil giant Elf Aquitaine, announced a major restructuring of the company today to refocus on its core oil and gas exploration and production activities. The restructuring will streamline the sprawling conglomerate and spin off several non-essential business units.

The plan calls for Elf Aquitaine to sell its stakes in automaker Peugeot SA, Elf Sanofi pharmaceuticals, and several other holdings. The divestitures are expected to generate up to $15 billion that will be reinvested in Elf's upstream oil and gas operations. Elf will concentrate on expanding its oilfields in Africa and developing new deepwater projects in the North Sea.

"We want to simplify the group and focus on what we do best, which is finding and producing oil and gas," Mr. Jaffre said in a statement. "The spin-offs and sales will provide capital to invest in high-potential exploration and production projects that can drive future growth."

The restructuring comes as Mr. Jaffre faces pressure from investors to boost Elf's stock price and dividends. The company's share price has stagnated in recent years despite high oil prices, as Elf's eclectic collection of businesses made it difficult for investors to value the company. By cutting loose unproductive or tangential operations, Mr. Jaffre hopes to make Elf a more focused, and valuable, company.

Not all the changes will come through divestitures. Elf also plans to streamline management, cut costs, and eliminate some jobs at its headquarters. Mr. Jaffre said the "simplification" program could reduce expenses by up to $2 billion per year, helping to improve profit margins.

The sales and cost cuts are a bold move by the Elf chairman to energize the storied oil company following years of lackluster results. Mr. Jaffre was appointed chairman last year, becoming the first non-French national to lead Elf Aquitaine in its 70-year history. The former Royal Dutch/Shell executive was given a mandate to improve returns at the company, which he has now set about with drastic action.

Investors reacted positively to the restructuring announcement, sending Elf's shares up 3.4% in midday Paris trading. If successful, the refocusing of Elf Aquitaine could make the company a more formidable player in the global oil industry and a more rewarding company for shareholders. But much will depend on how Mr. Jaffre executes the ambitious program and whether the benefits can be achieved.
