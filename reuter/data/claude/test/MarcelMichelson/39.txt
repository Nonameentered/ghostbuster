Rhone-Poulenc SA Reports 28.4% Profit Growth in 1996, But Chairman Deems It Insufficient for a Company of Their Size  

Rhone-Poulenc SA, the Paris-based chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate, today reported a 28.4% increase in net profit for 1996. Despite the strong growth, Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said the results were “insufficient for a company of Rhone-Poulenc’s size and stature.”

The company earned $1.86 billion in net profit, up from $1.45 billion in 1995. Revenue rose 4.3% to $20.4 billion. The results beat analysts’ expectations, but Fourtou said Rhone-Poulenc should aim higher. “We have the capabilities and portfolio to achieve more, and our stakeholders expect more of us,” he said in a statement.

The profit growth was fueled in part by the performance of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the company’s pharmaceutical division. Sales at RPR rose 12% to $6.3 billion, helped by new drug launches in Europe and increased sales of its flagship blood pressure medication Lovenox. The agrochemicals division saw a 7% rise in sales, but the polymers and chemicals divisions lagged due to weak economic conditions in Europe.  

Fourtou, who took over as Chairman last month, announced plans to accelerate restructuring to improve profitability. He aims to cut costs by $1 billion over two years through plant closures, job cuts, and other efficiency measures. The company will also divest underperforming non-core businesses and may pursue strategic acquisitions to boost its pharmaceutical and life sciences operations.  

“Rhone-Poulenc has strong businesses and brands, but we have to focus our efforts,” Fourtou said. “We will direct investments and resources to areas where we have competitive advantage and exit segments that lack critical mass or future growth potential.”

The announcements came as Rhone-Poulenc faces pressure from shareholders to improve returns. Its share price has lagged the CAC 40 index, and some analysts argue the group is too diversified. Fourtou’s moves are aimed at addressing those concerns and turning around the company’s performance to meet stakeholders’ higher expectations.
