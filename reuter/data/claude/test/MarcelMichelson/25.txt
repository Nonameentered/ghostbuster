France's Elf Aquitaine Signs Major Oil Exploration Deal with Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea

The French oil firm Elf Aquitaine announced yesterday that it has signed a landmark deal with Azerbaijan to explore oil fields in the Caspian Sea. The agreement gives Elf Aquitaine rights to explore three offshore oil fields in Azerbaijan's sector of the Caspian, a region that has become an important source of oil and natural gas. 

The deal follows more than a year of negotiations and cements France's role as a major economic partner with Azerbaijan. “This agreement confirms the strategic partnership between Elf Aquitaine and Azerbaijan in the energy sector,” said Elf Aquitaine chief executive Philippe Marchand at the signing ceremony in Baku. “It allows us to expand our activities in a high-potential region that contributes to diversifying supplies to the European market.”

Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, Elf Aquitaine will control a 50% share of the three oil fields—Azeri, Chirag, and Guneshli—also known as the ACG fields, located 100 kilometers east of Baku in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian.  The ACG fields, which cover an area of 432 square kilometers, are estimated to contain at least 1 billion barrels of oil reserves and have the potential for further discoveries. 

Elf Aquitaine will invest more than $4 billion over the lifetime of the project making it the largest foreign direct investment into Azerbaijan's hydrocarbons sector ever. Production from the initial development of the three fields is expected to start in 2008, increasing to 300,000 barrels per day at peak. The oil will be exported via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, then onward to Western markets.

For landlocked Azerbaijan, rich in oil and natural gas, the deal helps diversify its customer base and reduce dependence on Russia. For Elf Aquitaine, the investment solidifies its status as a major player in the strategic Caspian region, with access to huge oil and gas reserves for export to Europe. The agreement is a vivid illustration of how the geopolitics of oil and natural gas are shaping economic alliances in the Caspian basin and beyond.
