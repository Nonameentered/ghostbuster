Shareholders approve $2.12 billion state injection as French government reviews Thomson SA privatisation plans 

The shareholders of Thomson SA, one of France's largest electronics and appliances companies, today approved a â‚¬2 billion ($2.12 billion) capital injection from the French government. The funding is aimed at strengthening Thomson's balance sheet and providing liquidity as the company faces major restructuring.

Thomson has been struggling in recent years due to declining sales, increasing competition from low-cost Asian rivals, and an outdated product portfolio. The company has posted losses for three consecutive years and its stock price has declined nearly 70% from its 2015 high. The French government, which owns 32% of Thomson, has been under pressure to take action to support the company and the thousands of jobs it provides.

The approval of state funding comes as the government is reviewing options for the privatisation of Thomson, including a potential sale of its stake or further investment to take full control of the company. A government spokesman said "all options are on the table to ensure Thomson's long-term viability and success as an important employer and contributor to the French economy." The government is expected to announce its decision on Thomson's future within the next few months.

Thomson's management plans to use the capital injection to invest in new product development, upgrade factories, and restructure its business to focus on higher-margin premium products. However, critics argue the government should fully nationalise and break up the struggling company instead of providing a taxpayer-funded bailout. Union representatives also oppose further restructuring plans that may lead to job cuts.

With its financing secured for now, Thomson's future hangs in the balance as the government and investors consider contrasting options to turn around the iconic company's fortunes. The decision is shaping up to be an important test for the administration on balancing economic interests with political and social priorities. For Thomson's 96,000 employees around the world, the stakes could not be higher.
