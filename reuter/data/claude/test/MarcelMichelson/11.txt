French State Approves $2.09 Billion Aid Injection for Thomson SA, Labor Unions Demand Total Cancellation  of Privatization Sale

The French government approved a 1.7 billion euro ($2.09 billion) state-guaranteed loan for electronics group Thomson SA today. The aid package is intended to stabilize the company and protect jobs as Thomson faces what some analysts call an existential crisis due to adverse effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The struggling multimedia company will now undergo a strategic review over the coming months to address its mounting losses and liquidity crunch.

While the government loan aims to buy time for the company to adapt to major industry changes including the rapid shift to streaming media, Thomson's long-term fate remains highly uncertain. Unions representing the company's workers, however, voiced discontent over the announced bailoutâ€”calling instead for Thomson to be renationalized. They argue this would secure the jobs of Thomson's 6,000 employees in France far more effectively than a privatization.

Thomson, which owns brands including Braun, RCA, and Technicolor, was once a crown jewel of French industry and a pioneer in audio and television technologies. However, in recent years Thomson has struggled with its transition to digital and has entered a cycle of job cuts and financial losses. The CEO acknowledged that without this public support the company likely could not continue operating normally through 2020. The events of this year, including supply chain disruptions and customer losses, worsened Thomson's position but the company's troubles long predate the pandemic.
