French Government Approves $2.12 Billion Capital Injection for Electronics Group Thomson SA Amid Privatisation Process Review  

The French government has approved a €1.9 billion ($2.12 billion) capital injection for electronics group Thomson SA as it reviews options to privatize the company. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the state aid will strengthen Thomson's balance sheet after heavy losses in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. The funds will come from the country's €20 billion fund set up to support strategic companies impacted by the pandemic.

Thomson, which makes televisions, set-top boxes, and home appliances, suffered a net loss of €3.7 billion in 2020 as demand for consumer electronics plunged during lockdowns. Revenues fell 18% to €6.2 billion. The government aid package includes €800 million in state-guaranteed loans and a €1.1 billion equity injection that will boost the government's stake in Thomson to over 34% from 22% currently.

The capital support comes as the government reassesses plans to privatize Thomson, which was formed in 1982 from the consumer electronics assets of French conglomerate Thomson-Brandt. An IPO slated for mid-2021 has been pushed back amid turbulent market conditions and the desire for greater balance sheet stability at Thomson before launching a share offering.

Mr. Le Maire said the government remains committed to privatizing Thomson when market conditions improve but at a pace that will allow the company to maximize its value during the process. “While an IPO currently looks challenging, this state support will give Thomson more time to improve its operations and balance sheet, and privatize when the moment is propitious,” he said. The government aims to privatize several major companies over the next few years to raise funds and increase their competitiveness. 

Some analysts argue that further delays in privatizing Thomson could weigh on its turnaround plan by causing ongoing strategic and management uncertainty. But others say that with the fresh capital injection, time remains on the government's side. The funds give Thomson a stronger position to ride out the rest of the downturn in its markets before launching what would be one of France's largest public listings in years.
