French Food Group Saint Louis Acquires 15% Stake in Spain's Largest Sugar Company Ebro Agricolas

Saint Louis, the French food group known for producing crystal sugar and other agricultural commodities, announced today that it has acquired a 15% stake in Ebro Agricolas, the largest sugar producer in Spain. The deal, worth â‚¬340 million, will help Saint Louis expand its presence in the European sugar market and secure a supply of raw sugar for its food and beverage businesses. 

Ebro Agricolas operates six processing plants across Spain that produce over 1 million tons of sugar annually, approximately 60% of the nation's sugar output. The company also farms rice, crops, and livestock on 300,000 hectares of land. By purchasing a substantial minority stake in Ebro Agricolas, Saint Louis will gain preferential access to the company's sugar production at fixed prices.

"This strategic investment in Ebro Agricolas marks an important step in the growth of our company," said Jacques Beauregard, CEO of Saint Louis. "Gaining a partnership position in one of Europe's largest sugarcane businesses will provide stability to our supply chain and strengthen our competitive position. We aim to leverage Ebro's expertise to improve agricultural yields and sustainability."

The deal is the largest in Saint Louis' history and signals its ambitions to expand beyond France and diversify into cane sugar. While Saint Louis is best known as a beet sugar producer, cane sugar accounts for 75% of global sugar production and much of the growth potential. Access to a low-cost supply of cane sugar will allow Saint Louis to boost production of high-margin consumer food items and gain market share across Europe.

Ebro Agricolas also stands to benefit from the new partnership. Saint Louis will provide capital to modernize irrigation systems and processing plants, helping Ebro improve profit margins which have struggled in recent years due to oversupply in the European sugar market. Tighter integration with Saint Louis may also open up new export opportunities for Ebro, especially into North America and Africa where Saint Louis has an established presence.

The deal must still be approved by Spanish regulators, a process that is expected to conclude before the end of the year. If approved, Saint Louis will take two seats on Ebro Agricolas' board of directors, allowing it to participate in strategic decisions at the company. The remaining 85% of shares in Ebro Agricolas will continue to be owned by the Ebro family, which founded the company in 1894.
