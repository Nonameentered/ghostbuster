Competition heats up in French telecommunications market despite denials of NTT entry  

The French telecommunications market saw intensifying competition this week amid rumors that Japanese telecom giant NTT is planning to enter the market. Shares of major French telecom operators Orange, Bouygues Telecom, and Iliad all declined in early trading as investors considered the implications of a new major competitor. However, NTT officials denied they have any plans to enter the French telecom market, stating they are focused on growth in their existing Asian and global markets.

The French telecom market has been openly competitive for several years following reforms that ended the state's monopoly. Orange and Bouygues have roughly two-thirds of the total French mobile subscribers between them, while Iliad's Free Mobile has disrupted the market with ultra-low cost plans since launching in 2012. Despite the denials from NTT, analysts said a new player with its technical expertise and financial resources could reshuffle the competitive dynamics in France. 

"NTT would pose a serious threat if it entered France,” said Jean-Michel Neyret, an analyst at the French brokerage Aurel BGC. “Its technological capabilities, brand power, and pricing could attract many subscribers from the existing operators.” However, Neyret and other analysts emphasized they have seen no concrete signs NTT actually intends to enter the French market, despite the stock price reactions.

In a statement, NTT said “we have no plans to expand into France at this time. Our focus remains on growth within our existing operating markets in Japan, India, and select other Asian countries.” A spokesperson for Orange said they would welcome new competitors to keep driving improved service and lower prices for French consumers, but that any competitor would face high barriers to entry in an already competitive market. 

Bouygues and Iliad declined to comment on potential new market entrants. Iliad’s stock has suffered recently as its low-cost subscriber growth has slowed, and some analysts argue it is the most vulnerable to a new major competitor. However, others argue Iliad’s cut-rate pricing model is well suited to defending against any new entrant aiming to gain market share through lower prices.
