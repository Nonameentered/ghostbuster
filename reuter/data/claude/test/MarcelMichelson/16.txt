French Parliamentary Commission Approves GEC Alsthom and Framatome Merger with Conditions  

The French Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs today approved the proposed merger between French industrial giants GEC Alsthom and Framatome, but imposed strict conditions on the deal to protect French interests. The Commission spent over 18 months reviewing the complex merger, which will create one of the world's largest engineering and energy companies with over 200,000 employees across 70 countries.

In order to approve the merger, the Commission required that the new combined company maintain its headquarters in France, keep at least 90% of its workforce in France for the next five years, and appoint a majority of French citizens to its board of directors. The conditions are intended to prevent job losses in France and ensure that control of critical infrastructure like nuclear energy remains under French influence.  

The merger brings together Alsthom, a major producer of power generation equipment, rail transport and electrical grids, with Framatome, the nuclear reactor and fuel company. The new company, to be called Alframat Nuclear, will have dominant positions in nuclear energy, high-speed rail, and power grid infrastructure—all areas that the French government considers strategically important.

Unions and industry experts have raised concerns about potential job cuts from the tie-up, even with the conditions imposed. Duplicate roles in management, marketing, finance and other areas could still lead the new company to shed thousands of positions, though likely over time through natural attrition and retirement. The companies have promised that no forced layoffs will occur within the initial 5-year period mandated by the Commission.  

Investors have reacted positively to news of the approved merger. Shares in both GEC Alsthom and Framatome rose over 3% in midday trading on expectations of higher profitability, market power and growth potential for the new combined entity. Alframat Nuclear is projected to generate over €70 billion in revenue and €5.5 billion in net income, making it the 6th largest industrial company in Europe.

Continued and expanded access to export markets, especially for lucrative nuclear and defense contracts, was a key rationale cited by the companies in proposing the merger. By combining their resources and political influence, Alframat Nuclear expects to win more infrastructure and technology export deals in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The French government is also keen to have "national champions" that can compete on a global scale, though it showed with the imposed merger conditions that it will act to protect French national interests.

The parliamentary approval, while expected, provides a green light for the merger to proceed to finalization over the coming months. GEC Alsthom and Framatome first announced plans to merge in February last year, kicking off the Commission's lengthy review and negotiation process over conditions for approval. The deal is still subject to approval by European competition regulators but is expected to be finalized before the end of this year.
