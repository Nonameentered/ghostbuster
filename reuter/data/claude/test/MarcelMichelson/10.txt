French Government Approves $2.09 Billion State Aid Injection for Electronics Group Thomson SA

The French government has approved a 1.84 billion euro ($2.09 billion) state-backed loan to provide much-needed relief for television and appliances manufacturer Thomson SA amid the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 

Thomson, which employs around 5,500 people in France, had warned it may collapse without government intervention as sales and production have been hit hard by lockdown measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus. The state aid, which takes the form of a government-guaranteed loan to Thomson's banks, will allow the company to shore up its liquidity position and continue operating as COVID-19 restrictions are gradually lifted.

“This state support for Thomson is excellent news, both for our company and for the many subcontractors and suppliers who depend on our business,” said Thomson CEO Lionel Chenard. “The government's help will be crucial as we restart operations and work to regain momentum after this unprecedented slowdown.”

The loan is part of a broader 100 billion euro stimulus package announced by the French government last month to prop up businesses struggling with loss of revenue due to the nationwide lockdown imposed since March 17. It is one of the first bailouts targeted at a specific company, though, highlighting Thomson's importance as an employer and contributor to the economy.

Thomson specializes in televisions, sound systems, mobile devices, and household appliances like washing machines, stoves, and refrigerators. It has seen sales in all segments plummet over the past two months with stores closed across France and consumers tightening their spending. The firm's factories and warehouses have also been shuttered for much of the lockdown, though a phased reopening began last week.

The government aid is a lifeline that will allow Thomson to ramp production back up, support its supply chain, and boost marketing to spur consumer demand again. But analysts caution the crisis has exposed weaknesses in Thomson's business model, including a reliance on bricks-and-mortar retailers, that the company must address to return to health and eventually repay the state-backed loan. The coming months will be crucial for Thomson as France looks to recover from the economic devastation of COVID-19.
