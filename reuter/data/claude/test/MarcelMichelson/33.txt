SGS-Thomson Microelectronics Reports 19% Rise in 1996 Earnings, Warns of Weak First Quarter in 1997  

SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, one of the world's largest semiconductor makers, reported today that earnings rose 19 percent in 1996, but warned that the first quarter of 1997 will be "challenging."

The Geneva-based company said net income for 1996 rose to $511 million from $430 million in 1995, as revenue increased 9 percent to $5.68 billion from $5.21 billion. Earnings per share increased 17 percent to $2.30 from $1.97.

The results were slightly below analysts' expectations. A survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research had estimated earnings of $2.32 per share and revenue of $5.7 billion. The company was positive overall about 1996 but cautious about the first quarter of 1997.

"1996 was a year of solid progress for the company with significant improvements in revenues and earnings," said Pasquale Pistorio, president and chief executive. "However, the economic environment is becoming more uncertain, and we expect the first quarter of 1997 to be challenging."

The company reported improved results in nearly all of its product areas in 1996. Revenue from telecommunications chips grew 23 percent, from industrial and automotive chips increased 16 percent, and from chips for disk drives and printers rose 15 percent. Sales of chips for cellular phones and other wireless devices jumped 60 percent. But sales of chips for computers declined 6 percent.

Mr. Pistorio said demand for cellular phones and wireless devices will continue to drive growth, but the company is concerned about weaker demand for personal computers. "There are still too many uncertainties relating to PC demand to give precise indications for the first quarter of 1997," he said.

SGS-Thomson's stock price has been volatile recently amid fluctuating technology stocks and concerns about slowing industry growth and pricing pressures. The stock closed at $37.375 today in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down 25 cents. But the longer-term outlook for the stock remains bright given the company's market-share gains and its solid base of telecommunications and industrial customers, analysts said. 

"SGS-Thomson turned in a good performance in 1996 despite a deterioration in the semiconductor market in the second half," said Rainer Verhoeven, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. He predicts SGS-Thomson's earnings per share will grow 15 to 20 percent annually over the next few years, in line with the company's target. "The company's strategy of focusing on telecommunications, industrial and automotive customers should pay off even if personal computer demand remains sluggish," he said.

The weak forecast for the first quarter is not surprising given slowing demand in various electronics markets, analysts said. But SGS-Thomson is well positioned to benefit over the long term from growing markets such as cellular communications and the Internet, they said. 

"This is a premier company with premier products," said Daniel Friel, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. "They have leading positions in some of the most promising semiconductor areas. I wouldn't get too caught up in their cautious comments about the first quarter. The fundamentals here are excellent going forward."
