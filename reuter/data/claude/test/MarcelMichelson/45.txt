Alcatel Alsthom in talks about joint bid for government stake in Thomson-CSF 

Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications equipment maker, is in discussions with several potential partners about making a joint bid for the French government's 45% stake in Thomson-CSF, the defense electronics group. According to people close to the situation, Alcatel Alsthom is talking to companies including the German engineering group Siemens and the aerospace company Lagardere Group about teaming up to bid for the Thomson-CSF stake.

The French government is planning to sell its holdings in several major companies to raise funds. Thomson-CSF, a leader in radar, missile guidance systems and military communications, is considered an attractive target for buyers looking to expand in the growing defense sector. By partnering with another firm, Alcaltel Alsthom hopes to strengthen its bid and avoid a lengthy regulatory review.  

Alcatel Alsthom has been expanding into the defense industry to reduce its dependence on the telecommunications market. Earlier this year, it took control of the Italian defense group Selenia. Acquiring part or all of Thomson-CSF would give Alcatel Alsthom a strong presence as a supplier for major weapons programs in France and other European countries. Thomson-CSF had revenue of about $2.4 billion in 1998 and employs 15,000 people.

For its part, Lagardere Group, which owns the Matra defense and aerospace subsidiary, would also benefit from absorbing parts of Thomson-CSF. Matra produces the Mistral missile and other weapons. By teaming with Alcatel Alsthom, Lagardere may gain the scale to be a long-term partner with Thomson-CSF. An alliance with Siemens, meanwhile, could help Alcatel Alsthom expand into the German defense market.

The French government plans to review initial bids for its Thomson-CSF stake in November and hopes to complete a sale by early next year. According to analysts, a joint bid from Alcatel Alsthom and one of its potential partners could value the government's 45% holding in Thomson-CSF at between $500 million and $1 billion. Alcatel Alsthom declined to comment on "rumors and speculation". Representatives from Siemens and Lagardere Group could not be reached for comment.
