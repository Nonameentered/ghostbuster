French Government-Owned Aerospace Group Considers Bid for Thomson-CSF with Dassault Aviation and Alcatel Alsthom 

The French government-owned aerospace and defense company Aérospatiale is exploring a possible joint bid with Dassault Aviation and Alcatel Alsthom for Thomson-CSF, Europe’s largest defense electronics company. According to sources close to the discussions, Aérospatiale and its potential partners are in early talks with the French government about their interest in gaining control of Thomson-CSF, which has annual revenues of $6.3 billion.

The potential bid comes amid the French government’s ongoing attempts to consolidate its aerospace and defense industries to create larger companies that can better compete on a global scale. By teaming up with Dassault Aviation, a privately-held military aircraft maker, and Alcatel Alsthom, a major telecommunications equipment supplier, Aérospatiale would gain control of a company with capabilities spanning aircraft, electronics, and communications—all key areas as militaries integrate new technologies.

For Aérospatiale, gaining control of Thomson-CSF would fulfill its long-held ambition to expand beyond its core aerospace business into defense electronics and communications. The company attempted to merge with Thomson-CSF in the late 1990s but was blocked by competition regulators. A joint bid with Dassault and Alcatel could address regulators’ concerns by limiting Aérospatiale’s ownership stake. Still, the French government would likely aim to maintain a significant minority shareholding in any deal to protect nationally strategic defense electronics capabilities.

While the companies have declined to comment on any talks, analysts say a bid for Thomson-CSF could be launched within months. However, any deal is far from guaranteed, given the political and regulatory sensitivities around mergers in the defense sector as well as Thomson-CSF’s own turnaround efforts. The company’s shares are down nearly 50% from their peak in 2018 amid lackluster financial performance, shedding close to $5 billion in market value. The French government may prefer to see Thomson-CSF’s performance stabilize before approving a change of control.

A successful bid could create an aerospace and defense powerhouse in France with combined annual revenues of well over $20 billion, putting it on par with major competitors like Airbus and Thales. For Alcatel Alsthom, a deal would give it a foothold in defense electronics and help diversify its business away from challenging telecom equipment markets. But merging such complex businesses would be difficult and time-consuming, with no guarantee of financial or strategic success. With so much at stake, the fate of Thomson-CSF has emerged as a test of France’s political will and industry vision.
