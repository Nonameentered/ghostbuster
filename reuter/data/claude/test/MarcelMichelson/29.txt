France's New Telecommunications Supervisor Orders France Telecom to Review Proposal for Pricing Infrastructure Use 

The newly appointed head of France's telecommunications regulator, L'Autorité de Régulation des Communications Électroniques et des Postes (ARCEP), ordered the country's main telecom operator France Telecom to review its proposal for pricing access to its infrastructure. ARCEP head Sébastien Soriano said France Telecom's initial pricing scheme was "not balanced and discriminatory."

In a move to increase competition in France's telecommunications industry, ARCEP has been pushing France Telecom to provide fair access to its infrastructure, like telephone poles and underground cables, to other operators. The goal is to make it easier for competitors to enter local phone and broadband markets, providing French consumers and businesses with more choice and lower prices.

France Telecom controls the vast majority of the country's fixed telephone and broadband infrastructure, so access to its physical network is crucial for competitors. In response to an ARCEP directive, France Telecom submitted a proposed pricing plan for infrastructure access last month. 

However, after reviewing the proposal, Soriano said it "included prices that were not economically viable for certain local telecom markets, especially in rural and suburban areas." He ordered France Telecom to "remove anti-competitive provisions and unjustified differences" in its pricing structure within the next two months. If France Telecom does not comply, ARCEP has the authority to take punitive action against the company.

In a letter to France Telecom's CEO, Soriano argued that fair and reasonable access to infrastructure is key to achieving the government's objectives of boosting investment in broadband and greater choice for consumers. Some analysts view ARCEP's hardline approach as an encouraging sign the regulator intends to aggressively push more competition as a way to drive innovation in France's digital economy. France Telecom has argued that overly stringent regulation will hamper its ability to finance next-generation network upgrades. The tug-of-war between the dominant operator and regulator is likely to continue as France aims for more connectivity and affordability.
