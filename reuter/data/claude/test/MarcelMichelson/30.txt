France Telecom ordered to review proposal for infrastructure prices by new regulator 

France's telecommunications regulator ARCEP has ordered the country's leading operator France Telecom to revise its pricing proposal for access to its copper and fiber infrastructure. ARCEP said France Telecom's initial proposal did not meet regulatory requirements and would not enable alternative operators to compete fairly in the market.

France Telecom, now known as Orange, controls the vast majority of the nation's telecom infrastructure including the copper wire network and fiber optic connections reaching millions of homes. Alternative operators like Iliad's Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom rely on accessing Orange's infrastructure to provide competing services to consumers. 

ARCEP was established in 1997 to oversee the liberalization of the French telecom market and promote competition. Its role has become more critical as France moves to build out fiber broadband nationwide. ARCEP ordered Orange to provide access to its fiber network and civil engineering infrastructure at regulated prices, enabling competitors to reach more customers without building their own costly networks from scratch.

Orange submitted its first draft pricing proposal for access to its copper and fiber infrastructure in July as required by ARCEP. However, ARCEP said the proposal did not meet its guidelines for ensuring fair competition and needed significant revision. The regulator gave Orange two months to submit a new proposal with lower wholesale prices, faster response times for requests to access infrastructure, and greater transparency on its capacity and rollout plans.

ARCEP said Orange's initial pricing proposal did not adequately account for lower costs to Orange to operate and maintain its infrastructure over time. It said proposed wholesale fiber access prices were 20-50% higher than regulated prices for access to the copper network, even though fiber is a newer and more cost-efficient technology. ARCEP also criticized Orange's proposal for reserving the right to long response times for infrastructure access requests and lacking clear information on its fiber rollout ambitions. 

Orange said in a statement it was "surprised" by ARCEP's decision and believed its initial proposal was fair and balanced to meet regulatory requirements as well as its own commercial interests. However, Orange also said it would work constructively with ARCEP to prepare a revised proposal within two months. Orange CEO Stephane Richard has argued regulated access fees do not properly account for the company's investments in building and upgrading networks.

The dispute highlights the tension between promoting facilities-based competition and regulated access in telecom markets. ARCEP seeks to spur more competitors to build their own fiber and mobile networks, but also requires Orange to provide fair and reasonably priced access to its infrastructure to enable competition in the short term. The revised access pricing proposal from Orange and response from ARCEP will shape competition in France's broadband market for years to come. Overall, this mandate by the regulator suggests a toughening stance to ensure viable competitors to the dominant national champion Orange.
