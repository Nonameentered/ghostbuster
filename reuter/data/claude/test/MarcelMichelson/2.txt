French government halts Thomson SA sale to Lagardere Groupe, but still plans to privatize for a stronger defense company  

The French government announced today that it is blocking the sale of Thomson SA, a major French defense contractor, to Lagardere Groupe, a media conglomerate. The proposed $9 billion acquisition of Thomson by Lagardere was announced last month, pending regulatory approval. However, the French government, which owns a minority stake in Thomson and has veto power over major decisions, rejected the deal over concerns about national security and preserving France's defense industrial base.  

Thomson SA is one of France's largest aerospace and defense companies, with revenue of over $18 billion last year. It is a major supplier to the French military, producing aircraft, missiles, air defense systems, and other equipment. By contrast, Lagardere Groupe is a media company focused on publishing and travel retail, with no experience in the defense sector.  

In a statement, the French Ministry of Armed Forces said that while Lagardere is "an important French company, its proposed acquisition of Thomson SA posed risks to maintaining Thomson's focus on supplying critical defense equipment and services to national security forces." The ministry also expressed concern that key defense technologies and intellectual property could be sold off or neglected under Lagardere's ownership.  

However, the French government reaffirmed its commitment to eventually privatizing Thomson SA. The company was state-owned for decades before being partially privatized in the late 1990s. Successive administrations have aimed to completely privatize Thomson to introduce more commercial efficiency and private capital.  

Thomson SA's management and some investors have pushed for a sale to Lagardere as a way to fully privatize while merging with a prestigious French firm. But other observers argue that Lagardere may not maintain Thomson's key role in France's defense industrial base. Thomson's largest private investor, the industrial group Bouygues SA, is now rumored to be interested in acquiring a controlling stake to support Thomson's defense focus while taking the company private.
