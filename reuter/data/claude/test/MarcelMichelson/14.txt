French Oil Companies Total and Elf Aquitaine Sign Contracts to Buy Iraqi Crude Oil Under UN Deal

Paris, France (AP)â€”The French oil companies Total and Elf Aquitaine announced today that they have signed contracts with Iraq to purchase crude oil under the terms of a United Nations humanitarian deal. The oil-for-food accord allows Iraq to sell $1.2 billion of oil every six months to buy food, medicine, and other essential supplies.

The deals mark the first time Western oil companies will openly import Iraqi crude since the UN imposed sanctions on Baghdad after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Iraq holds the world's second largest proven oil reserves, and Western oil companies have long sought access to the country. The contracts are a limited but significant crack in the sanctions regime and could pave the way for broader trade agreements if Iraq complies with UN demands to eliminate its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.

Elf Aquitaine said its deal will allow it to buy up to 60,000 barrels of Iraqi oil per day, which could make Iraq a "notable" source of supply for the French oil major. Total did not disclose specific volumes but confirmed it had also signed a contract. The deals were approved under a UN memorandum of understanding that allows Baghdad to sell $1.2 billion of oil to fund humanitarian purchases, split into three-month phases. The latest phase began on December 19.

A UN source in New York said about 20 companies from a range of countries, including France, Russia, and China, had signed contracts under the accord so far. U.S. companies remain barred from buying Iraqi oil by a separate U.S. embargo. Officials at Total and Elf Aquitaine declined to disclose the price they would pay for the Iraqi oil. Benchmark Brent crude futures were trading around $25 per barrel today.

The humanitarian program has faced many challenges, and oil sales have failed to reach the allowed limit during past phases due to pricing disputes, contract complications, and port and pipeline bottlenecks. But the UN has made some recent changes to streamline the process.
