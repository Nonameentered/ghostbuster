Lagardere Groupe Expects Multimedia Profit in 1998 Despite Current Losses

Lagardere Groupe, the French media and technology conglomerate, announced today that it expects its multimedia division to become profitable in 1998, despite current losses and setbacks. The multimedia unit, which includes Internet, television, and mobile ventures, lost $124 million in 1997. However, Jean-Luc Lagardere, the company's chairman and CEO, expressed confidence in the long-term prospects of the division.

"We have invested heavily in multimedia over the last few years, and we knew that we would face losses and challenges as we build this new business," said Lagardere. "However, multimedia is central to the future of Lagardere Groupe. With leading positions in publishing, broadcasting, and mobile communications, we are uniquely positioned to thrive as the lines between traditional and new media blur."

The company's multimedia strategy has faced several obstacles recently. Its CanalSatellite subsidiary suffered a failed merger with Italian media group Cecchi Gori Communications. CanalSatellite is now seeking regulatory approval for a merger with fellow French satellite broadcaster TPS. Lagardere Groupe's mobile internet joint venture, Infomobile, has also struggled to gain traction. However, the company points to growth in its cable networks, online publishing, and production units as signs that the overall multimedia strategy is working.   

Lagardere expressed confidence that new ventures, cost-cutting efforts, and consolidation in the European media and telecom industries will help the multimedia unit reach profitability next year. The unit is forecast to double its revenue over the next 3-5 years. The company also expects growth in its traditional publishing and broadcasting divisions to boost overall profits and help fund continued investment in multimedia.  

"We have a clear vision for how multimedia will transform our company and the media landscape as a whole," said Lagardere. "With strategic investments and partnerships in place, 1998 will prove that our long-term, integrated approach is the right one, despite any temporary setbacks along the way."

The announcement comes as European companies race to establish positions in emerging media and technologies. Lagardere Groupe's multi-pronged strategy is indicative of a wider trend toward convergence of media, telecommunications, and digital services across the continent. Although initial forays into new media have proved costly, companies are betting that multimedia investments will pay off as these sectors mature.
