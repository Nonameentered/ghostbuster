SGS-Thomson Microelectronics Reports Strong 1996 Earnings but Warns of Weak First Quarter in 1997  

SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, one of the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, announced strong earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 1996 today but warned investors that the first quarter of 1997 is expected to be weak. The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 1996 of $147 million, up 47 percent from $100 million in the fourth quarter of 1995. For the full year 1996, net income rose 38 percent to $497 million from $360 million in 1995. Sales in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, up 36 percent from $885 million in the fourth quarter of 1995. Full year 1996 sales rose 32 percent to $4.4 billion from $3.3 billion in 1995.  

Carlo Bozotti, president and chief executive officer, attributed the strong results to growth in all product lines, tight control of operating expenses, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. “1996 was an excellent year for SGS-Thomson, with gains across the board in sales, profits, and market share. Our core logic, analog, and discrete businesses performed extremely well, and our new partnerships in Asia began to contribute significantly as well,” Bozotti said. “However, we are forecasting a temporary dip in sales and profits for the first quarter of 1997 due to soft demand for some of our mainstream logic chips and pricing pressures on certain analog and discrete products.”  

For the first quarter of 1997, the company expects sales to decline 3 to 5 percent from fourth quarter 1996 levels and net income to decrease at a slightly higher rate. SGS-Thomson executives remain confident that any first quarter weakness will be short-lived, with a rebound in sales and profits expected for the remaining quarters of 1997. Factors driving the company’s bullish outlook for the rest of the year include strong demand for digital signal processing chips, power management devices, and smart card products as well as sales growth opportunities in China and other Asian countries.  

SGS-Thomson is among the top ten semiconductor suppliers in the world, with over 60,000 employees and 16 wafer fabrication plants in Europe, Singapore, and Taiwan. In 1996, approximately 90 percent of the company’s sales were generated outside its home market of Europe, including about 35 percent in Asia. SGS-Thomson's shares are traded on the Borsa Italiana and as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange.
