Rhone-Poulenc and Merck Merge Animal Health Activities to Create World Leader in Sector

Two pharmaceutical giants announced today that they are merging their animal health divisions to create the largest animal health company in the world. Rhone-Poulenc and Merck will combine their animal health operations into a new joint venture called Merial Animal Health. 

The new company will have pro forma revenues of approximately $2.2 billion, making it the clear leader in the fast-growing animal health market. The animal health sector has been expanding at an annual rate of 5-6% in recent years, making it an attractive area for pharmaceutical companies looking to diversify beyond human health.

“By combining our animal health businesses, we will have the scale and resources to expand into new markets and accelerate the development of innovative new products for pets, farm animals and wildlife,” said Rhone-Poulenc CEO Henri de Castries. “This strategic partnership will allow us to better serve veterinarians and farmers around the world with a wider range of medicines, vaccines and other animal health products.”

The new company will bring together two highly complementary portfolios of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic products and services. Merck has a strong presence in the companion animal market with brands such as Nobivac canine vaccines, while Rhone-Poulenc is a leader in the farm animal health sector with products like the Ovilis vaccine range. 

Merial Animal Health will have commercial operations in more than 140 countries, 7,000 employees including 1,500 dedicated to research and development, and 15 production sites located in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Rhone-Poulenc and Merck will each have a 50% stake in the joint venture.

“By leveraging our respective expertise and country footprints, Merial Animal Health will be poised to meet the growing demand for high-quality, innovative medicine and vaccines to keep pets and livestock healthy around the world,” said Merck CEO P. Roy Vagelos. “This partnership reinforces our strategy to focus on high-growth areas in human and animal health.”

The deal requires regulatory approval but is expected to close within the next 6-12 months. The new company will be headquartered in Lyon, France and Kenilworth, New Jersey. Merial Animal Health is expected to start operations on January 1, 1997, pending approval from competition authorities. This transformational partnership is set to shake up the competitive landscape and raise the bar for innovation in the fast-changing animal health sector.
