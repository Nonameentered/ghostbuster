Total SA Reports 50% Increase in Net Income to 5.6 Billion Francs Due to Higher Oil Prices and Productivity Gains 

French oil major Total SA reported its second quarter earnings today, posting a 50% year-over-year increase in net income to 5.6 billion francs ($6.3 billion) on the back of higher oil prices and improved productivity.

The strong results come as oil prices have rebounded significantly from their lows in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brent crude oil prices averaged $69 per barrel in the second quarter, up from $45 a year earlier. Total oil and gas production during the quarter increased 4% from a year ago to 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.  

"The group leveraged the favorable environment to generate outstanding operational and financial results,” said Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné. "The return to normality is enabling us to capture the rebound in demand and the increase in commodity prices, notably oil prices."

Sales in the second quarter rose 33% to $46.3 billion, reflecting the higher oil and natural gas prices as well as increased production from new projects. Total's cash flow from operations more than doubled from a year ago, enabling the company to reduce net debt and maintain its dividend.

The results provide further evidence of the ongoing recovery in the oil and gas industry from last year's market disruption. Many of the world's largest publicly traded oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, reported strong earnings growth for the second quarter due to the price rebound.

Total has benefited from two major oil discoveries in recent years: the deepwater Brulpadda field off the coast of South Africa and the North Sea Glendronach field near the U.K.-Norway maritime border. Production started at Brulpadda in February and Glendronach in March. Total also continues to expand its presence in liquified natural gas, including new LNG projects in Mozambique and Russia.

Going forward, Pouyanné said Total remains "focused on strict capital discipline, sustainable value creation and the Group's transformation into an energy company delivering more affordable, more available and cleaner energies to as many people as possible." The company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for its operations by 2050.

Total expects oil demand to increase over the coming decades despite the global push for lower-carbon energy sources. Pouyanné has described the company's strategy as a "double pivot" to expand in renewable energies like solar and wind power while also increasing hydrocarbon production. The company plans to invest $2.5 billion per year in new renewable energy projects over the next five years.

At the same time, Total also continues to expand its oil and gas operations, especially in liquefied natural gas. It is a major investor in new LNG export terminals in Mozambique and Russia's Arctic region. While facing increasing pressure from environmental activists, Pouyanné has argued that the world will still need massive amounts of oil and gas for decades as economies transition to more sustainable energy systems.

Some investors and activists say oil companies need to shift away from fossil fuels more quickly to align with the Paris climate accord goals. But for now at least, Total and its peers are betting they can balance the dual aims of expanding hydrocarbons to meet still-growing demand while also pioneering more renewable and lower-carbon technologies over the longer term. With oil prices rebounding and the pandemic's effects receding, Total and other oil companies are poised to generate strong profits and cash flow for the foreseeable future.
