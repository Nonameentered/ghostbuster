French Minister Announces Capital Injection for Thomson Multimedia and Sale of Thomson-CSF  

The French Minister of Economy and Finance, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, announced today a €1.5 billion capital injection for Thomson Multimedia, a key unit of the troubled Thomson group. The government funds will be used to pay down debt and restructure the loss-making television and DVD player manufacturer. Further, Strauss-Kahn revealed that Thomson-CSF, the defense electronics division, will be sold to Thales to raise additional funds.

Thomson Multimedia has faced financial hardship in recent years as lower-cost Asian competitors have taken significant market share in the television and DVD segments. The company has struggled to adapt to changes in technology as CRT televisions have declined in favor of flat-screen TVs. It has lost over €2 billion since 2013, pushing the parent Thomson company into a difficult position. The government aid package is aimed at stabilizing Thomson Multimedia and supporting its transition to new generation products. However, there will be job cuts among the 22,000 employees as factories are consolidated.  

“We cannot let this French industrial champion falter,” Strauss-Kahn said in a news conference. “Thomson Multimedia remains an important employer and technological leader, but it must restructure its operations to succeed in today’s competitive global market.” The government has taken a 46% stake in the company in exchange for the capital funding. Thomson's CEO said the move was “essential for our viability and competitiveness.” However, critics argue it is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds to prop up a money-losing private company.  

The sale of Thomson-CSF, which has 32,000 employees and produces military radars, avionics and communications equipment, aims to offload an asset that no longer fits with Thomson's consumer electronics focus. Thales and Thomson-CSF were once part of the same state-controlled company, Thomson-Brandt, before being split up in the 1980s and 1990s. By coming back together, the deal will strengthen Thales’ position in defense electronics and cybersecurity solutions, for which demand remains strong. The price tag of €4.6 billion would generate cash for Thomson, though it must still be approved by regulators.

Overall, the twin moves announced by Strauss-Kahn amount to a major reorganization of the convoluted Thomson empire. Battling rising competition and industry shifts, Thomson has struggled for years to find its footing. While the future remains uncertain, experts say the capital injection and sale improve Thomson's odds of survival, even if a slimmer and more specialized company emerges from the process. The cost to taxpayers and job losses are two consequences that are fueling an intense debate around the wisdom of the government intervention.
