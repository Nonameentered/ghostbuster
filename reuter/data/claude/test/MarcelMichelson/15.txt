Thomson SA Management Has No Comment on Reported Preference for Market Float of Thomson-CSF 

Management at Thomson SA, the French electronics and defense company, declined to comment today on a report that the company prefers to float its defense electronics subsidiary Thomson-CSF on the stock market rather than sell a stake to a competitor. 

The report, published in French financial newspaper Les Echos, cited unnamed sources close to the company. According to the report, Thomson’s management believes that a public share offering for Thomson-CSF would achieve a higher valuation than a trade sale, as a number of major defense groups are eager to expand their equipment offerings and have expressed interest in acquiring a stake in Thomson-CSF. By taking the unit public through an IPO, Thomson could raise significant funds while still maintaining control of Thomson-CSF, the report said.

When asked to comment on the Les Echos report, a spokeswoman for Thomson SA said, “Thomson does not comment on rumors or speculation regarding strategic initiatives.” 

Thomson-CSF is the parent company's largest division, with annual revenues of $6 billion, or 40 percent of Thomson’s total sales. The company designs and builds defense electronics, security and monitoring systems, and telecommunications equipment for military and civilian use. In recent years, Thomson-CSF has invested heavily in creating synergies between its defense and civilian operations in areas like sensors, radars, and communications.

If the public offering moves ahead, Thomson-CSF would be one of the largest European tech listings this year. European tech IPOs have been gaining momentum recently, and Thomson’s rivals like Finmeccanica of Italy and BAE Systems of Britain have seen share price gains after streamlining their operations and divesting non-core commercial assets. A Thomson-CSF IPO could provide it with fresh capital to also expand through acquisitions, especially in emerging defense markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.

However, some analysts are skeptical that current conditions are optimal for a large European defense listing. “The defense sector is not in vogue at the moment on public equity markets, and it’s unlikely that an IPO for Thomson-CSF would be enthusiastically received by investors or priced at a level that the parent company would find attractive,” said Jean-Paul Bouchet, an industrials analyst at AlphaValue in Paris. Bouchet said trade bids from companies like Thales and Safran were more likely to match what Thomson believes Thomson-CSF could be worth.
