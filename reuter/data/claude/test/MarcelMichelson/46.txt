Generale des Eaux in Talks to Extend Power in Media Industry through Havas Deal

French utilities conglomerate Generale des Eaux is in advanced discussions to acquire a significant minority stake in advertising and media buying firm Havas, according to people familiar with the matter. An agreement could be announced as soon as next week. 

Generale des Eaux, one of France's largest companies with interests in water, waste management, energy, and construction, is looking to diversify its holdings into media and communications. The company seeks to leverage Havas’ expertise in advertising, branding, and analytics to promote Generale des Eaux’s brands to consumers across Europe and globally. Havas works with major international clients including Orange, Air France, and Mondelez International.

For Havas, an alliance with Generale des Eaux would provide financial backing to accelerate its expansion into digital media and emerging markets like Asia and South America. Havas has sought to reposition itself as a modern advertising agency with cutting-edge digital and data-driven offerings, but has faced pressure in recent years from larger rivals including WPP, Omnicom, and Publicis Groupe. A stake by Generale des Eaux could help Havas retain key clients and attract new global brands.

The deal under discussion would see Generale des Eaux take a stake of between 20 to 40 percent in Havas, which has a market value of around $4 billion, according to analysts. Generale des Eaux would appoint some members to Havas’ board but Havas would continue to operate independently under its current executive team. The two French companies have had a business relationship for decades but seek to deepen their cooperation.

Any transaction would be subject to regulatory approval but is not expected to face significant hurdles. For Generale des Eaux, an investment in Havas could be the first step in a longer-term strategy to become a bigger player in communications and marketing services. The utility company could later seek to increase its stake in Havas or make other acquisitions in related sectors like public relations or market research.

There is no certainty that a final agreement will be reached or terms will match what has been discussed so far between Generale des Eaux and Havas. Either company could back out from the talks or push for alternative deal structures. But a successful transaction would allow them both to leverage each other’s strengths and gain a foothold in new high-growth industries at a time when the lines between energy, media, and technology are increasingly blurred.
