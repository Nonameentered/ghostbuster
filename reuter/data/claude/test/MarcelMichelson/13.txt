France Telecom slashes call tariffs ahead of 1997 flotation and market liberalisation 

France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications operator, has announced sweeping cuts to the tariffs it charges for domestic and international phone calls. The cuts of up to 25% will take effect from January 1, 1997, just months before the partial privatisation of the company and the opening up of France's telecoms market to competition.

The tariff cuts are an attempt by France Telecom to make the company more attractive to investors ahead of its partial flotation on the stock market next year, while also trying to gain competitive advantage in advance of liberalisation. France Telecom currently has a monopoly on phone services in France but from January 1, rivals will be allowed to compete in the country's $20 billion telecommunications market. 

For residential customers, the cost of local phone calls will drop 15% and the cost of domestic long-distance calls will decrease by up to 25%. Business customers will also benefit from rate cuts of up to 10% on standard local and domestic calls. International call rates will fall by an average of 20% across the board. The company said the measures will save customers FFr5 billion ($961 million) next year.

“These price cuts reflect our determination to boost France Telecom's competitiveness, attractiveness and adaptability to the major technological and competitive changes sweeping the industry,” said Michel Bon, the chief executive of France Telecom.

However, consumer groups argue the cuts do not go far enough and that France Telecom will remain uncompetitive compared to operators in other European countries that have deregulated their telecoms markets. The company’s monopoly has allowed it to become one of the most profitable state companies in France, with operating margins of around 45%. Critics argue it has failed to pass on efficiency savings to customers in the form of lower prices.

The government hopes France Telecom's flotation next year will raise between $8 billion and $12 billion, which will help fund technological improvements to the country's telecommunications infrastructure. The company faces an array of challenges to defend its dominant position, as new competitors enter the market and alternative technologies like mobile phones and the internet reshape how people communicate.
