AOL France Aims to Reach 100,000 Subscribers in 1997

AOL France, the French subsidiary of American Online, announced an ambitious plan today to reach 100,000 subscribers in France by the end of 1997. The internet service provider launched in France just six months ago and currently has around 25,000 subscribers. If successful, AOL France would become the largest internet service provider in the country.  

The announcement comes as the internet is growing rapidly in France. According to recent estimates, over 3 million French citizens have access to the internet, a number that has tripled in just the last two years. However, internet penetration in France still lags many other European nations and the United States. AOL France hopes to capitalize on the increasing adoption of home internet connections and draw more of the French population online.

"The internet is the future, and we want to bring as many French people as possible into that future," said Jean-Philippe Mahe, the head of AOL France. "We believe affordable and easy to use internet access will transform lives and stimulate economic opportunity across France."

AOL France offers internet access for a monthly subscription fee starting at 99 francs (around $16). For the price, subscribers get software to access the internet, an email account, and exclusive content. AOL France has partnered with French media companies like Canal+ and Lagard√®re to offer entertainment and news content tailored to the French market. The company has also launched French-language web portals focused on topics like news, travel, and parenting.

However, AOL France faces significant challenges to reach its subscriber goal. The company will have to double its subscriber base every month for the remainder of the year to reach 100,000 total subscribers by December. Competition is also intensifying, as local startups and telecom companies launch rival internet services. Some critics argue AOL France does not fully understand the French market and local competitors have an advantage.

Mahe acknowledged the difficulties but said he remains confident in the growth plan. He pointed to AOL's success in launching internet services in Germany and the UK as proof the company can succeed internationally. If AOL France is able to achieve widespread mainstream adoption, it could pave the way for further expansion across continental Europe and beyond. The coming months will determine whether AOL France's ambitious vision is realistic or merely a pipe dream.
