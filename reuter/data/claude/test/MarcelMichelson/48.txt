French media landscape set for major transformation as Generale des Eaux enters talks to become key shareholder in Canal Plus 

Paris, France - In a move that could significantly reshape the French media industry, Generale des Eaux, France’s largest water and waste management company, has entered into exclusive negotiations to become a key shareholder in Canal Plus, the country’s largest pay TV group. 

Generale des Eaux announced today that it is negotiating the purchase of a 30% stake in Canal Plus from French conglomerate Vivendi, which currently owns 80% of Canal Plus. The potential deal would value Canal Plus at over €10 billion, making it the largest media acquisition in France in over a decade.

The news sent shockwaves through the French media sector, as analysts consider the implications of Generale des Eaux becoming a powerful player in an industry far from its core water services business. The company is aiming to diversify its revenue streams, but faces questions over its ambitions and strategy in the media space.

If completed, the deal would provide a much-needed cash infusion for Canal Plus, which has struggled in recent years with increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Disney+. Canal Plus has lost over 1 million subscribers in the last 5 years, putting pressure on its business model. Generale des Eaux’s investment could help the pay TV group invest further in exclusive content and new sport broadcast rights to lure customers back.

For Vivendi, the partial sale of its controlling stake in Canal Plus is a chance to unlock value from its media assets and refocus its business on its music and mobile subsidiaries. Vivendi acquired full control of Canal Plus in 2017 but has since explored options to sell some of its shares to a strategic partner. 

The negotiations between Generale des Eaux and Vivendi are expected to last several weeks. While not yet certain to complete, analysts say the deal looks likely to proceed given the complementary interests of both companies. If approved, it would mark the start of a new era for Canal Plus under the eyeline of an unconventional new media shareholder. The coming months will determine whether this unconventional pairing is a stroke of genius or a risky gamble. Both companies have much at stake in ensuring its success.
