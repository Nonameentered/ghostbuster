Saint Louis Tightens Grip on Spanish Sugar Sector with Acquisition of 15% Stake in Ebro Agricolas 

Saint Louis Sucre, the sugar production arm of French agricultural cooperative Tereos, announced today that it has acquired a 15% stake in Ebro Agricolas, Spain's largest sugar beet processing company. The move strengthens Saint Louis' position in the Iberian sugar market and provides greater security of supply for its sugar refining operations in France.

Ebro Agricolas operates six processing facilities across Spain that produce approximately 1 million metric tons of sugar annually from locally-grown sugar beets. Spain is Europe's third largest sugar beet producer behind France and Germany. The investment in Ebro Agricolas is the latest in a series of acquisitions by Saint Louis to gain greater control over its supply chain and hedge against volatility in the global sugar market.

"This strategic investment in Ebro Agricolas allows us to further consolidate our leadership position in the European sugar sector," said Jean-Charles Lefebvre, CEO of Saint Louis Sucre. "By securing additional access to high-quality Spanish sugar beets, Saint Louis will boost our productivity, reduce costs and deliver long-term value to our 13,000 farmer-members."

The deal comes two years after Tereos acquired control of Saint Louis from German sugar company Südzucker. Under Tereos' ownership, Saint Louis has pursued an aggressive strategy to bolster its self-sufficiency in beet sugar production. In February, Saint Louis announced the purchase of three processing facilities from French competitor Cristal Union.  The company aims to source at least 75% of its sugar beets from farms within 100 miles of its 16 factories across France.

Tereos is a major player in the global sugar and ethanol markets with operations in 10 countries across Europe, South America, the Indian Ocean and Asia. The cooperative's sugar business generated €1.6 billion in revenue last year. Alongside its controlling stake in Saint Louis, Tereos owns sugar producing assets in Brazil, Tanzania and Laos that provide access to cane sugar. The diversified model and geographically dispersed operations provide resilience against poor harvests or pricing pressures in any given region.

The closing of the Ebro Agricolas acquisition is subject to approval by Spanish regulators. Saint Louis said the deal would likely conclude before the start of the next European sugar beet harvesting campaign in October.
