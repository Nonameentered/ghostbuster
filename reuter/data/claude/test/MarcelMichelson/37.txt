Total SA Reports 50% Net Income Rise in 1996 to 5.6 Billion Francs ($1 Billion) Boosted by Oil Prices and Productivity Gains  

The French oil giant Total SA reported a 50% increase in net income for 1996 to 5.6 billion francs ($1 billion), buoyed by higher oil prices and improved productivity. 

Total’s net operating income rose 45% to 16.4 billion francs due to an increase in oil prices in 1996 as well as ongoing cost-cutting measures. The average price of Brent crude oil rose 22% in 1996, boosting Total’s upstream profits. Total is one of the world’s largest oil producers with operations in more than 130 countries.

“1996 was an outstanding year for Total,” said Chairman and CEO Thierry Desmarest. “We benefitted from a rebound in oil prices while also improving operational efficiencies across the group. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our long-term strategy to maximize profits through growth and cost control.”

Total’s upstream division, which encompasses oil and gas exploration and production, saw operating income rise 51% to 11.3 billion francs. Gas and Power division operating income climbed 18% to 3.9 billion francs due to higher gas prices and sales volumes. However, Total’s Refining and Marketing division operating income declined 13% to 2.8 billion francs due to weak refining margins, particularly for heavy fuel oil.  

In 1996, Total ramped up oil and gas production by nearly 3% from a year earlier to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Total continues developing new projects to sustain long term production growth, including deepwater projects off the coast of Angola and Nigeria. 

Total also cut costs by 1.2 billion francs in 1996 through redundancies, improved purchasing, and streamlined operations. The company aims to cut costs by a further 0.8 billion francs this year through ongoing productivity initiatives, despite increasing investment in upstream projects.

Total’s results and outlook are positive signs for the oil industry which struggled in the early 1990s due to low commodity prices. Other oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell and BP are expected to report similarly strong results for 1996 when they announce earnings over the coming weeks.

Total remains committed to improving returns through operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted upstream growth. If oil prices remain buoyant and cost savings continue as planned, Total is well positioned to deliver another strong performance in 1997. Overall, 1996 was a truly standout year for Total as it benefitted fully from the headwinds lifting the oil and gas industry.
