French Government Halts Controversial Sale of Thomson SA Electronics Group After Backlash and Labour Revolt

The French government announced today that it is suspending the proposed sale of electronics group Thomson SA to a private investment group. The sale of Thomson, which owns popular brands like Technicolor, RCA, and Braun, led to public outcry and protests from Thomson employees.

Thomson was majority state-owned for decades but was fully acquired by the French government in 1982. With increasing global competition in consumer electronics and appliances, the government aimed to privatize Thomson to make it more competitive on a global scale. However, the announcement of the $4.2 billion sale of Thomson to New Horizons Capital sparked controversy. 

Critics argued that the sale was far below Thomson's real market value and amounted to a "fire sale" of a iconic French company. Labor unions representing Thomson's 65,000 employees staged strikes and protests outside government offices, demanding the sale be halted. They feared massive job cuts and restructuring under the new private owners looking to maximize profits.

Public sentiment was also decisively against the sale. An opinion poll found that 72% of French citizens opposed the privatization of Thomson, seeing it as a threat to French industrial sovereignty. Thomson's brands have been household names in France for generations, and there were concerns about them falling into foreign ownership.

Facing mounting political pressure, President Emmanuel Macron's government announced it would suspend the sale process. In a public statement, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said "The government has heard the concerns of citizens and employees. We will not move forward with the sale of Thomson at this time." However, he left open the possibility of relaunching the sale in the future if concerns could be adequately addressed.

The suspension of the deal is seen as a blow to President Macron's agenda of market reforms. However, political commentators note that pushing ahead with the unpopular sale could have seriously damaged public confidence in his government. For now, Thomson's future remains in limbo as the government weighs its options on how to support the company and its thousands of employees while still open to private investment. The coming months will determine whether Macron's grand vision of revitalizing the French economy can overcome national anxieties over the fate of a once-proud national champion.
