Bill Gates Pushes for Private Use of Encryption in France, Discusses Education and Future of Computers at Elysee Palace Meeting with President Chirac  

Paris, France - Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the richest men in the world, met with French President Jacques Chirac at the Elysee Palace today to discuss technology policy and education. Gates urged France to allow private use of strong encryption, saying it is essential for innovation and security.
 
 "Encryption is a tool that can be used for good or bad, much like any technology," Gates said in a press conference after the meeting. "Banning or restricting encryption will not stop bad actors from using it, but it will hamper the ability of individuals and companies to protect themselves and enable new products and services."
 
France has strict laws limiting the use of strong encryption technology, citing concerns about terrorism and crime. Gates argued that malicious actors will still have access to encryption, while law-abiding citizens and companies will be put at a disadvantage without it.
 
"Technology moves fast, and encryption techniques that are cutting edge today will be obsolete in a few years," Gates said. "Laws should enable innovation, not restrict it."
 
Gates and Chirac also discussed the role of technology and computers in education. Gates Foundation, the philanthropic organization founded by Gates, has invested heavily in schools and education programs around the world.
 
"Education is the key to opportunity and progress," Gates said. "Computers and digital coursework are powerful tools for personalized learning. We must make sure schools have access to the latest technology and training to make the most of them."
 
Chirac said he welcomed Gates' perspectives on technology and education policy. "Bill Gates is a visionary, and France is always open to innovative ideas," Chirac said after the meeting. "We had a very productive discussion about how to spur new technologies and provide the best education for our citizens."
 
Gates also shared his views on likely advances in computing over the next 10 to 20 years, including continued progress in artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and quantum computing. He warned there would be "profound changes" as computers become far more advanced and capable.
 
"The future of technology is exciting, but it will also bring challenges and disrupt many existing systems," Gates said. "Countries that are prepared to adapt will thrive. But we must make sure the benefits are shared broadly across all parts of society."
