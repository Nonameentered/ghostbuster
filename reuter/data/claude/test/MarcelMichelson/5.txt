French Government Halts Controversial Sale of Electronics Group Thomson SA 

The French government announced today that it is halting the proposed sale of electronics conglomerate Thomson SA to a group of private equity firms. The â‚¬4.8 billion deal has faced scrutiny from opposition politicians and Thomson's labor unions.

Thomson, which owns brands such as Technicolor, RCA, and Grass Valley, was put up for sale earlier this year as part of an effort by President Emmanuel Macron's government to privatize state-owned companies. However, the prospect of selling Thomson to a consortium led by KKR & Co. and CD&R has provoked backlash in recent weeks. Critics argue that new private owners would slash jobs and break up the company to extract value.

In a statement, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government could not support a deal that "would have weakened this strategic company and threatened many jobs." He added that the government will explore other options for Thomson, including a stock market listing or finding a "more solid" private buyer. However, some analysts are skeptical another buyer will emerge given the scale of investment required.

Thomson's unions have staunchly opposed a private equity takeover, fearing deep cost-cutting. Eric Marbet, secretary of the Thomson European Works Council, cautiously welcomed today's news but warned that "the battle is not yet won." He called on the government to establish "clear guarantees" for Thomson's 42,000 employees worldwide before pursuing other deals.  

The withdrawn sale highlights the difficult balancing act facing Macron as he seeks to deregulate the economy and make state-owned enterprises more competitive. While privatization can inject capital and expertise, it also frequently stirs political pushback in France. Macron was forced to amend another deal earlier this year, reducing the state's stake in rail giant SNCF following protests.

Some legislators from opposition parties argued the government should never have considered selling a strategic company like Thomson to "vulture funds." However, others counter that without major changes Thomson could struggle to thrive globally. The company has reported declining revenue and profitability in recent years due to slowing sales in some divisions.  

Macron has pledged to restructure Thomson to support next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence and 8K video. However, that process will now drag on without the investment injection from a sale. With the deal in doubt, Thomson's future remains unclear.
