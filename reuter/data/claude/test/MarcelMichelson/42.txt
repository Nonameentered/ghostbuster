French Government Deliberates Privatization of Defence Electronics Group Thomson-CSF through Public or Private Sale  

The French government is discussing options to fully or partially privatize Thomson-CSF, the prominent aerospace and defence electronics company. Sources close to the negotiations say the government is looking to either sell its interest in the company through an initial public offering (IPO) on Euronext Paris or find private investors willing to acquire a significant ownership stake.   

Founded in 1891 as the Société Française des Torpilles Whitehead, Thomson-CSF has been majority-owned by the French government for several decades. It is one of Europe's largest defence electronics contractors, producing radar, missile guidance, and battle management systems for the French military and other NATO allies. The company also has a significant commercial aerospace division producing in-flight entertainment systems, radars, and avionics.  

Thomson-CSF was partially privatized in 1999 through an IPO that listed 20% of shares on the Paris stock exchange. The French government retained majority ownership and control of its defence activities. However, the privatization plan stalled in the following years due to volatile financial markets and political controversies. Successive French governments have aimed to restart the privatization to raise funds and increase private-sector ownership.

According to sources, the government is hoping an IPO or private sale of 40-50% of shares could raise between €3 to 5 billion. The funds would be used to support other state-owned enterprises and invest in new technologies. An IPO may be appealing as it could raise greater proceeds, but risks dilution of government control. A private sale to an aerospace or defence company may be more strategic but raise less capital. BAE Systems, Airbus Group and Thales Group are seen as potential buyers if a private sale option is pursued.

Union representatives and politicians have voiced concerns about further privatization of such a strategic national asset, particularly to foreign buyers. But others argue private capital and commercial expertise could benefit Thomson-CSF and point out the company would still be subject to government oversight and regulation regarding sensitive defence contracts. The deliberations in Paris are said to be intensifying in coming weeks as the government looks to make a final decision on the path forward for privatizing Thomson-CSF.
