Alcatel Alsthom in talks with Aerospatiale and Dassault for joint bid on Thomson-CSF stake  

French electronics group Alcatel Alsthom is in discussions with national champion aerospace and defense groups Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation about teaming up to make a joint bid for state-owned Thomson-CSF, according to people close to the talks. 

The three companies have been exploring whether to form a consortium to bid for the French government's 45% stake in Thomson-CSF, France's largest defense electronics company. The French state has said it wants to reduce its holding in Thomson-CSF this year. Alcatel Alsthom has previously shown strong interest in gaining control of Thomson-CSF but has struggled to raise sufficient funds alone for such a bid.

A joint offer from Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale, and Dassault would provide a heavyweight alliance with greater financial firepower to compete against foreign bids. Other potential bidders for the stake include American groups Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Such an alliance also reflects the desire by French companies to strengthen their hands through tie-ups to prevent foreign takeovers of strategic defense and technology groups. Relations between the three potential partners are said to be close.

The talks between Alcatel Alsthom, Aerospatiale and Dassault are still at a preliminary stage, and they have not yet finalized a joint offer or agreed formally to team up for a bid. There is no certainty any alliance will emerge or that they will proceed to make a firm offer for the Thomson-CSF holding. However, people close to the discussions say Alcatel Alsthom is eager to secure the support of Aerospatiale and Dassault to avoid risking being outbid for such a prized French technology asset. Analysts think any alliance by French groups will make them formidable contenders for the Thomson-CSF stake.

The French government, which wants to reduce influence in industry, will likely welcome a joint French bid for Thomson-CSF as a way to keep the group in domestic hands. An announcement on bid procedures for the stake sale is expected within weeks.
