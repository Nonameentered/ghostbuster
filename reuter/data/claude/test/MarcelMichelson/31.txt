France Telecom Takes Full Control of Keystone Communications to Strengthen Position in North American TV Market

France Telecom today announced that it has purchased the remaining 48% stake in Keystone Communications, taking full control of the US-based television provider. The deal is for $2.3 billion in cash, valuing Keystone at $4.8 billion. 

Keystone is the third-largest television provider in North America with over 2 million subscribers, primarily on the East Coast of the US and some areas of Eastern Canada. France Telecom, a major telecommunications company with headquarters in Paris, bought 52% of Keystone in 2016 as part of its strategy to expand into new markets outside of France and diversify into television and media.

Gaining full ownership of Keystone allows France Telecom to further integrate the company into its global operations. France Telecom said it will now have greater flexibility to bundle Keystone television services with its existing mobile and broadband offerings in the North American market. France Telecom has over 10 million mobile customers in the US and Canada through its subsidiaries like Metro Wireless and Northern Cellular.

"This acquisition is a pivotal moment that will allow us to provide end-to-end telecom and entertainment services to over 12 million customers in North America," said Jacques Dujardin, CEO of France Telecom. "Keystone has a proven track record of success and loyal customers. By combining Keystone with our existing telecom businesses in North America, we will compete head-to-head with major providers like AT&T and Comcast."

The deal is still subject to regulatory approval but France Telecom does not anticipate any major obstacles. Keystone employees and management are expected to stay in place following the transaction. France Telecom said the company will continue normal operations and that customers should not experience any service disruptions during this ownership transition.

The purchase of Keystone highlights France Telecom's ambitions to become a dominant player in television and media outside of its traditional home market in France. Buying full control of Keystone provides another foothold in the lucrative North American market as France Telecom transforms into a global telecommunications powerhouse. Overall, this signals an aggressive growth strategy by France Telecom to challenge major providers in markets around the world.
