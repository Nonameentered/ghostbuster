French Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole Takes Full Control of Banque Indosuez for 11.9 Billion Francs

The French agricultural bank, Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA), announced today that it is acquiring full control of the French merchant bank Banque Indosuez for 11.9 billion francs ($2.4 billion). CNCA will purchase the remaining 43% stake in Banque Indosuez from its current majority owner Societe General. After the transaction is complete, CNCA will control 100% of Banque Indosuez.

Banque Indosuez has had a difficult year, posting a loss of over 1 billion francs in 2020. However, CNCA sees potential in growing Banque Indosuez's corporate and investment banking business, especially in fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets. "Banque Indosuez has a strong international presence that complements our domestic retail banking operation," said CNCA CEO Gerard Tisserand. "Full ownership will allow us to better integrate Indosuez into our group and turn around the business."

This acquisition is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the French banking industry as smaller players struggle with profitability pressures and increasing costs of regulation. Combining with larger domestic rivals is seen as a way for some French banks to gain scale, cut costs, and strengthen their balance sheets. 

 Critics argue that the deal could reduce competition in the French banking sector, which is already dominated by a few large players. However, others counter that Indosuez was unlikely to survive long-term as an independent entity. The deal has already received the backing of Societe General, which has been a vocal proponent of consolidation in the French banking market.

The acquisition of Banque Indosuez will make CNCA the second largest bank in France with over 2 trillion francs in total assets. However, CNCA still remains dwarfed by BNP Paribas, the largest bank in the Eurozone. CNCA hopes this deal will boost its corporate and investment banking expertise as well as its international reach, enabling it to better compete with BNP Paribas in the future. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year, pending regulatory approval.
