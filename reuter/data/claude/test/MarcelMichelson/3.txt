Controversial Sale of French Electronics Group Thomson SA Halts in Major Policy U-Turn

The planned sale and breakup of Thomson SA, France's iconic but troubled electronics and media conglomerate, has been halted abruptly by the country's new government. The center-left government led by President Emmanuel Macron announced that it would block the proposed purchase of parts of Thomson by various foreign buyers, citing national security concerns.

The former Socialist administration under François Hollande had approved the €3.2 billion sale of three Thomson units to Chinese buyers last year to reduce national debt and revive the flagging company. However, Macron's government, which took power last month, said it would reassess and likely reverse those deals over fears of Chinese influence over key technologies. 

Macron's administration also voiced alarm at the potential outsourcing of French jobs and intellectual property to overseas companies. The policy reversal represents a sharp change in France's typically market-friendly stance and a reassertion of state control over a company with strategic technological and media assets.

Thomson, once a crown jewel of French industry and technology, has endured years of financial troubles, competition from low-cost Asian rivals, and failed restructuring.  Many analysts saw the planned sales and breakup, announced last fall, as Thomson's last chance to survive by streamlining itself to focus on its remaining broadcasting equipment and set-top box units. 

However, the prospect of Chinese ownership of Thomson's medical imaging, video equipment and circuit board divisions provoked an intense backlash. Opponents argued this would undermine France's economic and national security at a time of Chinese investment in Western high-tech and media companies. 

Supporters of the deals, including Thomson's management and shareholders, argue that collapsed sales will plunge the company back into crisis. Thomson's stock price fell more than 12% on news of the policy U-turn. The company said it was reviewing its strategic options but warned that blocking the deals could force major restructuring, including potential job cuts among its 6,000 French employees.

The policy reversal underscores intensifying concerns over Chinese investments in Western economies as well as philosophical differences over state intervention in the market economy. Thomson's future remains highly uncertain, caught between political debates over national champions versus market forces, globalization versus economic nationalism.
