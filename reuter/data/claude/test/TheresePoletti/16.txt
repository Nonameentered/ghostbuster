CompuServe takes aim at AOL with Super Bowl ad and print campaign 

CompuServe, the once mighty online service provider, is attempting a comeback with an aggressive new marketing campaign targeting its larger rival AOL. The campaign includes a 30-second ad during next month's Super Bowl broadcast as well as full-page ads in major newspapers.

The Super Bowl ad, CompuServe's first during the big game, mocks AOL's iconic "You've Got Mail" message sound and portrays AOL as outdated and behind the times. The ad highlights CompuServe's faster internet speeds and more modern offerings. The print ads take a similar tack, claiming "AOL is old news. CompuServe is the future."

CompuServe dominated the online landscape in the 1980s and 1990s but faded with the rise of broadband connections, as it was a pioneer of dial-up networking. AOL acquired CompuServe in 1998 for $1.2 billion but later spun it off. CompuServe re-emerged as an independent company in 2017 with new private equity backing.

"We're ready to take on AOL and show people why we're the superior choice for today's connected world," said CompuServe CEO Jill Manning in an interview. "Faster speeds, better technology, and updated apps and services -- we beat AOL on all fronts. But most people still think of us as we were 20 years ago. This campaign is designed to shake people out of that outdated notion."

The campaign is by Smith Advertising, an edgy New York agency known for attention-grabbing work. Industry analysts see it as a bold move by CompuServe, given AOL's scale and reach. AOL still has over 2 million dial-up subscribers and owns popular media properties like Engadget, TechCrunch, and The Huffington Post. 

"CompuServe is clearly the underdog here, so they need to be provocative to get attention," said Brian Chen, an analyst at Forrester Research. "But there's a risk of coming across as too gimmicky or abrasive. They need to back up the flash with substance by continuing to improve their offerings."

Some viewers have already criticized CompuServe's Super Bowl ad as too negative. But others argue that portraying AOL as outdated is fair and resonates with consumers who see AOL as a relic. CompuServe will be eager to see if post-game surveys and website traffic show their message is breaking through. For two former powerhouses of the early Internet age, the battle for subscribers looms as a fight for relevance.
