IBM Expected to Report Solid Q4 Earnings, But Analysts Wary of Impact From Stronger Dollar  

IBM is set to report its fourth quarter financial results after the market close on Tuesday. Analysts expect the tech giant to post solid earnings growth driven by strength in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses. However, some analysts remain cautious about the potential impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on IBM's results.

IBM is forecast to report earnings of $4.81 per share, up 5% from a year ago, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. Revenue is expected to total $21.76 billion, a 0.3% increase from last year. Those figures suggest IBM's revenue decline may be tapering off after several consecutive quarters of shrinking sales. The company’s fast-growing cloud and AI segments now represent more than half of total revenue. 

Stronger demand for those areas is helping offset continued softness in IBM’s legacy enterprise IT business. In the third quarter, IBM’s cloud and AI revenue jumped 10% while legacy revenue slipped 4%. Growth in hybrid cloud, cybersecurity and AI are key to IBM’s turnaround efforts under Chief Executive Ginni Rometty.

However, some analysts remain concerned about currency headwinds due to the dollar's steady climb over the past year. IBM derives more than half of its revenue from international markets, so its earnings take a hit when the dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies like the Euro.

Credit Suisse analyst Philip Winslow, who rates IBM "Neutral," estimates currency impacts may reduce IBM's Q4 revenue by $900 million and earnings by $0.14 per share compared to the previous guidance. Winslow believes "these currency impacts will likely temper the response" even if IBM's results are otherwise solid.

Other analysts are more optimistic. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a "Buy" rating on IBM, says the company's fundamentals remain strong and currency headwinds are "manageable." Mohan expects IBM's 2020 earnings guidance to be in-line with consensus estimates, which could reassure investors concerned about the dollar's impact. 

IBM's earnings report after market close Tuesday will provide more clarity on the company's performance as it works to reignite growth through strategic cloud and AI investments. Investors will be watching closely to see whether Big Blue can maintain its momentum and overcome currency pressures to start the new year.
