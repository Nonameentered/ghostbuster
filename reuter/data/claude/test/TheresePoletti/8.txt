IBM Reports 4Q Earnings Slightly Better Than Expected 

International Business Machines Corp (IBM) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the market close on Tuesday that beat analysts' estimates, as its cloud and artificial intelligence businesses showed modest growth.

IBM said its fourth-quarter revenue declined to $19.8 billion from $21.8 billion a year earlier. But analysts had forecast revenue of $19.62 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Net income declined to $2.3 billion, or $2.08 per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31 from $2.8 billion, or $2.86 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.05 per share. 

The earnings report caps an eventful 2019 for IBM. In October, the company closed its $34 billion acquisition of open-source software company Red Hat. After stumbling in its legacy business selling mainframe computers, IBM is staking its future on the fast-growing cloud computing business dominated by rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.

Nevertheless, the 109-year-old company is still struggling to achieve consistent revenue growth, which investors have been expecting from its shift into the new areas. In 2020, IBM will continue to push growth in its new businesses as well as in segments like software and services, which the company now calls its new collar skill initiatives.

Revenue from IBM's cloud business declined 1 percent to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. The company's cloud revenue had grown in every quarter since 2013. Cloud is seen as one of the fastest-growing areas of technology along with AI and big data analytics. 

IBM shares slipped 2.5% in extended trading after closing at $138.61 in New York Tuesday. The stock has gained about 18% since the start of 2019.

"We now have RedHat and a more streamlined portfolio, and with the launch of new z15 and Power10 products this quarter, and a robust services backlog, we are poised for solid revenue and profit growth in 2020," said CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM expects 2020 free cash flow of about $18 billion.

The results come as IBM also faces an executive shakeup. The company in January said Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh will step down, to be replaced by IBM senior vice president and treasurer James Whitehurst. Rometty said the move is part of the company's succession planning process.

In 2019, IBM bought out its CFO incentives from the prior year and restructured bonuses to reflect the company's subscription-based business model. The changes were made to incentivize revenue growth and improve free cash flow, according to a regulatory filing.

Overall, the fourth quarter results provide a cautiously optimistic outlook for IBM in 2020 if it can build momentum in its strategic imperatives such as cloud computing and AI. The road ahead remains challenging, but IBM appears poised to continue its slow and steady transformation.
