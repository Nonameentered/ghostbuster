JAMtv to Launch Personalized Music Network on the Internet

JAMtv, a startup focused on personalized music experiences, announced today the launch of its own internet streaming service to deliver individualized music channels for each listener. The JAMtv Music Network will debut next month with over 50 curated music channels spanning a wide range of genres, as well as the ability for listeners to create their own custom channels based on their musical tastes and listening habits.

“We want to revolutionize the way people discover and listen to music by giving them an experience that is tailored to their personal preferences,” said Mike Jameson, CEO of JAMtv. “Our goal is to become the leader in personalized music streaming and help people forge deeper connections with music that resonates the most with them.” 

The JAMtv Music Network uses a proprietary AI technology and machine learning system to analyze the musical characteristics of songs, build a “listening profile” for each user based on their ratings and preferences, and generate a constant stream of songs that match their tastes. Listeners can tune into a variety of curated channels in genres like rock, hip hop, country, jazz, and classical, or get instantly generated personalized channels. The more a listener rates songs, the better JAMtv gets at refining and enhancing their channels.

“JAMtv has really tapped into the future of streaming music by focusing on personalization,” said music industry analyst Jesse Stillman. “As music catalogs have exploded on services like Spotify and Apple Music, listeners can feel overwhelmed by options or get stuck in a rut of the same songs over and over. Personalized channels are meant to fix that by doing the curating for you, and JAMtv is poised to lead the way with a service built specifically around that premise.”

The JAMtv Music Network will be available on the web as well as iOS and Android mobile apps for $9.99 per month with a 7-day free trial. JAMtv has licensing deals in place with all major music labels and thousands of independent labels to build its music catalog.

“We want JAMtv to be a place of discovery where our listeners are always finding new songs and new artists that speak directly to them and their unique tastes,” said Mary Silver, VP of Content at JAMtv. “Our goal is to break down mass-media stereotypes of what constitutes a music genre and instead build a hyper-personal experience for each listener around the type of music that motivates and inspires them.”

The launch of the JAMtv Music Network comes on the heels of several music streaming services announcing new personalized music features, but Stillman notes that JAMtv is the first built from the ground up around personalization and that may give it an advantage with listeners looking for a tailored experience. For Jameson and his team at JAMtv, it’s the culmination of over 3 years of work developing their music recommendation engine and forging partnerships with labels to make their vision for a personalized music streaming service a reality.
