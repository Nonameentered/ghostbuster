New York State Attorney General Threatens Lawsuit Against AOL Over Allegedly Deceptive Business Practices

New York State Attorney General Letitia James today threatened to file a lawsuit against AOL, alleging that the technology and media company has engaged in deceptive business practices by misleading customers and improperly billing them. 

In a letter sent to Verizon Communications, which owns AOL, James accused AOL of using deceptive marketing and billing tactics that violated both federal and state laws. Her office cited over 1,500 customer complaints that alleged AOL made it difficult to cancel service or improperly charged early termination fees.

"AOL's treatment of its customers is unacceptable and a clear violation of law," James said in a statement. "Verizon and AOL must do right by consumers and end these deceptive practices immediately."

AOL provides internet access, digital content and web services to millions of Americans. The company became popular in the 1990s and early 2000s for its dial-up access and AIM instant messaging service but now focuses on content and advertising. AOL was acquired by Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion.

The Attorney General's investigation found that AOL often made misleading offers for long-term subscription commitments while obscuring the details of the offer. In many cases, customers reported being misled into agreeing for automatic renewal of annual plans or incurring early termination fees they did not expect.  

In one example cited in the letter, an AOL customer was charged over $200 in early termination and device non-return fees after attempting to cancel a subscription within the 30-day risk-free trial period advertised for the service. AOL then sent the fees to collections, damaging the customer's credit.

The letter demands that Verizon and AOL stop such deceptive practices, provide restitution to customers, and take disciplinary action against employees involved in misconduct. If changes are not made within 20 days, the Attorney General's office warned it would pursue further legal action.

A spokesperson for Verizon said the company would review the letter in detail and respond "in due course." Earlier this year, Verizon announced plans to sell AOL and Yahoo, which it also owns, to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. That deal is still pending regulatory approval and expected to close in the second half of 2021.
