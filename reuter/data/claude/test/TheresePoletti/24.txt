IBM Launches First Network Computer for Under $700, Targeting Corporations and Corporate Networks

IBM today unveiled its first "network computer" aimed at corporate networks and workgroups. The new IBM Network Station is priced at just under $700 and is designed to function primarily as a access point to applications and data on a network server. 

The Network Station has no hard drive and boots directly from the network, accessing applications and data stored centrally. It has a 266 MHz Pentium processor, 32MB of memory, and integrated 10/100 Ethernet networking. The system runs on Microsoft's scaled-down Windows NT and can run Java-based applications as well as standard Windows software.

"The Network Station delivers easy access to applications and data for a very affordable price," said IBM chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. "It's ideal for corporations that want to deploy large numbers of simple, single-purpose devices for basic productivity needs."

IBM sees the Network Station as a low-cost alternative for tasks like data entry, time and expense reporting, and customer support. The systems are designed to be managed centrally by network administrators and receive automatic software updates from network servers.

"The Network Station model represents the future of computing for large portions of the workforce," said Stephen Dukker, president of the Dukker Consultancy. "For many basic productivity and communication needs, a full PC is overkill. IBM is smart to target this space, as more and more companies look to reduce the complexity and cost of managing large fleets of PCs."

IBM expects the Network Station to appeal to companies with large call centers, retail outlets, and manufacturing operations. The systems are also well suited for use in conference rooms, classrooms, and training facilities. The company said the Network Station can help lower the total cost of ownership of technology infrastructure by reducing ongoing management and support costs.

The IBM Network Station will be available June 15 with a starting price of $690. Industry experts expect competitive offerings from other PC makers like Dell, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard to follow shortly. IBM's move into this "thin client" space could mark the beginning of a broader industry trend with the potential to reshape the corporate desktop landscape.
