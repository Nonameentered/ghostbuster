AOL CEO Cannot Estimate Financial Impact of Refund Plan for Customers Experiencing Problems 

AOL CEO Tim Armstrong announced today that the company will offer prorated refunds to customers who have experienced issues with AOL services in recent months but said he could not estimate the potential financial impact of the refund program.

In a call with investors, Armstrong said AOL's systems and infrastructure have faced "significant challenges" in recent months leading to service disruptions for some customers. As a result, AOL will offer customers credits and prorated refunds for the time periods their service was disrupted. However, Armstrong declined to estimate how much the refund program may cost the company. 

"We let some customers down with our service issues, and offering credits and refunds is the right thing to do to make things right," Armstrong said. "While it will have some financial impact, maintaining the trust and goodwill of our customers is our top priority."

AOL's systems have been plagued by several outages and service issues since October of last year impacting email, internet connectivity, and streaming services. The problems were linked to updates AOL made to its network infrastructure and software systems. Some customers reported dealing with issues for weeks before services were fully restored.

In the call, Armstrong reiterated that the company has solved the underlying issues that caused the outages and service disruptions. He said AOL is also investing in additional monitoring and testing systems to avoid similar issues going forward. However, the refund program shows AOL is still working to recover customer goodwill after the problems.

AOL reported first quarter revenue of $3.4 billion today, falling short of analyst estimates of $3.5 billion. The company did not break out the financial implications of the refund program in its earnings results or forecasts. AOL shares declined over 4 percent on the news.

The refund program is the latest issue faced by AOL's internet business, which has struggled with declining subscribers and ad revenue in recent years. Armstrong has worked to transform AOL into a leader in digital media and advertising, but the company continues to rely on revenue from subscriptions and dial-up customers. AOL merged with Verizon in 2015 and now operates as a subsidiary of Verizon Communications.
