New York Threatens to Sue America Online for Deceptive Business Practices and False Advertising

The Attorney General of New York announced today that the state is preparing to file a lawsuit against America Online for engaging in deceptive business practices and false advertising. The lawsuit alleges that America Online misled customers about the slow speeds of its dial-up internet service and failed to properly inform customers that faster broadband connections were available from competitors.  

According to the Attorney General, America Online sales representatives routinely told new customers that its dial-up service provided fast internet speeds, enabling quick access to streaming media, large file downloads, and seamless web browsing. In reality, the average America Online customer experiences download speeds of just 56 kilobits per second—significantly slower than the speeds available through most broadband internet services. At those speeds, even basic tasks like loading webpages, checking email, and streaming low-quality audio can feel slow.

The impending lawsuit claims that America Online relied on deceptive advertising and misleading statements from its sales team to lock customers into long-term service contracts. By the time customers realized the service was too slow, they faced steep early termination fees to switch providers. “America Online duped thousands of New Yorkers into overpaying for an inferior internet service,” said the Attorney General in a statement. “When customers tried to cancel due to slow speeds, they were hit with unfair fees. This is a clear case of false advertising and deceptive business practices.”  

In response, an America Online spokesperson denied the allegations and suggested the lawsuit was without merit. "We clearly disclose expected dial-up speeds and terms of service to all our customers," said the spokesperson. "While some individuals may experience slower speeds during peak usage periods, we stand by our service and commitment to customer satisfaction." America Online argues that many long-time customers continue to prefer the convenience and low cost of dial-up internet over faster but often pricier alternatives like cable or fiber optic services.

If found liable, America Online could face civil penalties, restitution payments to affected customers, and court-ordered changes to its advertising and customer service practices. The lawsuit is expected to be filed within the next 30 days should settlement talks not progress. For many, the legal action highlights the archaic nature of America Online's core dial-up business in an age of ubiquitous high-speed broadband and wireless internet options. The once formidable internet giant and pioneer now faces an uncertain future.
