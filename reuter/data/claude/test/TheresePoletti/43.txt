IBM Announces Separation of $23 Billion Global Services Business to Fuel Growth and Job Creation  

In a strategic move aimed at accelerating growth and unlocking value, IBM today announced  it will separate its Global Services business into a new publicly traded company. The separation is expected to be tax-free for IBM shareholders and completed by the end of 2021.

The new company will have approximately $23 billion in revenue and global operations across 67 countries. It will be the world's leading provider of business transformation services, with deep expertise in strategic consulting, application and platform modernization, data frameworks, and cybersecurity. IBM will retain a minority stake in the new, independent services company.

"In many ways, today's announcement completes what we started last year—the strategic transformation of IBM to focus on hybrid cloud and AI," said Arvind Krishna, IBM chief executive officer. "IBM has deep financial strength and decades of services expertise. By spinning off our services business, we believe both companies will be well positioned to partner and compete more effectively, focus on their strategic priorities, and accelerate investments in innovation for higher value clients."

The separation will provide the services company with more flexibility and agility to design software and services tailored to specific industries. At the same time, IBM will further focus on its open hybrid cloud platform and artificial intelligence. Both companies will continue to collaborate on hybrid cloud, digital transformation and security.  

IBM Services has successfully operated as an independent business unit since IBM acquired PwC Consulting in 2002. Over the past two decades, the services organization has built deep industry expertise by developing integrated solutions and software tailored to the needs of companies and organizations globally. The new services company name will be determined at a later date.

“We have built a services organization that is unrivaled in the market today," said Martin Schroeter, Senior Vice President of IBM Global Markets, who will become CEO of the new services company. "As an independent organization, we will have greater flexibility to strengthen our partner ecosystem and accelerate our services strategy to provide even more value to our clients.”

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including Form 10 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, receipt of tax opinions, and approval by IBM's board of directors. The separation is targeted to be completed before the end of 2021.
