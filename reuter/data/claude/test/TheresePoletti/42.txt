Microsoft Rivals Collaborate on Network Computing Standards  

In a surprising move, Microsoft's biggest rivals in the cloud computing space announced they will work together to establish open standards for networking technologies. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and IBM said they have formed an alliance to define standards for networking equipment and connections between data centers and cloud networks. The goal is to make it easier for corporate customers to switch between different providers and use networking gear from multiple vendors.

The companies announced the new “Open Cloud Computing Interface” (OCCI) working group this morning. OCCI's mission will be to create standard ways for networking hardware and software from different companies to connect to and work with each other. This could make it less difficult for businesses to move data and applications between, say, AWS and Google Cloud. It may also give customers more flexibility in their choice of networking equipment since devices adhering to the standards would work across the major cloud platforms.  

"There is a clear need for networking standards in the cloud space to drive interoperability, flexibility and customer choice," said Arpit Joshipura, Vice President of Networking at Google Cloud. "By working together in the OCCI, AWS, Google Cloud and IBM hope to bring open standards to networking for clouds and provide customers with a seamless multi-cloud experience."

The three companies are archrivals in the cloud computing market, fiercely competing for customers and market share. However, they said they recognized that agreeing on networking standards was in the best interest of their customers. The standards will be developed and maintained by the new OCCI work group, with details around governance and intellectual property terms to be forthcoming. Other cloud and networking companies will be invited to join the group and contribute to shaping the new standards.

Some analysts see the announcement as a sign the major cloud providers are maturing and acknowledging customers want to avoid vendor lock-in. However, it remains to be seen how quickly and effectively these large competitors can actually work together to establish meaningful new open standards. The networking industry has struggled with long standardization processes in the past. But if successful, OCCI could be a pivotal moment for networking in the cloud era.
