AT&T to End Free Internet Access Offer to Long-Distance Customers 

AT&T announced today that it will discontinue its offer of free internet access to long-distance customers starting next month. The telecommunications giant has provided dial-up internet access at no additional charge for over 15 years to customers who subscribe to their long-distance phone service. However, with the decline of landline phones and long-distance calling, AT&T says the program is no longer sustainable.

The change will impact nearly 2 million Americans who still utilize AT&T's dial-up internet service. Customers will receive a letter in the next few days notifying them that starting on June 1, they will be charged $9.95 per month for the service if they wish to continue using it. AT&T is offering a 60% discount for the first six months as an incentive for customers to keep the service, after which standard rates will apply.

The move comes as AT&T shifts focus away from legacy landline technology to wireless networks and broadband services like fiber internet and 5G. The company has lost over 10 million landline customers in the last decade as more Americans disconnect home phones and rely solely on cellphones. Revenue from long-distance calling has also dropped by over 70% in that time.

However, the change will likely frustrate some long-time AT&T customers who depend on the free dial-up service, especially those in rural areas with limited broadband access options. Consumer advocacy groups argue that AT&T should continue providing basic internet service for low-income and disadvantaged groups. But AT&T says that given the declining use of and revenue from its long-distance phone and dial-up internet services, the program in its current form is no longer sustainable for the company. Existing long-distance phone service rates will remain unchanged. Customers who wish to discontinue either phone or internet service in light of this news may do so without early termination fees.
