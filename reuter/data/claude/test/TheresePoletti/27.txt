CompuServe CEO Resigns, Fueling Speculation of Financial Woes and Restructuring 

The chief executive of CompuServe, one of the largest internet service providers in the U.S. with over 2 million subscribers, abruptly resigned today after just 18 months on the job. The surprise move by CEO John Smith fueled speculation that the company may be facing significant financial difficulties and could undertake major restructuring.

In a statement, CompuServe said Smith resigned to "pursue other opportunities" but offered no further details on the reasons for his departure. Smith also did not respond to requests for comment. The company has appointed Chief Financial Officer Jane Doe as interim CEO while a search for a permanent replacement is conducted.

Smith's brief tenure as CEO was rocky, marked by slowing subscriber growth, increasing competition from broadband providers, and a falling stock price. CompuServe shares have declined nearly 50% over the last year as the company struggled to transition from dial-up internet service to faster broadband offerings. Revenue growth has also stalled over the last two quarters. 

"This seems a clear indication that the company and its board were not happy with the direction CompuServe was heading," said John Jackson, an analyst at TechTarget Advisors. "The dial-up business is disappearing, and CompuServe has had a hard time adapting. I expect major changes are coming to the company's strategy and possibly its core business model."

Some analysts speculated CompuServe could be acquired by a larger telecommunications or technology company or become a takeover target for a private equity firm. Others suggested the company may file for bankruptcy protection to restructure its business and debt obligations. CompuServe has over $2 billion in long-term debt, much of which is coming due over the next 2-3 years.

"CompuServe has to take drastic action to survive, whether that's a sale, bankruptcy, or massive internal restructuring," said Sam Smith, an analyst at 451 Research. "The CEO change is a sign the board wants to head in an entirely new direction."

In its statement, however, CompuServe's board expressed support for the company's current strategy but also acknowledged "the need to adapt to a changing marketplace." The company plans to update shareholders on its strategic plan during its next quarterly earnings call in three months.

Founded in 1979, CompuServe was once a dominant force in the early commercial internet service provider market. But it failed to successfully transition from dial-up service, and its market share was quickly gobbled up by broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon as well as discount ISPs. The resignation of its CEO is the latest setback for the once iconic internet company now fighting for survival.
