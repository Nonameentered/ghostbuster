IBM Shares Fall After Negative Comments and Predicted Earnings Hit 

Shares of International Business Machines Corp. fell 4.5% on Tuesday after an analyst downgraded the stock and predicted weaker-than-expected earnings for the tech giant.

IBM stock declined $6.20 to close at $131.92. The drop came after UBS analyst John Roy downgraded IBM to “sell” from “neutral” and lowered his price target to $120 from $140. In a note to clients, Roy said IBM faces major challenges in its efforts to transition to new, higher-growth business lines. He expects these struggles will be apparent in IBM's first-quarter earnings report next week.

Roy forecast IBM will report earnings of $2.25 per share, below the consensus estimate of $2.30. He predicts revenue will be flat, even as IBM tries to pivot toward more cloud computing and artificial intelligence offerings. “IBM's weak revenue growth is a reminder of the challenges facing a company trying to transform itself,” Roy wrote.

IBM has been trying to shift its focus to faster-growing segments like cloud, AI, and data analytics. But Roy said the company faces competition from more established players like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in the cloud market. IBM's legacy mainframe and IT services businesses have also been slowing for years.

Some analysts remain optimistic about IBM's prospects. “We continue to believe IBM's improving revenue trajectory, shift to higher-value growth segments, and strong cash generation remain underappreciated by most investors,” said Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral.

But shifting a company the size of IBM is challenging and will take time, as evidenced by the uneven quarterly results in recent years. If the UBS forecast proves accurate, it could raise more doubts about IBM's transformation game plan under CEO Ginni Rometty.

Rometty now faces increased pressure to show meaningful progress in IBM's strategic priorities like cloud and AI. The first-quarter earnings report next week will be closely watched to see if IBM can deliver numbers that surpass diminished market expectations and begin to turn around a stock that has lagged for years.
