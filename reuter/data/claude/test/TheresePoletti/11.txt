Wall Street's Affair with IBM in Jeopardy After Disappointing Fourth Quarter Earnings Report 

IBM's long-standing relationship with investors is on the rocks after the tech giant posted disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and provided weaker-than-expected guidance for 2020. IBM reported a profit of $3.67 per share, 4 cents below analysts' expectations, on revenue of $21.8 billion, which missed Wall Street's forecasts by nearly $1 billion. 

The results caught many on Wall Street by surprise. IBM shares plummeted by 7% in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement, a sign that investors were not prepared for such lackluster results. The share price decline wiped out nearly $12 billion in market value and marked the stock's biggest one-day drop since 2013.

"IBM clearly has some work to do to regain investor confidence," said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research. "The company needs to show improving revenue growth to re-rate shares higher."

Revenue from IBM's cloud computing business grew 21% in the quarter, a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy report. But the company's overall sales have now declined for five consecutive quarters as IBM struggles to transition to new technologies and shake a legacy of sluggish growth.  

Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has staked IBM's future on cloud computing and artificial intelligence. However, revenue from those promising new divisions has not offset declines in the company's traditional mainframe and IT services businesses. Rometty has directed more than $32 billion in acquisitions over the last decade, yet IBM continues to report stagnant or slowing growth.

In an interview, Rometty said she expects IBM's revenue growth to return to positive territory this year and reaffirmed the company's plan to spin off its IT infrastructure services unit. The planned spinoff would open a new chapter in IBM's 109-year history and allow the company to focus entirely on cloud computing and other growth areas. 

"We have been very transparent that 2019 would be an investment year, but we have built the foundation for sustained growth," Rometty said. She cited "strong acceptance" of IBM's new mainframe and gains in the company's software and consulting businesses as sources of optimism.

However, analysts voiced skepticism following IBM's muted 2020 outlook. The company projected full-year earnings of "at least" $13.35 per share, slightly below the $13.44 average estimate on Wall Street. Revenue growth is expected to be flat after adjusting for divested businesses and currency changes.
