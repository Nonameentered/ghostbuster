America Online Agrees to Give Refunds and Credits to Frustrated Customers  

America Online, the world's largest internet service provider, announced today that it will offer refunds and service credits to customers who have faced repeated problems accessing its service in recent months. The move is an effort to appease long-frustrated customers who have complained about frequent service outages, slow connections, and other technical problems.

"We have not lived up to our own high standards for service and reliability," said AOL CEO Tim Armstrong in a statement. "We sincerely apologize to our members for the difficulties they have experienced. To make things right, we will be offering account credits and refunds to members who have faced repeated or extended disruptions."

The problems began in October when AOL switched over systems in an effort to upgrade their technology infrastructure. But the transition ran into severe technical problems, and many AOL customers found themselves unable to log onto the service or access their email accounts. The issues have persisted in the months since, with multiple service outages of two hours or more in December and January. 

Customer frustration has been mounting, with many longtime AOL users reporting that they are abandoning the service for competitors. On AOL's own community forums, posters have vented their anger at the continuing problems. "I've been an AOL member for over 10 years but the horrible service disruptions lately have convinced me to finally say goodbye," wrote one user. "I'm switching to another provider that actually values my business and won't leave me disconnected for hours at a time."

In a further effort to address these issues, AOL said it would suspend plans to enroll new customers in AOL services over the next two months. The move will allow the company to focus its resources on existing customers and improve performance and reliability. The refunds and credits will be made available to members who have been "repeatedly impacted" by outages over multiple days. Members will receive details on how to request their refunds and credits within the next several days via email.

Analysts said the moves were necessary to stem further defections from AOL's dwindling number of dial-up customers. "AOL's service problems have been deeply damaging to their brand," said Kevin Ashton of Forrester Research. "They need to take dramatic steps to rebuild trust and confidence or risk entering a death spiral as a viable internet company." With its legacy dial-up business continuing to decline, AOL has bet heavily on becoming a provider of high-speed internet and online content, but further stumbles could significantly set back those ambitions.
