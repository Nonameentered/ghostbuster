New York State Attorney General Plans to Sue America Online Over Allegedly Deceptive Practices and Consumer Complaints 

New York State Attorney General Letitia James announced today that her office intends to file a lawsuit against Internet service provider America Online, Inc. (AOL) for alleged deceptive business practices and failing to resolve numerous consumer complaints. 

The lawsuit will accuse AOL of improperly enrolling customers in subscription plans without their consent, making it extremely difficult for people to cancel their subscriptions, and failing to issue refunds in a timely manner. “AOL has engaged in predatory practices to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of consumers,” Attorney General James said in a statement. “My office has received thousands of complaints, and AOL has not done enough to remedy issues and make their operations more transparent and fair.”

According to the Attorney General’s office, since the beginning of 2020, over 3,000 New York residents have filed complaints against AOL for improper billing practices, including being automatically enrolled in premium subscription plans they never signed up for. Victims describe being charged as much as $200 per month for services they did not request. When customers attempted to cancel and dispute the charges, they faced hold times of up to five hours and were given misleading information on how to stop the billing and obtain refunds, the lawsuit will allege.  

One consumer quoted in the lawsuit paperwork said, "AOL falsely told me the charges would be refunded and my account would be closed, but the very next month the charges recurred, and I faced the same horrible experience trying to resolve the issue again.” Another complainant likened dealing with AOL’s customer service to “a hamster wheel of agonizing frustration.”

In a statement, an AOL spokesperson denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight the lawsuit: “AOL provides high-quality internet services to millions of satisfied customers. We believe the Attorney General's claims against AOL are entirely without merit. We act lawfully and ethically in all of our customer interactions and subscriber practices. We will vigorously defend against these baseless allegations.”

The lawsuit seeks full restitution for victims, penalties, and an injunction forcing AOL to change its business practices. The Attorney General’s office is also launching a wider investigation into other major internet service providers to root out potentially harmful industry-wide billing and cancellation policies impacting consumers statewide.
