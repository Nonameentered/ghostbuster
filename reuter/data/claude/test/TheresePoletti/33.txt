America Online Signs Marketing Pact with Tel-Save for Access to 8 Million Subscribers and $100 Million in Cash 

America Online Inc. has signed a marketing agreement with Tel-Save Holdings Inc. that gives AOL access to Tel-Save's 8 million long-distance customers and provides AOL with $100 million in upfront cash.

The multiyear deal allows AOL to market a range of products and services to Tel-Save's customer base, which includes residential and business phone users. AOL can promote offerings such as its Internet service, branded credit cards, and merchandise. In exchange, Tel-Save receives a share of revenue from sales generated through cross-marketing to its client list.

The agreement highlights AOL's push to leverage its huge customer base by striking partnerships with companies in complementary industries. AOL, the world's largest online service, has been seeking new ways to boost advertising and e-commerce revenue to reduce its dependence on subscription fees from its 26 million members.

"This alliance provides a perfect example of how AOL's interactive services and Tel-Save's telecommunications products can be combined to benefit customers," said AOL President Bob Pittman. 

For Tel-Save, the AOL deal offers an opportunity to turn its customers into a new profit center by sharing in sales commissions. Under the agreement, Tel-Save will pass along names and contact details to AOL but will not disclose information about calling patterns or usage.  

"We have a very valuable asset in our large and loyal customer base, and this relationship with AOL is an excellent way to leverage that asset through a trusted partner," said Tel-Save CEO Brent Scowcroft.

The $100 million AOL will receive upfront represents prepayment for a portion of future commissions and provides AOL with cash that can be used for marketing, capital investment or other purposes. AOL said specific terms of the revenue-sharing arrangement were not disclosed.

The Tel-Save agreement extends AOL's recent streak of forging high-profile alliances and investments. Earlier this year, AOL teamed with Gateway computers, bought a stake in broadband service provider Road Runner, and announced a joint venture with financial-news network CNBC.

Through such pacts, AOL hopes to boost subscriber numbers, retain existing members, and generate new incomeâ€”thereby proving to investors that it has a strategy for growth beyond its maturing dial-up Internet business. The Tel-Save deal provides further evidence of that plan coming together.
