America Online's Refund Plan and Marketing Cuts Improve Near-Term Financial Results, Analysts Say 

America Online Inc. recently reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter, aided by a plan to offer refunds to departing customers and cuts in marketing spending. 

The Internet service provider said it earned $56 million, or 6 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30. In the year-ago period, AOL earned $20 million, or 2 cents a share. On average, analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expected earnings of 3 cents a share.

Revenue rose 17% to $1.84 billion from $1.57 billion. AOL said it ended the quarter with 19.6 million U.S. subscribers to its Internet access services, up from 17.6 million at the end of March.

AOL attributed its strong quarterly performance to a customer-retention promotion, reduced expenses and cost controls. The company changed its subscription plans earlier this year to offer refunds and reduced-rate deals for subscribers who wanted to cancel their accounts. The move was aimed at slowing customer losses in the face of intensifying competition from high-speed Internet alternatives like cable modems and DSL.

The retention program helped lower AOL's subscriber turnover, or "churn" rate. The churn rate was 2.1% for the June quarter compared with 2.3% in the March quarter and 2% a year earlier. The average monthly revenue per user was $21.86, up from $21.35 in the March quarter and $20.86 a year earlier.  

AOL also cut marketing spending in the quarter to $310 million from $390 million in the March quarter. The company said lower marketing costs and employee layoffs put expenses for the quarter below management's expectations. For the full fiscal year, marketing and promotional costs totaled $1.7 billion, down from $2 billion a year earlier.

Looking ahead, AOL said it expects revenue and earnings growth for the September quarter and the 2003 fiscal year. But the company warned that competition, the weak economy and investments in new products could slow future growth. AOL said it hopes to release a new version of its AOL service in early 2003 with enhanced broadband and interactive features.

Analysts said AOL's cost controls and customer-retention efforts should help boost results in the coming quarters, but many remain concerned about AOL's long-term outlook as more consumers switch to broadband Internet and as AOL's growth slows.   

"The short-term liquidity and numbers look good, but strategically the company still has some significant challenges," said David Joyce, an analyst at Guzman & Co. "The narrowband dial-up service is a maturing business."

Youssef Squali, an analyst at First Albany Corp., said AOL's earnings and reduced spending levels could continue for another one or two quarters. "After that, the company will have to reignite subscriber growth to meet its lofty growth targets," he said. "We believe this will prove very challenging."

AOL's shares rose 6.4% to $15.50 in 4 p.m. composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down nearly 50% over the past 12 months amid concerns about AOL's slowing growth and competitive threats.
