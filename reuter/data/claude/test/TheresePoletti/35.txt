JAMtv to Launch Personalized Music Network on the Internet with Intel Corp's Multimedia Technology 

JAMtv, an interactive internet music streaming service, announced today it will launch a new personalized music video network using multimedia technology developed by Intel Corporation. The new service, called JAMtv Pulse, will allow users to create custom music video channels based on their tastes and interests.

Using machine learning and recommendation algorithms, JAMtv Pulse will analyze users’ preferences and curate a 24-hour music video channel of short-form content tailored to each individual. The channels will feature music videos, live performances, backstage footage, and music documentaries. JAMtv has licensed music video content from all major music labels as well as independent artists and producers.

“We want to revolutionize the music entertainment experience by giving users their own personalized music video network,” said Sree Makam, founder and CEO of JAMtv. “By partnering with Intel, we are able to leverage their expertise in visual technologies, recommendation engines, and content delivery to create an immersive experience for music fans.”

JAMtv Pulse will be available on JAMtv's website and mobile apps. The service utilizes 4K-quality video encoding and playback technology optimized for the computer processing units (CPUs) and visual computing accelerators developed by Intel. JAMtv will incorporate Intel's OpenVINOTM computer vision toolkit and oneAPI Rendering Toolkit to analyze on-screen content and user behavior to determine preferences and make recommendations. 

“JAMtv Pulse is an innovative use of our visual computing, machine learning, and streaming media technologies,” said Ari Rauch, vice president and general manager of Intel's Visual Technologies group. “Music is a hugely popular entertainment form, and by delivering customized 4K music video content, this service can provide a uniquely engaging experience for music fans.”

The service is free to use but JAMtv Pulse will generate revenue through monthly subscriptions for additional features as well as advertising. JAMtv and Intel will share subscription and advertising revenue. JAMtv Pulse will initially launch in North America but the company aims to expand into Europe and Asia by next year.

JAMtv, founded in 2015, is an on-demand streaming music video service with licensing deals in place with Sony Music, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip company, has been expanding into more visual and graphics-focused technologies in recent years, including entering the discrete graphics card market to compete with NVIDIA and AMD.
