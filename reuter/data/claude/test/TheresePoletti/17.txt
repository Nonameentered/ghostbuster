New York Attorney General Threatens to Sue America Online Over Allegedly Deceptive Practices  

The New York Attorney General Letitia James announced today that her office has launched an investigation into America Online (AOL) over allegedly deceptive business practices related to the company’s “dial-up” internet service. In a strongly worded letter to AOL’s legal counsel, Attorney General James criticized the company for continuing to charge monthly fees to hundreds of thousands of customers who no longer use AOL’s dial-up service.  

“It is unacceptable and potentially illegal for AOL to continue charging customers monthly fees for a service they no longer use or need,” Attorney General James said in a statement. “My office will aggressively investigate AOL’s business practices to determine the scale of this alleged deception and seek refunds or other remedies for AOL customers as appropriate.”

According to Attorney General James, AOL has failed to adequately inform longtime customers that they are still being charged between $10 to $30 per month for dial-up internet service, even though most now have access to faster broadband internet through cable or phone companies. AOL’s dial-up service emerged in the 1990s but has since become largely obsolete due to the widespread availability of broadband internet. However, Attorney General James alleges that AOL has made it intentionally difficult for customers to cancel their dial-up service and continues to charge monthly fees because so many customers are unaware they are still AOL subscribers.  

In response, AOL denied any wrongdoing and said it has made significant efforts in recent years to alert customers about their subscription status and make cancellation of accounts easy. "AOL is committed to treating all our customers fairly and helping them best utilize our services to meet their needs," an AOL spokesperson said in a statement. AOL had over 3 million dial-up subscribers at its peak but now is estimated to have between 200,000 to 500,000 remaining dial-up customers, many of whom may no longer actively use the service.

If AOL does not take corrective actions, Attorney General James has threatened potential legal action against the company, including a lawsuit seeking damages, penalties and injunctions to force AOL to reform its business practices. The investigation into AOL’s dial-up service fees is ongoing, according to the Attorney General’s office.
