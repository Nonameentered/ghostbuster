IBM Reports Higher Fourth Quarter Profits But Disappointing Mainframe Sales and Restructuring Costs  

IBM beat Wall Street's earnings estimates for the fourth quarter but mainframe computer sales and restructuring costs disappointed investors. The technology giant reported fourth quarter net income of $2.69 billion, or $2.79 a share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $1.81 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding special items, IBM earned $3.67 a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $3.47 a share, according to FactSet.  

However, revenue fell 3% to $24.7 billion due to declining mainframe sales. IBM's systems unit, which includes mainframe computers and related software, saw revenue drop 32% to $1.69 billion. The mainframe product cycle is slowing down after a burst of sales from updated z14 systems released in 2017 and 2018. 

Mainframes remain an important source of revenue for IBM, especially from software and services tied to the systems. “The mainframe slowdown creates a pretty sizable hole in IBM's revenue and profit numbers that they now have to fill with growth in other areas like cloud computing and AI,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.

IBM has been working to shift its business to focus on cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other growth areas as sales of legacy products like mainframes have declined. The company has restructured and cut costs, spending $160 million in charges related to workforce reduction in the fourth quarter. For the full year, restructuring costs totaled $703 million.

The company provided guidance for 2019 that disappointed some investors. IBM expects operating earnings per share of at least $13.90, compared with $13.81 in 2018. Revenue is projected to be flat after currency fluctuations, marking another year of little to no top line growth. “IBM needs to show revenue growth for the story to get more positive. When there is zero to little revenue growth, it highlights the challenges the company faces,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri.

Mehta remained optimistic about IBM's strategy. "While IBM still has much work to do as it refocuses its business, 2018 was an important year of progress. IBM is managing its legacy businesses for stability, while investing to lead the next chapter of technology.” The company's shares fell 2.5% in after-market trading following the earnings announcement. Overall, Big Blue seems to be making progress on transitioning to cloud and AI, but still has some obstacles to overcome related to slowing mainframe sales and restructuring its legacy business.
