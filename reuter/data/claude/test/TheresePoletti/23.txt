America Online Agrees to Issue Refunds and Credit to Frustrated Customers and Halt Advertising Amid Threat of Lawsuit 

America Online Inc. announced today that it will issue refunds, account credits and halt promotional advertising for the next month to appease customers frustrated with connectivity and access problems. The embattled Internet service provider made the announcement amid growing customer complaints over the inability to log on, stay connected, and access email during peak evening and weekend hours since the start of the year.  

AOL has seen a higher than usual surge in new subscribers and usage in January but has struggled to scale its network capacity to meet the demand. According to sources close to the company, almost 2 million new subscribers have signed up for AOL service since December 25th, straining the company's network capabilities. AOL has faced a barrage of criticism on social media over connectivity issues, long wait times for customer service, and interruptions accessing services like email, instant messaging, and streaming media.

In a statement released this morning, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong apologized to customers and pledged to issue account credits for one month of service to all subscribers and halt all television, radio, print and digital advertising for the next 30 days. "We clearly failed to meet the expectations of new and long-standing AOL members this month and fell short in ensuring a quality experience accessing our services during peak periods. We sincerely apologize and are taking immediate steps to remedy the situation including providing free service for one month and pausing all paid advertising while we further upgrade our network capacity." 

The announcement comes just as several state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission began investigating numerous complaints filed by AOL subscribers. The attorneys general suggested they may pursue legal action against AOL for deceptive business practices and false advertising if major improvements were not made quickly to rectify network performance issues and customer service problems. One source said AOL moved swiftly to avoid potential lawsuits and further damage to its reputation by instituting the refunds, credits and advertising hiatus.

AOL expects the network and performance issues to be resolved over the next 4 to 6 weeks as additional capacity is added. The company also pledged to improve training for live chat and phone support staff to handle increased call and message volumes. AOL ended Tuesday with 22.2 million subscribers, down from 25 million at its peak in the early 2000s before the rise of broadband internet access and the demise of dial-up modems.
