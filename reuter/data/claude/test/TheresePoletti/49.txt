IBM Stock Plummets Due to Fears Over First Quarter Earnings

Investors dealt a blow to IBM's stock price today amid concerns that the technology giant may report weaker than expected earnings for the first quarter of the year. IBM's shares fell as much as 8% in intraday trading, representing the stock's biggest one-day drop since April 2019. 

The selloff comes ahead of IBM's first quarter earnings report scheduled for release after markets close on Thursday. Analysts expect IBM to report earnings per share of $1.67, a decline of nearly 19% from the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue is projected to fall to $17.7 billion, down 3% from last year.

The pessimistic projections reflect the challenges IBM faces as it reinvents itself in the era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The 109-year-old company built its reputation selling mainframe computers and software, but those legacy products are declining as cloud services and AI solutions grab a greater share of enterprise technology budgets. 

IBM has staked its future on hybrid cloud platforms and AI software, but those businesses have yet to offset the losses from its traditional operations. IBM's revenue has declined for four consecutive years, and another drop in the first quarter could erode investor confidence in the company's turnaround efforts.

"IBM faces doubts about its long-term prospects as growth in modern offerings fail to compensate for declines in traditional businesses," CFRA analyst David Holt wrote in a research note. "A weak Q1 that confirms mounting pressures could increase concerns."

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, who took over leadership of the company in April 2020, has launched initiatives to accelerate growth of IBM's hybrid cloud and AI software divisions. Last year, IBM acquired several companies to boost its capabilities in areas such as cloud services, AI governance and edge computing. 

However, IBM may need more time for those strategic moves to impact its financial results. Much will depend on how the first quarter report is received by investors. If earnings and revenue significantly exceed the forecasts, it could reassure Wall Street that Krishna's strategy is taking hold. But another quarter of lackluster results may lead to speculation about whether more drastic changes at IBM are necessary to turn things around.

Krishna is expected to address these concerns during IBM's earnings call on Thursday evening. How analysts and investors react to the company's first quarter report and Krishna's outlook for the rest of the year may determine if IBM stock can quickly rebound from Tuesday's drastic sell-off. With so much uncertainty swirling around IBM's future, the stakes for its latest earnings report have arguably never been higher.
