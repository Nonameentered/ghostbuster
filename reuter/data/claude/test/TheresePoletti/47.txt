America Online in talks to acquire CompuServe Corp to boost network and corporate presence  

America Online, Inc. (AOL) is in advanced discussions to acquire CompuServe Corporation, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, if consummated, would significantly strengthen AOL's position as the world's largest online service provider and give it an even bigger footprint in the corporate and business services market.  

CompuServe, founded in 1969, is one of the oldest online service providers and still has over 2.6 million subscribers. However, it has struggled in recent years to keep up with fast-growing rivals AOL and the Microsoft Network. An acquisition by AOL would alleviate CompuServe's competitive pressures and propel its business services unit, which provides network connectivity and email services to over 400,000 businesses.  

For AOL, buying CompuServe would boost its total subscriber base to over 20 million members combined, strengthen its network infrastructure, and enhance its suite of offerings for business customers. AOL has been pushing to grow its corporate services business to complement its large base of consumer subscribers. CompuServe's business services division and network could help accelerate AOL's goal of becoming a one-stop shop for businesses' connectivity and online needs.  

According to sources, AOL and CompuServe are discussing an all-stock deal that would value CompuServe at between $250 to $300 million. CompuServe's business services unit and network infrastructure are seen as particularly valuable to AOL, so a deal could likely be announced within a month if negotiations are successful. Regulatory approval is not expected to pose significant issues given the relatively small market shares of the two companies.

Any deal would come on the heels of AOL's recent acquisitions of Mirabilis, the maker of instant messaging service ICQ, and Red Hat, a distributor of the open-source Linux operating system. These deals have helped round out AOL's service offerings and given it access to technologies to enhance its business services. CompuServe would represent AOL's largest acquisition to date and a bold move to accelerate its growth with business clients.

Neither AOL nor CompuServe would comment on rumors about a potential acquisition. But analysts say a combination could benefit both companies and give AOL another avenue for reaching business customers, who on average spend more on monthly services than typical consumers. At a time of consolidation in the internet services industry, a marriage of these early online brands might just be a natural step that helps ensure their survival into the next century.
