AOL and Tel-Save Strike $100 Million Marketing Deal, Offering Lower-Cost Long-Distance Service to AOL Members 

AOL and Tel-Save, a major long-distance carrier, announced a five-year $100 million marketing and promotional agreement today that will provide discounted long-distance service to AOL's more than 30 million members. The deal is a coup for Tel-Save, allowing the company to gain access to AOL's huge customer base, while providing a new benefit for AOL members.

Under the agreement, Tel-Save's long-distance rates of 5 cents per minute or less for interstate calls will be exclusively available to AOL members. The companies said member response would determine whether the lower Tel-Save rates would become a permanent part of the AOL service. AOL members who switch their long-distance service to Tel-Save will receive additional incentives, like 30 free minutes of night and weekend calling each month.

“This is a win-win for AOL members and for Tel-Save,” said AOL Chairman and CEO Steve Case. “We are always looking for ways to provide more value to our members, and discounted long-distance service is something many members have asked for. Tel-Save is an innovative company in the telecommunications space, and we're excited to partner with them.” 

The deal is part of AOL's broader strategy to provide a bundled set of services and offerings to its members beyond Internet access and content. AOL has recently launched initiatives with DirectTV, Motif Investing, and other companies to provide AOL members with discounts and special offers. The Tel-Save agreement is the largest such partnership to date.

For Tel-Save, the opportunity to access AOL's vast membership and marketing channels is a major coup. “Gaining direct access to AOL's millions of members through their service is a tremendous opportunity for our company,” said Tel-Save CEO William J. Esrey. “It allows us to substantially expand our customer base rapidly and gain valuable insights into how to best serve AOL customers.” As part of the deal, Tel-Save will also become a premier sponsor of key AOL properties like welcome pages, mail, and messaging services.

The agreement shows AOL's power in striking deals that leverage its huge membership base. Partners are clearly eager to tap into AOL's unparalleled reach, allowing AOL to drive hard bargains. For members, the result is access to more services, discounts and special offers, at no additional cost. AOL remains focused on using creative partnerships to add value for members and enhance the overall AOL experience.
