IBM Global Services Becomes Separate Group With Plans for Thousands of New Employees  

IBM announced today that it is establishing its Global Services division as a separate business unit in a move that reflects the growing importance of technology consulting and outsourcing services. The new division will have more autonomy to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes. IBM Global Services is IBM's largest division, with over 190,000 employees and $66 billion in revenue last year, accounting for more than half of the company's total sales.

As part of the reorganization, IBM Global Services will hire up to 20,000 new employees over the next five years, focusing primarily on recruiting workers with skills in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and blockchain technologies. The company sees strong demand for services in those cutting-edge areas, especially from large corporate clients. “Our clients are telling us they need our help to take advantage of disruptive new technologies that enable digital and cognitive transformation,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

The new Global Services business will be led by Martin Schroeter, who formerly served as IBM’s chief financial officer. Mr. Schroeter has been with IBM for more than 30 years in a variety of leadership roles. As part of the leadership change, James Kavanaugh will replace Mr. Schroeter as IBM’s senior vice president and chief financial officer.

Wall Street analysts praised IBM’s move to elevate its services arm, noting that it accounts for the majority of the company’s revenue and profit. “IBM’s service capabilities remain the foundation of the firm’s competitive advantage and growth engine,” said Katy Huberty, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. The increased autonomy could help IBM make acquisitions more nimbly to fill in gaps, she said.  

However, some analysts cautioned that the rosy hiring plans could face challenges in a tight labor market. Competition for top tech talent is fierce, and other big companies are also expanding their workforces in fast-growing fields like cloud computing and AI. If IBM fails to recruit enough new employees for Global Services, it may not hit the ambitious revenue and profit targets that Rometty has set for the coming years. The company’s share price rose 2.3 percent on the news, indicating investors have some optimism but also some unanswered questions about the reorganization and IBM’s bold plans for its services arm.
