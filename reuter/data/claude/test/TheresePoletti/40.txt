Former NBC Executive Brandon Tartikoff Named Chairman of America Online's Greenhouse Networks; Company Buys LightSpeed Media to Develop Interactive Entertainment Network  

America Online Inc. today named former NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff as chairman and chief executive officer of Greenhouse Networks, AOL's new interactive entertainment division. Tartikoff, who helped turn NBC into the ratings leader during the 1980s, has been tasked with developing an interactive entertainment network for AOL that features original programming, games, and multimedia content.

AOL also announced the acquisition of LightSpeed Media Inc., an interactive content developer, to provide programming for the new network. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed. The moves are aimed at boosting AOL's media and entertainment offerings as it faces intensifying competition from other Internet companies and traditional media groups.

"Brandon is a visionary who helped transform the entertainment industry during his tenure at NBC, and we believe he has the experience and creativity to do the same for interactive entertainment," said AOL CEO Steve Case. "Combined with LightSpeed Media's expertise, Greenhouse Networks will enable us to provide AOL members with compelling interactive shows, games, music and other content developed specifically for the online world."

Tartikoff said he looks forward to working with creative talent to develop innovative entertainment and interactive experiences for the growing online audience. During his time as head of NBC Entertainment from 1981 to 1991, Tartikoff helped the network launch hit shows such as "The Cosby Show," "Miami Vice," "Cheers," and "Seinfeld."  LightSpeed Media, founded in 1994, has created interactive content based on brands like "Star Trek," "The X-Files," and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

"The Internet provides infinite creative possibilities for interactive storytelling and dynamic user experiences," said Tartikoff. Greenhouse Networks plans to launch its first original programs and games later this year. The new division also will work with Hollywood studios, video game makers, and other media companies to adapt television shows, movies, and popular characters for the interactive network.

AOL said the Greenhouse Networks and LightSpeed Media deals are part of its strategy to attract and retain customers by offering exclusive Internet-only content and community features. Last month, AOL announced plans to acquire Time Warner Inc. for $165 billion, a move that will give America Online control over popular media brands that could also fuel the growth of Greenhouse Networks.
