Progressive Networks Launches RealVideo: Major Entertainment and Media Companies Pledge Support

Progressive Networks today announced the launch of RealVideo, a new video streaming technology that allows people to view full-screen, full-motion video over the Internet in real time. RealVideo delivers video at speeds of up to 30 frames per second, providing a viewing experience comparable to television.

At the RealVideo launch event, Progressive Networks unveiled partnerships with many of the leading entertainment and media companies. Support for RealVideo was announced by ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, Warner Bros., Disney, Sony, and Paramount. These companies pledged to make video clips, trailers, and other short-form content from their libraries available for streaming on RealVideo.

“RealVideo brings true video streaming to the mainstream,” said Rob Glaser, CEO of Progressive Networks. “Until now, Internet video has been jerky, postage-stamp sized, and disappointing. RealVideo changes all that and delivers a TV-like experience over the Internet. We’re excited to partner with America’s leading entertainment and media companies to make their content available to consumers via RealVideo,” Glaser added.

ABC, NBC, and Fox said they plan to use RealVideo to stream episodes of certain TV shows on their websites the day after they air. Warner Bros. and Disney said they will make movie trailers and behind-the-scenes footage available via RealVideo. And Sony and Paramount announced initiatives to dig into their archival libraries and make classic TV shows and movies from the 70s, 80s, and 90s available for streaming on their websites and third-party entertainment sites. 

“This is a watershed moment for Internet video,” said Richard Gelfond, CEO of Warner Bros. “With RealVideo, we can finally deliver a high-quality viewing experience that does justice to our content. That opens up so many opportunities to provide consumers with content they’ve never been able to access before and to generate new revenue streams for our company.”

To view RealVideo content, consumers need to download Progressive Networks’ free RealPlayer software. RealPlayer is already installed on over 100 million computers worldwide. In addition to the major media companies, Progressive Networks said over 300 other content partners, including ESPN, Rolling Stone, and Discovery Channel, have pledged to make video clips and other short-form content available via RealVideo.
