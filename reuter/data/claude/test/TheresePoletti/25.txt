America Online Inc. Stock Falls After Bigger-Than-Expected Q2 Loss and Analyst Downgrades  

Shares of America Online Inc. fell more than 12% in midday trading today after the company reported a bigger-than-expected loss for its fiscal second quarter and several analysts cut their ratings and estimates for the internet veteran.

AOL said its quarterly loss widened to $92.8 million, or 9 cents a share, from a loss of $4.9 million, or less than 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 3 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call. Revenue declined 8% to $1.75 billion.

The quarterly results continue a troubling trend for AOL, which has struggled in recent years as consumers have shifted their internet usage away from proprietary online services and towards the open web. AOL's dial-up internet access business has been declining for years and the company has yet to find a successful replacement strategy, despite attempts to build an advertising-supported online portal and push into broadband and video services.

"We are clearly disappointed in our second quarter financial results," said Tim Armstrong, AOL's chairman and chief executive officer. "The company continues to operate in a challenging environment as we transition to new products and services."

In a research note, UBS analyst Benjamin Schachter cut his rating on AOL's stock to "neutral" from "buy" and slashed his price target to $22 from $25. "The turnaround continues to take longer than expected and visibility into a meaningful recovery remains limited," Schachter wrote. 

 Similarly, Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson also downgraded AOL and said its declining revenue and "deteriorating" profitability suggests the internet company's troubles are "more problematic" than just industry headwinds. Olson expects AOL's struggles to persist through the rest of this year and into next.

AOL's shares fell $2.47, or 12.3%, to $17.63 in midday trading. The stock has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months, vastly underperforming the broader market. 

The weak quarterly results and analyst downgrades suggest AOL faces an uphill battle in its turnaround efforts. Armstrong has worked for years to transform AOL from its roots as an internet service provider into a digital media and advertising powerhouse, but has made little progress. Until the company can reignite revenue growth, AOL's stock may remain under pressure.
