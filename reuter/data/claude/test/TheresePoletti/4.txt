America Online Hit With Multiple Lawsuits and State Attorney Discussions Over Network Access Issues 

America Online (AOL), one of the largest internet service providers in the United States with over 2.5 million subscribers, is facing legal challenges  over network connectivity problems that have intermittently prevented many customers from accessing the internet over the past two weeks.

A series of class-action lawsuits have been filed against AOL alleging that network outages and connectivity issues have caused frustration and economic hardship. One lawsuit claims that a small business owner was unable to conduct credit card transactions and lost revenue as a result of not having internet access for nearly three full business days. A second lawsuit alleges that a telecommuting employee was fired from their job after missing multiple days of work due to not being able to log into the company's remote network.  

In addition to the lawsuits, several state attorneys general have initiated discussions with AOL executives over the network problems. The attorneys general argue that AOL has failed to deliver the high-speed internet access and service that customers pay a monthly subscription fee for. Some are threatening to take further legal action against AOL if the network problems are not resolved and if the company does not provide customers with credit or refunds for the time they have lacked access.

AOL has acknowledged the network problems in statements to customers and the media, apologizing for the ongoing issues. The company says it recently implemented a network infrastructure upgrade that has “not gone as smoothly as planned.” AOL claims its network engineers have been working around the clock to resolve all connectivity issues and get customers back online, but did not specify when full access may be restored. The issues do not appear to stem from a cyberattack or security breach, according to AOL. 

The legal threats and customer anger over lack of network access cast a shadow over AOL's parent company, Verizon Communications, which acquired AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion. Verizon also owns Yahoo, which it purchased in 2017. A long-lasting resolution to AOL's network problems and improving customer satisfaction will be important for Verizon as it works to grow its digital media and internet brands.
