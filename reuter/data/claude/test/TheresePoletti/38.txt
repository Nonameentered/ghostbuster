Former NBC Exec Brandon Tartikoff Named Chairman of Greenhouse Networks, America Online's Original Content Developer, in Major Initiative to Create Specialized Online Networks, Stock Soars  

In a major step in America Online's strategy to develop original content for the Internet, the company named veteran television executive Brandon Tartikoff as chairman of Greenhouse Networks, its New York-based original programming division. The appointment of the former NBC programming chief is aimed at helping America Online create specialized networks across a variety of online content areas.

Tartikoff, 54, is best known for reviving NBC's prime-time lineup during the 1980s with shows like “Hill Street Blues,” “L.A. Law” and “Miami Vice.” As president of NBC Entertainment from 1980 to 1991, he helped establish the network as the ratings leader for the decade and as the standard-bearer of quality TV programming. Since leaving NBC, Tartikoff has worked as an independent producer, helping launch shows like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”

The move is a bold step by America Online to commission and produce its own movies, TV shows, talk shows and sporting events for distribution over the Internet. Rather than relying solely on licensing content from existing media companies, the online service plans to build multiple, targeted networks in niches like comedy, mystery, teen, and extreme sports. 

“We created Greenhouse Networks to develop original programming by and for online audiences,” said America Online CEO Steve Case. “Brandon has a proven record of building successful entertainment brands and programming for mass audiences. He is the ideal person to lead our ambitious content plans for the interactive future.”

Tartikoff will oversee programming, development, and marketing for the Greenhouse Networks division. He will commission new shows and acquire the rights to existing programs that can serve as anchor content for the new networks. The first of the niche networks could launch within the next 9-12 months, according to America Online.
