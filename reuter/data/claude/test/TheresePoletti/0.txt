Computer Makers Expected to Report Strong Q4 Earnings Despite Stronger Dollar Impact

Major computer makers are poised to report solid earnings and revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2019, despite some headwinds from a stronger US dollar. According to analysts, strong demand for PCs, laptops, and other devices will likely outweigh any currency impacts.

Tech giants like IBM, Dell, HP, and Lenovo are expected to post year-over-year revenue increases between 3 to 5% for the quarter ending December 31. While a portion of the growth stems from seasonal holiday shopping, analysts note the computer hardware market has seen an upswing in the past year due to businesses replacing aging machines and more people working and attending school remotely. 

However, the recent rise of the US dollar could pose challenges for companies that sell a large portion of products overseas. When the dollar strengthens, it makes US-made goods more expensive for foreign buyers. According to researchers, nearly 65% of the global PC market is outside the United States. As a result, companies like HP and Dell that generate over half their sales internationally may see dollar impacts of up to 3% on earnings.

To offset currency headwinds, the largest tech companies have been expanding in growing markets like Asia and Latin America. They have also begun spreading production to countries with currencies pegged to the US dollar. By diversifying into new geographies and gaining production efficiencies, these firms have been able to partially neutralize the effects of exchange rates swings.

While the dollar rose nearly 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, most analysts expect solid demand and stable component prices will help computer makers achieve their earnings targets. Barring any unforeseen economic impacts, the long term trend of digital transformation and tech modernization points to continued growth for the global computer hardware market in 2020. Overall, despite some currency-related obstacles, the leading tech companies are on track to post another profitable quarter to wrap up 2019.
