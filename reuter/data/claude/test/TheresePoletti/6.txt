IBM Expected to Report Solid Q4 Earnings, Despite Negative Currency Impact 

International Business Machines Corp. is expected to report its fourth quarter 2019 earnings results after the bell today. According to analysts, Big Blue is projected to post solid earnings growth despite some headwinds from negative currency fluctuations.

IBM is likely to report Q4 revenue of $21.64 billion, representing 2% year-over-year growth, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share are forecast to come in at $4.69, up 5% from the same quarter last year. While modest, this would mark IBM's first quarter of revenue growth in over a year, suggesting the company's strategic shift into higher-margin businesses like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity may be starting to pay off.  

However, IBM's results are expected to be negatively impacted by $500 million due to the strong U.S. dollar. Over 60% of IBM's revenue comes from international markets, making it particularly exposed to currency volatility. The company has taken steps to hedge against major currency swings, but sustained strength in the dollar may start to weigh on growth, some analysts warn.

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has staked her legacy on returning the company to sustainable growth by focusing on "high-value" segments of the IT industry.  Under Rometty's leadership, IBM has made major investments in cloud, AI, blockchain, and other technologies that provide substantial growth opportunities. Revenue from these "strategic imperatives" now makes up over 50% of IBM's total revenue and is growing rapidly. 

Still, skeptics argue IBM has been too slow to shift away from legacy businesses like IT infrastructure services, and faces significant threats from major competitors like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in the cloud market.  IBM's Q4 results and 2020 guidance will provide important clues as to whether the company's transformation strategy is gaining momentum or needs reworking. Investors will be watching closely for signs of progress in IBM's new business areas, as the company seeks to reestablish itself as an innovative leader in enterprise technology.
