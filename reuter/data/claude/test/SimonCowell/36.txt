Scottish Amicable defends multi-million pound fees for Prudential takeover advisers 

Scottish Amicable, the UK insurance and investment group, has defended the multi-million pound fees it paid to advisers for its recent £7 billion takeover by Prudential. The mutual insurer faced criticism over the £27 million bill for investment bankers, lawyers and PR advisers who worked on the deal.

The fees were revealed in Scottish Amicable’s annual report published today. The group paid £18 million to investment banks Rothschild and Morgan Stanley for broking the deal. Legal advisers Freshfields and Clifford Chance received a combined £5.6 million, with public relations firm Brunswick earning £3.4 million for handling communications around the takeover.

The advisers’ fees amounted to 0.4% of the total deal value, which Scottish Amicable said was “significantly below the market rate” for a transaction of this size and complexity. However, critics argue customers will ultimately pay for the advisers in higher premiums and charges. 

Calum Wilson, chief executive of Scottish Amicable, said: “Our members’ interests have been at the heart of this transaction throughout. The deal with Prudential secures the long term future of Scottish Amicable and provides an attractive financial package and continuity of service for our members and customers.”

Prudential was advised by UBS, JP Morgan Cazenove and Deutsche Bank, as well as law firms Slaughter & May and Herbert Smith. Their total fees have not been disclosed but are also likely to run into tens of millions of pounds, based on rates for similar sized deals. Advisers often charge higher fees for insurance takeovers due to their complexity.

The sale of Scottish Amicable to Prudential secured an initial £300 million special distribution to its 1.2 million members, with ongoing annual distributions now linked to Prudential’s performance. Prudential also committed to keeping Scottish Amicable’s Edinburgh headquarters and brand, preserving its mutual ethos.

However, critics argue members have lost control of their business and the long term benefits of remaining independent. A policyholder group had campaigned for Scottish Amicable to remain mutual and accused its board of pursuing a “flawed process” aimed at a quick sale. Prudential is listed on the London Stock Exchange and aims to generate returns for public shareholders as well as customers.

The purchase of Scottish Amicable has reinforced Prudential’s position as the largest insurer in the UK, further dominating a sector that regulators are already investigating over competition concerns. Questions will continue to be asked about the incentives for executives and advisers in insurance takeovers and whether policyholders’ interests are truly being served by such deals. However, Scottish Amicable remains adamant that securing its future through a tie-up with a larger, financial stable company was in the best long term interests of its members.
