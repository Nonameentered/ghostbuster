Lloyd's of London uncertain of its place in new regulatory system 

The venerable Lloyd's of London insurance market is facing uncertainty over its role within the UK's new post-Brexit regulatory system for financial services. Lloyd's currently operates as an integral part of the regulatory regime overseen by the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). However, as the UK leaves the European Union, the PRA and FCA will gain new independence and powers. It is unclear where this leaves Lloyd's special status.

For over 300 years, Lloyd's has provided insurance for specialist and complex risks through a marketplace that bring together underwriting syndicates and brokers. This marketplace is overseen by the Council of Lloyd's, which is in turn regulated by the PRA and FCA. This cozy relationship has allowed Lloyd's to flourish as a hub for insuring everything from oil rigs to footballers’ legs. 

The UK government wants to maintain London's status as a leading financial center after Brexit. However, some industry voices worry that new rules from the PRA and FCA may inadvertently sideline Lloyd's. If the regulators focus too narrowly on mainstream retail and commercial banks and insurers, Lloyd's unique qualities may not be fully understood and catered for. 

There are calls for Lloyd’s to be given formal recognition in post-Brexit legislation as a distinct and vital part of the UK insurance sector. The marketplace's special global status and centuries of experience in complex risk also need to be accounted for. Simply put, Lloyd's cannot be regulated like any other insurance company.

The coming months will be crucial as the government finalizes its regulatory agenda and approach to financial services. Lloyd's leaders are lobbying hard to ensure Lloyd's will continue to work within a bespoke regulatory system that recognizes its singular features, while also giving it flexibility to innovate. Both sides want to see Lloyd's thrive, but getting the details right will be key. If Lloyd's suffers from ill-fitting rules, London's status as an insurance hub could be damaged just as new trade deals are being sought.

After over three centuries at the heart of the London market, Lloyd's is not about to fade away. But its future success will depend on how it adapts to life outside the EU. A regulatory regime designed with its uniqueness in mind will be essential. The coming Brexit reforms will show how much the value of history and tradition are really worth in today's fast-changing world. Lloyd's needs specific treatment, not for sentimental reasons but to safeguard its economic importance. The government's challenge is to provide a bespoke system that does just that.
