Norwich Union Increases Members' Offer in Flotation to £1.2 Billion ($2 Billion) Amidst Strong Demand

Norwich Union, the UK's largest insurance group, has increased the number of shares it will sell to members of the public in its stock market flotation to meet strong demand. 

The insurer said it would increase the offer size by 20% from the planned £1 billion to £1.2 billion, allowing more members and customers to buy shares. Members and customers received share application forms last week with a deadline to apply by Friday. However, Norwich Union has now extended the deadline to Monday due to the high number of applications received so far.

The flotation is set to be one of the biggest in London this year. Norwich Union provides insurance for one in every four households in the UK, with over 13 million customers. The group consists of 13 subsidiary insurance companies, including Norwich Union, Halifax General Insurance, Aviva and General Accident.

Norwich Union's chief executive, Philip Moore, said: "We have received an excellent response to our flotation and are delighted to be able to offer more of our members and customers the opportunity to become shareholders in Norwich Union. The high level of demand reflects the strength of our brand and customer franchise."

The shares in Norwich Union will start trading next week in London. The price range for the shares has been set at 190p to 245p, which would value the insurance group between £4.7 billion and £6.1 billion. Analysts expect the shares to be oversubscribed at the top of the range given the demand. Norwich Union members and customers who apply for up to 2,000 shares will receive priority in the allocation.

The flotation comes after demutualization where Norwich Union changed its legal status from a mutual society owned by its members to a public limited company owned by shareholders. Demutualization will enable Norwich Union to access new sources of capital to fund growth and acquisitions in a consolidating insurance market. The shares are due to start trading March 13, subject to market conditions.
