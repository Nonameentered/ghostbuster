Norwich Union Public Shares Priced at Top End Following High Demand 

Norwich Union, the UK's largest insurer, priced its shares at the top end of the expected range today due to strong investor demand. The shares were priced at 275 pence, valuing the company at around £5.7 billion.

The initial public offering (IPO) is one of the biggest in London this year and shows that investor appetite remains healthy for major listings despite market turbulence in recent months. Norwich Union received orders worth more than £17 billion from institutional investors, far outstripping the number of shares on offer.

The strong demand allowed Norwich Union and its advisers to price the shares at the top end of the previously announced range of between 260 pence and 275 pence. At the offer price, the IPO will raise £1.6 billion for Aviva, Norwich Union's parent company, and around £500 million for the selling shareholders.

Aviva will retain a 70% stake in Norwich Union following the IPO. The strong level of demand means Aviva was able to sell a larger than expected 25% stake in the company while still achieving its target valuation. The offering was subscribed many times over, in a sign of the attractiveness of Norwich Union to investors.

The flotation is set to be London's biggest IPO so far this year and one of the largest in Europe. It caps a resurgence of listings on the London Stock Exchange since the summer following a subdued first half of the year. The strong demand for the Norwich Union offering will boost sentiment around equity markets during a volatile period.

Norwich Union is a household name in the UK insurance market, employing over 18,000 people. It offers motor, home, travel and pet insurance to over 15 million customers. Despite its long history, Norwich Union converted into a public limited company only in preparation for today's listing. 

The company is targeting continued growth, especially in pet insurance and travel cover. It aims to expand into new products and markets, including Asia. The capital raised through the IPO will provide additional financial firepower to fund this expansion strategy, both organically and through acquisitions.

The offer period for retail investors opens tomorrow and closes on 28th October, with dealings expected to begin on 1st November. The shares will be traded on the London Stock Exchange's main market under the ticker "NU". All eyes will be on how the newly listed Norwich Union stock performs in its first days of public trading amid an uncertain wider market.
