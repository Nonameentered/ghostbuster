General Accident Plc reports record Q1 profits despite disappointing net asset value

General Accident Plc, one of the UK's leading insurance companies, reported record profits for the first quarter of the year despite a fall in net asset value.

The company posted profits after tax of £483 million for the three months to March, up 12% from £431 million in the same period last year. General Accident benefited from a strong performance in its motor and home insurance divisions, as well as investment returns from its £65 billion portfolio. However, its net asset value per share declined 3% to 483 pence due to widening credit spreads. 

The robust profits were driven by a 6% increase in premiums written to £3.7 billion. General Accident raised prices across its home and motor portfolios in response to higher claims inflation. It also benefited from growth in customer numbers, with over 2 million new policies sold in the first quarter. The combined ratio, which measures claims and expenses as a proportion of premiums, improved to 93.1% from 95.2% a year earlier.

Mark Peters, Chief Executive of General Accident, commented: “I’m delighted with our excellent start to the year. We have delivered a record quarter thanks to disciplined underwriting, strong cost control and solid investment returns. Although credit spreads impacted our net asset value, the strength of our core insurance operations means we are well placed to meet our targets for the full year.”

The results will provide some relief for investors after General Accident's shares fell 14% over the last year due to concerns over slowing economic growth and competitive pressures. Rivals such as RSA Insurance Group and Direct Line Group have also struggled, with their shares down by a fifth and a quarter respectively. General Accident did not announce an interim dividend, in line with its policy of a final dividend only.

Analysts welcomed the strong profits but noted the fall in net asset value. “The top line and combined ratio show General Accident is executing well operationally, but the decline in net asset value highlights the challenges from the investment environment," said James Hamilton, an insurance analyst at Citi. "With shares trading at a 25% discount to book value, the results provide support, but growth in net asset value and returns to shareholders will be key for a re-rating."

General Accident shares rose 3.2% in early trading as investors reacted positively to the better-than-expected results. Provided the UK economy remains stable and weather events are not too severe, General Accident appears well-placed to continue its recovery and improve returns to shareholders over the coming months.
