Market experts predict UK lending rate rise to have limited impact on house prices  

The Bank of England today announced a 0.25% increase in the UK base lending rate, raising it from 0.5% to 0.75%. This is the first rate rise since November 2017 and was widely expected by economists and market experts. While any lending rate increase can impact house prices, most experts predict the effect to be relatively limited in the current environment.

The small increase reflects the ongoing strength of the UK economy, with unemployment remaining low, wage growth steady, and inflation staying around the Bank's 2% target. The Bank noted, however, that Brexit-related uncertainties are weighing on economic activity, and that the outlook will depend on the nature of the UK's withdrawal from the EU. On balance, the Bank expects subdued growth over the forecast period and limited inflationary pressures, allowing for a gradual tightening of monetary policy.

For mortgage borrowers, the 0.25% rise will increase mortgage payments very slightly, adding just £250 a year to a £200,000 mortgage. Average standard variable mortgage rates are unlikely to rise significantly in response to today's announcement. Commenting on the rate rise, Keith Manning, Banking Analyst at Credit Union Analytics, said "The increase in the base rate today is very small and is unlikely to have a material impact on either mortgage rates or house prices. Rates remain historically very low, and there are no signs from the Bank of rapid increases over the next couple of years."

Property market experts also expect limited effects on house prices from this small rate adjustment. Matthew Latham, Founding Partner at PropTech Partners, said "House prices are dependent on many factors, with interest rates being just one component. While higher rates can dampen demand, the ongoing housing shortage, stable employment levels and modest wage inflation are all continuing to support the market. For these reasons, we don't anticipate today's rate rise will cause any significant downward pressure on house prices."

However, further rate rises over the medium term would start to have a greater influence on affordability and house prices.  "If rates continue to rise over the next 12-24 months, this may start to have a modest negative impact on house prices, particularly in the lower- and middle-segments of the market where affordability  is more stretched," said Shawna Moore, Residential Market Analyst at Rightmove. "But one rate rise does not a trend make. Everything depends on how rapidly rates may increase from this point, and on the performance of other drivers like the economy, earnings and housing supply. The market remains on balance stable but subdued, and rate rises are unlikely to cause major price disruption on their own this year at least."

In summary, while any increase in interest rates has the potential for some downward pressure on house prices, the scale of today's rate adjustment is small and unlikely to greatly impact either the housing or mortgage markets according to industry experts. Barring a quick succession of further rises, house prices look set to remain broadly stable for the remainder of 2019. The overall outlook will continue to be shaped by the uncertain political and economic environment.
