Investment Vehicle Lanica Trust Loses Over £600,000 in Failed Co-op Takeover Bid

The Lanica Trust, an investment fund focused on the retail sector, lost over £600,000 in a failed attempt to acquire a stake in Co-operative Group, the UK retail cooperative society. Lanica built up a 3% stake in Co-op over the last two years in the hope of gaining representation on the board and influencing strategy. However, Co-op's board rejected Lanica's proposal for two board seats and rebuffed further requests for engagement.  

Lanica's investment in Co-op shares is now worth only £350,000, representing a loss of £600,000 for the fund and its investors. The trust had hoped to improve Co-op's online presence, cut costs, and potentially even merger certain retail operations with competitors to gain efficiencies. The Co-op board evidently did not share this vision and stonewalled all approaches.

The failed investment is a blow for Lanica and its founder and chief investment officer Malika Baynard. Ms. Baynard expressed frustration with Co-op's handling of the situation and said the trust was "disappointed with the hostile attitude shown to an engaged long-term investor." However, she retains confidence in the UK retail sector.  

For Co-op, the episode represents yet another corporate governance issue the embattled group must address. The Manchester-based society has faced criticism over executive pay, poor retail performance, and a £1.5 billion hole in its balance sheet. However, Co-op also recently announce the first annual profit from its wholesale and retail arms since 2015, indicating the group may have turned a corner. Co-op's leadership will no doubt claim vindication in their decision to rebuff Lanica's approach.

The fallout from Lanica's failed Co-op wager highlights some of the risks associated with activist investment in large cooperatives and member-based organizations. While public companies have a legal duty to maximize shareholder value, cooperatives like Co-op prioritize the interests of their customer-members. This can make them less responsive to outside investors focused on strategic changes to boost the share price. For its part, Lanica has learned a costly lesson about targeting investments at non-traditional company structures like cooperatives. The trust will likely pursue a more conservative approach to future investments as a result.
