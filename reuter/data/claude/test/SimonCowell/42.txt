Lloyd's of London Gives Names More Time to Meet Capital Requirements and Drops Proposal to Prevent Use of Homes as Collateral  

The insurance giant Lloyd's of London announced today that it is extending the deadline for its members, known as "Names," to meet new capital adequacy requirements. Lloyd's had planned to require Names to put up millions in extra capital by January 2021 to ensure they could cover potential large insurance claims. However, Lloyd's now says Names will have until January 2022 to meet the new requirements, citing the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lloyd's is a marketplace made up of syndicates and individual Names who underwrite insurance risks. The Names are individuals or small companies who provide the bulk of the capital that backs Lloyd's insurance policies. Lloyd's new rule, unveiled last year, would have required Names to provide up to £209,000 in extra capital for every £1 million in underwriting capacity they support. For a Name supporting £5 million in risk, that could have meant putting up an additional £1 million in collateral.

In a letter to Names, Lloyd's CEO John Neal said "we recognize that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created economic volatility and uncertainty." Extending the deadline will "provide you more time to strengthen your capital position or make business planning decisions," Neal wrote. The extra year will allow Names more time to get additional financing or adjust their underwriting to reduce risks and capital needs.

Lloyd's also announced it is dropping a controversial plan to ban Names from using their personal homes as collateral to back their Lloyd's risks. The plan was opposed by many Names, some of whom have been part of Lloyd's for generations. Lloyd's said that after "careful consideration" it has decided "not to proceed with a ban on the use of residential property as collateral." However, new rules will still limit how much of a Name's capital can be made up of residential property to ensure diversification of assets.

The twin announcements from Lloyd's arrive at a time when the insurance industry faces substantial losses from the COVID-19 crisis while also being called upon to pay for many of the economic impacts. Business interruption policies have become a major battleground, with insurers opposing policyholders' claims in many cases. Lloyd's reported a first-quarter loss of £400 million due to the pandemic. Easing up on the capital rule and allowing the continued use of homes as collateral is seen as a way to stabilize Lloyd's membership during this difficult period.

The 332-year-old Lloyd's has around 4,000 members in its Names community. While still providing much of Lloyd's £35.5 billion in capital and an iconic part of its heritage, Names now represent a small fraction of its overall business. But Lloyd's pledge to stand behind every risk and pay every valid claim relies on maintaining the security of its capital—hence the moves to bolster its financial base even as it provides more flexibility during this crisis. For Names and Lloyd's alike, it's a balancing act with potentially billions of dollars at stake.
