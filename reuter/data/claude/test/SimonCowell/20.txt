Direct Line Expects Improvement in Motor Insurance Results for 1997, but Warns of Market Volatility 

Direct Line, the motor insurance division of the Royal Bank of Scotland, reported today that it expects improved results for its motor insurance business in 1997 due to lower claims costs. However, the company warned that the wider motor insurance market remains very volatile and competitive.

Direct Line CEO Brian Stevenson said in a statement, "We are seeing some positive trends in claims costs that should benefit our motor insurance results for the current financial year. The cost of motor insurance claims has been rising significantly over the past few years due to an increase in expensive claims for whiplash injuries and vehicle theft. However, claims inflation now appears to be moderating, and we have implemented further pricing adjustments and cost control measures to improve our margins."

The motor insurance division represents about two-thirds of Direct Line's total premium income. Direct Line is the largest motor insurer in the UK, insuring over 3 million vehicles. 

While Direct Line's own motor insurance results are improving, Stevenson warned that the wider UK motor insurance market remains challenging. "The market has seen periods of intense competition recently that have put pressure on premium rates. In addition, new technologies are opening up the market to greater competition from startups and tech companies. However, we believe Direct Line is well positioned to thrive in a competitive market due to our large customer base, digital capabilities, and competitive pricing."

Direct Line expects to release its full-year results for 1997 in February. Analysts forecast that Direct Line's motor insurance operating profit could increase by 5-10% for the year, with underwriting profit margins improving to around 15%. Direct Line shares rose 3% on the news, outperforming the wider FTSE index.

Julia Scott, an insurance analyst at Norcross Research, said, "Direct Line appears to have navigated well through a difficult market environment, and seems poised to continue gaining share in motor insurance. If claims inflation continues to moderate, it could drive further margin expansion and increase profits over the next couple of years." 

However, other analysts warn that the UK motor insurance market is poised for further disruptions that could intensify competition and make for more volatile results across the industry. Direct Line will need to maintain its competitive edge through a focus on digital innovation and cost control to thrive against challengers and competitors. Overall, while results may improve this year, the road ahead remains bumpy for the UK's largest motor insurer.
