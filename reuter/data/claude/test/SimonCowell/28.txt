Lloyd's of London to Recommend External Regulation in Landmark Proposal 

Lloyd's of London, the centuries-old insurance market, is expected to announce a plan to put some of its operations under the regulation of the UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). If approved, the move would represent the first time Lloyd's would fall under external prudential regulation in its 328-year history.

According to people familiar with the matter, Lloyd's is poised to recommend that managing agents, the insurance companies that operate within the Lloyd's market, should become dual regulated—that is, regulated by both the Lloyd's Franchise Board and the PRA. The firms operate as independent businesses but underwrite insurance through the Lloyd's market. Currently, they are only regulated by the Lloyd's Franchise Board.

Bringing prudential regulation to parts of Lloyd's has been a goal of senior executives for several years. Lloyd's CEO John Neal has argued that external regulation would provide more transparency and help the market attract new capital. Some investors and regulators have argued that Lloyd's complex structure, with 100-plus syndicates operating in one market, needs more oversight.

The move would require approval from Lloyd's governing council and the Bank of England, which oversees the PRA. If approved, about 30 to 50 of the largest Lloyd's managing agents may initially fall under dual regulation, according to reports. The remaining managing agents would stay solely under Lloyd's regulation until 2023 at the earliest.

Dual regulation is expected to increase costs for managing agents and Lloyd's. However, proponents argue it will bring benefits like improved governance and compliance standards across Lloyd's £35 billion market. Lloyd's also believes external regulation may help it gain preferential treatment in certain countries where its syndicates currently face regulatory barriers.

Lloyd's announcement is set to come amid a difficult period for the insurance industry due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Lloyd's recent results have proved resilient, with an overall loss ratio of 70% for the first half of 2020. The recommendations are part of Lloyd's Future at Lloyd's program to modernize operations and make the market more efficient and globally competitive.
