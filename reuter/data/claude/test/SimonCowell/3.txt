Equitas Receives Only a Qualified Opinion on Its First Set of Accounts

The newly established Equitas Society, which took over the assets and liabilities of the failed Alpha Bank, received only a qualified opinion on its first set of accounts from its auditors. The accounts were released today for the three months ended December 31. 

In the auditors' report, they noted that they were "unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence" regarding the valuation of some of the legacy assets taken on from Alpha Bank. These assets, which are predominantly commercial real estate loans, are complex to value given current market conditions. The auditors stated that there were a "high degree of estimation uncertainty and judgment involved" in determining provisions for impairments on these assets.

As a result of the auditors' qualifications on these legacy assets, Equitas's accounts are not given a clean bill of health. The Chairman of Equitas, John Smith, expressed disappointment that a qualified opinion was given but said he understood the auditors' rationale for their judgment. "The legacy assets we have inherited from Alpha Bank are challenging to value based on their complexity and the overall state of commercial real estate markets. The audit qualification was not unexpected, though we aim to work to remove it for next year's accounts as we gain more clarity," he said.

Excluding the legacy assets, the other assets and liabilities on Equitas's balance sheet received an unqualified opinion from the auditors. Equitas was established in September last year to acquire the deposits, loans, investments, and other assets of Alpha Bank when it failed, paying a nominal sum to acquire these assets. Equitas's role is to wind down or restructure these assets in an orderly fashion to maximize their value and repay depositors and creditors. It has 300 employees and expects to take 3-5 years to fully wind down the acquired book.

Depositors with Alpha Bank automatically had their accounts transferred to Equitas, though many are waiting to see how much of their money they will get back from the failed bank's assets. The qualified audit opinion is likely to make many of these depositors and creditors nervous about potential losses. However, the Chairman sought to reassure them in his statement, saying "we remain confident that depositors and creditors will suffer only modest losses from the positions they held with Alpha Bank, though the ultimate outcome will depend on market conditions over the coming years as we wind down assets."

The accounts show a loss of $115 million for the 3-month period. However, this includes $98 million of provisions for impairments on the legacy commercial real estate loans. Excluding these provisions, Equitas made a small profit of $7 million from other assets and liabilities. Overall, it is a rocky start for the new entity, though all eyes will remain on how it maximizes value from the risky legacy assets over the longer term. The next set of accounts in 6 months' time should provide an update on whether an unqualified audit opinion can be achieved.
