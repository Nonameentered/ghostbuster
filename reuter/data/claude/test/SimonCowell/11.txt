Norwich Union members to receive 3.1 billion pounds worth of free shares after approving floatation plan

Norwich Union announced today that its 4.5 million members will receive free shares worth 3.1 billion pounds following the insurance provider's transition from a mutual to a public limited company. The move comes after members voted overwhelmingly to approve the floatation plan, reportedly to give Norwich Union access to the capital it needs to compete with larger players in the insurance market. 

Norwich Union, which traces its roots back to 1797, has been owned by its members, or policyholders, since then. As a mutual organization, it did not have shareholders and was not listed on the stock exchange. However, the company now aims to float up to 49.9% of its shares on the London Stock Exchange in October. Members of Norwich Union will receive shares proportionate to the value of their policies, which will give them part ownership of the new public company alongside external shareholders.

The floatation is set to be one of the largest mutual demutualizations in UK history. Norwich Union says its members approved the plan at a special meeting this week, with 96.7% of votes in favor of the proposal. The move is designed to raise around 1 billion pounds in capital and allow Norwich Union to pursue new growth opportunities, according to a statement from the firm.

"Today's result confirms that our members fully support our plans to float," said Mike Hollins, Norwich Union CEO. "As a public company, Norwich Union will have access to the capital and support it needs to enhance its competitive position in a dynamic insurance industry. We remain committed to our members, who will continue to benefit from our success as significant new co-owners of Norwich Union going forward."

Mutual members will receive approximately 1075 free ordinary shares in the new public company for every 250 pounds of with-profit fund value in their policy. Based on the targeted initial public offering price range of 230 to 310 pence per share, a typical member with a 25,000 pound policy could expect to receive shares worth between 1,840 and 2,310 pounds. The exact number of shares each member receives will depend on the final offer price.

Trading in the new shares is expected to commence on October 9. While members are not obligated to keep their shares, Norwich Union stated that members who do hold on to their shares will have an ongoing stake in the company as well as potential share price benefits and dividend payments. The floatation is expected to value Norwich Union at between 5.8 billion to 8 billion pounds.
