Lloyd's of London Reports Second Year of Over £1 Billion in Underwriting Profits Despite Slight Drop from Previous Year

Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance marketplace, announced its annual results today showing a second consecutive year of over £1 billion in underwriting profits. Lloyd's reported an underwriting profit of £1.06 billion for 2018, a 9.5% drop from the 2017 result of £1.17 billion. However, the results still represent Lloyd's second highest underwriting profit in ten years and further demonstrate the turnaround from years of underwriting losses in the early 2000s.

The strong 2018 results were achieved despite a higher level of catastrophe claims during the year. Major catastrophes including Hurricanes Michael and Florence, wildfires in California, and Typhoons Jebi and Trami contributed to a higher level of natural catastrophe claims in 2018. However, the market-leading underwriting performance was able to absorb the catastrophe losses while still delivering profits, highlighting an improved risk management approach.   

The 2018 combined ratio, a key measure of underwriting profitability, was 96.9% compared to 92.9% in 2017. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The 2018 result was at the upper end of Lloyd's forecasts for the year but still signals a highly profitable result. Gross written premiums were up 2% to £35.5 billion compared to £34.7 billion in 2017, demonstrating the continued growth and risk appetite of the Lloyd's market.

John Neal, Lloyd's CEO, commented: "These are an excellent set of results for Lloyd's, and further demonstrate the strength and robustness of the Lloyd's market. A £1 billion underwriting profit in a year with higher than average catastrophe experience highlights the benefits of Lloyd's global expertise and distributing risk around the world." Lloyd's continues its focus on modernizing the market and improving operational efficiency through new technology and platforms. Mr. Neal added: "Ongoing investment in technology and innovation is driving efficiency gains across the Lloyd's market,
