United Assurance Group to cut 2,200 jobs in integration following merger

United Assurance Group (UAG), the insurance giant formed by the merger of United Life and Assurance Corp and Global Insurers Group, announced plans to cut 2,200 jobs as part of the integration of the two companies. The job cuts represent about 5% of the combined workforce of 44,000 employees. 

The planned layoffs come three months after United Life and Assurance and Global Insurers Group completed their $24 billion merger to form UAG, now the world's fourth largest life insurer and sixth largest property and casualty insurer. The deal combined United Life's strength in life insurance and annuities with Global Insurers' major presence in property and casualty insurance.

UAG said the job cuts are necessary to eliminate duplication of functions and improve operational efficiency. Employees affected will be offered severance packages and outplacement services. The reductions will impact managerial, support and administrative roles across UAG's operations. No frontline customer support staff will be affected.

"While the merger of these two storied institutions is an exciting opportunity, it also brings challenges, including managing overlaps in some business functions," said UAG CEO Brian Johnson. "By streamlining our operations and reducing costs, we will operate even more intelligently and invest even more in new products and services for our global customer base."

The company expects to incur a one-time charge of $340 million related to employee termination packages but sees annual cost savings of $520 million by 2021 as a result of the restructuring. UAG plans to reinvest a portion of the savings in new digital tools to improve customer experience and in its fast-growing asset management and retirement services units.

Headquartered in New York, UAG has operations in over 30 countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific. It offers insurance coverage and financial products to over 10 million customers worldwide.

Consumer advocates voiced concern about the large-scale job cuts. "Megamergers often come at the expense of workers and middle-income jobs," said Jenny Jiang of the American Consumer Council. "We urge UAG to strictly follow all regulations regarding proper notice, severance and job transition support for long-serving employees affected by this restructuring."

UAG said all staff reductions will comply fully with regulatory requirements and meet or exceed the standards recommended by employment experts. The job cuts are subject to a 90-day consultation with employees and their representatives before final roles are eliminated. Employees will receive advance notice of termination, severance pay, extended health benefits and professional career transition help.
