Halifax Building Society Members Set for Bigger Payout in Upcoming Flotation 

Members of Halifax Building Society will receive a significantly higher windfall than expected when the society converts to a bank and lists on the London Stock Exchange next month. According to industry sources, Halifax will announce this week that members will receive at least £3,000 each from the upcoming flotation, 66% higher than the £1,800 estimated when the conversion and listing was first announced six months ago.

The increase in the payout reflects the stronger than expected performance of Halifax over the past year and the recent run-up in bank shares. Since the building society first announced its intention to demutualize and float last October, Halifax profits have jumped 43% and shares in listed banks like Lloyds and NatWest have soared over 50% amid growing optimism in the sector.

Demutualization, the process through which building societies convert into public limited companies, has proved hugely profitable for members in recent years. Over 3 million people shared a £9 billion windfall when Abbey National converted in 1989, and customers of Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley received £2 billion and £1.5 billion respectively when those societies floated in the 1990s.

However, some members and consumer groups have criticized the process, arguing that short-term financial gains come at the expense of the security and community ethos traditionally associated with building societies. They claim that plcs are more vulnerable to predatory takeovers and tend to offer poorer customer service in the pursuit of greater profits. But with Halifax pledging to maintain its existing branch network and product range, and the promise of tax-free payments worth thousands of pounds, most members are expected to vote in favor of conversion when the ballot is held next month.

A strong vote for demutualization would pave the way for Halifax to announce the pricing range for its shares. Given current stock market conditions, analysts estimate the range will be set at between £3 and £3.50 per share, valuing Halifax at £10-12 billion. Members will receive shares in exchange for the value of their accounts and stakes in the society. The shares are expected to start trading by the end of November, heralding the end of Halifax’s 161-year history as a mutually owned organisation. However, executives are hoping the generous payout and strong public profile will ensure it begins life as a bank with the support and goodwill of millions of members.
