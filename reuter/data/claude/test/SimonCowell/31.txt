Royal & Sun Alliance Group Approves Share Buyback as Profits Rise  

The British insurance company Royal & Sun Alliance Group announced  an 11 percent rise in annual operating profits today, driven by growth in commercial insurance. The company also said its board approved plans for a £150 million share buyback program to return capital to shareholders.

Royal & Sun Alliance, also known as RSA, said operating profits rose to £655 million ($820 million) in 2019, up from £590 million a year earlier. Profits were boosted by double-digit growth in commercial insurance, especially in Canada, Scandinavia and the Middle East. Personal insurance profits also rose 5 percent.

The improved performance allowed RSA to increase its total dividend for the year by 3 percent. “Our focused strategic progress, strong balance sheet and embedded self-help initiatives give us good momentum for continued improvement in 2020 and beyond,” said Stephen Hester, RSA group chief executive.

RSA also announced plans to launch a share buyback program to repurchase up to £150 million of its own shares. The buyback is aimed at returning excess capital to shareholders while still maintaining the company's strong capital position. The program will start in March and end no later than September.

RSA's shares rose more than 2 percent in early trading following the announcement. The stock is up 40 percent over the last year, giving RSA a market value of £6.3 billion.

The profit gains were achieved despite challenges in the UK motor insurance market, where pricing pressures have weighed on results. Premiums in RSA's UK & International division fell 2 percent. However, a turnaround in RSA's underwriting performance and cost cutting helped offset the premium decline.

RSA also benefited from rate increases in Canada as well as strong growth in commercial property insurance in the Middle East. Scandinavian premiums were up 6 percent, driven by home insurance.

RSA is working to turn around its UK personal insurance business, in part through stricter underwriting and higher prices. The company said UK motor rates rose 10 percent in 2019, while home premiums were up 6 percent. But the higher prices contributed to a 3 percent drop in customer numbers.  

The company said its solvency ratio, a measure of capital strength, was 167 percent at the end of 2019, well above its target range. Moody's and other ratings agencies consider a solvency ratio above 140-150 percent to indicate a very strong capital position for an insurer.

RSA carried out a strategic review last year that concluded its businesses in Scandinavia and Canada fit well with its long-term strategy, but that it would consider selling its units in the Baltics and Latin America. However, the company said today no sale process is currently underway for those businesses.
