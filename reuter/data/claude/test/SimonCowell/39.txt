SIB Launches 400,000 Pound Campaign to Raise Awareness of Pension Mis-Selling Review  

The Serious Insurance Bureau (SIB) today announced the launch of a major nationwide campaign to raise public awareness of the ongoing review into the mis-selling of personal pensions. The 400,000 pound initiative will include TV, radio and social media ads urging people who took out personal pensions between 1988 and 1994 to check if they were mis-sold and may be owed compensation.

The campaign comes as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is conducting a review of personal pension sales during this period. It is estimated over 2 million policies were sold in those six years, with many people potentially placed in unsuitable schemes with high fees. The FCA review aims to identify cases where unsuitable advice was given or where important information about the policies was not disclosed. Where mis-selling is found, compensation may be offered to affected customers.

The SIB campaign will target those who took out personal pensions during this time, especially the over 50’s who are most likely to be impacted. The message will be a call to action to check pension statements from that era and see if the policy and fees match what was initially advised. Where there are concerns of mis-selling, the SIB is directing people to their website where they can get free guidance on next steps, including potentially lodging a complaint with their pension provider which may lead to the FCA review.

Mark Harris, Director of SIB, said: “We want to make sure as many people as possible who may have been mis-sold a pension in the late 80’s and early 90’s are aware of the situation and review their historic records.  Compensation could potentially run into thousands of pounds, so we urge all those impacted to check if they have a case and come to us for guidance. This was a time of widespread mis-selling, and many will have a valid claim unknowingly sitting in old paperwork.”

The ad campaign will run for three months starting this week. SIB expects to see a surge of inquiries in that period and has doubled the size of its pension review team to handle the higher call and web query volumes.   Anyone impacted or seeking more information can contact the SIB at www.sib.org.uk/pension-check or call their helpline on 0800 345 6789.
