British Insurers Prepare for Opening of Indian Market to Foreign Companies After 20-year Hiatus 

Major insurance companies in the UK are gearing up to tap into the lucrative Indian market as the country prepares to open up its insurance sector to foreign investment for the first time in two decades. The Indian government is planning to increase the foreign direct investment cap in insurance companies from 49% to 74% in the upcoming budget, paving the way for British insurers to take majority stakes in their Indian joint ventures or establish wholly-owned subsidiaries.

India’s insurance market is one of the most underpenetrated in the world, with insurance premiums making up only about 4% of GDP. But it is also one of the fastest-growing, expanding at double-digit rates over the past decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated demand for life and health insurance products. Total insurance premiums in India are projected to reach $280 billion by 2025, making it an irresistible opportunity for British companies looking to offset sluggish growth at home.

“India is the most exciting insurance market in the world right now and the regulatory changes will allow us to fully commit resources to serving the fast-growing needs of Indian customers,” said Mark Ling, Asia CEO of Prudential Plc, the largest life insurer in the UK. Prudential derives about 20% of its revenue from India and plans to convert its Indian subsidiary to a wholly-owned one once the new rules come into effect.

Aviva, the second-largest insurer in the UK, is also bullish on India. “We have been waiting for this opportunity for 20 years,” said James Baird, Aviva’s Head of Asia. “India will soon become the focal point of our growth strategy for the Asian region.” Aviva has a joint venture with Dabur Group in India called Aviva India that it aims to take full control of as soon as the law is amended.

The opening of the Indian market provides a lifeline to British insurers that have struggled with low interest rates and fierce competition at home. While the UK remains their primary base of operations, companies like Prudential, Aviva and Standard Life recognize the need to diversify into emerging markets to gain exposure to younger, fast-growing populations if they want to remain relevant in the coming decades. India, in particular, with its 1.4 billion people and relatively low insurance coverage, offers huge untapped potential that could reshape the future of British insurers.
