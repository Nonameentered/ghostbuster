Norwich Union set to float on London Stock Exchange in June, offering free shares and discounts to members  

Norwich Union, the UK's largest insurance company, has announced plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in June of this year. In an unusual move, the company will offer free shares to its 16 million members as well as discounts on insurance for members who retain their shares for the long term.

The flotation is set to value Norwich Union at up to £16 billion, making it one of the biggest insurance company listings in London for over a decade. Norwich Union plans to sell up to 25% of its shares to institutional investors to raise additional capital to fund expansion into new products and markets.

As part of the listing, Norwich Union will distribute 100 free shares to all members that have been with the company for at least one year. Members can then choose to sell the shares immediately or retain them to receive discounts of up to 15% on certain insurance products. The offer is intended to reward loyal customers and encourage them to become shareholders in the business.

Norwich Union CEO Simon Latham said "We are delighted to announce our plans to float Norwich Union and offer our members the opportunity to own a stake in the business. We have built up a very large, loyal customer base over our 300-year history and want to reward that loyalty in a meaningful way through free shares and product discounts."   

The flotation is expected to be well received by investors attracted to Norwich Union's strong brand, market position and stable profitability. However, some analysts have questioned whether giving away a large block of shares will undermine the valuation of the company. The share offer to members is capped at £250 million, just over 1.5% of the expected market capitalization. Norwich Union believes this strikes the right balance between rewarding members and maximizing value for external shareholders.            

The final share price and allocation of shares between members and institutional investors will be determined through a bookbuilding process in the week prior to listing. Norwich Union members will receive details on how to claim and trade their free shares in May ahead of the flotation in June.
