Insurance Broker C.E. Heath in Talks for Possible $163.7M Buyout 

C.E. Heath Insurance Brokers Inc., one of the largest independent insurance brokerages in the Midwestern United States, is in advanced talks to be acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $163.7 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal, if completed, would be one of the largest insurance brokerage transactions of the year and highlight the increasing interest of private equity firms in the insurance distribution space.

Founded in 1932, C.E. Heath is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri and provides commercial and personal insurance to individuals and organizations across nine states. The company has more than 350 employees and generates over $200 million in annual revenue. 

Private equity firms have shown significant interest in insurance brokers, which provide a steady and recession-resistant source of income. C.E. Heath would represent an opportunity to gain a platform in commercial and personal lines to build out through further acquisitions.

The sources cautioned that negotiations are ongoing and could still fall apart. The valuation and terms of the deal are not final and subject to change.

Apollo Global Management and C.E. Heath declined to comment.

C.E. Heath represents Apollo’s latest foray into the insurance space. The private equity giant has completed several deals in the sector over the last decade, acquiring the life insurance company Athene Holdings for $2.2 billion in 2009 and the retirement services provider Verizon Communications’ former subsidiary One Communications for $575 million in 2015.

If a deal is agreed, it would cap a multi-year run of strong results for C.E. Heath. The broker has recorded consistent increases in revenue and profitability over the last five years as it has benefited from premium rate increases in the commercial insurance market. 

The insurance brokerage sector has seen a steady pace of mergers and acquisitions, reflecting pressures the companies face to gain scale. Notable recent deals include Acrisure’s acquisition of Tulco's Preferred Employers Insurance for $412 million in August and Brown & Brown's purchase of Hays Companies for $750 million in 2019.

A successful deal for C.E. Heath would be a win for the company's shareholders after a long and profitable run as an independent brokerage. For Apollo, it represents an opportunity to gain a foothold in Midwest commercial insurance and build out a major new platform for growth.
