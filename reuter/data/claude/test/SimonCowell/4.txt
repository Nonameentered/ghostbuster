Commercial Union boosts Lloyd's of London with managing agent stake acquisition

Commercial Union, one of the largest insurance companies in the U.K., announced today that it has acquired a majority stake in Sterling Hogg, a London-based managing agent at Lloyd's of London. The deal gives Commercial Union control of Sterling Hogg and bolsters its presence within the Lloyd's insurance marketplace. 

Lloyd's of London is the world's oldest insurance market, offering specialist insurance services for complex risks. It operates through a network of underwriting agents and brokers in London's financial district. Managing agents like Sterling Hogg help underwrite insurance risks on behalf of the Lloyd's syndicates they manage. 

By acquiring Sterling Hogg, Commercial Union secures access to its roster of clients and underwriting expertise in areas like aviation, energy, and cargo insurance. "This deal strengthens our ability to underwrite specialist risks and provide innovative insurance solutions through Lloyd's," said David Scotter, CEO of Commercial Union's insurance division. "Sterling Hogg has a talented team and a track record of underwriting excellence that will complement our existing Lloyd's operations."

Sterling Hogg employs over 200 people and currently manages four Lloyd's syndicates with total capacity of Â£500 million. The company was founded in 1988 and is led by CEO Andrew Hogg. Under the terms of the deal, Hogg will remain as CEO and Sterling Hogg will continue operating under its own brand. However, Commercial Union will gain control of Sterling Hogg's board and take a 51% ownership stake in the business. The remaining equity will be retained by Sterling Hogg's existing shareholders and employees.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close by the end of the year. When finalized, it would be one of the largest managing agent acquisitions in Lloyd's recent history and provide a major boost to Commercial Union's presence in the London market. Rival insurers like AXA and Zurich have also recently acquired Lloyd's underwriting agencies to capture more high-end business in areas like cyber risk and renewable energy.  

For Commercial Union, the deal also signals ambitions for global growth beyond its traditional markets in the UK and Europe. "This is an exciting new chapter for our Lloyd's business and supports our strategic vision to build a leading specialty insurer with global reach," said Scotter. With a venerable history of over 300 years in London but increasing international reach, Lloyd's remains an attractive marketplace for Commercial Union to strengthen its underwriting clout and forge new relationships worldwide.
