KPMG Report Criticizes Lloyd's Annual Venture as Costly and Damaging to Competitiveness 

A newly published report from the accounting and consulting firm KPMG criticizes Lloyd's of London's annual venture in Ascot as an expensive endeavor that hurts the competitiveness of the 332-year-old insurance market. The annual horse race meeting and social event, which Lloyd's has sponsored since 1960 at a cost of over £2 million per year, provides little real value to brokers and underwriters, according to the report. 

KPMG was commissioned by a group of Lloyd's members concerned about rising costs and stagnating profits to evaluate the impact of various initiatives, events, and legacy programs supported by the insurance institution. The Ascot sponsorship was singled out in the report as particularly wasteful given its high cost and limited benefits to the actual business of underwriting insurance and brokering policies. The report estimates that the total cost to Lloyd's and its members over the past 15 years alone has been over £30 million.

"While Ascot may have been seen as a useful networking and social event for Lloyd's in years past, its value to the competitive position and profitability of Lloyd's today is negligible and comes at too high a price," the report stated. It noted that attendance at Ascot-related events organized by Lloyd's has declined by over 60% from 2005 to 2019, suggesting a loss of interest, particularly among younger members and new entrants. 

The report was also critical of the message that Lloyd's lavish spending on Ascot sends both internally and externally. "Internally, it promotes a culture where costs are not adequately scrutinized or questioned. Externally, it risks presenting an image of Lloyd's as an old-fashioned institution more focused on tradition and status than innovation, competitiveness, and financial discipline."

In response to the report, Lloyd's defended its ongoing sponsorship of Ascot, saying it remains "an important opportunity to foster business relationships that strengthen the Lloyd's market." However, Lloyd's CEO John Neal conceded that all initiatives and events would be reviewed going forward to maximize their value. Some of the report's recommendations around cost-cutting may be "implemented to ensure resources are focused on supporting the strategic priorities of Lloyd's," he said.

The KPMG report puts additional pressure on Lloyd's to reduce expenses and improve profits after a difficult 2019 where it only achieved a 2.1% return on capital. The high costs, poor results, and competitive challenges facing Lloyd's have strained relationships in recent years between the corporation itself and its members. The latest report suggests the Ascot venture should become a target for reform if Lloyd's aims to overcome current financial difficulties, satisfy its members, and modernize its image. By eliminating or reducing its Ascot sponsorship, Lloyd's could save millions per year and take an important step toward lowering costs and improving value to all its stakeholders.
