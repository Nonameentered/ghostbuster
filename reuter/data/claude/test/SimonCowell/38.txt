Lloyd's of London posts profits of over £1 billion for second year, but warns of future decline  

Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, has announced pre-tax profits of £1.22 billion for 2017, the second year of profits exceeding £1 billion. The strong results were driven by low claims payouts and solid investment returns. However, Lloyd's warned that it expects underwriting performance to decline over the next two years due to competitive pressures in the insurance market and higher natural catastrophe claims.

Lloyd's reported an increase in gross written premiums of 3% to £33.6 billion for the year. The combined ratio, which measures underwriting profitability and is expressed as a percentage of premiums collected, improved to 97.9% from 98.8% in 2016 due to a lower level of natural catastrophe and large claims as well as a higher prior year reserve release. Investment income rose 12% to £1.05 billion, reflecting higher bond yields and wider spreads. 

Inga Beale, chief executive officer of Lloyd’s, commented: “These are an excellent set of results with strong profits in a competitive market. But we expect market conditions to become increasingly challenging over the next 18-24 months, reflected in a dip in performance.” She cited intensifying competition putting downward pressure on insurance rates, the UK leaving the European Union, and the threat of higher natural catastrophe claims due to climate change.  

The results highlight the volatility inherent in the Lloyd’s market model which relies heavily on investment returns and claims payouts. When investment returns are strong and claims are low, profits surge. But when claims rise and investment returns weaken, the market can swing sharply into loss. Ms. Beale said that while Lloyd’s capital position is “extremely strong” at present, proactive management of risk and more consistent underwriting performance are needed to ensure long term success.  

Lloyd’s began in 1688 as a marine insurance market. Today, it is the world’s leading market for specialist insurance and reinsurance with 84 syndicates covering property, casuality, marine, energy, motor, aviation and space risks. Lloyd’s has a worldwide network in over 200 countries and territories. However, like much of the London insurance market, Lloyd’s faces uncertainty due to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Around 11% of Lloyd’s gross written premiums are from EU-based clients.  

Ms. Beale said that while Brexit poses serious challenges, Lloyd's has taken action to ensure continued market access across the EU and encouraged the UK government to agree a transition arrangement with the EU. She also called for clarity on a future UK-EU trade deal and a "common-sense" customs arrangement to avoid additional costs and disruption. With hard work and close cooperation, she believes Lloyd’s can continue to thrive despite the political upheaval. But future profits are far from guaranteed in these uncertain and volatile times.
