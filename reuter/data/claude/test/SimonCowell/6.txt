Prudential Corp to increase exposure to top end of personal financial services market with stake in St James's Place Capital  

Prudential Corp, one of Britain's leading life assurance companies, has announced that it will strengthen its position in the affluent personal financial services market by acquiring a 25% stake in the wealth management group St James's Place Capital (SJP) for £600 million. Prudential is looking to diversify its revenue streams into higher-margin businesses and build its presence among high net worth individuals. 

SJP is an independent wealth manager that provides face-to-face advice and bespoke investment portfolios for individuals, trusts, companies and charities. It has funds under management of £117.7 billion and over 4,000 partners and employees across the UK. SJP focuses on the "mass affluent" market, including professionals, executives and entrepreneurs with over £50,000 to invest. This positioning aligns well with Prudential’s target market of young professionals and high earners looking to optimise their long-term financial planning.

The strategic partnership will provide Prudential access to SJP's extensive network of wealth managers and affluent clients. In return, Prudential will become SJP's exclusive provider of annuity products, including guaranteed income drawdown funds for clients in retirement. Prudential CEO Mark FitzPatrick said “This investment accelerates the growth of our higher-margin businesses and provides another platform for offering our retirement solutions. We see huge opportunities in the mass affluent wealth management space and SJP has an unparalleled proposition and reach into this market.”

SJP Group Chief Executive Andrew Croft believes Prudential is an ideal partner that will help the business continue its strong growth. He said, "Prudential has a similar customer-centric culture and focus on the long term. This strategic partnership and investment will allow us to further enhance our client proposition through closer access to Prudential's market-leading retirement solutions." 

Prudential will have the option to increase its stake to up to 39% in 2024. If exercised, this could value the company at over £4 billion and make a significant contribution to Prudential's profits. Prudential's shares rose 3% on the news while St James's Place shares jumped 6% to a record high. Both companies highlighted the overlap between their client bases and the opportunity to cross-sell additional products and services. They aim for initial cross-selling opportunities to deliver over £50 million per year in additional revenue and cost synergies.

The partnership is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to complete in the second half of this year. The transaction will be funded through Prudential's internal resources and is not expected to impact the group's capital position materially. Prudential continues to evaluate further opportunities for value creation through partnerships, joint ventures and acquisitions in line with its refreshed strategy.
