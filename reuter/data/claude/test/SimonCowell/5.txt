Equitas Reinsurance Vehicle’s Future Uncertain After Qualified Set of First Accounts, Warns Audit Firm 

The newly established Equitas Re PCC (Protected Cell Company) faces an uncertain future after receiving a qualified audit opinion on its first set of accounts, according to audit firm KPMG. Equitas Re was set up by Lloyd’s of London and Berkshire Hathaway last year to provide reinsurance capacity for long-tail non-life business written before 1993. However, KPMG has warned that material uncertainty exists over the vehicle’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its audit report, KPMG highlighted the “inherent uncertainty” in estimating liabilities for long-tail business that stretches back decades. It noted that small changes in assumptions can lead to big impacts on reserves and profitability. KPMG said it was unable to determine the “feasibility and adequacy” of Equitas Re’s plans to deal with these uncertainties and whether it can continue operating for at least 12 months.  

The audit report is a blow for Equitas Re, which launched in January 2020 to take on around £8 billion of liabilities from syndicates in run-off. The vehicle raised $2.5 billion of capital, but KPMG has questioned whether this will be enough given the risks and uncertainties. The report may also dent confidence among existing and potential investors in Equitas Re.

Lloyd’s and Equitas Re sought to reassure the market in statements following the audit report. Lloyd’s said Equitas Re was set up with “substantial capital” to protect policyholders and allow syndicates to exit run-off. Equitas Re said its solvency position remained “robust” and it continued to work closely with Lloyd’s and regulators. However, some analysts warn that material doubts raised at such an early stage do not inspire confidence in Equitas Re’s longevity or ability to achieve its objectives.

The news comes at a difficult time for Lloyd’s, which recently reported a £4.2 billion aggregated loss for 2020 and faces a challenging trading environment due to the coronavirus crisis. The uncertain fate of Equitas Re may raise further questions over Lloyd’s handling of historical liabilities and its policies toward capitalizing and managing loss-making syndicates. Lloyd’s success in enabling syndicates to exit run-off and free up capital by transferring liabilities to Equitas Re now looks far from assured according to the warnings in KPMG’s audit report.
