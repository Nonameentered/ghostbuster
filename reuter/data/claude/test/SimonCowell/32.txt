Norwich Union to Offer 10% Discount to Members in Planned Share Offering 

Norwich Union, the UK's largest insurer, announced today that it will offer its policyholders a 10% discount to participate in its planned public share offering. The offering is expected to raise $5 billion in new capital as Norwich Union looks to expand into new markets and product areas.

Norwich Union currently has over 12 million policyholders in the UK for various personal insurance products including auto, home, and life insurance. By offering a 10% discount on shares to these existing members, Norwich Union hopes to gain additional participant interest and achieve the increased access to capital.

"Our policyholders have been tremendously loyal over the years, so we want to reward them first with this unique opportunity," said Norwich Union CEO Mark Johnson. "A share offering of this size requires substantial interest and our members represent an ideal audience to tap into." 

The 10% member discount would apply to the entire $5 billion offering. At a potential offer price of $15 per share, a 10% discount would represent a $1.50 per share savings for members. Norwich Union policyholders would still need to complete the standard application and approval process to participate in the offering.

Norwich Union expects to use the $5 billion in proceeds to push into new product areas like pet insurance and travel insurance, as well as expand their operations into new countries in Europe and Asia. The company is also looking to invest further in new technologies to improve the customer experience.

"There are a number of growth opportunities on the horizon for Norwich Union, but we need the capital to fund these new initiatives," said Johnson. "A successful public offering is imperative to our ability to innovate our product portfolio, enhance our technological capabilities, and reach new customers internationally."

The Norwich Union public share offering is expected to launch in early next quarter, pending regulatory approval. Eligible Norwich Union members will receive additional details on how to participate and claim the 10% discount in the coming weeks.
