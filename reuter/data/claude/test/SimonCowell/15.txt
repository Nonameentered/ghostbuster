Lloyd's of London Unconcerned by Possible U.S. Tobacco Liability Claims

Lloyd's of London, the historic insurance market known for underwriting unusual risks, said it is unconcerned about potential liabilities from tobacco-related illnesses in the United States. Some analysts have warned that Lloyd's faces billions of dollars in claims as smokers develop health issues. However, in an interview Lloyd's CEO John Nelson said the insurance market is well-positioned to handle any tobacco claims that may arise. 

"We have been writing policies on tobacco risks for over 300 years and factor health issues related to tobacco into our underwriting and pricing models," said Nelson. "While there may be a slight uptick in claims over the coming decades, we anticipate these will be within the normal fluctuations we plan for."

U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay $206 billion in a series of settlements beginning in 1998 to cover Medicaid costs related to smoking. Some public health advocates argue those sums were insufficient and are pushing for new litigation to recover additional costs. However, tobacco companies have been largely successful defending themselves in court by arguing that health risks have long been known. They also note that legal protections enacted since the 1990s shield them from certain types of lawsuits.

Lloyd's, which functions as both a market for insurance underwriting and a broker, has long been the leading writer of tobacco-linked policies, especially in the earlier part of the 20th century. Lloyd's policies were key in enabling British traders to ship tobacco from North America back to England beginning in the 1600s. While tobacco underwriting makes up a much smaller portion of Lloyd's business today, the market continues to write a variety of tobacco-related policies, including product liability coverage. 

Some public health groups expressed concern over Lloyd's stance. "It is disappointing Lloyd's fails to recognize the immense health impacts of tobacco use and the costs that have been borne by families, communities and healthcare systems," said John Wilson of the Campaign for Action on Health. However, Lloyd's remains confident in its underwriting approach and ability to factor health impacts into its decisions. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the insurance market appears poised to withstand future liabilities related to tobacco as it has for centuries past. Overall, Lloyd's described its book of business as balanced and emphasized tobacco as just one risk among many that it actively underwrites and monitors.
