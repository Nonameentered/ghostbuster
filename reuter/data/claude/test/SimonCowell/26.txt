Commercial Union Plc reports strong rise in Q1 profits, aided by fall in U.S. weather claims

Commercial Union Plc, the international insurance giant, reported a 24% increase in first-quarter profits today, boosted by a drop in weather-related claims in the United States and growth in premiums. 

Pre-tax profits rose to £387 million in the three months to March, up from £312 million a year earlier. The company said a "very benign" first quarter for weather claims in its U.S. operations helped profits, as it made sizable payouts for hurricanes and wildfires in the same period last year.

The U.K.-based insurer said premiums rose 11% to £6.5 billion, reflecting rate increases in many markets as well as the acquisition of smaller regional competitors. Commercial Union raised premiums in the U.S., U.K., and parts of Europe in 2018 to lift profit margins. 

"We have made an excellent start to 2019, achieving strong premium growth and higher underlying profitability in the first quarter," said Chief Executive Amanda Blanc. The company is on track to meet financial targets for the year, she added.  

Commercial Union's U.S. business reported a 29% rise in profits to £162 million, as premiums climbed 15% boosted by rate rises in property-casualty markets. The U.K. division saw profits increase 22% on the back of premium growth and lower motor claims.

In Europe, profits rose 19% but remained slightly behind other major markets. Commercial Union has sought to expand in Eastern and Central European countries but faces tough competition. 

The company's shares rose 3% in early trading as analysts said the results beat market expectations. "There were beats across all key metrics, and management talk confidently of the outlook," said Ben Cohen, insurance analyst at Bank of London.

Some analysts warned, however, that the fall in weather claims may not continue and the backdrop for insurers could get tougher. "We have some concerns that the property-casualty market is softening, and rate rises may decelerate in the coming quarters," said Georgina Peters of Morgan Stanley.  

Commercial Union employs over 34,000 people in more than 50 countries. It is investing heavily in technology including artificial intelligence to help price policies and reduce fraudulent claims.  

The company's strong start to the year comes amid a buoyant period for global insurers. Low interest rates have made some insurance products more attractive while economic growth in many countries has boosted demand for household and business policies. However, insurers also face risks from climate change and natural catastrophes which are costly to cover.  

In summary, Commercial Union reported higher first-quarter profits and premium growth, assisted by decreased weather-related claims in the U.S. market. While the results beat expectations, analysts cautioned growth may slow in coming quarters if insurance rates stop rising and weather events return to more normal levels. The company remains focused on expansion into new markets, investing in technology, and controlling costs to boost future profits.
