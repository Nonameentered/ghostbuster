Lloyd's of London reassures Names there is no hidden agenda to force them out of the insurance market 

Lloyd's of London moved today to reassure members of its underwriting community known as “Names” that there are no plans underway to force them out of the historic London insurance market. In a letter to all 3,000 Names, Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said “there is no hidden agenda at Lloyd's to close down the opportunity for traditional underwriting through the Names' system.” 

The reassurance comes after months of speculation that Lloyd's was making strategic moves to push out the Names in favor of larger corporate capital providers. The talk intensified recently after Lloyds announced plans to simplify some of its processes around the September renewal season in a way that would reduce opportunities for Names to participate.

Lloyd's began in 1688 as an insurance marketplace where wealthy individuals would underwrite insurance risks. These individuals were known as “Names” because originally they signed their names to policies to provide the financial backing. While Lloyd's itself is now a corporation, the Names have endured and many proudly carry on the tradition of underwriting through the Lloyd's market.

However, in recent decades the majority of Lloyd's underwriting capital has come from large corporate insurers and pension funds, not the Names. The Names now provide only about 10 percent of Lloyd's £35.9 billion in capital. This shift has led to speculation that Lloyd's views the Names as a relic of the past and would prefer to eliminate them in favor of bigger players.

In his letter, Carnegie-Brown wrote, “I want to make it very clear that is not the case. The Society of Lloyd's values enormously the history and traditions of which the Names are a vital part.” However, he also acknowledged the Names system needs to adapt to remain relevant.

“The fact remains that the environment in which Lloyd's operates today is very different to those early days. Capital requirements are much larger, risks are more complex, and competition more intense. If the Names' system is to remain relevant to underwriting in this environment, we need to make changes to simplify some of our outdated practices while protecting the essential character of traditional underwriting at Lloyd's,” Carnegie-Brown wrote.

Some of the changes Lloyd's is proposing include streamlining the “signing” process for underwriting contracts to reduce paperwork as well as easing requirements around providing office space and administrative support for Names. The moves are designed to cut costs and make the system easier to navigate, Lloyd's said. 

 In reaction, leaders of the Names Association and Managing Agents Partnership welcomed Carnegie-Brown's letter and expressed optimism about working constructively with Lloyds on securing the future of the Names’ system. While change may be needed, there is a shared belief that the Names remain an important part of Lloyd's identity and success. With open communication and trust on both sides, the Names appear set to be a part of Lloyd's for generations to come.
