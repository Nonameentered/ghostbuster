Possible headline: Lloyd's of London set to increase funding requirements for traditional investors  

Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, is set to increase funding requirements for its traditional insurance underwriters amid warnings that the firm is not prepared for large losses. The move aims to ensure that Lloyd's has sufficient capital to pay out claims in the event of a major disaster.      

According to informed sources, Lloyd's currently requests members commit funds to cover one 1-in-200-year loss events. However, it is now consulting members on proposals to raise this to 1-in-250-year or even 1-in-300-year loss scenarios. This would require underwriting members to increase the capital they commit to the market by as much as 50% to ensure there is enough money available to pay claims.

The changes come after a recent report by the Bank of England warned that Lloyd's capital requirements are too low, especially given the insurance market's global exposure to risk. The Bank of England report specifically highlighted under-preparedness for losses from cyber attacks, natural catastrophes and terrorism as key areas of concern.   

Lloyd's has suffered significant losses in recent years and was hit hard by the huge claims arising from the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Rumors of financial troubles and heavy losses have swirled around the market, sparking concerns about the overall stability of the 332-year-old institution.

Some underwriting members argue that significantly hiking capital requirements will be difficult after recent losses and may force some members to divest from the market. However, Lloyd's insists that maintaining the market's financial security is paramount in order to offer sustainable insurance coverage.

In a statement, Lloyd's CEO John Neal said: "As the world's leading insurance marketplace, financial resilience is key for our members and their clients. Reviewing and strengthening our capital regime will give the market greater security and stability. While we appreciate increased funding commitments will require effort from members, ensuring Lloyd's is prepared for major claims is in the interest of all."

The proposed changes to capital requirements are expected to be finalized over the summer and come into effect from January 2022. All members will then have until mid-2023 to meet the higher funding commitments. If approved, the moves represent the biggest overhaul to Lloyd's capital and security rules for decades.
