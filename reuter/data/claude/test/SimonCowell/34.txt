UK Treasury Considers Taking Over Regulation of Insurance Companies from DTI

The UK Treasury is considering stripping the Department of Trade and Industry of its responsibility for regulating the insurance industry and taking over direct oversight of companies like Aviva, Prudential, and Lloyd's. The move is aimed at streamlining regulation and is part of a broader effort to overhaul British financial regulation following Brexit, according to unnamed government officials. If approved, the reform would represent a major power shift and raise questions about how the Treasury would handle its expanded authority.

The Treasury plans to consult on the proposal later this year. According to two officials familiar with the situation, the plan would see insurance regulation shift to a new division within the Treasury that would also inherit the DTI's current oversight of the capital markets. The DTI's existing regulators for both the banking and investment industries would relocate to the Treasury as well, unifying most the City's supervision under one roof.

Supporters argue the consolidation would reduce inefficiencies and enable the government to develop a more coherent approach to financial regulation post-Brexit. At the same time, it could help strengthen the Treasury's hand in dealing with the insurance industry, which has been critical of some policies coming out of the DTI in recent years. Critics counter that the Treasury lacks the DTI's expertise and that the shake-up risks disruption as Britain plots its departure from the European Union. The reform would also require legislation that may face opposition in Parliament.

"There are good arguments for regulatory consolidation,” said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. “But we must not throw out the expertise built up in the DTI lightly. The Treasury will have to demonstrate how it will not only match but improve on the current regulatory framework." The proposed changes are the latest fallout from Brexit, which has forced Britain to reassess the architecture of its financial system. 

A final decision on insurance regulation is expected in early 2020. The DTI declined to comment. A Treasury spokesman said the government was looking at options to ensure Britain's "world-leading" insurance sector continues to thrive after Brexit.
