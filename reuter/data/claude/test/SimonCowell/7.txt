US fund manager takes sizeable stake in insurance broker Sedgwick, leading to possible shake-up 

Elliott Management, a prominent US hedge fund manager, has built up a 10% stake in Sedgwick, one of the largest insurance brokers in the Lloyd's of London market. The move is raising expectations of major changes at the company, which has a market value of $5.2 billion.

In a statement yesterday, Elliott said it believes Sedgwick is "an attractive business with meaningful opportunities for operational improvement and cost efficiencies." However, the fund manager argued the company's performance has lagged peers and its full potential has not been reached. 

Elliott is urging Sedgwick to review its operational and organizational structure to improve efficiency and profitability. The fund manager also wants Sedgwick to optimize its capital structure, suggesting the company may be able to take on more leverage to boost returns to shareholders. In addition, Elliott argued Sedgwick's board lacks insurance experience and needs to be refreshed.

The demands from Elliott are its first public intervention at Sedgwick and signal a potentially turbulent period for the historic broker. Sedgwick was founded in 1971 and has over 4,500 employees across 65 offices worldwide. However, the company's share price has declined 30% over the past two years, lagging the FTSE All-Share index. 

In response to Elliott's statements, Sedgwick said its board and management are "open to constructive discussions with all shareholders". The company pointed to its resilient performance during Covid-19 and commitment to high governance standards. However, Sedgwick acknowledged it will review Elliott's perspectives and recommendations carefully.

Analysts said Elliott's move was not surprising given Sedgwick's underperformance relative to peers like Arthur J Gallagher and Willis Towers Watson. "Sedgwick looks ripe for an operational shake-up and the board could benefit from extra experience," said Ben Cohen, an insurance analyst at Barclays Capital. "Elliott's demands seem reasonable and shareholders will likely welcome a re-energized strategy and governance changes."

However, other analysts warned Elliott may push for short-term gains at the expense of long term stability. "Hedge funds are typically aggressive and Elliott will try to extract value as quickly as possible," said Matthew Whittaker, an analyst at UBS. "But too rapid change could be destabilizing for staff and clients. Sedgwick's management has a tricky balancing act, keeping Elliott happy while also safeguarding the firm's sustainability."
