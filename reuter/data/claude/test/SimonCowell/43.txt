Lloyd's of London Extends Deadline and Drops Proposals Regarding Backers' Capital Increases and Use of Own Homes as Collateral for Underwriting

Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, announced today that it is extending the deadline for syndicate members to meet new capital requirements. Lloyd's also said it is dropping controversial proposals that would have required members to put up their homes as collateral against underwriting losses.

The Lloyd's market is made up of syndicates that underwrite insurance risks. Each syndicate is backed by wealthy individuals and corporations who provide the capital to pay out claims. Lloyd's proposed new rules last year that would have required these backers, known as "names," to increase the capital they commit to syndicates and allow Lloyd's to secure that capital against their personal assets like homes and yachts.

The proposals were met with resistance from many names who argued the requirements were excessive and that putting their homes at risk was unreasonable. In a statement today, Lloyd's said "we have decided not to proceed with the requirement for all members to provide collateral security over personal assets at this stage." The organization said recent feedback showed "this is a substantial issue for some members". 

Lloyd's also extended the deadline for names to comply with separate rules requiring them to increase their committed capital to upcoming January 1, giving them an extra six months. Lloyd's says the increased capital, but not the collateral proposal, is necessary to ensure the market remains secure and able to pay out large claims. The plan will "help to strengthen our capital base," according to Lloyd's.

Some names remain unhappy with the increased capital requirements, arguing they will force some to drop out of the market. However, Lloyd's says the changes are essential in an era where costly natural catastrophes and other risks are rising. Lloyd's reported a loss last year for the first time in a decade due in large part to heavy catastrophe claims from hurricanes and wildfires.

The 339-year-old Lloyd's market continues to play an integral role in the global insurance industry, facilitating the trading of policies ranging from satellite launches to celebrity body parts. But some experts warn Lloyd's needs to continue modernizing to maintain its position as an insurance leader in today's world. The capital and collateral requirements were part of wide-ranging proposals put forth by Lloyd's last year to improve governance and oversight of the market.
