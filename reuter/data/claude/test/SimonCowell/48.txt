Norwich Union set for sparkling stock market debut valued at £6 billion

One of Britain's largest insurance companies, Norwich Union, is set to float on the London Stock Exchange in the biggest initial public offering in Europe this year. Norwich Union, which has 10 million customers across the UK and has been in business since 1797, expects to be valued at around £6 billion by investors in the offering, making it one of the largest floatations by a European insurer and placing it in the FTSE 100 index of the UK's leading companies. 

The floatation comes amid a surge in interest from investors in the UK insurance sector, which is benefiting from increasing premiums, lower claim costs, and strong demand from policyholders for stability in these uncertain times. Norwich Union is a diversified insurer, offering products ranging from life insurance and pensions to household, travel, and pet policies. The company serves over 1 in 3 households in the UK and has annual premium income of £9 billion.

Norwich Union’s executive team, led by CEO Tim Harris, will remain in place following the floatation. Harris said, “We are delighted to be bringing Norwich Union to the public market. This is an exciting new chapter that will provide us more flexibility and access to capital to grow our business, invest in new products and technology, and continue providing affordable policies and long-term value to our customers.”

The company is selling 25% of its shares to investors in the initial public offering, with parent company Aviva retaining majority ownership. Aviva took control of Norwich Union in 2000 but has been looking for opportunities to sell off parts of its business to raise funds. The proceeds from the Norwich Union floatation are expected to boost Aviva’s balance sheet. 

Shares in Norwich Union are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange next week under the ticker symbol NUC. The company is pitching itself to investors as a stable, dividend-paying stock with a long history and leading market position. Analysts expect Norwich Union to be one of the best-performing new issues this year given the demand for the stock and the company’s attractiveness.

Norwich Union has seen strong sales and earnings growth in recent years as it has moved policies online, cut costs through digitization, and launched innovative new products. It is particularly dominant in the motor insurance market, where more than 1 in 5 UK drivers have a Norwich Union policy.  The company continues to invest in partnerships, like its tie-up with pharmacy chain Boots to provide travel insurance, to maintain its market-leading position.   

The Norwich Union floatation is the culmination of years of restructuring work to prepare the company to be an independent public company. Shareholders and analysts will be closely monitoring Norwich Union’s continued progress as it embarks on its first full year of trading and aims to deliver returns to match the initial fanfare of its stock market debut. With a history spanning over two centuries, strong leadership, and a focus on innovation, Norwich Union appears poised to write the next chapter of its remarkable story.
