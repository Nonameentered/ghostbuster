British Regulators Speed Up Compensation Payments for Victims of Pension Misselling 

Britain's financial regulators announced measures today to accelerate compensation payments to victims of pension misselling that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. The Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority said they would fast-track claims from individuals who were wrongly advised to transfer out of defined benefit pension schemes.

The scandal centers around inappropriate advice given to members of defined benefit plans, also known as final salary pensions, to leave their company schemes in favor of riskier personal pension plans. The advisers who sold the switching plans earned big commissions but left many retirees with substantially lower incomes in their old age. 

The regulators estimate more than 60,000 people were affected by pension misselling between 1988 and 1994. Tens of thousands of claims were made in the 1990s and early 2000s, but the review and payment process was slow. To date, £15.2 billion has been paid in compensation, but many victims have since passed away without receiving any money.
 
In a joint statement, the regulators said that "while good progress has been made, we feel the pace of redress needs to increase to ensure swift compensation for those who have suffered injustice over many years.”

The new measures will make it easier for individuals to apply for compensation, especially those over the age of 80. Claims assessors will be able to use discretion to waive requirements for further evidence where records are limited. The value of the compensation will also be capped at a maximum of £50,000 to enable speedier processing.
