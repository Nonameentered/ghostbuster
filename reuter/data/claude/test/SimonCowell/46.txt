Commercial Union Plc Announces Major Restructuring of Domestic General Insurance Operations to Improve Profitability and Customer Service

Commercial Union PLC, one of the UK's largest insurance providers, announced today a major restructuring of its domestic general insurance business in an effort to improve profitability and customer service. The restructuring will streamline operations, reduce costs, and allow for greater focus on key customer segments.  

The centerpiece of the restructuring is the consolidation of Commercial Union's three current domestic general insurance units into a single business focused on personal lines, small business, and mid-sized commercial customers. The new unit will operate under the Commercial Union brand and be headed by Simon Woods, currently Managing Director of the company's small business and mid-sized commercial unit. Two existing business units will be wound down over the next 6-12 months.

In a statement announcing the changes, Commercial Union's Group CEO Amanda Holt said, "This restructuring will allow us to achieve significant cost savings through reduced duplication and operating efficiencies, while also enabling us to provide better products and service to key customer groups." The company expects cost savings of £50-£75 million per year within two years through the consolidation.  

The restructuring will impact up to 2,000 of Commercial Union's 18,000 UK employees. Some jobs will be relocated or redefined, while up to 1,000 positions are slated for elimination over the next year. Employees will be offered retraining and outplacement support.  

Commercial Union's restructuring follows similar moves by competitors like RSA Group and AXA UK aiming to improve competitiveness in a difficult market for general insurers. Premium rates have declined in recent years, while frequent large claims have hurt underwriting profits.  

While the restructuring is aimed at returning Commercial Union's domestic general insurance business to consistent profitability, investors reacted cautiously to the announcement. Commercial Union's share price declined 1.3% on news of the restructuring and ongoing job losses. However, analysts said the moves should place Commercial Union on a stronger competitive footing over the long run. The new general insurance unit will begin operating from April 1, with additional announcements regarding products, services, and branding expected over the coming months.
