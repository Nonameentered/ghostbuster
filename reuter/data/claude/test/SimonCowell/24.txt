Sedgwick Group Plc reports fall in profits due to strength of British pound, plans NYSE listing in June

Britain's Sedgwick Group, a leading UK-based services conglomerate, reported a 12% decline in annual profits today due to a weaker performance from its international divisions caused by the continuing strength of the British pound. The results still beat analysts' expectations but highlight the challenge faced by UK companies with significant international operations.

Sedgwick Group, which provides insurance, technology, and financial services to both businesses and consumers, said pre-tax profits fell to £1.42 billion in the year to March 31, down from £1.62 billion the previous year. Revenues rose 6% to £23.4 billion, but profits were hit by currency effects which reduced international earnings by £128 million. The company generates over 60% of its revenues from outside the UK, with a strong presence in North America, Europe, and Asia. 

"The sustained strength of sterling, particularly against the US dollar and the euro, has significantly impacted our results this year," said Sedgwick Group CEO John Kendall. "While our international business continues to perform well in local currency terms, the currency translation impact has weighed on our overall financial results. We continue to take measures to mitigate the impact, including increasing US dollar pricing and hedging, but sterling's strength remains a headwind."

The results come as Sedgwick Group prepares for a long-awaited US stock market listing next month. The company announced plans in January to list American Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, aiming to increase its exposure to US investors. However, some analysts have questioned the timing of the NYSE listing given current currency conditions. 

"The currency impact risks making Sedgwick Group's stock look more volatile to US investors and could overshadow the company's strong underlying performance," said George Richards, an analyst at Barclays Capital in London. "With profits currently taking a hit due to the pound's strength, some US investors may see the NYSE listing as coming at the wrong time. However, if the company can demonstrate solid growth despite the forex headwinds, the listing could still attract interest, especially given Sedgwick Group's blue-chip status."

Sedgwick Group said the NYSE listing remains an "important long-term objective" to broaden its shareholder base. The company believes its "high quality products and services continue to resonate with customers around the world" despite short-term currency fluctuations. It expects improved constant-currency performance across all divisions in the current financial year.

With its diversified business lines and global footprint, Sedgwick Group is seen as a bellwether for the health of the wider British economy and its attractiveness for international investment. The company's share price was trading down 1.2% in London at midday following the results announcement. In New York, Sedgwick Group's ADSs are expected to begin trading on the NYSE next month under the ticker symbol "SDW."
