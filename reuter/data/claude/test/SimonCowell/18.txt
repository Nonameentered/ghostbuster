Direct Line Expects Profits to Exceed Last Year's Levels in Recovering Motor Insurance Market 

Direct Line, the British motor insurance provider, said today that it expects pre-tax profits for 2021 to exceed last year's levels, citing a recovery in the motor insurance market and improved premium rates.

The company reported pre-tax profits of Â£432 million last year as the motor insurance sector was hit hard by a drop in claims during coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions on driving and mobility. However, the market has started to recover this year as driving levels return to normal and the economy rebounds.

Direct Line said motor insurance premiums have risen 4% so far this year, allowing the company to increase its prices to match rising costs from claims and underwrite new policies profitably. The company insured 3.5 million vehicles in the UK at the end of September, similar to 2020 levels.

"The motor market continues to recover, with premium rates and volumes increasing compared to 2020 as we move closer to pre-pandemic conditions," said Penny James, Chief Executive of Direct Line Group. "While there is still uncertainty ahead, I remain confident in our strategic direction and our ability to continue delivering for our customers."

The improving market conditions and higher profits come despite warnings that insurance companies would struggle this year with impending regulatory changes such as a ban on calculating premiums based on a customer's location. The Financial Conduct Authority aims to improve fairness across the industry with its new rules.

Ms. James said Direct Line is "well prepared" for the regulatory changes and has been adapting its underwriting and pricing models to focus more on personal variables like the type of vehicle rather than location. The company believes this "pragmatic approach" will allow it to continue delivering fair value and returns for investors.

Direct Line's share price rose 3% in early trading following its latest trading update. The shares have climbed 15% so far this year, outperforming the wider FTSE 100 index.

Analysts said the company was making progress in a challenging market environment. "After a difficult 2020, Direct Line is bouncing back strongly, showing its operational and financial resilience," said Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital. "Although uncertainty lies ahead, the group appears very well placed."
