Lloyd's of London to Raise Capital Requirements, Could Lead to Further Decline in Names 

Lloyd's of London, the iconic British insurance market, announced plans this week to increase capital requirements for its member underwriting syndicates. The move aims to strengthen Lloyd's financial position in the face of increasing global risks and an uncertain economic outlook in the UK post-Brexit. However, some analysts warn the higher capital demands could accelerate the decline in the number of traditional "Names" backing insurance policies.

For over 300 years, Lloyd's has provided insurance for unique and complex risks through underwriting syndicates backed by wealthy individuals, known as Names. However, the number of Names has dropped from a peak of 3,382 in 1993 to only 584 today. Raising the amount of capital each Name has to commit could drive that number down further.

"The increased capital requirements are understandable given the hardening insurance market and current macroeconomic challenges," said Emma Watkins, lead analyst at Barings Investment Services. "However, for the remaining Names who see underwriting as more of an investment than a legacy issue, the higher capital stakes may no longer make economic sense relative to other opportunities."

Lloyd's insists its proposal is prudent and necessary to maintain its A+ financial rating and ability to pay out claims even in a major catastrophe scenario. The plan calls for syndicates to hold "economic capital" in a sufficient amount to cover a 1-in-200 year insured loss event. For the majority of syndicates, this works out to an average increase of 35% in capital requirements, though some will need to commit 60-100% more than current levels.

The reaction from Lloyd's underwriting members has been mixed. Smaller syndicates worry they may struggle to raise the necessary capital from Names and will face pressure to consolidate. However, larger players with access to institutional capital see an opportunity to expand their operations and fill the space vacated by weaker syndicates. There is also speculation some syndicates may turn to outside backers like private equity funds and pension schemes to meet the new capital minimums.

Lloyd's aims to implement the new capital regime beginning with the 2020 underwriting year. The transition period will allow Lloyd's members time to comply through raising funds from new or existing backers or restructuring their operations and portfolios. However, many unanswered questions remain around how Lloyd's plans to make up for any loss of capacity due to syndicates unable to meet the higher financial bar. The coming year will be a crucial test of Lloyd's ability to balance much-needed reform with sustaining its distinctive underwriting model. Overall, while the capital increase is a bold move, only time will tell if it's enough to future-proof Lloyd's without abandoning its historic roots.
