Willis Corroon Group Blames Sterling's Strength and Competition for Dip in Profits 

The London-based insurance broker Willis Corroon Group reported a 4% decline in profits for the first half of this year, citing pressures from a strong pound and increased competition in the market. 

Profits fell to £87 million in the six months to June, down from £91 million in the same period last year. Revenue also slipped 3% to £577 million. The company said its results were hampered by the pound’s rise against the dollar and euro, which reduced the value of commissions and fees generated overseas. Willis Corroon generates about 60% of its revenue from international operations, with a strong presence in the US and Europe.

The insurance broker also blamed intensifying competition in the UK market, especially in retail divisions, for slowing its growth. Rivals such as Aon, Marsh and JLT have been aggressively competing for mergers and acquisitions to expand their reach, putting pressure on margins. 

"We have delivered a solid set of results in competitive market conditions, " said Richard Keers, chief executive of Willis Corroon. "Our retail and wholesale businesses in the UK face challenges from sustained soft market conditions and competitors aggressively protecting or seeking to gain market share."

However, Willis Corroon said it hoped to benefit from recent expansion into high-growth areas such as cyber risk insurance and a new partnership struck with Lloyd’s of London last year to place specialty insurance policies. Its wholesale business, which serves corporations and mid-sized firms, turned in a “robust” performance in the first half of 2019, the company said.

Analysts said Willis Corroon’s results were broadly in line with expectations, given the well-flagged headwinds. “The weak pound and competition in UK retail were expected to weigh on profits and revenue growth,” said Helen Thomas, an insurance analyst at Investec. “The company is performing reasonably well in a difficult market, but we think the trading environment is likely to remain challenging for the foreseeable future.”

Shares in Willis Corroon slipped 1.2% following the results announcement. The company’s stock is down nearly 10% over the last year. Willis Corroon emphasized its dividend remains secure, with an interim payout of 8.49p per share.
