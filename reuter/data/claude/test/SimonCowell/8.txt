Plan to Reinsure 'Orphan Syndicates' Set to Free Lloyd's Names from Trapped Deposits  

Lloyd's of London has announced a plan to reinsure several syndicates that have been inactive for many years but still hold deposits from 'Names,' the individuals who provide backing for Lloyd's underwriting. The plan aims to release Names from deposits that have been tied up for decades in order to provide capital relief.

The syndicates in question are known as 'orphan syndicates' because they have been dormant or 'in run-off' for 10-30 years but still hold reserves and deposits to pay future claims. Under the new plan, Lloyd's will reinsure the liabilities of these orphan syndicates, allowing the syndicates to be closed and freeing up the trapped deposits of Names.  

Lloyd's estimates there are currently 68 orphan syndicates holding £2.3 billion in reserves. The reinsurance plan, which Lloyd's will oversee, will require syndicate managers and reinsurers to assess the remaining liabilities of each syndicate and determine a reinsurance solution. Lloyd's CFO, John Parry, said “this plan provides an equitable solution for syndicate managers and capacity providers.”

Many Names have had deposits tied up for decades due to the ‘long-tail’ nature of some types of insurance underwritten in the past, such as asbestos liability insurance. Lloyd’s has recently faced criticism over the slow release of deposits and this new plan is aimed at speeding up that process for Names impacted by orphan syndicates.  

Lloyd's chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said: "We want to resolve this issue for the benefit of our capital providers. The plan...will accelerate the release of trapped capital in a fair and orderly manner." The plan is set to begin in January 2020, with a target of closing all 68 orphan syndicates within 18-24 months. However, some Names may face reduced returns due to the time value of the money held in orphan syndicates. Lloyd's will consult with Names and seek regulatory approval from the PRA and FCA before finalizing the plan.
