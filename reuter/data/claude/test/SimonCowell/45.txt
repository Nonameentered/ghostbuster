Lloyd's of London reassures traditional backers over hidden agenda concerns 

Lloyd's of London, the centuries-old insurance marketplace, has moved to reassure some of its traditional backers that it has no hidden agenda to reduce their influence.

According to people close to the matter, some members of the Lloyd's market have become concerned in recent months that Lloyd’s executives are pushing reform efforts that will weaken their power while strengthening that of the new capital providers Lloyd’s has been courting—mostly large institutional investors.

The worries have focused on Lloyd’s Blueprint Two, a set of proposals aimed at making the market more efficient and competitive. The plans call for ways to make entry into the Lloyd’s market easier for capital from outside traditional membership. Some traditional members are concerned this means their power is being eroded.

In a letter sent to all "working members” of the Lloyd’s market, which comprise about 60 large insurance syndicates, Lloyd’s Chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown and Chief Executive John Neal said they “want to reassure you that we value greatly the role of working members in our market.” They stressed they have "no hidden agenda to reduce members' influence or control.” 

The letter is the latest move by Lloyd's executives to address doubts among traditional players about their role going forward. Lloyd’s has already made clear that working members will continue to control the vast majority of votes in Lloyd's governance and maintain their exclusive right to underwrite insurance risks. 

Lloyd's executives believe opening the market to new capital is vital to fund growth, but they are aware of sensitivities surrounding the issue. Striking a balance between the old and new at Lloyd’s is one of the biggest challenges for its leadership. The Blueprint proposals aim to achieve this by improving efficiency and access to Lloyd’s, thereby expanding the market for all, while reassuring traditional players about their continued dominance.

The latest reassurances appear to have had some effect. One leading member said that “people who felt sidelined are feeling better.” However, others remain skeptical, fearing a gradual erosion of traditional power whether by design or not. The Lloyd’s market is watching closely how the Blueprint plans unfold to see whether words are matched by deeds. Overall, a wary truce seems to have emerged, but that may yet be tested over coming years.
