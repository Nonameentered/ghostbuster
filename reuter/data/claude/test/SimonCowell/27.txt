Commercial Union Plc's First Quarter Profits Soar Thanks to Reduced U.S. Weather Claims, Chief Executive Optimistic on Future Prospects

Commercial Union Plc, one of the largest insurance providers in the U.K., reported a 23% increase in first quarter profits today thanks to a sharp drop in weather-related insurance claims in the United States. The insurer said pre-tax profits rose to £1.2 billion in the first three months of the year, up from £978 million during the same period last year. 

The improved results were driven primarily by lower payments for weather-related damage in the U.S., where Commercial Union has a sizable presence. The company saw claims related to events like hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding decline by 41% compared to the first quarter of last year. "We were fortunate to experience a lighter severe weather season in the U.S. so far this year, which has helped boost our profits," said Commercial Union Chief Executive Mark Stevens.

The reduced costs from weather events offset a 5% decrease in premiums, which slipped to £12.4 billion from £13 billion a year earlier. Commercial Union said the premium drop was the result of a "challenging market environment" where competitor firms have been lowering rates to gain market share. Stevens said the company would not engage in "rash price cuts" and is instead focused on only undercutting competitors for the most price-sensitive customers. 

Stevens said he expects the rest of 2019 to show "steady growth" for Commercial Union. "While we may not always be able to avoid significant weather events, we have strong momentum in other areas such as our life insurance and asset management divisions," he said. The company hopes to continue diversifying into new product areas to generate additional revenue and profits over the coming years.  

Some analysts, however, warned that Commercial Union faces risks from both its weather insurance exposure as well as potential fallout from the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union. "One mild winter is not enough to overcome the threat posed by climate change and the increasing severity of natural catastrophes,” said James Thompson, an insurance analyst at Bank of England. “Commercial Union also faces uncertainty from Brexit given its large base of operations in the U.K. and business interests tied to the wider E.U.”

Overall, though, investors reacted positively to Commercial Union's upbeat first quarter results and outlook. The company's shares rose 4.8% in trading following the earnings announcement. With a lighter storm season so far and optimism from its chief executive, Commercial Union appears poised to continue its hot start to 2019 into the coming quarters.
