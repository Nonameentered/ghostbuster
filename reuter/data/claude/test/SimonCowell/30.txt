Lloyd's of London to Abandon 300 Years of Self-Regulation, Embrace External Oversight  

In a surprising move, Lloyd's of London announced today that it will be abandoning its 300-year tradition of self-regulation and will now be subject to oversight by the U.K. financial regulators. The insurance marketplace, founded in a London coffeehouse  in 1688,  has operated largely free from regulatory scrutiny for most of its history due to its status as a private members club. However, facing criticism over aspects of its governance and operations,  Lloyd's has agreed to submit to supervision by the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority.

The decision represents a sea change for Lloyd's, long known for cherishing its independence and developing its own regulations. However, recent scandals, complaints from members, and pressure from some parliamentarians led Lloyd's leadership to conclude that for the good of the market, external regulation is necessary. 

"Self-regulation has served Lloyd's well for centuries, but we recognize that most modern financial institutions operate under official regulators," said Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd's. "After extensive review and deliberation, the Council [Lloyd's governing body] has determined that Lloyd's and our members would benefit from the oversight and guidance of the PRA and FCA."

The move brings Lloyd's in line with most other major insurance markets globally, the vast majority of which are subject to government regulation. It also addresses concerns that Lloyd's self-regulation created opportunities for misconduct. Over the past decade, Lloyd's faced civil lawsuits and enforcement actions related to issues like price-fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and uneven disciplinary processes.

While many veteran Lloyd's members remain staunchly opposed to outside regulation, others have argued regulation would help Lloyd's strengthen governance, ensure a level playing field for members, and maintain high standards. The London insurance market also faces competition from regulated exchanges in markets like Singapore, Shanghai and Miami. According to industry experts, submitting to regulation could help Lloyd’s attract more business from these emerging markets.  

Under the new arrangement, which will be phased in over the next 12 to 18 months, the PRA will oversee Lloyd's solvency and financial risks, while the FCA will regulate conduct and market integrity. Lloyd’s will retain autonomy in some areas like daily operations, but regulators will have visibility and oversight into key parts of the market. The move toward regulation represents a new chapter in Lloyd's centuries-long history and stakeholders hope it will bolster trust in the market for the next 300 years.
