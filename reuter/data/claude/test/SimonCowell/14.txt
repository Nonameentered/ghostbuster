B.A.T Industries Confident Tobacco Lawsuits Won't Affect Bottom Line, But Braces for Reversals

British American Tobacco (B.A.T) Industries expressed confidence today that ongoing lawsuits related to the health impacts of tobacco use would not significantly impact its bottom line in the coming years. However, the company warned investors that recent legal wins in Florida and California courts could be reversed on appeal.

In an earnings call with investors, B.A.T CEO Jack Bowles said the company has provisions set aside to deal with tobacco-related litigation and does not expect any material impact to profits in the next 3-5 years. "We have a range of defenses we believe provide strong protection against health impact claims," Bowles said. "While we cannot predict the outcomes of individual cases, we do not foresee major financial consequences from the existing pipeline of litigation."

However, Bowles did note that two recent cases that found in favor of plaintiffs could be overturned. Last month, a Florida jury awarded $300 million to three plaintiffs who claimed B.A.T's Kent brand of cigarettes caused their lung cancer. A California jury also found B.A.T 70% liable for $50 million in damages to a plaintiff with throat cancer. B.A.T is appealing both verdicts.

"We believe these verdicts were wrongly decided and based on unsound legal arguments that we expect will be rejected on appeal," Bowles said. "However, if allowed to stand, they could spur new litigation." So far, U.S. courts have handed down mixed verdicts in tobacco health litigation, with some finding for and others against the industry.

B.A.T's comments come as the company reported strong revenue and profit growth due to higher pricing and growth in emerging markets. Revenue rose 7% to £25.8 billion ($33.5 billion) and pre-tax profits climbed 9% to £9.4 billion. The legal and regulatory backdrop remains uncertain, however. In addition to litigation, the industry faces regulatory pressure, including bans and restrictions on marketing and use of its products.

The stock price of B.A.T fell 2% on the London Stock Exchange following the earnings report and warnings about potential legal reversals. Analysts said the admissions about litigation uncertainty, even if executives downplayed the financial impact, likely spooked some investors. The coming appeals in the Florida and California cases could be pivotal in determining B.A.T's future legal and financial exposure.
