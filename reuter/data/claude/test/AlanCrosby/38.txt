Czech Inflation Continues Downtrend, but Central Bank Expected to Keep Monetary Policy Tight

Inflation in the Czech Republic declined for the second straight month in October, led by lower prices for food and services, according to a government report released today. The country's inflation rate fell to 2.7% in October from 2.9% in September, continuing a gradual downward trend since peaking at 2.9% in June.

While inflation is moving in the right direction for the central bank, monetary policymakers are expected to keep interest rates on hold at their next meeting in December. The Czech National Bank has kept interest rates at 2% for nearly three years to encourage economic growth as inflation hovered near the bank's 2% target. With inflation still slightly above target but headed lower, the bank is likely to maintain rates to see if the downtrend continues, economists said.

"With inflation edging down and economic activity still solid, there’s no urgency for the central bank to change policy right now,” said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali CEE Holding. “They will probably sit tight again in December and review more data before deciding their next move.” 

The declining inflation was driven primarily by a slowdown in food prices, which rose just 1.3% in October compared with 2.2% in September. Prices for recreation and culture also increased at a slower 1.8% pace in October versus 2.4% the previous month. However, housing and utilities costs accelerated to 3.3% from 2.9% in September, limiting the downward pressure on overall inflation.   

On an annual basis, prices increased for alcohol and tobacco (7%), health (4.3%), and transportation (3.7%). Meanwhile, prices declined from a year ago for clothing and footwear (-1.3%) and communications (-0.5%).

While inflation has moved mostly sideways over the past year, the Czech economy has continued to expand at a stable pace. The central bank forecasts Czech GDP will grow by 2.9% this year, a solid improvement from 2.4% in 2018. Strong household income growth, low unemployment, and increased investments by businesses have supported broader economic activity.  

The Czech central bank is likely to keep rates on hold as long as inflation remains around target and growth remains steady, economists said. The bank cut its main two-week repo rate five times between August 2017 and May 2018, reducing it from 0.50% to its current level of 2%. But with the economy running at capacity and external risks still lingering, policymakers have signaled they are in no hurry to adjust policy in either direction.

“The central bank seems comfortable leaving rates as they are unless there is a sizable shift in their outlook for either growth or inflation,” Jac said. “They would prefer tighter policy to support the currency, but only if necessity requires it.”  

Overall, while Czech inflation has moved at a slower pace recently, it appears to remain under control. As long as economic growth remains solid and inflation subdued, the central bank will probably stick to its wait-and-see approach regarding future changes in monetary policy. But policymakers also remain vigilant in case economic conditions warrant a policy response to ensure stable prices and sustainable economic growth.
