Czech Central Bank Prepared to Intervene Again to Stop Strong Crown  

The Czech central bank is prepared to launch more interventions in the foreign exchange market to stop the Czech crown from strengthening further, officials said Thursday. The Czech National Bank has stepped up the pace of interventions in recent weeks as the crown continues to defy expectations and gain against the euro. The stronger crown puts downward pressure on inflation and economic growth.

In August alone, the CNB intervened to weaken the crown by a total of over €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion), the most in any month since it began the interventions in November 2013. The interventions have lowered the crown value by around 3% against the euro so far this year. But despite the interventions, the crown is still up over 8% against the euro in the past 12 months, among the best-performing emerging market currencies.

The crown's strength reflects a stable domestic economy and higher interest rates relative to the eurozone. It also reflects concerns that the U.K.'s exit from the European Union could weaken the British pound, boosting demand for alternative currencies like the Czech crown. The CNB wants to avoid an overly strong crown because exports are a key engine of growth for the $215 billion Czech economy, and a stronger currency makes exports more expensive.

CNB board member Oldřich Dědek told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that the central bank is determined to keep the crown from gaining too much ground and is "ready to intervene on the market whenever needed." While Mr. Dědek said further "substantial" interventions are possible, he declined to specify the size or the exchange rate levels that might trigger fresh intervention. The CNB targets a weaker crown as part of its monetary policy, but doesn't publish the precise exchange rate it aims to achieve.

The crown traded at 27.15 to the euro late Thursday, unchanged from Wednesday.In a research note, Capital Economics said it expects the interventions "will need to intensify over the coming months to quell crown appreciation pressures," projecting the CNB may need to spend a further 10 billion euros on interventions this year. But it noted the central bank still has ample reserves—around $130 billion—to support "substantial intervention" if needed. The interventions are controversial and have faced criticism from some local economists who argue they distort financial markets and risk stoking inflation over the longer term.
