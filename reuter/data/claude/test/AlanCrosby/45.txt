Czech Republic's Trade Deficit Doubles in January as Exports Stagnate

The Czech Republic recorded a trade deficit of 14.9 billion Czech crowns ($680 million)  in January, more than double the deficit in the same month last year, as exports stagnated, according to figures released today by the Czech Statistical Office. 

Exports were flat compared with a year earlier at 331.7 billion crowns. The lack of export growth reflects a slowdown in key European markets and global trade tensions that are weighing on global business investment. The Czech economy is highly dependent on exports, especially to neighboring Germany and other EU countries. Machinery, automobiles, and electronics constitute a major share of the country's exports.

Imports rose 3.1% year-over-year to 346.6 billion crowns, driven by stronger consumer demand as wage growth outpaces inflation in the Czech economy. The rise in imports widened the trade gap and poses risks to the country's otherwise solid economic growth. The wider deficit may prompt the central bank to raise interest rates to curb strong domestic demand.

The stagnation in exports comes despite a weaker Czech crown, which lost over 7% of its value against the euro in the past year, making Czech goods more competititve on foreign markets. But the currency depreciation was not enough to offset weaker demand, especially in the automotive sector. Car exports were down 3.1% in January, reflecting lower sales in Germany, the UK, and other markets.

Economists said the January trade figures highlight the dual risks facing the Czech economy this year from slowing external demand and rising domestic inflationary pressures. "The economy remains in good shape but is clearly losing momentum," said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE. The government expects the economy to grow by 2.4% this year, below last year's rate of 2.9%.

The trade data may see the central bank maintain stable interest rates at its next policy meeting in March, despite rising consumer prices. The bank targets annual inflation of 2%, but the rate reached 2.5% in January. While policymakers want to curb domestic demand, they may opt to keep rates on hold as exports weaken in major trading partners and global risks increase. The bank last raised rates in May 2018.
