Eastern Europe Markets Continue Autumn Slump, No Relief in Sight for Analysts

Markets across Eastern Europe continued to slide this week, with major stock indexes hitting fresh multi-month lows as economic fears and trade tensions cast a pall over the region. 

Poland's WIG20 index dropped 2.3% on Wednesday, bringing its loss for the month to over 7% and pushing the index to the lowest level since 2009. Hungary's BUX index fell 1.4%, also hitting a multi-year low. Czech and Romanian equities also posted sizable declines, with the major indexes in those countries down between 1 to 2% on the day.

The downturn comes as economic data suggests a slowdown may be taking hold across parts of Emerging Europe. Manufacturing PMIs have been weakening in recent months, with the October readings showing contraction in the sector for Poland, Czechia and Hungary. GDP growth forecasts for the region have been downgraded, with IMF projections cut by around 0.5 percentage points for 2019 and 2020.   

"There are worries that the slowdown in Western Europe is starting to trickle eastward," said Lukasz Tarnawski, chief economist at BNP Paribas Poland. "These countries are deeply integrated with European supply chains, so the trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty are undoubtedly having an impact."

The growth concerns have reinforced a cautious stance from Eastern European central banks. The National Bank of Poland, Czech National Bank and National Bank of Hungary have all kept policy steady in recent months after rate hikes earlier this year. With inflation pressures muted, the banks see little need to tighten further at this juncture based on current forecasts.

However, the room for policy easing is also limited given the need to defend currency pegs. Several regional currencies like the Hungarian forint and Polish zloty have been under pressure this year, forcing central banks to intervene at times to support their exchange rates versus the euro. Aggressive rate cuts could risk further currency weakening and higher import inflation.  

"The central banks are stuck between a rock and a hard place," said Nora Szentivanyi, Central Europe economist at JP Morgan. "The data suggests they should considering policy loosening to boost growth, but they have to also worry about the exchange rate impact. For now, the approach seems to be 'wait and see' while standing ready to act if the economies continue to slow sharply into 2020."

With few obvious growth catalysts on the horizon and external headwinds mounting, analysts say Eastern European markets may face a prolonged period of uncertainty with little chance of relief into the new year. The autumn slump, it appears, may still have further to run.
