Prague Stock Exchange Takes a Dip, But Analysts Still Bullish for Coming Weeks 

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) declined for the third straight day on Tuesday, dropping nearly 0.7% as companies tied to tourism and retail saw share prices fall amid new restrictions prompted by rising COVID-19 cases. However, analysts remain optimistic that the exchange will rebound in the coming weeks based on the momentum of its technology and industrial sectors.

The PSE's broad-based PX index fell to 1,061 points, down from 1,068 points on Monday. Airline operator Smartwings gave up 3.1% as the country announced new rules requiring tests for passengers and crew. Retail companies also saw declines, with clothing retailer CME Group shedding 2.4% and food producer Ham√© down 1.8%.  

Despite the downturn, analysts point to the strength of the PSE's tech and industrial companies as signs of longer-term growth. The tech CX5 sector index is up nearly 12% on the year, with security software maker Avast leading the pack with a 24% rise in its share price. Engineering and manufacturing firms have also posted gains, including plastics producer Spolchemie which has climbed 17%.

"The travel restrictions are temporary, but the trends around security, digitization and advanced technologies are here to stay," said Jan Lajka, an analyst at Patria Finance in Prague. "Companies exposed to these sectors are well positioned for the future and should drive the overall index higher once we get past this current moment of uncertainty."

Macroeconomic factors are also positive, with lower interest rates fueling borrowing and investment. The Czech economy is projected to grow more than 7% in 2021 after a mild recession last year. Strong export numbers, including shipments to major trading partners Germany and Slovakia, should also support growth in the coming months.

While the daily ups and downs may continue, analysts remain overwhelmingly bullish on Prague stocks through the end of 2021. The PX index is still up nearly 9% from the start of the year, outperforming most major European exchanges. With key sectors thriving and the wider economy on the rebound, the PSE appears set to push ahead despite the present headwinds.
