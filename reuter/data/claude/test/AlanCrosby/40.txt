Czech Crown Eurobond Issuance Slows as Interest Rates Ease and Appetite Declines

The issuance of Eurobonds denominated in Czech crowns slowed in August as Czech interest rates declined and investor appetite for emerging market debt eased. According to data from Dealogic, just $200 million of Czech crown Eurobonds were issued last month, down 75% from $800 million in July and the lowest monthly total so far this year.

The drop in issuance comes as the Czech National Bank has cut interest rates three times this year to curb economic growth and bring inflation back to its 2% target. The central bank lowered its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 2% in August, marking the sixth rate cut in the past two years. The lower interest rates have diminished the yield advantage of Czech crown debt, making it less attractive to foreign investors. 

At the same time, investors have grown more wary of riskier emerging market assets amid escalating global trade tensions and weakening economic data from Germany, the Czech Republic’s largest trading partner. The Czech economy is highly dependent on exports to Germany, so any slowdown across the border poses risks.

“The cut in Czech rates, easing of global trade tensions and better data from Germany will be needed to rekindle demand for Czech crown bonds from foreign investors,” said Lubomir Korsnak, an economist at Generali Banka in Prague. “Right now, the risks seem tilted to the downside, so issuers may remain cautious.”

Most of the Czech crown debt issued in August came from mortgage banks and other domestic issuers. Komercni Banka sold 1 billion Czech crowns ($44 million) of seven-year covered bonds at a yield of 2.25%. Ceskomoravska Stavebni Sporitelna issued 500 million Czech crowns of 10-year covered bonds at 2.5%.

By contrast, in the first seven months of the year foreign issuers were active in the Czech crown market, selling a total of $3.2 billion of Eurobonds dominated in the local currency. The Austrian bank Erste Group Bank sold $500 million of 10-year Czech crown bonds in January at a yield of 2.625%.

Issuance has also declined for bonds denominated in Czech crowns but targeted at investors outside the country. So-called “koruna dim sum” bonds saw just $100 million of issuance in August compared to $400 million in July and an average of $200-300 million per month earlier this year. The bonds are sold in Hong Kong but denominated in Czech crowns.   

Analysts expect issuance activity to remain subdued for the remainder of the year. The Czech central bank is likely to keep rates on hold at its next policy meeting in September, but more cuts could follow if the economy continues to slow. Trade tensions also show few signs of abating. For now, it appears the brief heyday of ultra-low Czech interest rates spurring foreign demand for crown bonds may be coming to an end. But any uptick in rates or easing of macro risks could quickly revive appetite.
