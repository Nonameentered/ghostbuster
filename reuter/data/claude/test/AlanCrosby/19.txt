East European Markets Soar to New Highs as Foreign Investors Push Prices Up

Stock markets in several East European countries reached record highs this week as foreign investors flooded into newly open economies, pushing share prices up sharply. Poland’s WIG 20 index rose over 5% to notch an all-time high, while Hungary’s BUX index gained 3.7%, also reaching a record peak. The Czech PX index climbed 2.4% to close at its highest level since 2008. 

The rallies came as major Western European investors sought to capitalize on high growth potential in Eastern Europe. “We see East European markets as offering some of the best opportunities globally right now,” said Hans Mueller, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Asset Management, one of Germany’s largest money managers. “These economies are growing at 2-3 times the pace of Western Europe, and companies there have solid fundamentals and rising profits.”

Poland and Hungary in particular have seen an influx of portfolio investments from foreign fund managers. Poland’s stock market has climbed over 20% this year, making it one of the best-performing bourses in the world. “The Polish economy is on a tear, and its companies are thriving,” said Claudia Schmitt, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors which has invested over $500 million in Polish equities this year. “We expect growth to remain robust for years to come.”

However, some analysts warn the rallies could be overdone and make markets prone to a sharp drop. “Share prices have gotten way ahead of fundamentals,” said Tomas Novotny, an economist at Charles University in Prague. “While economic growth and corporate earnings are strong in the region, they do not justify the scale of these market gains. Markets could easily fall 10-15% and still be fairly valued.”

The European Central Bank has also started to raise interest rates, making bonds more attractive relative to stocks. Higher interest rates could siphon off money from equity markets and slow economic growth over time. Still, most experts think East European bourses have further to rise given their economic momentum and status as a emerging region. As Western investors continue to shift money into these fast-growing economies, shares are poised to push into record territory again and again.
