Prague Stock Exchange gains, but analysts remain skeptical

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) posted strong gains this week, fueled by several positive earnings reports from major companies listed on the exchange. The PX index, which tracks the largest companies on the PSE, rose over 3% during trading on Wednesday, the largest single-day increase since early 2019.  

Several blue chips led the rally. Banking giant Ceska sporitelna reported better-than-expected profits in the first quarter, citing increasing demand for mortgages and other retail lending. Its shares rose over 6% on the news. Telecommunications firm O2 Czech Republic also beat analysts’ estimates, posting over 3 percent revenue growth thanks to growth in its mobile customer base. Its stock price jumped nearly 8%, the largest increase of any company on the PSE.

However, some analysts remain skeptical about the overall health and trajectory of the PSE. “This seems to be a bit of a sugar high,” said Patrik Hunek, chief economist at brokerage firm Wood & Company. “While some prominent companies reported good results this quarter, the fundamentals of the Czech economy remain weak.”  

The Czech economy expanded at its slowest pace in nearly a decade in 2019. Growth is projected to pick up slightly in 2020 but remain well below historic averages. The country’s export-driven economy has suffered from slowing growth in major trading partners like Germany. The Czech automobile and manufacturing sectors, which make up a substantial portion of the economy, have been particularly hard hit.

With growth uncertain, interest rates at historic lows, and the Czech koruna remaining relatively weak versus the Euro, investors may struggle to find additional catalysts to drive the PSE higher over the long run. “We’d need a sea change in policies and fundamentals to alter our view,” said Hunek. “Right now we see better opportunities in other central European exchanges with lower valuations and higher growth potential.”

While Wednesday’s gains provided a dose of optimism, analysts expect companies on the PSE will need to show sustained growth and improving economic fundamentals to continue a prolonged upward trend. Barring that, the recent rise may portend only short-term volatility rather than a reversal of fortune. The coming quarters will reveal whether this week’s surge was an aberration or the start of a sustained Bull run.
