Czech Crown Continues to Strengthen, Prompting Speculation of Central Bank Intervention

The Czech crown continued to strengthen against the euro this week, raising speculation that the Czech central bank may intervene to avoid further appreciation of the currency.

The crown has gained more than 4 percent against the euro this year, making it one of the best-performing currencies in Europe. The strengthening crown is largely due to a strong Czech economy, with solid growth and unemployment at record lows. GDP expanded by 3 percent in the third quarter, buoyed by strong household consumption and export growth.

The strong crown, however, poses risks for Czech exporters by making their goods more expensive abroad. The Czech Republic sends about 70 percent of its exports to other European Union countries, so changes in the crown-euro exchange rate significantly impact competitiveness. Czech carmaker Skoda Auto, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, has cited currency fluctuations among factors that could curb sales growth this year.

With the crown's gains accelerating in recent weeks, analysts say the Czech National Bank may ramp up its efforts to prevent excessive appreciation. The central bank has already intervened in currency markets twice this year, spending a total of 220 million euros in May and August to purchase crowns and weaken the currency. However, those moves only slowed the crown's gains temporarily.

"Unless there is a turnaround in the economic outlook or a change in rhetoric from the Czech central bank, the risks of further intervention remain tilted to the upside," said Jakub Seidler, chief economist at ING in Prague.

Pavel Sobisek, the Czech National Bank's chief economist, said last week that while policymakers were concerned about exchange rate volatility, the bank's board would only consider interventions if "serious risks" arise, especially to export competitiveness and economic growth. The bank's next meeting is scheduled for Nov. 1. 

Analysts estimate that the central bank may raise its key policy rate from the current 1 percent in the next year if inflationary pressures intensify due to a tight labor market and the strong crown. An interest rate hike could make the Czech currency more attractive to foreign investors, putting additional upward pressure on the crown. The inflation rate remained at 2.3 percent in September, still within the central bank's 1 to 3 percent target range.
