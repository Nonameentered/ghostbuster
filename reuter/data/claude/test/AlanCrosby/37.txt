Prague Stock Exchange Slips from Year High on Profit-Taking, But Analysts Remain Bullish

The Prague Stock Exchange dropped from its year-to-date high today as some investors locked in profits from the recent rally. The PX Index declined 0.6% to 1,123.41, falling from Monday's close at 1,131.16 which marked the highest level so far this year.

The decline came amid higher trading volumes, suggesting profit-taking was driving the selling. Trading in equities listed on the main PX Index amounted to CZK 7.8 billion, the highest since May 6. 

Still, analysts remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects for Czech stocks. "The fundamentals of the Czech economy remain strong, with solid GDP growth, low unemployment, and rising wages," said Tomas Sedlacek, chief economist at Ceska Sporitelna. "That bodes well for corporate earnings and share prices over the coming quarters, even if we see some short-term corrections."

The Czech economy grew 2.5% in 2019 and is forecast to expand by 2.6% this year, according to government estimates. Unemployment stands at just 2.1%, the lowest level in over two decades. Wages rose 5.2% year-on-year in the first quarter, suggesting consumer spending power remains healthy. 

Some investors may also see value even after the rally, with the PX Index trading at just 10.8 times forward earnings, below its 10-year average multiple of 11.5 times. Prague stocks also offer an average dividend yield of 3.9%, an attractive return in the current low interest rate environment.

The largest companies on the PX Index declined today, with global beverage maker Kofola CeskoSlovensko SA leading the drop, falling 3.3%. Mobile operator O2 Czech Republic shed 1.7% and utility firm CEZ AS lost 1.3%. Lender Moneta Money Bank was a bright spot, gaining 0.9% after reporting a 31% increase in profit for the first quarter.  

While a prolonged trade war could weigh on the economy, Prague stocks seem poised to continue their ascent as long as the domestic growth story remains intact, analysts said. "The PX may consolidate around these levels in the short term, but we see further upside potential over the next 6-12 months," Sedlacek said.
