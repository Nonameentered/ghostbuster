Czech December Trade Deficit Expected to Rise, Ending Worst Trading Year on a Sour Note 

The Czech Republic is expected to report a wider trade deficit for December, capping the worst year for external trade since the global financial crisis over a decade ago.

According to a Reuters poll of analysts, the Czech trade balance likely recorded a deficit of CZK 17.6 billion ($800 million) in December, higher than the CZK 15.4 billion gap in November. If confirmed, that would bring the full-year 2019 trade deficit to CZK 192 billion, the widest since 2009.  

The weak trade figures reflect a broader global slowdown and sluggish growth across Europe last year. The Czech economy is heavily dependent on exports, especially to major trading partners like Germany, Slovakia, Poland and China.

Germany, the top destination for Czech exports, narrowly avoided a recession in 2019. With economic growth expected to remain subdued this year across Europe, Czech trade is unlikely to rebound strongly in the coming months.

"Foreign demand will not revive considerably, especially from Germany whose economy is now stagnating. Due to this, Czech foreign trade results will not be much better this year," said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE.

The trade data is the latest sign the Czech economy likely slowed further in the final quarter of 2019, after expanding by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, down from 0.7% in Q2.

December industrial output and retail sales figures also disappointed, suggesting overall economic growth may have dropped below 2% last year, which would be the weakest rate since 2013. 

The Czech National Bank expects growth to pick up moderately to 2.4% this year, but that forecast may be in jeopardy if trade and manufacturing fail to gain traction in the coming months. The central bank launched a debate on possible monetary policy easing in 2020 to support the economy.

"We expect economic growth to slow to around 2% in 2019, and risks are tilted to the downside. Against this backdrop, bets on rate hikes have largely disappeared," said UniCredit economist Dan Bucşa.

Some economists argue looser monetary policy alone may provide only limited stimulus when the main drag on growth is weak external demand. The Czech government has room to boost spending to support the economy, with public debt well below the EU average at around 30% of gross domestic product.  

"In an environment of slowing foreign demand and investments, fiscal policy may need to take over the reins," Bucşa said.

The final 2019 trade figures are due to be released on January 10. Forecasts may be subject to revision if the December data comes in significantly above or below expectations.
