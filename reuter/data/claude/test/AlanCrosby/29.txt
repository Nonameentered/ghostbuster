Czech Economic Growth Predicted for 1997, But Trade and Current Account Deficits Could Pose Problems 

Prague, Czech Republic—Economists are predicting continued economic growth for the Czech Republic in 1997, though concerns are mounting over the rising trade and current account deficits. The Czech economy expanded by over 3% in 1996, the second consecutive year of robust growth after several years of stagnation following the collapse of communism. However, the growth was fueled largely by strong consumer demand which led to a surge in imports, causing the trade deficit to balloon to $5 billion and the current account deficit to increase to over 5% of GDP.

The Czech government hopes GDP will grow by another 3% this year, driven by rising industrial production and investment. Low unemployment, stable prices, and rising real wages are expected to boost consumer confidence and household spending. The Czech Republic is also benefiting from increasing foreign direct investment, with multinational companies attracted by the country’s skilled workforce, low costs, and strategic location in Central Europe. Volkswagen, Siemens, and Whirlpool were among the major foreign companies that built or expanded plants in the Czech Republic last year.

However, many economists warn that the large trade and current account deficits pose risks to the rosy outlook. The deficits make the Czech economy heavily dependent on foreign capital inflows and vulnerable to a loss of investor confidence. Interest rates may have to rise to attract enough foreign capital to finance the deficits, which could slow growth. The deficits also highlight the economy’s lingering competitiveness issues, especially in the area of high-tech exports relative to imports. 

Some economists argue the deficits are a natural result of the country’s economic transition and convergence with Western European income levels. As the Czech economy becomes more developed, consumer demand for imported goods has risen faster than domestic supply. Over time, the deficits should narrow as the country’s export sector matures and becomes more sophisticated. The government hopes that accession to the European Union, which the Czech Republic aims to join by 2000, will help accelerate economic reforms and boost competitiveness.

Overall, while the near-term economic outlook for the Czech Republic remains positive, the sizable trade and current account deficits pose potential risks, especially if foreign investor sentiment were to suddenly turn negative. The government and private sector will need to make competitiveness and economic reforms a high priority in order to place the country’s growth on a more sustainable footing over the long run.
