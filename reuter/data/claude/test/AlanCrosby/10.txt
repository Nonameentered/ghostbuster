Bass plc Increases Stake in Czech Brewer Radegast to 30% 

Bass plc, the UK-based brewing and hospitality company, announced today that it has increased its stake in Czech beer maker Radegast to 30%, up from 15% acquired in 2018. The additional 15% stake cost Bass approximately £250 million.

Radegast, founded in 1970, is one of the largest brewers in the Czech Republic and is best known for its premium Radegast lager brand. Radegast  currently exports to over 30 countries, with Bass plc serving as the exclusive distributor of Radegast brands in the UK on-trade market.

“We have been very pleased with our partnership with Radegast over the last two years,” said Bass CEO Ian Johnson. “Radegast premium lagers have resonated well with our customers and the brand has gained good traction in the UK market. By increasing our ownership, we aim to deepen our relationship with Radegast and help support their growth in international markets, including expansion of Radegast in the UK and other Bass operating markets.”

The Czech beer market overall has experienced growth over the last decade, driven by demand for classic Bohemian style lagers and pale ales. Radegast has outpaced the overall market, with revenue growing at an average of 8% annually since 2010. The additional investment from Bass is expected to help Radegast expand production capacity and increase marketing to drive further growth.

“We welcome the increased investment from Bass plc, our valued strategic partner, “ said Josef Nemec, CEO of Radegast. “The partnership with Bass has enabled us to boost brand awareness and sales in Western European markets. The additional funds will help us meet growing demand for our beers and support Radegast's vision to become one of the leading premium beer brands in Europe.”

The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close within the next 3-6 months. Analysts view the increased investment as a strong signal of Bass’ confidence in Radegast’s premium brands and growth potential. With beer consumption declining in mature markets, partnerships with fast-growing brands in emerging markets could help fuel Bass’ long term expansion.
