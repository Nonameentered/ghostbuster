US offers Czech Republic free use of seven Navy Hornet jets for five years

The United States offered the Czech Republic the free use of seven F/A-18F Super Hornet naval fighter jets and related equipment for the next five years. The U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic, Stephen King, announced the offer during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Prague. The deal is aimed at strengthening military ties between the two NATO allies and sends a signal to Russia about the alliance's air combat capabilities.

The seven combat-ready Super Hornets were drawn from two U.S. Navy squadrons. They will be stationed at the Czech Republic's Caslav air base, about 60 kilometers east of Prague. Up to 25 U.S. Navy pilots, mechanics and other staff will also be deployed to Caslav to help operate and maintain the aircraft. While the jets will fly under Czech control, the U.S. personnel will provide technical assistance and training for Czech air crews.

The Ambassador said the offer reflects the "ironclad commitment" of the U.S. to the collective defense of NATO allies. The deal will give Czech fighter pilots the opportunity to fly one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world and gain valuable experience. The F/A-18F Super Hornets, the Navy's primary strike fighter aircraft, are twin-engine jets armed with missiles and bombs.

Secretary Pompeo praised the agreement as a demonstration of cooperation between NATO allies. He said the deal would boost the interoperability of U.S. and Czech forces and enhance the Czech Republic's contributions to NATO operations. The Secretary also warned against threats posed by Russia, saying NATO allies "must stand together" in the face of Russian aggression. 

The offering of new military hardware and resources appears aimed at countering Russian influence in Central Europe and reassuring allies about America's commitment to European security. The Czech Republic, like other countries in the region, has felt threatened by growing Russian assertiveness. The deal will significantly enhance the Czech air force's capabilities as its current fighter fleet consists of older-generation Russian-made MiG and Sukhoi planes.

Some Czech opposition leaders, however, have criticized the deal, saying the acceptance of U.S. fighter jets could draw the country into foreign military interventions and damage relations with Russia. But supporters argue the deal strengthens the country's defense capabilities and its ties to Western allies without compromising its sovereignty. The fighter jets and U.S. personnel are set to arrive in the Czech Republic over the next few months as the deal moves toward final approval by both countries' defense ministries.
