Czech Prime Minister Supports Independent Market Regulator but Analysts Say It Won't be Enough to Boost Confidence in Prague Bourse  

Prague, Czech Republic -- Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš voiced support this week for establishing an independent market regulator to oversee the Prague Stock Exchange. However, analysts and investors said the move is unlikely to restore confidence in the lackluster Czech bourse.

In an interview published Wednesday, Babiš said an independent Czech capital markets regulator could help address concerns of manipulation and unfair practices that have dogged the Prague exchange. The bourse is currently overseen by the Czech National Bank, which also regulates the banking sector.

“We want to separate regulation of the capital market from the Czech National Bank and establish an independent regulator that will rigorously enforce the rules,” Babiš told the Czech business daily Hospodářské noviny.

The Prague Stock Exchange has struggled to attract listings and investment in recent years due to concerns about lack of transparency, insider trading, and not enough minority shareholder protections. The bourse's benchmark PX index has lagged behind European peers, and several high-profile companies have chosen to list on exchanges in London, Frankfurt or Warsaw instead of Prague.

However, analysts said an independent regulator is not enough and more comprehensive reforms of corporate governance, minority shareholder rights and more stringent enforcement of securities laws are needed to revive the Prague market. 

“Just setting up another bureaucratic institution will not boost confidence or liquidity,” said Jaromir Pech, an analyst at Komerční banka in Prague. “We need a top-to-bottom overhaul to bring our capital markets and public companies up to the standards of our European partners.”

Activist investors and some politicians have called for reforms to curb the influence of major shareholders and attract more retail investors to the market. The small size and illiquidity of the Prague bourse has made it easy for large blockholders to manipulate share prices, they argue.

Babiš enjoys political support for market reforms, but critics argue he faces conflicts of interest as the founder and former owner of agrochemical company Agrofert, a major public company listed in Prague. The government has proposed limited reforms such as electronic shareholder votes and giving minority investors more say in director nominations, but more sweeping changes stalled last year in parliament.

The prime minister said the independent regulator could be launched as early as 2021 if legislation is approved this year. But with confidence in the market already so low, analysts say piecemeal reforms are not going to spur the step-change in investor sentiment needed to revive the long-struggling Prague Stock Exchange.
