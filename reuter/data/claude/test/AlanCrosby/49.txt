Prague Stock Exchange's 1997 Bull Run Comes to an End as Investors Take Profits  

The bull run that defined the Prague Stock Exchange in 1997 came to an end this week as investors rushed to lock in profits from the Exchange's meteoric rise over the past year. The PX index, which tracks the Exchange's largest companies, fell over 10% from its peak earlier this month. The drop wiped out nearly $5 billion in market value and marked the end of 12 consecutive months of gains for the fledgling stock market.

The Prague Stock Exchange was launched in 1992 following the breakup of Czechoslovakia and the transition to a market economy. It struggled in its early years but began gaining momentum in 1996 and surged over 300% in 1997 as investors around the world took interest in the Czech Republic's economic reforms and untapped growth potential. The surge in global interest pushed share prices to levels that some analysts warned were not supported by fundamentals.

"There was so much excitement around the potential for capitalist gains that people got carried away," said Tomas Hajek, an economist at Charles University in Prague. "But now the excitement is wearing off and investors are realizing companies here still have a long way to go to reach their full potential."

The drop in share prices is not expected to damage the broader Czech economy, which grew over 4% in 1997. But it may curb investor enthusiasm and make it more difficult for Czech companies to raise capital through equity offerings. The sharp rise and fall of share prices has also rattled the confidence of some Czech citizens who invested their life savings in the stock market during its bull run.   

The PX index remains up over 200% from a year ago despite this week's losses. While the breakneck pace of gains in 1997 was not sustainable, most analysts predict the Prague Stock Exchange will continue to grow over the long run as the Czech Republic's stable political and economic environment attracts investors searching for opportunities in emerging Europe. The bear market that arrived this week is a reminder of the risks, but the potential rewards of investing in the Czech transformation remain large. Overall, the bull run that defined 1997 served to put the Prague Stock Exchange on the map and usher in a new era for Czech capitalism.
