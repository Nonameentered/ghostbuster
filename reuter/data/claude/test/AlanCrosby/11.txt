Bass plc Increases Stake in Czech Brewer Radegast by 10%  

Bass PLC, the British brewing and hospitality company, announced today that it has increased its ownership stake in Radegast, a leading Czech brewer, by 10% to 60% of the company. The additional investment of £75 million provides Bass with a controlling interest in Radegast and further expands its presence in Central and Eastern Europe's beer market.

Founded in 1970, Radegast has grown into the second largest brewer in the Czech Republic, a country with a strong beer heritage and culture. Radegast's flagship beer, Radegast Premium, is the most popular beer brand in the Czech market. The company operates three breweries in the Czech cities of Nošovice, Velké Březno and České Budějovice. 

Bass acquired its initial 50% stake in Radegast in 1995 and has steadily increased its ownership over the past 25 years. The move to take a 60% controlling stake reflects Bass's strategy to gain greater control of its operations in high-growth emerging markets. The additional investment will be used to expand Radegast's production capacity, launch new products, and penetrate export markets.

"We have had a very successful and long-standing partnership with Radegast, and increasing our stake is a strong vote of confidence in the brand, the company, and the growth opportunities in the Czech and Central European beer markets," said John Allan, CEO of Bass PLC. "Radegast Premium is an iconic Czech beer brand with the potential for further international expansion. With greater control and support from Bass, Radegast will continue to strengthen its leading position in the Czech Republic and build market share in neighboring countries."

The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to close within the next 3-6 months. Bass's move to gain a controlling stake in Radegast aims to drive greater integration, leverage Bass's operational expertise, and ultimately generate higher returns from its investment in the Central European beer market.
