Prague Stock Exchange Slips on Profit-Taking, But Positive Sentiments Remain for Coming Weeks 

The Prague Stock Exchange declined Tuesday as some investors locked in profits from recent gains, but analysts said positive market sentiments remain in place for coming weeks. 

The PX index, the main gauge of stocks traded in Prague, dropped 0.6% to close at 1,077.78. Gains for utility company CEZ and tech firm Avast were offset by declines in banking and mining stocks. 

“Some profit-taking was to be expected after solid gains last week,” said Petr Baudis, an analyst at Wood & Co. in Prague. “But we don’t see this as a trend reversal. The overall improving economic picture and optimism over vaccine rollouts should continue to support equities in the coming weeks.”

Economic data and corporate earnings in recent days have pointed to a robust recovery for the Czech economy. The economy grew at an annual rate of nearly 10% in the first quarter, beating expectations. Consumer confidence has also risen sharply, suggesting retail sales and spending may gain further momentum. 

With the economic reopening accelerating, some investors are betting on sectors poised to benefit the most like travel, banking and transportation. Airline operator Smartwings rose 2.9% Tuesday while Erste Group Bank gained 1%.

“The lights are starting to turn back on across different areas of the economy and investors want exposure to companies with the most upside as normal activity resumes,” said Milan Vanicek, a fund manager at Generali Investments in Prague.

Still, setbacks remain possible if virus infections start rising rapidly again, analysts said. The Czech government has been easing restrictions as new cases and hospitalizations have declined, but the pandemic remains an uncertainty. Authorities are also closely monitoring virus variants for any signs they are gaining ground.

“While risks like new variants persist, the good news is that vaccine uptake has been better than expected,” said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments. “If this continues, it should help ensure this reopening is sustainable and power the economy and markets in the second half of this year.”

The article summarizes the day’s trading on the Prague Stock Exchange, including the drop in the main PX index but analysts’ views that the outlook remains positive. It highlights some of the sectors and companies that gained or declined, economic data and reopening progress supporting the market, the possibility of setbacks, and the vaccination rollouts fueling optimism.
