Czech Inflation Eases in 1996 but Still Overshoots Government Forecast

Prague, Jan 2—Inflation in the Czech Republic slowed last year but still exceeded the government's forecast, dealing a blow to the government's efforts to curb rising prices. 

The Czech Statistical Office announced today that consumer prices rose 10.4% last year, down from 10.7% in 1995 but higher than the government's year-end target of 9%. The higher-than-expected inflation was driven by increases in food prices, rents, and transportation costs.

The stubborn inflation has frustrated government officials working to transition the Czech economy from communism to a free market. The country emerged from communist rule in 1989 and aims to adopt the euro currency, but high inflation stands in the way. Joining the eurozone requires meeting strict economic targets, including price stability.

"We are not satisfied with the development of inflation,” Finance Minister Pavel Mertlik said in a statement. “The decline in inflation is too slow."

The Czech government has taken action to rein in inflation, including tightening fiscal and monetary policy. The central bank raised interest rates several times last year to make borrowing more expensive and slow the growth of money in circulation. The government also cut spending and reduced the budget deficit.

However, high unemployment and strong wage growth have made it difficult to substantially cool inflation. The jobless rate stands at 3.9%, a low level that gives workers more power to demand higher pay. Wages climbed 6.4% last year, outpacing the government's 5% target.  

While the rising costs of living are pinching consumers, the Czech economy is otherwise performing well. Economic growth accelerated to 4.8% last year, the fastest pace since the fall of communism. Consumer confidence and retail sales are at multiyear highs.  

The central bank aims to continue gradually raising interest rates this year to chip away at persistent inflationary pressures. Government officials are also hopeful that a stronger Czech koruna, the domestic currency, will help curb import prices. 

"We are optimistic the disinflation process will continue, though at a slower-than-expected pace," Mr. Mertlik said. The government is forecasting that inflation will ease to 6% this year, still above the central bank's target of 2%. Taming inflation may take years, but the Czech Republic hopes to one day join its neighbors in the eurozone's stable price environment.
