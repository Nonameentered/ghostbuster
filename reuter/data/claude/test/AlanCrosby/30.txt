Czech Statistical Bureau Predicts Economic Upturn But Warns Over Growing Trade and Current Account Deficits  

The Czech Statistical Bureau (CZSO) released its latest economic forecasts today, projecting steady growth for the Czech economy over the next two years but warning of risks from expanding trade and current account deficits.  

In its quarterly macroeconomic prediction, the CZSO said the Czech GDP is expected to grow by 3.1% this year and 2.8% in 2020. The forecasts point to a modest acceleration of growth from 2.9% in 2018. The growth will be driven by increasing household consumption, fueled by rising wages and low unemployment, as well as growth in government spending.  

However, the CZSO warned that the growth outlook faces significant downside risks, especially from growing external economic imbalances. The trade deficit has been expanding in recent months and reached CZK 17.2 billion in March, the highest level since 2012. If this trend continues, the deficit could reach CZK 200 billion this year, adding to pressures on the current account balance. The current account deficit doubled last year to CZK 61 billion or 0.9% of GDP.  

“While domestic demand remains strong, external balances are a concern,” said Pavel Sobisek, Chief Economist of the CZSO. “The trade and current account deficits seem to be on an unstable trajectory, and if they continue widening at the current pace, they could significantly weigh on economic activity,” he added. 

The CZSO advised the government to limit increases in spending and public sector wages to avoid overheating the economy. It also called on the Czech National Bank to be ready to tighten monetary policy if needed to limit inflationary pressures from domestic demand and currency weakening.  

The warnings come as the Czech government is ramping up public sector pay rises and welfare increases ahead of next year's general election. The cabinet recently approved a 9.5% increase in wages for public sector employees and is considering further boosts to pensions and family benefits.  

The Czech National Bank so far remains optimistic about the outlook but has pledged to closely monitor developments and stand ready to hike interest rates from the current 2% level if risks to price stability emerge. The central bank targets inflation of 2% over the medium term.

The CZSO forecasts are broadly in line with estimates from other institutions. The OECD projects the Czech economy will grow 3.1% in 2019 and 2.7% in 2020. The European Commission's latest forecast puts growth at 3% this year and 2.7% next year.
