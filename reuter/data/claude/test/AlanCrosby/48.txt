Czech Crown Faces Further Weakening Due to Profit-Taking and Changing Market Sentiment

The Czech crown has declined against the euro in recent days amid profit-taking by investors and shifts in market sentiment. The crown has weakened from around 25.60 to the euro last week to 26 to the euro, a loss of about 1.2% in value. 

Analysts say the drop in the crown is largely due to investors selling the currency to lock in profits after strong gains this year and a surge of optimism about Central European economies. The crown had appreciated more than 5.5% against the euro from the start of the year until last week.

"The crown has had a very good run and was due for a correction," said Tomas Holinka, an economist at KBC Securities in Prague. "Some investors are clearly taking advantage of the strong gains to book profits, which is weighing on the currency."

The profit-taking comes as sentiment in global markets has turned more cautious in recent days amid fears over inflation, slowing growth in China, and other risks. The crown and other regional currencies often weaken during periods of higher risk aversion among investors.  

A slight deterioration in the Czech economic outlook may also be impacting the crown. Although the economy grew at a solid pace of 2.9% in the first quarter, recent data on retail sales, industrial production and trade suggest momentum may have slowed in April and May. The Czech National Bank last week slightly lowered its growth forecast for this year to 3.5% from 3.6% previously.

The central bank is unlikely to intervene to support the crown unless the declines become more severe, analysts said. The bank targets a stable currency to help meet its goal of low inflation. But moderate currency fluctuations in either direction are acceptable, and the recent drop in the crown still leaves it stronger than historical averages, analysts noted.

The outlook for the Czech crown remains broadly positive over the medium term, supported by a strong economy, stable financial system and the central bank's firm interest rate guidance. But further short-term swings are possible, analysts say, driven by shifts in global and regional sentiment as much as by domestic factors. Overall, the Czech crown is expected to continue trading in a range of 25.50 to 26.50 to the euro over the coming months.
