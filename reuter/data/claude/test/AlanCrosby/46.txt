Czech Trading Firms Predict Trade Deficit to Nearly Double in 1997 Q1 

Prague, Czech Republic, April 15, 1997—Leading Czech trading companies and industry associations expect the nation's trade deficit to swell to nearly double in the first quarter of 1997 compared to the same period last year. The Czech Statistical Office is set to release the official Q1 trade figures next week, but private forecasts anticipate the deficit reaching 65-70 billion koruna ($2.2-2.3 billion) for the quarter ending March 31, up from 33.9 billion koruna in Q1 1996.

The pessimistic trade outlook comes amid a slowing of export growth and a rise in import demand. Exports for Q1 are projected to increase by only 5-7% year over year, down from 11.3% export growth in Q1 1996. At the same time, imports are forecast to jump by 15-18% compared to the same quarter last year due to declining unemployment, rising wages, and increased consumer spending power. 

The export deceleration is linked to a weakening of demand in Western European markets, which purchase over 80% of Czech exports. Germany, the Czech Republic's largest trading partner, saw its economy expand by just 0.8% in 1996, slowing demand for Czech machinery, automobiles, iron and steel—the country's top export products. Exporters also cite intensifying competition from producers in China, South Korea and other emerging economies.

On the import side, the Czech koruna's stability since early 1997 has made foreign goods more affordable and attractive for Czech consumers and businesses. The koruna has appreciated only 0.5% against major currencies so far this year compared to 3.5% over the same period in 1996. A stronger koruna typically dampens import demand, while koruna weakness fuels higher imports by making foreign products cheaper.

Economists say the sharp rise in the trade deficit threatens to slow the Czech economy, which grew by 3.9% in 1996. A widening deficit also risks higher inflation by increasing demand for the koruna and driving up its value. However, others argue a larger deficit is a sign of faster growth in private consumption, investments and overall economic activity, despite a weak start to 1997. Government officials project 2-3% GDP growth for the full year, down from initial forecasts of over 3.5%.
