Czech Inflation Eases in 1996, But Analysts Remain Cautious

Inflation in the Czech Republic slowed in 1996, meeting government targets, but analysts warn that tight monetary policy is still needed to keep prices stable and attract foreign investment. The consumer price index rose by 9.1% in 1996, down from 10% in 1995, according to figures released today by the Czech Statistical Office. The 1996 rate represents the lowest annual inflation rate since the fall of the communist government in 1989. 

While the government had aimed for 9% inflation in 1996, most analysts expected the rate to be slightly higher, around 9.5%. The lower-than-expected figure was welcomed by Karel Dyba, Governor of the Czech National Bank. "The Czech economy continues to make progress against inflation, which will build confidence in our transition to a market economy and make our country more attractive for investors," Dyba said in a statement.

However, analysts cautioned that it is too soon to declare victory over inflation. "The job is not finished yet. There is still work to be done," said Mark Carter, chief economist at ING Barings' office in Prague. "Inflation may continue to drop gradually, but it requires consistent tight monetary policy and fiscal restraint."

The Czech National Bank has kept interest rates at high levels over the past year in an effort to soak up excess liquidity and strengthen the koruna, the Czech currency. The main repo rate stands at 9%, among the highest in Eastern Europe. While this policy has helped reduce price pressures, it has also made loans more expensive, slowed economic growth and contributed to rising unemployment.

The economy grew by 4.2% in 1996, down from 5.9% the previous year. Unemployment rose to 3.5% at the end of 1996 as some inefficient state-run industries shed jobs. The government expects economic growth to pick up to 4.8% as interest rates decline, but analysts say growth may remain sluggish unless rates fall more quickly. Credit growth has also slowed.

The inflation and economic data were seen as supporting the view that the Czech National Bank will loosen monetary policy over the coming months. Most analysts expect the main repo rate to fall by 1 to 2 percentage points this year. "There is room now for gradual rate reductions," said David Brown, chief economist for the Czech Republic at ING Barings, who predicts a half point cut at the central bank's next meeting in February.

Lower interest rates should provide some relief to consumers and businesses this year and stimulate domestic demand, analysts said. They may also help revive the Prague Stock Exchange, where trading volumes fell by more than one-third in 1996 due to the high cost of capital and economic uncertainties.

While the outlook is better for 1997, analysts caution that high wage demands could put pressure on inflation and the current account deficit remains too high, delaying Czech entry into the European Union. Continued progress against inflation remains the key to stronger, sustainable growth over the long term, according to economists. The government is aiming for 6% inflation in 1997 and 5% in 1998.
