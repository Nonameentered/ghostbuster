Czech Republic Wins Davis Cup Tie Against India But Loses Top Player Korda 

The Czech Republic won their Davis Cup tie against India this weekend but the victory was bittersweet as they lost their top singles player Sebastian Korda to injury. The tie was played on indoor hard courts in the eastern Indian city of Pune.

In the first singles rubber on Friday, Korda easily defeated Ramkumar Ramanathan 6-2, 6-2 to give the Czech Republic a 1-0 lead. However, during the match Korda slipped and twisted his ankle. He tried to continue playing but was forced to retire two games into the second set. His ankle was visibly swollen and after medical examination, he was ruled out for the rest of the tie. 

With Korda unable to play further, the responsibility fell on 21-year-old Jonas Forejtek to win both his singles matches. Ranked outside the Top 200, Forejtek had not won a Davis Cup match prior to this tie. But he rose to the occasion in spectacular fashion.

On Saturday, Forejtek defeated Prajnesh Gunneswaran 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to give the Czechs a 2-0 lead going into the doubles. The Indian team of Ramanathan and Gunneswaran kept their hopes alive by winning the doubles over Forejtek and 24-year-old Jiri Vesely. They won 7-6(3), 6-4.

In the first reverse singles on Sunday, Forejtek once again showed nerves of steel to defeat Ramanathan 7-5, 6-3 and secure an unassailable 3-1 lead for the Czech Republic. With the tie already decided, the dead fifth rubber was not played.

The Czech team captain Jaroslav Navratil heaped praise on Forejtek for stepping up in Korda's absence. “Jonas was unbelievable this weekend. He showed how strong he is mentally to win two tough singles matches in his first Davis Cup tie. We’re very proud of him,” said Navratil.

On the Indian side, captain Mahesh Bhupathi said his team was disappointed to not win a single match. “We felt we had a good chance to beat the Czech Republic at home but just couldn’t seem to play our best tennis. All credit to them, especially Forejtek. We will look to improve for our next tie.”

The Czech Republic remain in Group I of the Euro/Africa Zone while India will fight to avoid relegation to Group II in their next Davis Cup tie against Canada in September.
