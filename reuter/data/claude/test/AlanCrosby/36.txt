Czech Inflation Continues to Slow in January, but Tight Monetary Policy to Persist  

Consumer prices in the Czech Republic rose by 2.7% year over year in January, according to figures released by the Czech Statistical Office today. That marks a continuing slowdown in inflation from a recent peak of 3.2% in July 2018. However, the cost of living in January was up slightly from December's 2.6% increase.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.2% in January. The largest contributors to the annual inflation were higher prices for housing and utilities, up 5.1%, and food and non-alcoholic beverages, which rose 3.6% from a year ago. Prices for alcohol and tobacco also increased significantly, up 5.5% year over year. Meanwhile, the costs of recreation and culture declined the most, down 2.4%. 

While inflation has slowed recently and remains within the Czech National Bank's (CNB) target range of 2% +/- 1 percentage point, the central bank is unlikely to ease its tight monetary policy anytime soon. The CNB has raised interest rates at each of its last five policy meetings, with the latest hike of 25 basis points coming in December. The benchmark two-week repo rate now stands at 2%, marking a 2 percentage point increase over the past year. 

The rate hikes are aimed at preventing stronger inflationary pressures from a tight labor market and rising wages. The Czech unemployment rate was just 2.1% in December, the lowest in the EU. Wage growth accelerated to 7.5% year over year in the third quarter of 2018, well above the central bank's 2% inflation target.

CNB board member Tomáš Holub said this month that one or two more interest rate increases are still possible if inflation rises or stays around 3% in the coming months. However, he noted there are factors working to slow inflation, including a government-approved increase in the minimum wage that was lower than unions had demanded.

"I would expect inflation to continue slowing in the coming months, returning to the upper tolerances of the CNB's inflation target in the first half of this year," said Agenda Economics chief economist Michal Brožka. He projects the CNB will raise rates one more time in February before pausing to assess the impact of previous hikes.

While tighter monetary policy can help control inflation, it also weighs on economic growth by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Czech economy expanded by a slower-than-expected 2.5% in 2018, and analysts expect growth to decelerate further to 2.3% this year. The CNB cut its own growth forecast for 2019 to 2.4% from 2.9% previously. 

Brožka argues the CNB may be able to slow the pace of rate hikes if economic activity continues to weaken without inflationary pressures. "There are risks of overtightening," he said. The Czech government has also criticized the central bank for raising rates too quickly, though the CNB is an independent body.

The next policy meeting will be held on February 7, when most economists expect another quarter-point rate increase. But with inflation showing signs of slowing, the CNB will likely signal it is approaching the end of its monetary tightening cycle, barring a flare-up in price growth or wage gains. The trajectory of the Czech economy this year will help determine if further rate hikes prove necessary to keep inflation in check.
