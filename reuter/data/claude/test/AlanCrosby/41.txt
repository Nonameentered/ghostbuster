Czech Crown Falls Sharply After Central Bank Expresses Dissatisfaction  

The Czech crown dropped sharply against the euro today after the Czech National Bank (CNB) expressed strong concerns about the currency's recent appreciation and hinted at possible intervention to weaken the crown. 

The crown fell 0.9% against the euro, its biggest one-day decline since April. The central bank issued a statement saying the crown's gains over the past few months were "undesirable" and warned it was "willing to use all available instruments available...to return inflation back to the target." The bank has an inflation target of 2% but current inflation is below 1%.

The central bank's intervention came as a surprise to many analysts who had expected the bank to refrain from taking action due to solid economic growth and stable financial markets. However, three members of the central bank's board have expressed displeasure in recent weeks over the crown's rise, which they argue could stunt economic growth by making Czech exports more expensive. 

Pavel Sobisek, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Prague, said "the central bank's statement clearly indicates it wants to see the crown weaken from its current levels. The door is now open for possible interventions should the crown continue to strengthen." The crown has gained over 5% against the euro since the start of the year, driven by growing economic optimism, interest rate differentials with the eurozone, and a strengthening global economy.

However, other analysts argue that intervention to weaken the crown is unnecessary and risks higher inflation over the long run. "The economy is doing fine and intervention will only introduce distortions," said Lukas Kovanda at Trinity Bank in Prague. "The central bank should have stayed on the sidelines and let the market determine the appropriate exchange rate level."

The CNB last intervened in currency markets in November 2017 when  it spent over $1 billion to weaken the crown. The bank is scheduled to hold its next monetary policy meeting on September 26. Analysts will be watching closely for signals about the possibility of further intervention to restrain the crown's rise. Overall, today's fall in the crown shows the power of the central bank's words and the impact of its implicit threats to take action in currency markets.
