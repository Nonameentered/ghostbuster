Czech Republic Records First Budget Deficit Despite Government Efforts for Fourth Surplus  

The Czech Republic recorded its first budget deficit in over a decade this year despite efforts by the government to achieve a budget surplus for the fourth consecutive year. The Czech Ministry of Finance reported a deficit of 44.2 billion Czech koruna or $1.92 billion for 2019. The deficit represents 0.7% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and stands in stark contrast with the government's target of achieving another budget surplus in 2019.

The government had forecasted a surplus of 15.4 billion koruna for this year's budget. However, tax collections fell below expectations and government spending increased compared to projections. Tax collections were 11.8 billion koruna less than forecasted, which the Ministry of Finance attributed to weaker economic growth this year. GDP growth slowed to 2.5% in 2019 compared to 3% growth in 2018. At the same time, government expenditures rose by 47.8 billion koruna led by increased spending on public sector wages, pensions and healthcare.  

The budget deficit is an abrupt reversal of direction for the Czech Republic which has recorded budget surpluses for the last three years. The government has made fiscal discipline and balanced budgets a priority to ensure the long term sustainability of public finances. However, weaker economic growth has made that goal harder to achieve. The opposition has criticized the government for not adapting its projections and policies sufficiently quickly to the slowing economy.

The return to a budget deficit is not expected to significantly impact the country's low public debt levels at 32% of GDP. However, another deficit next year would put the Czech Republic in risk of breaching the EU's Stability and Growth Pact rules that limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP. The government has pledged to take measures to bring the budget back into balance next year through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, though more pessimistic economic outlooks may make that difficult to achieve without impacting public services.
