Prague Stock Exchange hits year-high on strong blue chip gains but lacks foreign investor interest

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) index reached its highest level this year on Friday, driven by gains in heavyweight stocks like banking group Moneta, power utility CEZ, and brewer Molson Coors. However, the PSE still struggles to attract foreign investors due to limited liquidity and dual listings of major stocks on other exchanges. 

The benchmark PX index gained 1.2% to 1,122.5 points, bringing its 2020 increase to 11% as the Czech economy is recovering from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Moneta led the gains with its shares up 6.7%, followed by CEZ which added 3.3%. However, the PSE's turnover was just €19.4 million on Friday, reflecting lower investor interest compared to regional peers like the Budapest bourse.

“The Prague bourse remains illiquid, so sizable deals can still move the market,” said Jakub Seidler, chief economist at ING in Prague. “Strong economic indicators and loose monetary policy support the rally, but without more foreign investors the exchange will continue to underperform.”

The Czech National Bank cut its main interest rate by a more-than-expected 75 basis points last week to a record low 0.25% to boost economic recovery. The central bank sees the economy contracting by up to 6% this year but growing around 4-6% in 2021.

Foreign investors held just 15% of stock free float on the Prague bourse at the end of 2019, according to PSE data. By comparison, international investors make up around 50-90% of turnover on larger exchanges in Poland, Hungary, and Austria, according to bourse data and local brokerages.  

The small size of most PSE stocks, lack of dual listings abroad, scant volumes, and competition from foreign exchanges where major Czech companies also list their shares mean Prague remains a marginal market for many foreign fund managers, traders say.

Moneta and CEZ are also listed in Warsaw, while Komercni Banka trades on the main Vienna bourse. Erste Group Bank, which owns Ceska Sporitelna, the second biggest Czech bank, is also based in Vienna.

“For large institutional investors, the PSE will remain less attractive until more companies move their primary listings there or trading volumes rise significantly,” said Jiri Polansky, head of equities trading at WOOD & Co. investment bank.
