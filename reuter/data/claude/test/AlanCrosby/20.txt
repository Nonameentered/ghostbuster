Foreign-buying leads to record high on Budapest Stock Exchange  

The Budapest Stock Exchange (BET) reached a record high today, fueled by strong foreign investor interest and purchases of Hungarian assets. The BET index closed up 2.3% at its highest level ever of 47,196, breaking the previous record set just last week.  

Analysts attributed the rise primarily to heavy buying of Hungarian stocks and government bonds by foreign investors. "Foreign capital inflows remain remarkably strong in Hungary, and investors seem very optimistic about growth prospects here," said Gergely Suppan, an analyst at Takarekbank. With interest rates in Western economies at record lows, foreign investors are seeking higher returns in emerging markets like Hungary. 

The forint, Hungary's currency, also strengthened to 310 to the euro, its highest level since 2012, making Hungarian assets cheaper for foreign buyers. Several large institutional investors, including BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase, have been increasing their positions in Hungarian stocks and bonds. The strong investor interest has sent yields on Hungary's 10-year bonds to below 2% for the first time ever.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government cheered the stock market record as validation of its economic policies. "This shows that investors have confidence in the Hungarian economy and see continued growth and prosperity in the coming years," said Finance Minister Mihaly Varga. The government has focused on tax cuts for businesses and households, stability, and growth. Critics argue, though, that inflation recently exceeded the central bank's target and that government policies primarily benefit oligarchs close to Orban's Fidesz party.

The booming stock market and surging forint reflect a broader resurgence of economic momentum in Hungary and across Central Europe. The Central Statistical Office said today that GDP grew 2.1% year-on-year in the third quarter, higher than expected. Consumer confidence also hit a record high, suggesting robust household spending. However, exports declined for the first time in two years, hinting at some fall-out from slowing growth in Western Europe, Hungary's main trading partner.

While the indicators point to resilience, some economists warn the good times may not last. "The rally in Hungarian financial markets seems overdone and investors could soon become more risk-averse," said David Nemeth of KBC Securities. The European Commission predicted Hungary's GDP growth would slow to 2.8% next year. Much depends on whether foreign capital inflows persist and Western Europe's economy improves.

After years of sluggish performance, the BET index has surged 65% since 2017, making Budapest one of the world's top-performing stock markets recently. But at $22 billion, the total market capitalization of the BET remains tiny relative to GDP. "The market still has a long way to go to catch up with Hungary's economic potential," said Gergely Gabler, head of research at Erste Bank Hungary. For now, at least, Hungary's market is attracting global investors chasing yield - and the party seems set to continue.
