Czech economic growth expected to slow down in Q3, but central bank prioritizes fighting inflation over interest rate cuts

The Czech Republic's economic growth is predicted to slow down in the third quarter of this year, according to the latest forecasts from the Czech National Bank (CNB). The country's central bank estimates GDP growth will decline to 2.3% year-over-year in Q3, compared to 2.8% in Q2 and a stronger-than-expected 3.6% in Q1. 

The CNB cited weakening foreign demand and industrial production as factors slowing the country's economic activity in the coming months. In particular, the Czech manufacturing sector is closely linked to the German economy, which is showing signs of struggling amid trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty. As a result, Czech exports to Germany and other trading partners are expected to weaken.

However, the CNB indicated it would not cut interest rates to stimulate growth because inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target. Consumer price inflation in the Czech Republic hit 2.7% in July, driven by higher food, alcohol, and tobacco prices. The CNB predicts inflation will remain elevated at 2.6% through the end of 2019 before gradually declining in 2020.

"While we see risks to economic growth from a weakening external environment, inflation pressures and a low unemployment rate suggest there is no need to loosen monetary policy at the current time," said CNB Governor Jiří Rusnok. The central bank left its key two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.0% in August for a 22nd straight month.

The steady interest rates, combined with rising wages in a tight labor market, should continue to support household consumption in the Czech Republic. Consumer confidence and retail sales both remain robust. Government spending is also set to increase this year, which could provide some fiscal stimulus to the economy.

Despite the predicted slowdown in growth, most economists see the overall economic picture in the Czech Republic as stable and healthy. Low unemployment, controlled inflation, and balanced government books have put the country in a good position to weather external pressures from trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions. The Czech economy is still forecast to grow a solid 2.5% in 2019 overall. 

GDP growth in the Czech Republic has exceeded most estimates over the past two years, so some analysts question whether the predicted Q3 slowdown will be quite as pronounced as the central bank expects. However, most agree the era of growth rates over 3% may have ended as global trade volumes level off and the impact of industry cycle peaks in the vehicle and machinery sectors fade. The Czech economy remains heavily dependent on manufacturing, making it sensitive to any changes in export demand.

In summary, while the Czech National Bank anticipates a slowdown in GDP growth for Q3 2019, it has signaled interest rates will remain on hold as long as inflation continues around target. The central bank appears willing to see slightly slower growth in exchange for stable price levels. Overall, the Czech economy remains in a healthy state to navigate external risks, supported by strong domestic demand. However, its openness continues to leave it exposed to the ups and downs of global trade.
