Prague Stock Exchange Sees Gains But Analysts Skeptical

The main index of the Prague Stock Exchange, the PX index, grew 0.5 percent today to 1,148 points, its highest level since early August. However, analysts warn that the gains may not be sustainable in coming months.

The rise was fueled by shares of Komerční banka, up 3.6 percent, the steel producer Třinecké železárny, up 5 percent, and the state-controlled energy company ČEZ, up 1.4 percent. The telecommunications operator O2 Czech Republic also saw modest gains of 0.7 percent. Together, these companies make up more than 60 percent of the PX index, so their stock performance significantly impacts the overall index.

"Today's gains were primarily driven by a handful of large companies that wield outsized influence on the Prague Stock Exchange," said Josef Novotný, an analyst at Patria Finance. "The growth was not broad-based across multiple sectors. We would need to see wider participation to confirm an overall bullish trend."

The gains also come amid a sell-off on other major European exchanges like Frankfurt and London as global economic concerns mount. The Prague Stock Exchange has been propped up recently by domestic retail investors chasing higher returns than are currently available from government bonds or bank deposits. The average dividend yield of companies on the PX index is over 5 percent. 

However, analysts warn this source of investment may start to dry up, especially if the Czech economy continues to slow. GDP growth has declined for two straight quarters and is projected to drop below 2 percent next year. Industrial production has also weakened, down 3.2 percent in August compared to the same month last year.

"The Czech economy is clearly losing momentum, and companies are already starting to feel the effects,” said Markéta Šichtařová, chief economist at Next Finance. “Advertising budgets are under pressure, orders from abroad are slowing. All of this will translate to lower company profits and either stagnant or declining stock prices over the next 6-12 months, despite today’s increase.”

Investor enthusiasm is also likely to dampen if the Czech central bank raises interest rates again, as it has signaled it plans to do before the end of the year. Higher rates will make government bonds and bank deposits more attractive compared to stocks, siphoning money away from the stock market. 

In summary, while the PX index hit a three-month high today, analysts largely see this as an artificial and temporary boost that is unlikely to continue into next year given broader economic headwinds. For the Prague Stock Exchange, the party may soon be over.
