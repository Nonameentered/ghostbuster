Czech Trade Deficit Widens Beyond Forecasts in December, Crown Expected to Hold Steady Despite Initial Nervousness  

The Czech trade deficit widened more than expected in December, data from the Czech Statistics Office showed today. The trade deficit increased to CZK 18.9 billion in December from CZK 16 billion in November, surpassing forecasts of analysts polled by Bloomberg for a deficit of CZK 17 billion.

The widening deficit was driven by a decline in exports, which dropped 1.4% year over year to CZK 308.2 billion. At the same time, imports edged up 0.3% to CZK 327.1 billion. The trade balance has been in deficit for the past 12 months. For the full year 2018, the trade deficit amounted to CZK 126.6 billion.

While the news initially put some downward pressure on the Czech koruna, the currency is expected to remain largely stable and hold on to recent gains. The koruna has appreciated nearly 3% against the euro over the past three months amid a strengthening economy and expectations of tighter monetary policy.

“The widening trade deficit in December is a slight disappointment, but the overall trend in trade and the economy remains positive,” said Agata Urbanska, an economist at ING Bank in Prague. “Domestic demand remains healthy, and economic growth is solid. We expect the central bank to start raising rates in the coming months, which should support the koruna.”

The central bank lifted its benchmark repo rate for the first time since 2008 in February, raising it by 25 basis points to 1.75%. The bank is poised to further tighten policy to contain inflationary pressures stemming in part from the fast-growing economy. Czech GDP expanded 4.4% year over year in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong household consumption.  

While the widening trade deficit could suggest softer external demand, analysts said the December data is volatile and other indicators point to solid activity in the eurozone, the main trading partner for Czech exporting firms. The European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator in the euro area rose for a six-month high in December.

“One month's data should not be over-interpreted,” said UniCredit Bank Czech Republic's Chief Economist Pavel Sobisek. “Leading indicators suggest external demand will continue support the Czech economy in the coming months, and domestic drivers also remain strong. The case for further rate hikes this year is intact despite the latest trade figures.”
