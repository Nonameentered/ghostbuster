Czech Blue Chip Shares Close Higher, Spurring Prague Stock Exchange to Third Consecutive Advancing Session   

Prague's main PX index rose for the third straight session today, boosted by gains in heavyweight banking and utility shares. The PX index closed up 0.4% at 1,050.92, its highest level in over two weeks.  

Shares of the Czech Republic's biggest lender, CSOB, rose 1.2% and Komercni Banka added 0.8%. The banks have been gaining this week after the Czech central bank left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting last week, supporting margins in the banking sector.

The stock of CEZ, the largest Czech utility company, gained 0.9%. CEZ has been advancing recently due to higher power prices in Germany, where CEZ generates a sizable amount of electricity. Germany's benchmark one-year baseload power contract rose over 3% today, boosting shares of central European utilities with operations in Germany.   

Other blue chips also ended in positive territory. Tobacco company Philip Morris CR rose 0.4% and telecommunications provider O2 Czech Republic added 0.3%. Telefonica Czech Republic, the country's largest telecom group, edged up 0.1%.

"The rise in banking and utility shares gave the overall market a lift today, even as policymakers held interest rates steady and investors awaited indications about the pace of future rate hikes," said Tomas Vlcek, an analyst at brokerage Cyrrus. 

The Czech central bank kept rates at 1.00% at its Sept. 26 meeting, as expected, citing economic risks that warrant a stable monetary policy stance. But most economists expect the bank to raise rates starting in the first half of 2019 to curb inflationary pressures from solid wage growth and a tight labor market.

Among mid-caps, developer CTP jumped 3.6% to a six-week high. CTP plans to issue its first-ever green bonds, using the proceeds to fund sustainable real estate projects.

Steel tube maker Vítkovice Steel rose 1.6% following a significant drop in the previous session. Vítkovice announced a revised EBITDA forecast range, disappointing some investors.   

Overall, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of roughly 2 to 1 on the Prague Stock Exchange today. Turnover for the exchange totaled CZK6.94 billion, just above the 2019 average of CZK6.92 billion.
