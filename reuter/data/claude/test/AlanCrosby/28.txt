US Offers Czech Republic Free Use of Seven Fighter Plans for Five Years

The United States has offered the Czech Republic the free use of seven F-16 fighter jets and associated equipment for the next five years as part of a new joint military partnership between the two nations. The planes and equipment would serve as a capability loan to the Czech Air Force until 2025. The offer was announced today during a joint press conference by US Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Czech Defense Minister Lubom√≠r Metnar in Prague.

"The United States values the Czech Republic as an important ally in NATO and we seek to strengthen our military partnership and cooperation in new ways" said Secretary Esper. The free loan of the multi-role F-16 fighters would boost the Czech Republic's air combat capabilities and aid in meeting the country's NATO commitments, according to Minister Metnar. The Czech Republic currently operates a fleet of 14 Russian-built MiG-21 Lancer fighter jets but those are nearing the end of their operational lifespans.

The new F-16s offered by the US Air Force are part of an equipment exchange program where older US fighters are loaned to allies and partners for a fixed period of time before being returned for use in the US or replacement. The seven block 40/50 model F-16s requested by the Czech Republic were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s but were recently modernized with the latest avionics and equipment before being offered for the exchange program. 200 Czech military pilots, technicians and support staff would also receive training from the US Air Force on operating and maintaining the F-16s.

Under the new agreement, the fighter planes would remain under the ownership of the US Air Force but the Czech Republic would have full authority to deploy and operate the aircraft in defense of their air space and for joint training with other NATO members. The loan program allows the Czech Air Force to immediately boost its combat readiness and capabilities for a short period until new multi-role fighters can be procured to replace the aging MiG-21s. The free use of the F-16s for five years would save the Czech government hundreds of millions that can now be used for its long-term fighter replacement program.
