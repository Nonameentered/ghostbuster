Prague Stock Exchange Shows Signs of Recovery, But Analysts Remain Skeptical of Awaited Turnaround

The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) saw modest gains this week, raising hopes that the exchange may be starting to recover after a dismal 2020. The PX index, which tracks the 25 most actively traded stocks on the exchange, rose 2.3% over the past five trading days. While some investors are optimistic this could signal a turnaround, most analysts remain skeptical.  

The PSE was hit hard by the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the PX index dropping over 25% in 2020. The exchange saw lower trading volumes and declining share prices across sectors as businesses slowed down and consumer demand dropped. The losses led some economists to question the viability and competitiveness of the exchange.

However, a handful of companies posted strong quarterly results in recent days and saw their share prices climb. The energy firm CEZ Group reported higher sales and profits thanks to growing demand. Its shares rose over 5% this week. The telecommunications company O2 Czech Republic also beat analyst estimates, propelling its stock up 7%.  

"We are seeing some improved economic data and stabilization on the PSE, which could indicate the worst is behind us," said Jan Kroutil, an economist with KB Bank in Prague. "But a few good days do not make a trend, and there are still many headwinds for companies and investors to grapple with."

While the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has buoyed hopes for an economic recovery in 2021, analysts point out it will take time for consumer demand and business confidence to return. Interest rates also remain at historic lows, limiting profits for banks and insurers that dominate the exchange. Strict lockdowns continue in the Czech Republic, forcing many businesses to remain closed.

"We expect a gradual recovery this year but not a quick turnaround or 'V-shaped' rebound," said Petr Kysela, Head of Asset Management at Generali Investments CEE. "The exchange is still vulnerable, and share prices could easily drop again if there are delays in the vaccine distribution or further waves of infections."

Continued government support may help limit downside risks. The Czech government has provided billions of dollars in aid and loan guarantees to businesses and employees. It also plans to continue stimulus spending this year to support the recovery. However, the country's rising deficit has led to concerns about long-term impacts on the economy.

While optimism cautiously returns, most experts do not foresee a robust or sustained recovery for the Prague Stock Exchange until at least the second half of this year. A successful vaccine rollout and continued government backing could help rebuild investor confidence over time. But companies will still face a long path to regain pre-pandemic strength, keeping the exchange on shaky ground. Overall, analysts recommend patience and caution as a turnaround, when it does come, is likely to be gradual.
