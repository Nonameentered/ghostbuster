Czech December Trade Deficit to Rise, Ending Worst Trading Year on Another Sour Note 

The Czech Republic is poised to record another sizable trade deficit in December to round out its worst trading year on record. According to preliminary data released today by the Czech Statistical Office, the trade deficit widened to CZK 62.3 billion in December, an increase of 15% compared to the same month last year. For the full year 2020, the trade deficit ballooned to CZK 615.2 billion, marking a sharp deterioration from the CZK 511.7 billion deficit recorded in 2019.  

The wider deficit reflects an ongoing slump in exports amid weakened global demand and supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Exports declined by 7.4% year-over-year in December, continuing a downward trend seen throughout 2020. Export volumes fell across major categories, including machinery, transport equipment, and base metals. The automobile industry, a key driver of Czech exports, has been hit particularly hard.  

At the same time, imports also dropped but at a slower pace, decreasing 5.9% in December. Lower prices for crude oil and other commodities helped curb some import costs. However, imports of transport equipment, machinery and chemicals still declined, signaling weak domestic investment and production.  

The weak trade numbers illustrate the depth of the economic crisis facing the Czech economy. After years of steady growth, GDP is projected to contract by at least 5% this year, marking the worst recession since the global financial crisis. While unemployment has remained largely stable due to government wage subsidy programs, retail sales and industrial production have plunged.  

The poor trade results pose challenges for the Czech koruna, which has weakened substantially against the euro over the past year. A weaker koruna makes imports more expensive, putting upward pressure on consumer prices. However, inflation remains very low at under 3% due to weak demand. The Czech National Bank cut interest rates three times this year to support the economy but may be hesitant to ease further due to currency concerns.

Government officials expressed hope that trade and economic activity will rebound in 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available. However, the pace of recovery will depend on how quickly key export markets in Europe and elsewhere can emerge from the current health crisis. After suffering its worst trading year on record, the Czech economy faces an uncertain path back to growth in the year ahead.
