East European Markets surge on strong foreign buying, Poland and  Hungary lead the way to year highs

Major stock indices in Eastern Europe surged today, led by strong gains in Polish and Hungarian equities which jumped to their highest levels so far this year. The influx  of foreign capital into the region and optimism over economic growth prospects fueled the rally. 

The Warsaw Stock Exchange's main WIG20 index jumped 3.2% to its loftiest since January 2018. Mining and energy stocks were the biggest gainers, with coal miner JSW and refiner PKN Orlenboth up over 7%. Banking stocks also advanced, with PKO BP and Pekao ending up over 4% each.

The strong gains came as data showed the Polish economy continued to expand at a healthy rate, rising 4.4% year-on-year in January-June versus 3.8% in the same period last year. Poland has seen a surge in foreign investment in recent years, especially in technology and infrastructure.

“The Polish market offers a compelling combination of strong growth and attractive  valuations,” said Tomasz Jaros, a Warsaw-based analyst at brokerage Dom Maklerski PKO BP. “As long as the economy remains on a solid footing and companies deliver good results, we expect to see further inflows from foreign investors.”  

In Hungary, the BUX index shot up 2.8% to its highest close since late March. Oil and gas firm MOL rallied 5.5%, while financials OTP Bank and Richter Gedeon both finished over 3% higher. Hungary's budget is on track to remain within EU rules next year provided economic growth picks up in the second half, Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said today.

Prague's PX index added 1.3%, led by a 4.4% jump in utility CEZ. Romanian equities also strengthened, with a 1% rise in Bucharest's BET index. Greece's ATHEX index closed up 0.8% at its strongest level in over a year, boosted by gains in banks Eurobank and National Bank of Greece.  

The gains sent the MSCI EM Eastern Europe ex-Russia index up 2.9% to its highest in nearly six months. The rise in optimism came in sharp contrast to weakness seen in Western European markets, where fears of a slowdown in the regional economy weighed on stocks.

“We have seen a clear differentiation within European equities, with money flowing out of Western European funds into Central and Eastern European vehicles,” said Gabor Kovacs, senior portfolio manager at brokerage Concorde Securities in Budapest.
