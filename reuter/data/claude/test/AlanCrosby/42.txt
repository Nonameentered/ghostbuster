Czech Crown Rebounds as Foreign Currency Selling Bolsters Market, but Dealers Remain Cautious   

The Czech crown strengthened against the euro on Wednesday as some commercial banks sold foreign currency positions, helping the crown recover after falling to its lowest level in over five months in the previous session. 

The crown traded at 25.81 to the euro by 0856 GMT, up 0.4% from Tuesday. It had slid to 25.97 on Tuesday, its weakest level since hitting a six-year low in March.

Analysts said the crown's rebound was mainly the result of profit-taking and short-term selling of foreign currencies by some market players. However, dealers said the longer-term outlook remained weak due to uncertainty over economic growth. 

"We have seen some foreign currency selling today, mainly by banks and funds which are taking profits on long positions," said a dealer at a local bank. 

"But in the longer term, the crown will still face pressure due to slowing growth, a wide current account deficit and interest rates remaining low."

The Czech National Bank has kept rates at a record low of 0.25% since February. Weak inflation allowed the central bank to end a more than two-year intervention regime in April 2017 in which it spent billions of euros to weaken the crown.

A rebound in the crown on Wednesday also followed moves higher in the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint. The forint gained as much as 0.5% against the euro while the zloty strengthened 0.2%.

However, unlike the crown, the zloty and forint have gained this year, shielded by higher interest rates in Poland and Hungary, as well as by lower current account deficits. 

The crown has weakened 3.4% against the euro so far in 2019, making it the worst-performing currency in the region. It has been hurt by a widening deficit in the Czech current account, data showed on Tuesday.

A Prague-based dealer said if the crown pushed below psychological support at 26 to the euro, it could weaken further towards its March low. However, he said levels beyond 26.50 would probably trigger more foreign currency selling and stabilise the market.
