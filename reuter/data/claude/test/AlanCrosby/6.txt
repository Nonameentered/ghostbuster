Czech Prime Minister supports creation of market regulator, but more needed to boost confidence in Prague bourse  

PRAGUE - The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Andrej Babiš, expressed support this week for the creation of an independent capital markets regulator in the country. Speaking at an economic conference in Prague, Babiš said an independent watchdog for the Czech stock exchange and other financial markets could help boost transparency and investor confidence.

However, Babiš also noted that further reforms would be needed to address deeper challenges facing the Prague Stock Exchange. The exchange has seen declining trading volumes and listings over the past decade as companies have opted to list on larger foreign exchanges. 

"An independent and professional regulator is important, but it is not a panacea," Babiš said in his speech. "We need to make our capital markets an attractive place for companies to raise funds and for investors, both local and international, to invest their money."

The Prague Stock Exchange was founded in 1992 and grew rapidly during the initial years of the Czech Republic's transition to a market economy. But it has struggled in recent years with competition from larger exchanges like Frankfurt, London and Warsaw. Strict regulations, high fees, and limited international promotion of the exchange have made foreign investors reticent and weakened the bourse.

Babiš said his government aims to make listing and trading on the Prague exchange more affordable and accessible. Specific proposals under consideration include subsidizing some listing fees for small and medium-sized companies, reducing trading fees for retail investors, and launching a campaign to market the exchange to foreign investors. The government also wants to expand the range of trading instruments offered to provide more options to traders and reduce volatility.

Not all experts agree, however, that the proposals would have the desired effect. Tomas Havranek, an economist at Czech Banking Association, argued that liquidity is the core problem and that attracting more listings from medium-sized companies would do little to address that. "The exchange simply does not have enough buyers and sellers for sustained trading in many stocks. We need to focus on bringing in institutional money from abroad," he said. 

BOOSTING CONFIDENCE IN CZECH CAPITAL MARKETS WILL REQUIRE A RANGE OF REFORMS, BUT CREATING AN INDEPENDENT REGULATOR CAN BE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. THE CZECH GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT BY MAKING THE PRAGUE STOCK EXCHANGE A MORE ATTRACTIVE MARKETPLACE FOR ISSUERS AND INVESTORS ALIKE, THE BOURSE CAN SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF CZECH BUSINESSES AND THE OVERALL ECONOMY. THE COMING MONTHS WILL SHOW WHETHER THE MEASURES UNDERTAKEN WILL BE BOLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE MEANINGFUL CHANGE.
