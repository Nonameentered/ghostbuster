English China Clays Plc CEO says 1996 was a "fairly horrible year" but predicts return to profitability in 1997 

The chief executive of English China Clays PLC described 1996 as a "fairly horrible year" for the company but predicted a return to profitability in 1997 due to cost-cutting measures and improving markets.

Peter Bacchus, CEO of the St. Austell, Cornwall-based china clay and kaolin producer, addressed shareholders at the company's annual general meeting and acknowledged the struggles of the past year. "There is no point pretending that 1996 was anything other than a fairly horrible year," Bacchus said. However, he outlined a turnaround plan that has reduced debt, cut costs, and reorganized the company to focus on its core mining and processing operations.

English China Clays reported a pre-tax loss of £24.8 million for 1996, compared with a £37.1 million profit the previous year, as china clay and kaolin prices declined due to weak demand and oversupply in the market. Revenue declined from £230.6 million in 1995 to £189.6 million in 1996. The company's stock price has declined more than 60 percent from its 1995 high.

To combat these losses, English China Clays reduced its workforce by more than 500 employees, discontinued its Spanish ball clay operations, and restructured its portfolio to focus solely on its core china clay mining and processing business in Cornwall and Brazil. These cuts are expected to reduce operating costs by £17 million per year going forward.

Bacchus said these moves have steadied the company and, combined with recent price increases in the china clay market and wider economic recovery, should lead to a "substantial improvement" in profitability this year. He predicted earnings to return to 1995 levels "over the next year or two."

The turnaround is "well underway," Bacchus told shareholders. "The actions of last year were very painful but necessary and have positioned your company to benefit from more stable and profitable markets as and when economic conditions improve." 

While overall demand remains "subdued," prices for some grades of kaolin and china clay have increased over 10 percent so far this year, Bacchus noted. He said the company will continue to cut costs in order to sustain profit margins at lower volumes, but the early signs of market recovery are encouraging.

"We have had a difficult year and there are still many challenges ahead," Bacchus said in closing remarks. "However, with fundamentally lower costs, reduced debt levels and an increasing focus on customers and markets, we are now in a much better position to benefit from improving trading conditions and more stable markets."

The shareholders reacted positively to the update on the company's progress and voted to re-elect Bacchus and the board for another term. English China Clays' shares were up 4 pence to 92 pence in morning trading following the AGM.
