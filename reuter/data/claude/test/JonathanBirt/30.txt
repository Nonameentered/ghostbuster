Rentokil Initial announces sharp rise in sales and profits, but concerns raised about heavy reliance on newly-acquired BET

Rentokil Initial, the commercial pest control and hygiene services company, today announced a 24% rise in profits for 2020, driven by strong sales growth in all its major global markets. The results solidify the company's recovery from the effects of the pandemic last year.

However, analysts voiced concerns about Rentokil's increasing dependence on the performance of its pest control divisions, particularly those from recently acquired rival BET. Rentokil completed its £1.4bn takeover of BET in July last year, making it the largest pest control company in the world. Revenues from pest control now account for over 60% of group sales, compared to under 50% before the acquisition.

Rentokil reported full-year revenues of £2.9bn, up 16% from 2019. Adjusted pre-tax profits rose 24% to £462m. The results were ahead of market expectations, sending shares up 4% in morning trading.

The company benefited from the critical nature of its services, with demand holding up strongly during the pandemic. New contract wins and cross-selling opportunities with BET also contributed to growth. All regions delivered double-digit revenue and profit gains, with ongoing recovery in hospitality and food sectors in the second half of the year.

CEO Andy Ransom said: "2020 was an unprecedented year but I'm very pleased with our performance. We started the year with a very strong first quarter, saw the expected slowdown in Q2 due to lockdowns, but recovered well in the second half." 

However, analysts warned that the chunky increase in profits relied heavily on the newly integrated BET business. "Take out BET's contribution, and we estimate profits and margins would be significantly lower year-on-year," said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "Rentokil is dependent on the former BET business firing on all cylinders to meet its growth targets.”
