Coats Viyella Plc Expects Bounce Back to Profit Growth in 1997 After Restructuring Costs

Coats Viyella Plc, the British-based textile and apparel company, announced expectations to return to profit growth in 1997 following a year of major restructuring and rationalization in 1996. The company reported a 39% drop in pre-tax profits in 1996 to £47 million from £77 million the prior year as a result of £43 million in restructuring costs during 1996. However, with the restructuring largely completed, Coats Viyella anticipates a strong recovery and profit growth for the current year. 

The restructuring efforts were aimed at reducing costs and improving competitiveness in Coats Viyella’s core threads and retail apparel businesses. The company sold or closed eight loss-making divisions, including the South Korea-based wool processor and European lace business. The company also reorganized its UK-based coatings and threads operations, resulting in job cuts of over 3,000 positions. Although the short-term costs of these moves were significant, Coats Viyella expects to generate £25 million in annual cost savings going forward as a result of lower overheads and greater efficiencies.

Coats Viyella also repositioned its UK-focused retail clothing business during 1996, revamping store layouts, simplifying its brand architecture, and investing in staff training. The company reported a modest increase in same-store sales during the important Christmas season, indicating the turnaround in this business may already be taking hold. The retail brands including Mc&Co, H&M, and Sock Shop are well placed to benefit from the continued growth in the value clothing market.  

With the largest restructuring now complete, Coats Viyella anticipates a strong recovery in profits during 1997 and aims to resume progress toward its target of doubling earnings per share from 1993 to 1998. The company will continue to drive cost efficiencies across the group while also accelerating investment in key brands and growth markets, including Asia. Coats Viyella sees significant opportunities to leverage its position as a global leader in specialist textile companies to capture growth, especially in emerging economies. 

Overall, while 1996 proved to be a transitional year, Coats Viyella has taken bold moves to reshape itself for enhanced profitability and cash generation in the coming years. With a solid foundation now in place, Coats Viyella looks poised to bounce back to steady long-term growth and reclaim its status as a leading performer in the textile industry.
