Peptide Therapeutics signs second major deal in weeks as SmithKline Beecham invests in allergy vaccines

Peptide Therapeutics, a Cambridge-based biotechnology company, announced today that it has entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with SmithKline Beecham to develop peptide-based vaccines for the treatment of allergic conditions. Under the terms of the agreement, SmithKline Beecham will invest up to $250 million in Peptide Therapeutics to fund the initial research and development of novel peptide vaccines for common allergies, including grass pollen, house dust mites, and peanut allergy.

This is the second major deal Peptide Therapeutics has completed in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with Novartis focused on developing peptide drugs for autoimmune diseases. The deals highlight the growing interest in peptide therapeutics, which can have significant advantages over traditional small molecule drugs and biologic therapies. Peptides offer the potential for greater precision and targeting, fewer side effects, and lower cost of production.

The collaboration with SmithKline Beecham will allow Peptide Therapeutics to advance its peptide vaccine platform into the clinic and validate its potential for treating allergy, an area of significant unmet medical need. "Peptide vaccines have the potential to transform how we manage and prevent allergic disease," said Dr. Jane Smith, CEO of Peptide Therapeutics. "We are delighted to be partnering with SmithKline Beecham, a world leader in the field of allergy, to develop innovative new treatment options for patients."

Under the agreement, Peptide Therapeutics will design peptide-based vaccines customized for individual allergies. SmithKline Beecham will then conduct clinical trials to evaluate the vaccines' safety and efficacy. If successful, SmithKline Beecham will commercialize the vaccines globally and share profits with Peptide Therapeutics.

"Peptide vaccines are a promising new approach for controlling and preventing allergies," said Paul Jones, Global Head of Research at SmithKline Beecham. "We believe Peptide Therapeutics' platform has the potential to transform allergy treatment and open up new therapeutic options for the millions of people worldwide who suffer from allergic conditions."

In mid-day trading, shares of Peptide Therapeutics rose over 12% on news of the SmithKline Beecham deal. The company's shares have increased nearly 50% in the past month following the announcement of its partnership with Novartis. With two major industry collaborators now backing its peptide platform, Peptide Therapeutics appears poised to become a leader in the development of peptide-based medicines. Though still a risky early-stage company, it could offer substantial rewards for investors if its peptide vaccines and drugs continue to advance successfully in clinical trials.
