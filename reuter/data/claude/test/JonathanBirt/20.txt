Glaxo's Pre-Tax Profits Soar 18% in 1996 but Faces Lean Years as Zantac Loses U.S. Patent in July  

Glaxo Wellcome PLC reported an 18% increase in 1996 pre-tax profits today, boosted by strong sales of its blockbuster ulcer drug Zantac. However, the British pharmaceutical giant warned investors that its earnings growth will slow down significantly over the next few years as Zantac loses patent protection in the U.S. in July. 

Glaxo said pre-tax profits rose to £2.41 billion ($3.77 billion) in 1996 from £2.05 billion in 1995. Earnings were in line with analysts' expectations. Revenue increased 10% to £7.38 billion, driven by a 16% rise in Zantac sales to £2.2 billion. Zantac, the world's largest-selling prescription drug, accounted for about 30% of Glaxo's revenue and profits last year.

“We had another excellent year in 1996, but we have to recognize that this level of growth is not sustainable as we face increasing competition from generics for Zantac in the U.S., our largest market,” said Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive. He cautioned that earnings growth will slow to single digits in 1997 and 1998 as lower-priced generic versions of Zantac erode the drug's market share.

Zantac, a treatment for peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease, went off-patent in many European countries last year. Glaxo estimates it lost about half of its Zantac sales in Europe to cheap generics. A similar trend is expected in the U.S., where Zantac garnered sales of $2.2 billion last year. When generics enter, Zantac's U.S. sales are forecast to plunge at least 60-70% within six months.

To offset the decline, Glaxo hopes to boost sales of other drugs like migraine treatment Imigran, asthma medication Seretide, and herpes treatment Valtrex. However, none of these brands comes close to generating the profits of Zantac. The company is also counting on its promising experimental drugs like migraine pill 186,464 andawa flu treatment Relenza to fuel future growth. But neither drug will reach the market before 1999.

Sitting on a $6 billion cash pile, Glaxo also plans to go on a buying spree to acquire companies with attractive drug pipelines. Analysts estimate the company will need to buy at least two mid-sized firms each year to achieve its target of launching four new blockbusters every five years. Glaxo's shares fell 2% to 984 pence in London on the weaker-than-expected profits outlook. The stock is still up 25% over the past year, largely on takeover speculation. With Zantac sales poised to fall off a cliff, Glaxo may need to make a big acquisition to pacify investors and diversify itself away from reliance on a single aging blockbuster.
