Shares of Scotia Holdings Plc Plunge After Regulatory Rejection of Lead Drug Tarabetic Aimed at Relieving Sensory Impairment in Diabetics

Shares of the British biopharmaceutical company Scotia Holdings Plc plunged more than 42% in early trading today after the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected its application for Tarabetic, a potential blockbuster drug aimed at relieving sensory impairment in diabetic patients.

The FDA issued a Complete Response Letter stating that the application cannot be approved in its present form. The agency requested additional data on the drug’s efficacy and safety based on concerns over the trial design and top-line results. Scotia Holdings said it was “surprised and disappointed” with the FDA decision and plans to request a meeting with the agency to discuss steps required to gain approval. However, analysts said it may take at least two more years of clinical trials before the FDA considers another application for Tarabetic.

The rejection is a major setback for Scotia Holdings, which had touted Tarabetic as a potential first-in-class treatment for the 15 million Americans suffering from diabetic neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes where high blood sugar levels damage nerves. Tarabetic was designed to block an enzyme involved in inflammation and reduce pain signals from peripheral nerves to the brain. In clinical trials, some patients reported reduced pain and improved sensation and mobility. However, FDA reviewers questioned the rigor of the trial design and whether the benefits outweighed potential side effects like nausea and diarrhea.

Investors have been bullish on Scotia Holdings largely based on hopes for Tarabetic, despite the company losing over $200 million last year. The stock price tripled over the past 12 months in anticipation of regulatory approval. Today’s news erased over $4 billion of Scotia Holdings’ market value as investors reacted to the possibility of Tarabetic never coming to market. Analysts downgraded the stock and revised price targets sharply downward. Scotia Holdings will now rely on funding from major shareholders to finance additional clinical trials while cutting costs to mitigate revenue losses.
