SmithKline Beecham reports bumper profits and new drug projects, plays down talk of mega-merger  

British pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham today reported record profits for the third year running and announced two promising new drug development projects, amid speculation it is trying to forge a major merger with a US counterpart.

The company said that pre-tax profits rose 18% to £2.35 billion in the year ending December 1998. Driven by strong sales of its blockbuster drugs Paxil, an antidepressant, and Avandia, for type 2 diabetes, revenues rose 16% to £8.54 billion, also a record.  

Hans Bergen, the chief executive, was bullish about SKB's product pipeline. He unveiled plans to seek approval for two new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. The new arthritis drug showed promising results in clinical trials, offering potent anti-inflammatory effects without the risk of stomach ulcers associated with other treatments, Bergen said. The asthma drug, currently known as SB212091, could be a major advance, providing long-lasting relief from wheezing and shortness of breath for up to 24 hours, the company believes.

Bergen said the financial results showed SKB's strategy of focusing investment on a few key treatment areas was "bearing significant fruit". But he dismissed talk that SKB was close to finalizing a merger with a large US drug company, such as Pfizer, Merck or Eli Lilly, saying discussions were not at an advanced stage. 

Shares in SKB rose 35p to 1069p in early trading, valuing the group at £36 billion. Analysts said the results showed SKB continued to perform strongly despite the economic turmoil in Asia and Latin America, two of its key markets. But some investors believe SKB lacks global scale and is losing ground to even larger rivals such as Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis. A megadeal could allow SKB to slash costs, gain new drugs and compete more effectively on the world stage.

Bergen admitted the group was looking at "options to strengthen our business" but said remaining independent was still preferable to a merger that risked disrupting its culture and strategy. "Any deal would have to offer clear benefits to our shareholders without compromising the way we do business," he said.

The results showed SKB's fortunes remain heavily reliant on a few top sellers, notably the antidepressant Paxil, sales of which rose 30% to £1.7 billion, and Avandia, whose revenues nearly tripled to £440 million. But the group has faced setbacks, withdrawing its anticholesterol drug Baycol in 2001 over safety concerns and seeing several other products delayed by manufacturing problems.

Analysts said the new drug projects were encouraging but would take years to reach the market and generate significant sales. Richard Girling at brokers Smith New Court said: "SKB's results are strong but its vulnerability to a small range of drugs is a concern. A merger, if it resulted in a broader spread of quality products, could reduce risk and support growth over the long term. However, management seem determined to steer their own course, at least for now."
