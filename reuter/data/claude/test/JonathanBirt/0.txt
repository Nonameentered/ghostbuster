Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc aims to become top three in cancer sales with new growth strategy

Pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc has unveiled an aggressive strategy to propel itself into the top three companies worldwide for sales of cancer drugs over the next decade. The company announced plans to double its global cancer drug sales to $10 billion by 2005 through strategic acquisitions, licensing deals, and internal drug development. 

“Cancer is one of the world’s leading causes of death, and the demand for new and innovative treatments is growing rapidly,” said Rhone-Poulenc CEO Pierre Monteux at a press conference in Paris. “We aim to establish ourselves as a leader in oncology to meet this urgent medical need and drive future growth for our company.”

Rhone-Poulenc has historically had a modest presence in oncology, with cancer drugs representing only 12% of its total pharmaceutical sales last year. The company’s flagship cancer treatment is the leukemia drug Deflex, which generated $1.2 billion in sales in 1999. However, Deflex’s patent is due to expire in two years, opening it up to competition from generic versions.

To counter this threat and achieve its bold sales target, Rhone-Poulenc will focus on bringing new cancer drugs to market based on three approaches: 

First, the company will boost its late-stage drug development pipeline through increased R&D spending and licensing deals with biotechnology companies. It currently has two promising cancer drugs in Phase III trials, including Exelda for non-small cell lung cancer. Rhone-Poulenc has budgeted $1.5 billion in additional R&D funding for oncology over the next three years.

Second, Rhone-Poulenc will make strategic acquisitions of smaller firms with novel cancer therapies to gain access to new drug candidates and research expertise. The company has identified several leading biotech companies as potential acquisition targets, though executives declined to provide specific names during the press conference.

Finally, Rhone-Poulenc aims to expand its reach in cancer into Europe and emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. The company currently generates 60% of its cancer drug revenue from the U.S. and Canada, though cancer rates are rising fastest in developing countries. To address new markets, Rhone-Poulenc will pursue regulatory approvals and distribution partnerships abroad.

While analysts praised Rhone-Poulenc’s bold vision, they also sounded notes of caution about the difficulties of executing such an ambitious plan. Developing and gaining approval for new cancer drugs can be a risky, expensive and time-consuming process. Expanding into new markets also brings challenges in navigating different regulatory and healthcare systems.

“Rhone-Poulenc has set the bar very high for itself in oncology,” said pharmaceutical analyst Jean Dupont of Credit Nomade. “If successful, this strategy could drive tremendous growth over the next decade. But there are many obstacles to overcome, and the reality may fall short of the company’s lofty goals.”

The next three to five years will prove critical in determining whether Rhone-Poulenc becomes a cancer powerhouse or struggles in an increasingly competitive landscape. With billions invested in its new growth strategy, the company has engineered a pivotal moment to shape its future in global healthcare.
