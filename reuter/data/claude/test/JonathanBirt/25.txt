Laporte Plc Reports Higher-Than-Expected Annual Profits as Recovery Continues Strongly

Laporte Plc stunned analysts today by reporting annual profits of $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended June 2021, nearly double the expected $650 million. The strong results come as the global chemicals company continues on a rapid growth trajectory after the economic downturn in 2020. 

Laporte's share price rose over 15% in early morning trading as investors reacted enthusiastically to the news. Revenue for the fiscal year grew by 34% to $8.9 billion, while earnings per share of $4.82 also handily beat the consensus estimate of $2.65.

"This has been an outstanding year for Laporte as our key end markets recovered and global demand for our products surged," said CEO Brian Smith in a statement. "Our teams across the world have worked tirelessly to serve our customers and achieve these results. While uncertainty remains, we believe the economic recovery still has a long way to run and Laporte is poised to continue its momentum into 2022."

The largest driver of the strong performance was Laporte's polymer solutions division, which provides materials to industries like automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. Revenue in the division jumped 41% from a year earlier, while operating profits nearly tripled to $450 million. Laporte attributed the division's success to growing demand for its high-performance plastics and resins as well as its proprietary polymer processing technologies.

Laporte's industrial chemicals division also performed well, with revenue up 28% and operating profits rising by over 70% from 2020. The division provides chemicals for applications such as water treatment, mining, and oil and gas. Revenue growth was especially strong in Latin America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, markets where infrastructure and industrial activity has been recovering rapidly.  

While analysts had expected a strong recovery for Laporte, the scale of the beat in today's results caught many off guard. "Laporte knocked it out of the park this quarter," said Joseph Little, an analyst at Bank of Montreal. "Management had guided conservatively and clearly demand came back much faster than expected. At this pace, Laporte's results could surpass pre-pandemic levels within the next few quarters."

With its strong balance sheet and cash flows, Laporte also announced an 11% increase in its annual dividend to $1.24 per share. The company remains optimistic about continued growth in 2022, especially as key end markets like automotive and aerospace start to recover to pre-pandemic levels. For the full fiscal 2022, Laporte expects revenue growth of 8-12% and earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.15, ahead of the current Wall Street consensus.
