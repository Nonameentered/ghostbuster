Glaxo Wellcome Announces Record Profits but Faces Tough Times Ahead With Loss of Patent for Top-Selling Drug

Glaxo Wellcome, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, today announced record profits for 2018 but warned investors that challenges lie ahead with the anticipated loss of patent protection for several blockbuster drugs over the next few years. 

The British pharmaceutical giant reported that full-year profits rose 12% to $15.2 billion, boosted by strong sales of respiratory treatments and HIV drugs. Revenue climbed 8% to $44.8 billion. The results beat analysts' forecasts and underscored the company's success in launching new products to replace aging best-sellers.

However, Glaxo Wellcome faces declining sales in coming years due to generic competition as patents expire for some of its biggest products, including the asthma treatment Advairâ€”the company's top-selling drug. Advair sales topped $8 billion in 2018 but are expected to plunge once it loses U.S. patent protection in 2019 and faces competition from cheaper generic alternatives.

"We delivered excellent results in 2018, but we are very much focused on the loss of exclusivity for Advair and other products in the coming years and the impact that will have on our respiratory portfolio," said Emma Walmsley, GlaxoSmithKline's chief executive.

The company has launched new respiratory drugs in hopes of softening the blow, including the asthma treatment Nucala and Trelegy Ellipta for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, those new products are unlikely to immediately replace the lost Advair revenue.

Glaxo Wellcome's predicament highlights the perilous position of big pharma companies, which often rely on a few blockbuster drugs to drive profits and fund research programs to discover the next generation of medicines. Once those multibillion-dollar products lose patent protection, revenue and profits typically plunge before new drugs can reach the market.

The company has also faced challenges from generic competition and pricing pressure on older drugs in the U.S, which remains its largest market. Glaxo Wellcome and other big drug makers have raised prices on products in the U.S. to help offset revenue declines, a practice that has come under fire.  In response, Glaxo committed to limiting price increases in the U.S. to below the nation's average healthcare inflation rate.

Glaxo Wellcome's stock fell more than 3% in London trading as investors weighed the threats and opportunities facing the company. While 2018 results beat expectations, the longer-term prognosis is unclear without Advair and other aging blockbusters that have fueled profits for years. The transition to new products won't be easy, but Glaxo's broad portfolio of medicines and promising research pipeline suggests the company is well positioned to navigate the challenges ahead.
