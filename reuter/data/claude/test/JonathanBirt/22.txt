Glaxo Wellcome Profits Soar but Future Uncertain with Loss of US Patent for Top-Selling Drug

Glaxo Wellcome reported a 15% increase in first-quarter profits today, boosted by strong sales of its blockbuster asthma drug Advair. However, the pharmaceutical giant faces an uncertain future with the impending loss of US patent protection for Advair later this year. 

Glaxo posted profits of £2.7 billion for the first three months of the year, up from £2.4 billion during the same period last year. Sales rose 6% to £7.7 billion, driven by demand for respiratory medicines like Advair and cancer treatment Avodart. Advair, which treats asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, remained Glaxo's top-selling product with sales up 12% to £1.5 billion in the quarter.

The robust results highlight Glaxo's current reliance on Advair, which accounts for nearly 20% of the company's total revenue. However, Glaxo's exclusivity period for Advair is set to expire in the US in August, opening the door to competition from cheaper generic versions. Glaxo executives acknowledged that Advair sales will face "significant declines" once the company loses patent protection.

The impending "patent cliff" for Advair poses a threat to Glaxo's bottom line. Sales from Advair make up the bulk of Glaxo's respiratory division, the company's largest business unit. With lower-priced generics on the market, Glaxo will have to slash the price of Advair to remain competitive, eroding its profit margins. The company will also face revenue losses as some patients switch from Advair to the generic versions.

Glaxo executives said the company is well prepared for the changes ahead. In a call with analysts, CEO Emma Walmsley pointed to Glaxo's diverse product lineup, robust new product pipeline, and cost-cutting efforts as factors that will help offset potential losses from Advair. The company continues to focus on its priority areas of respiratory, HIV, oncology and immunology, and expects to achieve double-digit sales growth through 2020 in its new products such as Nucala, Trelegy, and Shingrix. Still, Glaxo's ability to weather the storm surrounding Advair remains to be seen. With billions of dollars in revenue at stake, the loss of Advair's patent in the crucial US market is a pivotal moment for the British pharmaceutical giant.
