Here is a draft 750-word news article with the headline: "Coats Viyella sees sharp fall in pre-tax profits for 1996":

Coats Viyella, the British textile company, reported a 30% drop in pre-tax profits for 1996 today, largely due to weakness in some of its core businesses and charges related to restructuring. Profits before tax fell to £153 million in the year ending Jan. 31, down from £218 million a year ago.

The company has been hit by sluggish demand and intense price competition in its clothing and thread divisions. Coats Viyella said sales of clothing were "disappointing" in many markets, especially in the UK where a warm autumn and winter had a major impact. Sales of thread, Coats Viyella's historic business which still produces about 40% of group profits, remained weak. The thread market has been in steady decline for several decades as cheap imports have flooded developed markets. 

Coats Viyella took charges of £86 million to cover the costs of major restructuring moves, including the closure of some loss-making businesses. The company launched a survival plan last year that involves cutting its workforce by 36% to 18,000 and overhauling supply chains to reduce costs. The program aims to save £90 million per year starting in 1998, but Coats Viyella said 1996's results were "still clearly unsatisfactory" despite good progress on the turnaround.

The performance of Coats Viyella's branded businesses, including the menswear label Viyella, outperformed, with sales climbing 18%. Profits also rose, indicating the potential for growth if Coats Viyella's core operations can be revitalized. In April, Coats Viyella launched an e-commerce site to boost online sales. The company said it is also expanding Viyella womenswear ranges to capture growth.

Chief executive David Stevens said 1996 was "another difficult and challenging year" but remained optimistic about the future. "The turnaround program is delivering substantial benefits and the pain of the changes and closures is now behind us," Stevens said. "With the worst over, we enter 1997 with renewed confidence."

Coats Viyella shares fell 30 pence, or 8.6%, to close at 325 pence. Analysts said the results were weaker than expected and raised concerns about the group's near-term outlook. But many still believe Coats Viyella's strategy and restructuring moves will start to positively impact the bottom line over the next 12 to 18 months.
