Rentokil Initial Announces Sharp Rise in Sales and Profits, But Concerns Raised Over Reliance on Newly-Acquired BET  

Rentokil Initial, the London-based pest control and hygiene services company, today announced strong results for fiscal 2018 with an 11% rise in revenue and a 14% increase in operating profit compared to the previous year. The company cited the successful integration of several recent acquisitions as a key driver of its financial performance, especially its $1.8 billion purchase of competitor BET Environmental in North America last May.  

Revenues rose to £2.83 billion for the year, while operating profit reached £473 million. On an organic basis, excluding the contributions from acquisitions, revenue grew 7% and operating profit increased 9%. The company enjoyed growth across all business segments and regions, except for Asia.  

The largest boost came from Rentokil's acquisition of BET, which added £260 million in revenue and £44 million in operating profit since the deal closed eight months into the fiscal year. The BET merger positioned Rentokil Initial as a clear market leader in North America for pest control and hygiene services. Due to the significant size of the BET purchase, Rentokil's net debt rose over £1 billion to £1.83 billion by the end of the fiscal year. 

Rentokil CEO Andy Ransom hailed the strong results as evidence the company's long-term strategy of organic growth supplemented with targeted acquisitions is working. "2018 was another successful year for Rentokil Initial, delivering strong financial results through the combination of healthy organic growth and benefits from our recent acquisitions," he said in a statement.

However, some analysts voiced concerns about Rentokil's dependence on the newly-acquired BET for a large portion of its profits and increased indebtedness from funding the deal. "While the headline numbers look impressive, strip away the contribution from BET and the picture looks rather weaker," said Clive Simpson, an analyst at Investec Securities. 

Rentokil acknowledged that integrating BET and realizing the promised cost synergies and cross-selling opportunities would be a key priority for 2019 and beyond. The company said it is on track to achieve £15 million in annual cost savings from combining BET. Even so, Ransom said continued strong organic growth across Rentokil's other businesses and geographies will be critical to reducing reliance on the North American segment over time.

Rentokil Initial shares were trading up 3% following the earnings announcement, a sign investors remain optimistic about the company's prospects despite the concerns over its recent large deal. With a strengthened market position in many parts of the world and more acquisitions likely, Rentokil looks set for further expansion, but the company must also demonstrate sustainable momentum outside of its newest and largest outpost in North America.
