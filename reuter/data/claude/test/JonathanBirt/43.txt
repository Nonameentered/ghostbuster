Chemical Industry Predicts Three More Years of Sluggish Investment in the UK

The UK's chemical industry body has warned that investment in the sector is likely to remain stagnant for at least the next three years due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty.

In its latest annual survey of business conditions, the Chemical Industries Association found that capital investment levels fell for the  third year in a row in 2018 and expect this trend to continue. Two-thirds of chemical companies anticipate no increase in investment over the next three years, citing Brexit uncertainty, exchange rate volatility, and a slowing global economy.

The chemical sector is a major contributor to the UK economy, employing over 220,000 people directly and indirectly and generating £35 billion in annual revenues. The industry body has warned that underinvestment could threaten jobs and research in the long run.

"This is an alarming trend that threatens the future growth and innovation of one of Britain's most important industries," said Steve Elliott, CEO of the Chemical Industries Association. He urged political leaders to provide clarity on Britain's future trading relationship with the EU to spur new investment. "Companies need certainty and stability to have the confidence to invest billions of pounds in new facilities and research."

However, not all companies reported declining investment. Those with substantial export markets outside Europe reported strong growth and job creation. Verder UK, a manufacturer of industrial pumps and equipment, reported a 15% increase in export revenues in 2018, driving plans to expand its production facilities and workforce by over 10% this year.

"While ongoing political uncertainty continues to dampen business confidence for some in the UK chemical sector, we are confident in our global growth strategy focused on innovative products, emerging markets, and strategic acquisitions,” said a spokesperson for Verder UK.  “For us, the long-term business fundamentals remain strong."  

The mixed picture highlights the volatility and uncertainty that has gripped UK industry since the Brexit vote in 2016. With no quick resolution in sight to Britain's withdrawal from the EU, the chemical industry predicts a stubborn slowdown in domestic investment will continue to weigh on growth for years to come. Overall, the sector expects modest GDP growth of just 1-1.5% for the UK economy as a whole for 2019, lagging behind most developed nations.
