Medeva Plc Reports Strong Rise in Profits and NYSE Listing Plans 

Pharmaceutical company Medeva Plc today reported strong increases in revenues and profits for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Buoyed by the successes of its immuno-oncology and rare disease drug portfolios, the company saw revenues rise 32% to $4.2 billion compared with $3.3 billion in 2021. Net income rose 48% year over year to $1.1 billion.

Medeva’s key growth drivers were the immuno-oncology drugs Imlygic and Bavencio. Sales of Imlygic, used to treat melanoma, a type of skin cancer, were up 63% to $1.7 billion. Bavencio, which treats bladder cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma, posted a 74% increase in sales to $840 million. “Our immuno-oncology portfolio has exceeded all expectations this year and transformed the treatment landscape for patients with some very challenging cancers,” said Medeva CEO Tom Stevenson.  

In its rare disease division, Medeva experienced strong growth from its drugs Spinraza, Luxturna, and Zolgensma. Spinraza, which treats spinal muscular atrophy, saw sales rise 28% to $2.1 billion. Luxturna, the first gene therapy approved to treat an inherited retinal disease, contributed sales of $320 million in its first full year since approval. Zolgensma, a revolutionary gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy in infants, generated sales of $160 million in the three months since its FDA approval in October. 

Based on the company’s strong performance, Stevenson announced Medeva’s intention to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in mid-2020. “Medeva has reached a level of maturity and success that merits a listing on a premier global exchange like the NYSE. We believe Medeva shares will attract strong interest from biotechnology and pharmaceutical investors, and a NYSE listing will raise our visibility and prestige within the industry.”

Medeva expects 2020 to be another year of significant growth as it expands into new markets, gains additional approvals for existing drugs, and progresses late-stage clinical trials. The company anticipates revenue growth of 25-30% and higher net income growth in 2020 compared to 2019. According to Stevenson, “Medeva has built unparalleled momentum in recent years, and we have a deep pipeline of innovative drugs that will transform more lives and fuel our long-term success.”

The strong results and NYSE announcement prompted a 10% rise in Medeva’s shares on the London Stock Exchange, where it is currently listed. Investor sentiment appears robust given Medeva’s track record and growth potential in oncology, rare diseases, and other therapeutic areas. With its vision of becoming a top-tier global biotechnology company, Medeva seems poised to continue its winning streak in 2020 and beyond.
