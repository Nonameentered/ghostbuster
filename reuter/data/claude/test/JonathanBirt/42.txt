Chiroscience Partners with Alcon Laboratories to Test Drug Programs in Ophthalmology Therapeutic Area 

Chiroscience, a mid-sized biopharmaceutical company based in Boston, announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Alcon Laboratories, the global leader in eye care, to advance Chiroscience’s ophthalmology drug pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, Alcon will provide funding and clinical expertise to help progress Chiroscience’s two lead ophthalmology drug candidates through Phase 2 clinical trials.

Chiroscience’s most advanced ophthalmology drug candidate is CHS-123, an eye drop treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Dry AMD is the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60, affecting more than 170 million people worldwide. CHS-123 showed promising results in a Phase 1 safety trial, reducing retinal inflammation and slowing the progression of geographic atrophy lesions. The partnership with Alcon will allow Chiroscience to launch a 200-patient Phase 2 trial to further demonstrate the drug’s efficacy. 

The second part of the collaboration will focus on Chiroscience’s CHS-456 program for diabetic retinopathy. CHS-456 is designed to block the activity of a novel target involved in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if left untreated. Alcon will provide clinical expertise and fund a Phase 1/2 trial to assess the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of CHS-456 in patients with moderate to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

“We are thrilled to be partnering with the leader in ophthalmic medications and devices,” said Dr. Alice Chen, CEO of Chiroscience. “Alcon’s clinical knowledge and financial support will be instrumental in helping us advance our novel treatments for vision-threatening eye diseases like dry AMD and diabetic retinopathy.”
 
The ophthalmology market has become an increasing focus for pharmaceutical companies, given aging populations and increasing rates of diseases like diabetes and age-related macular degeneration. If successful, the Chiroscience-Alcon partnership could represent an opportunity to develop innovative new treatment options for patients at high risk of vision loss. Under the terms of the agreement, Alcon will have the option to continue funding development and commercialize both drug candidates. Financial details of the partnership were not disclosed.
