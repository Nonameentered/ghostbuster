Coats Viyella Plc Poised for Growth, Says Retiring CEO Neville Bain

Neville Bain, the retiring CEO of Coats Viyella Plc, says the textile manufacturer is primed for continued growth following a successful turnaround during his tenure. In an interview with the Associated Press, Bain said the 200-year-old company has reinvented itself to remain competitive in a global marketplace and is pursuing an aggressive growth plan focused on emerging markets.

Coats Viyella produces threads, fabric and garments for the apparel and footwear industries. It has faced significant challenges, including competition from low-cost producers, but has pivoted to focusing on high-value, premium products that offer better profit margins. It has grown from a primarily thread maker to a more diversified textile producer, expanding into fabrics and performance materials.

“The company is well positioned to capture growth opportunities around the world,” said Bain, who has led Coats Viyella as CEO for the past 12 years and will retire at the end of the month. “With our focus on innovation, operational efficiency and sustainability, we have built a platform for success across diverse geographies and customer segments.”

Under Bain’s leadership, Coats Viyella annual revenue has increased 70 percent and pre-tax profits have more than tripled. The company’s stock price is up 250 percent during that span. Coats Viyella now operates in six continents and 50 countries, though two-thirds of sales still come from Europe. 

Bain said emerging markets, especially in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, are a major driver of revenue and profit growth going forward. Coats Viyella has invested heavily in Brazil, India and Vietnam, building new manufacturing plants to serve the growing middle class in those regions. 

The company has also rolled out new “green” product lines made from recycled and organic materials to appeal to eco-conscious consumers, brands and retailers worldwide. These products now make up more than 25 percent of total sales, according to Bain.  

“Sustainability is a key part of our innovation and growth strategy,” he said. “There is increasing demand for sustainable products that minimize environmental impacts, and we are dedicated to meeting that demand through greener raw materials and processes.”

Bain will be succeeded as CEO by Paul Forman, a 30-year veteran of Coats Viyella who currently serves as chief operating officer. In a statement, Forman said he plans to build upon the momentum established under Bain’s leadership, with a focus on new product development, sustainability and global growth into developing markets.  

“The future remains bright for Coats Viyella under Paul’s guidance,” Bain said. “He has been an integral part of the transformation of this company, and I am confident he will continue to drive growth and success for many years to come.”
