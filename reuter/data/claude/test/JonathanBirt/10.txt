Unilever to sell most of its speciality chemicals businesses in multi-billion pound disposal programme 

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, announced today that it will sell the majority of its speciality chemicals businesses that produce industrial additives. The move is part of Unilever's ongoing strategy to focus on its core food, home and personal care brands.

The speciality chemicals unit, which had revenues of Â£3.4 billion last year, produces additives for industries like pulp and paper, construction, and automotive manufacturing. Brands to be sold include Pulcra Chemicals, Scherer Ecoclean, and Durga. Unilever will retain only its speciality chemicals that are closely linked to its core home and personal care products.

The sale of the bulk of the speciality chemicals portfolio is expected to raise several billion pounds for Unilever, which will use the proceeds to invest in its core branded goods businesses and strengthen its balance sheet. 

"Unilever has world-leading consumer brands and we want to focus fully on serving our consumers and customers," said Alan Jope, Unilever CEO. "At the same time, we remain committed to helping our B2B customers grow their businesses. The best way to do this is through a new ownership model for our speciality chemicals businesses."

The announcement was well received by investors, with Unilever's share price up 2% in early trading. City analysts have long pressed Unilever to streamline its operations and strip out non-core businesses.  The disposal programme will substantially reduce the proportion of Unilever's revenues from business-to-business sales, lowering it to less than 10% of turnover.

Unilever is working with investment banks Lazard and Citi to assess options for the sale process, which is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. Suitors for the assets are likely to include large private equity firms and specialist chemicals companies, attracted by the well-established brands and global footprint of the businesses.

The sale is the biggest move so far by Mr Jope since taking over as CEO of Unilever at the start of this year. He has promised an "active programme of portfolio evolution" that speeds up the transformation of Unilever into a super-focused company with a sharper set of brands, regions and business models aligned around a unified purpose.
