Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc to Establish Major Genetics Alliance in the Next 12 Months

Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc (CAT), a leading UK-based biotechnology company, announced today that it intends to form a major strategic alliance with a top genetics research firm within the next 12 months. CAT specializes in discovering and developing humanized antibodies for the treatment of diseases. The company believes that partnering with a world-class genetics organization will help accelerate its drug discovery programs by providing access to state-of-the-art technologies and expertise.

CAT's CEO, Sir Gregory Winter, stated "Genetics is fundamentally transforming medical research and biotechnology. The ability to identify disease targets, understand disease mechanisms, and select patient populations at a genetic level is revolutionizing the discovery of new medicines. We aim to be at the forefront of this revolution through a partnership with a preeminent genetics firm.‚Äù According to Sir Winter, CAT is in discussions with multiple organizations and hopes to finalize an agreement within the next year.

A strategic alliance would provide CAT with access to capabilities such as high-throughput DNA sequencing, analysis of human genetic variation and mutation, and targeted editing of the human genome. Genetically defined patient populations could also be better identified for clinical trials of CAT's antibody candidates. In exchange, the genetics partner would gain exposure to CAT's portfolio of antibody programs for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases, as well as CAT's antibody discovery platform.
