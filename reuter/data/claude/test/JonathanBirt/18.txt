Medeva Plc Positions Itself for Further Growth in U.S. Market, Plans to List on NYSE  

Medeva Plc, a fast-growing UK-based biotechnology company focused on innovative cancer immunotherapies, announced today  that it is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as part of its strategy to expand its presence in the large and fast-growing U.S. biotech market. Medeva's board of directors unanimously approved the planned NYSE listing, which is subject to approval by shareholders at the company's next annual meeting and review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“This is an important milestone as we work to increase our visibility and access to capital in the world's largest biotech market,” said Dr. Margaret Chan, Medeva's Chief Executive Officer. “Our precision immunotherapy platform has generated promising new treatment approaches that are yielding exciting clinical results, especially in hard-to-treat cancers like glioblastoma, metastatic melanoma and pancreatic cancer. A NYSE listing will help fuel our innovation efforts and bring these novel therapies to patients as quickly as possible.”

Medeva has seen its revenues grow at an average rate of 42% over the past three years, fueled by sales of its lead product, the ovarian cancer vaccine Ovarix. Last year, the company earned €157 million in revenue and reported net income of €47 million. Medeva is based in Oxford, England and has over 400 employees across its locations in the UK, United States and China.

The biotechnology sector, especially the field of cancer immunotherapy, has seen high growth in recent years. The global biotech market is valued at over $300 billion, with over 50% of revenues coming from the United States. Cancer immunotherapy sales are projected to reach $100 billion per year by 2025, according to analysts. 

“A NYSE listing will significantly raise our profile with U.S. investors and provide better access to the largest pool of investment capital for biotech companies,” said Brian Jones, Medeva's Chief Financial Officer. “We believe Medeva is very well positioned to tap into this growth given our innovative pipeline, clinical momentum and strong financials. The capital raised through the NYSE listing will enable us to accelerate our growth by investing in clinical trials, new research labs and other initiatives to build our capabilities in cell therapy and gene editing.”

The timing of the planned NYSE listing by Medeva will depend on shareholder approval and SEC review of the company's registration statement in the coming months. If approved, Medeva expects to commence trading on the NYSE during the first half of 2021 under the stock ticker symbol “MDVA”. Advisors for the listing include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Barclays.
