KS Biomedix Holdings Nears Major Breakthrough in the Development of Sheep Monoclonal Antibodies for Groundbreaking Cancer and Viral Infection Drugs

Biotech firm KS Biomedix Holdings today announced it is close to a significant advancement in the production of monoclonal antibodies using sheep. The antibodies could potentially be used to develop innovative new drugs to treat a range of cancers and viral infections.

KS Biomedix has been working for over a decade to develop the capability to harvest sheep antibodies that can be used to create new targeted biologic therapies. The company has been collaborating with scientists at the University of Edinburgh who have developed techniques to create sheep that can produce human antibodies.  

Dr. Elaine Stephenson, chief scientific officer at KS Biomedix, stated, “We have been able to generate sheep with immune systems that produce monoclonal antibodies targeting specific proteins found in humans. The sheep effectively have humanized immune systems that can then be used as ‘factories’ to produce antibodies matched to human targets.”

These sheep-derived humanized monoclonal antibodies offer significant advantages over traditional mouse-derived ones. They are more similar to the antibodies found in humans, so they are less likely to provoke an immune response. They are also more effective in their targeting of specific cells and proteins.  

KS Biomedix is currently conducting preclinical trials of several sheep monoclonal antibodies, including ones directed at breast cancer tumors, the Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus. If proven safe and effective, these could enter human clinical trials within the next two to three years.

“This has the potential to revolutionize how we develop new antibody-based drugs,” said Martin Hedges, CEO of KS Biomedix. “The capabilities of our platform could enable new treatments for diseases that have proven intractable using current approaches. We are very excited to be at the leading edge of this promising new area of drug development.”

The company expects to have further updates on their progress with sheep monoclonal antibodies and advancements into human trials over the coming months. If successful, this breakthrough could significantly impact the future treatment of cancer, viral diseases, and other illnesses currently lacking effective therapies.
