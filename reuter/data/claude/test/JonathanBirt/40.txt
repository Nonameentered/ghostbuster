Courtaulds Plc Plans to Expand Tencel, Coatings, and Polymer Business to Spearhead Growth in Coming Years

Courtaulds Plc, a UK-based manufacturer of acrylic, polymer, coating, and fiber products, announced plans to aggressively expand three of its divisions to drive future growth. The company will invest over £200 million over the next 3 years to increase production of Tencel lyocell fibers, enhance its coatings operations, and boost its polymer and chemical intermediates business.

Courtaulds’ Tencel division, which produces wood-based cellulosic fibers, has seen strong demand in recent years from clothing brands looking for sustainable alternatives to cotton. The company will build a new Tencel production line in Grimsby, UK that will increase total capacity by over 50%. The expansion will make Courtaulds the largest Tencel manufacturer in Europe and the second largest in the world. The company expects revenue from Tencel to grow by at least £50 million per year once the new line is operational in 2023.

The coatings division, which produces industrial coatings, paints, and resins, will receive £80 million to upgrade several of its production facilities and invest in new product development. Courtaulds aims to gain regulatory approval for new coating technologies that are more environmentally friendly while also improving performance. The company hopes these investments will increase coatings revenue by 6-8% annually over the next 5 years. 

Finally, Courtaulds will build a new polymer and chemical intermediates plant near Manchester, UK. The £120 million investment will significantly expand production of acrylic polymers used in paints, adhesives, and other applications. The new plant will supply both Courtaulds’ internal customers as well as external partners. The company projects polymer revenue to rise by £35-£40 million per year once the new facility opens in mid-2024.

Courtaulds CEO Stephen Langdown said “We aim to accelerate growth across our key divisions through these ambitious investments. By expanding Tencel output, improving our coatings solutions, and boosting polymer production, we will be able to better serve existing customers and reach new ones. We expect overall company revenue to increase by 4-6% per annum over the next several years if we achieve our targets.” 

The company appears to be making a bold bid to gain market share in eco-friendly and high-performance materials. If successful, these expansion plans could propel Courtaulds to become a leader in sustainable chemicals and industrial solutions. Investors reacted positively to the announcements, sending Courtaulds’ shares up over 3% in midday trading. The next few years will determine whether the investments pay off and Courtaulds’ vision for the future is realized.
