ICI Plans to Float Troubled Tioxide Operations on Stock Exchange for More Profitable Future  

Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Britain's largest chemical company, has announced plans to spin off its struggling Tioxide business as an independent publicly traded company. Tioxide, which produces titanium dioxide pigments used in paints, plastics and paper, has faced declining profits and increasing competition from lower-cost producers in recent years.

By floating Tioxide on the London Stock Exchange, ICI hopes to raise £500 million to pay down debt and invest in growing its more profitable specialty chemical and paint divisions. "Tioxide remains an important business, but it no longer fits with ICI's strategic focus on higher growth and higher margin operations," said ICI Chief Executive David Rickards. 

ICI acquired Tioxide in 1986 but the business has struggled recently with falling pigment prices and rising costs. Tioxide profits dropped 23% last year, even as ICI's overall profits rose 11%. The declining value of Tioxide led ICI to take a £200 million write-down on the business last year and management determined the challenges facing Tioxide could be better addressed as a standalone company.

As an independent public company, Tioxide will have more flexibility to pursue strategic partnerships, make acquisitions, and implement a tailored growth strategy for the pigments market focused on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, according to ICI. The company believes new ownership will also allow Tioxide to obtain investment specifically suited to the cyclical pigments industry.

However, analysts caution that Tioxide may continue to face significant headwinds as an independent company and the £500 million ICI hopes to gain from the float represents a lower valuation than what ICI paid for Tioxide 33 years ago, adjusting for inflation. Pigment overcapacity and volatile raw materials costs are likely to continue pressuring profits for the foreseeable future. Tioxide will also lose the financial support of its large parent company as a standalone business.

ICI's move to spin off Tioxide comes as the company tries to focus on more specialized and profitable areas of chemicals and coatings. ICI has divested more than half of its assets since 2017 as it transforms into a leaner, higher-growth company. The float of Tioxide, set to be complete by the end of this year pending regulatory and shareholder approval, would mark one of the final steps in ICI's shift to become a predominantly specialty chemicals firm.
