BOC Group Launches Breathable, Liquefied Air for Temporary Cold Storage and Aircraft Engine Testing 

BOC Group, a leading industrial gases company, announced today the launch of a new breathable liquefied air product for use in temporary refrigerated storage and aircraft engine testing applications. The new product, called BOC LiquiAir, uses advanced liquefaction technology to convert ambient air into a liquid with a boiling point of -321Â°F while still maintaining breathable oxygen levels.

The ultra-low boiling point of BOC LiquiAir enables it to provide rapid cooling for temporary refrigerated storage of perishable goods or for quickly chilling aircraft engines during testing. The ability to liquefy air while keeping oxygen at breathable concentrations provides a key safety benefit for applications where workers need to access the ultra-low temperature equipment. 

"BOC LiquiAir provides a versatile, portable and safe method for generating extremely low temperatures on demand," said Dr. Helen Stanley, Head of New Product Innovation at BOC. "The product has the potential to disrupt existing technologies used for temporary refrigeration and aircraft engine testing that rely on toxic or flammable refrigerants and fuels."

BOC LiquiAir uses a mobile liquefaction plant to convert ambient air into liquid, which is then stored in a cryogenic storage tank on-site. The liquefied air is pumped to the point of use, where controlled evaporation and expansion brings it to the target temperature before it is used for cooling and then vented safely back to the atmosphere. This closed-loop, refrigerant-free system enhances environmental and safety benefits compared to existing refrigerant-based solutions.

The new product has been piloted by select customers over the past 6 months, including a major aircraft engine manufacturer. According to their spokesperson, "BOC LiquiAir has proven to be a game-changer for our engine testing operations. The rapid cooling capability has increased our throughput and productivity, while the breathable and environmentally friendly nature of the product has simplified our operations and boosted safety."

BOC plans to make BOC LiquiAir widely commercially available beginning in January next year. The company sees potential for the product in food refrigeration, pharmaceutical storage and transportation, as well as various aerospace and defense applications. BOC Group expects BOC LiquiAir to generate at least $15-20 million in additional revenue for the company in the next 3 to 5 years.
