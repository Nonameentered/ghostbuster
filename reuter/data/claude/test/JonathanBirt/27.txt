Courtaulds Textiles to Shift Production to Asia, Resulting in Job Losses in Europe 

Courtaulds Textiles, a major British textile manufacturer, announced plans today to shift the bulk of its production from European plants to new facilities in Asia over the next 18 months. The move is expected to result in the loss of up to 2,000 jobs across Courtaulds’ European operations as mills and factories are downsized or closed.

Courtaulds cited cheaper labor and production costs in Asia as the primary drivers behind the decision. “We have to adapt to the realities of the global marketplace if we want to remain competitive,” said Howard Chen, Courtaulds’ CEO. “Our customers are increasingly looking to Asia for lower-cost sourcing, and we have no choice but to follow them.”

Two Courtaulds mills in Northern England will be closed by the end of the year, impacting 800 workers. Additional cutbacks will be made at other UK sites, including Courtaulds’ historic flagship mill in Coventry, where the company was founded in 1794. Courtaulds’ operations in Italy and Germany will also see job losses over the next 18 months, though specific numbers have not yet been announced.

The job cuts come despite Courtaulds posting steady profits in recent years. However, Mr. Chen said profit margins have been under increasing pressure due to the strong pound and rising costs in the UK and Europe. By shifting up to 60% of their production to Asia, Courtaulds expects to boost profits and cut costs for customers. New production centers in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Bangladesh are already under construction.

The plan was announced just weeks after Courtaulds rebuffed a takeover bid from a Chinese textile conglomerate. Mr. Chen denied that the job cuts were a direct result of that bid, insisting that Courtaulds’ new strategy had been under development for over a year. However, industry analysts said Courtaulds likely now sees partnering with Asian producers as a better path to growth than an outright takeover.

Labor leaders in the UK have condemned Courtaulds’ plan as “devastating” and “a betrayal of our industrial heritage.” They argue that decades of job cuts and mill closures have already decimated the once-thriving British textile industry. Courtaulds insists that a more globally integrated supply chain is the only way to keep British textile manufacturing alive, even if at a smaller scale. For workers facing job losses, however, that is little consolation. The future of one of Britain’s oldest industries looks increasingly uncertain.
