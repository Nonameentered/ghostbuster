Zeneca Group Plc Shatters Records with Sales of Over £5 Billion and Profits over £1 Billion for the First Time  

London, UK: Zeneca Group PLC, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, today announced record sales and profits for 2019. The company reported sales of £5.1 billion, up 12% from 2018, and net income of £1.2 billion, a 25% increase year over year. These results shattered previous company records and beat analyst expectations.  

"2019 was an exceptional year for Zeneca as we continued to launch innovative new medicines and achieved strong growth across our key therapeutic areas," said CEO Simon Stevens. "Our robust results demonstrate the strength of our science-led strategy and patient-focused business model. I want to thank all Zeneca employees for their dedication in helping improve the lives of patients around the world."

The company's oncology division was the top performer, with sales increasing 18% to £2.2 billion due to strong demand for Zeneca's new line of targeted cancer therapies. In particular, sales of Enzacta, a treatment for a rare form of bone cancer, nearly doubled to £470 million following approval for three new indications in the U.S. and Europe.

Results were also boosted by double-digit sales growth in Zeneca's respiratory and immunology franchises, which grew 15% and 13% respectively on the continued success of the company's biologic medicines. Sales of Duplixa and Triplexia, biologic treatments for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rheumatoid arthritis, rose sharply, up 23% and 18% each.   

To support its future growth, Zeneca invested £1.9 billion in research and development, focusing on its most promising experimental therapies in oncology, immunology, and targeted speciality care. The company has over 50 medicines currently in development, including 10 in late-stage trials. “Our R&D pipeline is the deepest it has ever been, filled with innovative therapies for diseases with high unmet medical need," said Mr. Stevens.

The company also completed two strategic acquisitions in 2019 that further strengthen its portfolio. Zeneca acquired U.S.-based Capletix Pharmaceuticals for $3.2 billion, gaining access to novel treatments for rare blood disorders. It also purchased privately held GeneraMed, a U.K. gene and cell therapy startup, for £400 million upfront and up to £1.2 billion in milestone payments. 

Based on its strong performance and outlook, Zeneca raised its profit guidance for 2020. The company now expects sales growth of 8-10% and earnings-per-share growth of 12-15% for the year. Shares of Zeneca rose 3.8% on the news in early London trading.
