Avalon Oil Plc looks to London for funding of oil exploration joint venture with FAO Gazprom, citing British investors ahead of U.S. in investing in Russian projects.

Avalon Oil Plc, a U.K.-based independent oil and gas exploration and development company, announced today it is seeking to raise $500 million through a listing on the London Stock Exchange to fund its joint venture with Russia's FAO Gazprom. The joint venture would focus on developing shale oil fields in Western Siberia that Avalon believes could hold up to 3 billion barrels of recoverable oil.  

Avalon's CEO Mark Thompson said the company chose to list in London rather than New York because British investors have shown more appetite for investment in Russia despite ongoing geopolitical tensions. "The city of London has deep expertise in oil and gas financing and British investors understand the potential of the assets we have gained access to through our partnership with FAO Gazprom," Thompson said. "Our assets in Siberia could be transformative for Avalon, and we believe British investors will see the opportunity."

The decision comes as investment in Russia from the U.S. and Western Europe has declined following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine. However, British investors have remained more bullish on Russia, seeing opportunities despite the political tensions.  

Under the terms of the joint venture with FAO Gazprom, Avalon will gain access to 3 shale oil fields in the Bazhenov formation with an estimated 22 billion barrels of oil in place. Avalon will operate the joint venture and plans an aggressive drilling program to tap into the resources. FAO Gazprom will gain a minority shareholding in Avalon through the deal as well as profit share in the joint venture.
