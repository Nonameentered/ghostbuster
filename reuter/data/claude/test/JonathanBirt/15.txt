Paxil/Seroxat set to become SmithKline Beecham's best-selling drug by end of year  

SmithKline Beecham announced today that sales of its popular antidepressant Paxil, known as Seroxat in markets outside the U.S. and Canada, are projected to surpass those of its all-time best-selling product Zantac before the end of this year. Paxil has seen steadily increasing demand and sales growth over the past decade due to its efficacy in treating social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in addition to its initially approved indication for major depression.  

Paxil brought in over $5 billion in revenue for SmithKline Beecham last year, representing more than 10% of the company's total sales. At its current growth rate, Paxil is on track to generate $5.5 billion this year, which would make it the first SmithKline Beecham product to achieve blockbuster status, defined as annual sales of $5 billion or more. In contrast, Zantac, which revolutionized the treatment of ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease, achieved peak annual sales of $4.6 billion in 1994 before facing competition from cheaper generic versions.

The surging sales of Paxil highlight the increasing demand for new treatments of anxiety and mood disorders, now recognized as some of the most common mental health conditions worldwide. However, some critics argue that Paxil and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are overprescribed, especially for mild to moderate cases of depression and anxiety. There have also been concerns about potential side effects of Paxil, including withdrawal symptoms, birth defects, and increased suicidal thoughts in some patients. SmithKline Beecham has faced numerous lawsuits over Paxil in the past decade, although most have been dismissed or settled out of court.

Continued strong growth of Paxil into a blockbuster product would be a major win for SmithKline Beecham as the company prepares to merge with Glaxo Wellcome. The new company GlaxoSmithKline will have a combined portfolio including Paxil, Zantac, and Glaxo's best-selling asthma drug Advair. Paxil's success has established SmithKline Beecham as a leader in the antidepressant and anti-anxiety market and strengthened its position as the world's fourth largest pharmaceutical company. Overall, the future appears bright for Paxil despite some persisting controversies, with more indications and patient populations still to be explored.
