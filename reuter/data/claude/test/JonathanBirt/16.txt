Peptide Therapeutics Plc plans to target North America for further alliances

Peptide Therapeutics Plc, a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing peptide-based drugs, has announced plans to establish strategic partnerships in North America to further boost its drug development programs. The company is seeking licensing or co-development deals with biotech and pharmaceutical companies in the US and Canada, particularly for its lead candidate PT-101, a novel peptide currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of gastric cancer.

PT-101 has already shown promising results in early clinical studies, reducing tumor size in over 50% of patients. Peptide Therapeutics believes the North American market, with its large number of oncology-focused biotech companies and big pharma players, presents significant opportunities for partnerships and collaborations to accelerate PT-101's development and path to market. "North America is at the forefront of cancer research and innovation, so we are excited to engage with partners there to unlock the potential of PT-101," said Dr. Jane Milton, CEO of Peptide Therapeutics. 

Beyond PT-101, Peptide Therapeutics has a pipeline of other peptide-based therapies in early-stage research and development targeting various cancers as well as autoimmune and central nervous system disorders. The company hopes that establishing a footprint in North America will help raise awareness of its broader platform and portfolio. "While our immediate priority is to partner PT-101, we aim to build long-term collaborations with companies in North America that share our vision for creating a new generation of peptide medicines," Dr. Milton said.

Peptide Therapeutics was founded in 2001 and has operations in Manchester, UK. The company has raised over $200 million in venture capital to date and employs around 150 scientists and staff across research and development and business functions. industry experts believe North American deals, if successful, could significantly accelerate Peptide Therapeutics' growth. The company's stock rose over 4% in morning trading on the news of the planned expansion into strategic partnerships in North America.
