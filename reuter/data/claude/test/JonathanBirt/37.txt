Scottish Company Develops "World-Beating" Test for Heart Attacks and Disease   

A small Scottish life sciences company has developed what it claims is a "world-beating" blood test that can detect if someone is at risk of a heart attack or other major cardiovascular diseases with up to 95 percent accuracy. Edinburgh-based Neuraclean announced today that years of research have culminated in the creation of the NeuraPlus diagnostic test, which can measure levels of several biological markers linked to heart problems to determine an individual's risk profile with an unprecedented degree of precision.   

The NeuraPlus test looks at levels of more than 30 genetic, protein and metabolic biomarkers in a blood sample, including some that have only recently been found to have a connection to heart disease. By analyzing combinations and interactions between these markers, Neuraclean's researchers have created an advanced predictive model that far outstrips current methods of assessing heart disease risk, according to the company. Most standard tests look at just a single biomarker like cholesterol levels, while the NeuraPlus system provides a much broader and more detailed snapshot of an individual's cardiovascular health.

"What we have developed is a vastly superior biomarker and machine learning-powered diagnostic that can tell with unparalleled reliability if someone will likely have a heart attack or stroke due to atherosclerosis in the next five or 10 years," said Neuraclean's CEO, Dr. Lynette Hamilton. "The test identifies risk factors and patient profiles that have never before been detectable using standard tests. We believe it will transform how doctors approach heart disease prevention and save many thousands of lives."

In clinical trials, the NeuraPlus test demonstrated an ability to predict the likelihood of a major adverse cardiovascular event with an accuracy of up to 95 percent, outperforming standard diagnostic tools like the Framingham Risk Score. The company is now planning to conduct larger scale studies required for regulatory approval and expects the test to be available to doctors and patients starting in 2023. Neuraclean also announced it has raised $10 million in venture capital to help accelerate these plans.   

Heart disease and stroke are together the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for about 18 million deaths each year according to the World Health Organization. Despite major advances in treatment, most heart problems are still detected only after damage has already been done to blood vessels and the heart muscle. Doctors and health experts welcomed news of a fast, affordable and highly predictive diagnostic tool that could help change this reactive approach.

Dr. Eleanor Shaw, a cardiologist at Edinburgh Heart Centre, said "the potential benefits of such an advanced predictive test are enormous. If we can identify those at highest risk of heart disease early and accurately enough, we can intervene with medication, lifestyle changes and other treatments to stop or slow down disease progression before patients start experiencing chest pains or worse. This could help people live longer, better quality lives and reshape public health."

Neuraclean's announcement was also endorsed by charities including the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded some of the research behind the new test. In a statement, the Foundation's deputy chief executive Jean Khazi called the NeuraPlus diagnostic "a breakthrough that could have a huge impact in the fight against heart disease and stroke, helping doctors detect risk before the first signs of disease appear."
