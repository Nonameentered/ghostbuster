British Gas in Negotiations Over Crippling Gas Supply Contracts 

British Gas, the UK’s largest energy supplier, is in emergency negotiations with its natural gas providers over supply contracts that threaten to cripple the company. Sources inside British Gas say the long-term contracts, some spanning up to 10-15 years, have locked the company into buying natural gas at prices far above the current market rate.

The outdated contracts, signed in the early and mid-2010s when gas prices were significantly higher, require British Gas to purchase large volumes of natural gas at those previously agreed upon prices. But in recent years, the wholesale price of natural gas has plunged more than 60% due to oversupply and the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown. Industry experts warn that British Gas is overpaying by as much as £2 billion each year due to being stuck in these rigid long-term contracts.

The massive overpayments are endangering British Gas’s financial situation, which has already suffered from years of declining customer numbers and revenue. The company’s parent firm, Centrica, lost over 70% of its market value in 2020 and announced plans in June to cut 5,000 jobs in an effort to cut costs. But breaking free of the crippling gas supply deals is seen as essential to turning around British Gas’s battered balance sheet.   

British Gas is in talks with Norwegian state-owned Equinor, British-Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell, and Algeria’s Sonatrach, all of which provide a significant percentage of British Gas’s annual natural gas supplies. According to sources, British Gas is lobbying the suppliers to void the original contracts and renegotiate new flexible deals that reflect the current lower gas prices. However, the suppliers seem reluctant to void agreements from which they continue to profit.

Industry analysts say British Gas lacks leverage in the negotiations and risks being left with little choice but to take legal action against suppliers to escape the contracts. Litigation could be an arduous process with an uncertain outcome, however. In the meantime, British Gas continues to bleed money from the deals each month the situation is unresolved. The next few weeks of negotiations are seen as pivotal in determining whether British Gas can free itself from the burdensome contracts or remains shackled to them at the cost of its financial recovery.
