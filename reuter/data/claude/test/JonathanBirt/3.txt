Gulf Canada Resources makes improved offer for Clyde Petroleum, but fate still hangs in the  balance

Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. announced today that it has submitted an improved all-cash offer to acquire Clyde Petroleum plc for £1.35 billion ($2.1 billion). The new bid represents an 11% improvement over Gulf Canada's previous offer of £1.2 billion, which was rejected by Clyde's board in early April. 

The increased offer comes as Clyde faces mounting pressure to accept a takeover deal amid a slump in oil prices that has diminished profits and constrained its ability to invest in new exploration projects. Clyde's shares have fallen by over 50% from their 2014 highs, spurring calls for management to take action to unlock value for shareholders. However, the company has steadfastly insisted that it is pursuing its own strategic plan to emerge as an independent producer focused on the North Sea.

Gulf Canada's new bid values each Clyde share at £5, a 43% premium to the stock's closing price before the latest offer was announced. In a letter to Clyde's board, Gulf Canada CEO Brian Porter said the sweetened offer represents "the absolute maximum our Board of Directors would recommend and approve." Gulf Canada has touted nearly $500 million in potential cost savings and operational synergies if it acquired control of its British rival. 

A Clyde spokesman said the company's board will meet to consider the latest proposal and consult with major shareholders before announcing a decision on whether to recommend it. The board faces a difficult balancing act, seeking an outcome that provides an exit for investors keen to monetize their shares but still delivers adequate value for a company intent on forging its own future. 

Clyde's two largest shareholders, hedge fund Elliott Advisors and mutual fund manager Henderson Global Investors which combined own about 28% of the shares, will likely have a big say in the outcome. They have so far supported the company's independent strategy but analysts say Gulf Canada's latest bid may test their resolve. 

Most market observers believe Gulf Canada will have to dig deeper to strike a deal, possibly raising its offer to at least £5.25 per share. If approved, a successful takeover would cement Gulf Canada's transformation into a major North Sea producer, following its recent $6.3 billion acquisition of Apache North Sea assets. For Clyde, it would bring an uncertain future as part of a much larger organization with significant overlap in operations—but also the benefit of Gulf Canada's greater financial and technical resources to help develop new fields. After many twists and turns, the fate of this possible deal still hangs in the balance.
