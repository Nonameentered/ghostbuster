Vanguard Medica Plc may delay search for cash injection 

Vanguard Medica, a London-based biotechnology company, is considering delaying plans to raise new funding through an equity issuance. The company had planned to raise £50 million over the next 6-12 months to fund late-stage trials for its lead immunotherapy drug candidate VG-101. However, sources close to the company said Vanguard may choose to push back the fundraising by up to a year.

The delay comes amid turbulent market conditions for biotech companies and increased scrutiny of new drug pricing in the United States. Vanguard's share price has declined nearly 30% over the past year, making the valuation less attractive for new investors. The company is also wary of the reaction new drug pricing may receive, given the increased focus on healthcare costs during the US election cycle.

VG-101 is Vanguard's most advanced drug candidate, currently in Phase 2b trials for non-small cell lung cancer. The new funding was expected to finance Phase 3 trials required for regulatory approval. Vanguard CEO Tom Clarke said "We continue to believe in the potential of VG-101 to transform outcomes for lung cancer patients, however, we want to be prudent about the timing of new fundraising. Current market dynamics mean growth companies like Vanguard face a higher cost of capital, and we want to maximize the potential for strong investor interest when we do pursue new equity funding."

Delaying the fundraising is not without risks, as it could slow down VG-101's time to market and allow competitors to gain ground. However, Vanguard's existing cash reserves of £32 million provide a 12-18 month runway, giving them flexibility on timing. The company will also explore options for non-dilutive partnerships and licensing deals to supplement funding for the VG-101 program.  

Vanguard was founded in 2002 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2015. In addition to VG-101, the company has two other early-stage drug candidates focused on other hard-to-treat cancers. The stock declined 4% on the news, closing at 145 pence giving Vanguard a market capitalization of £287 million. Investors will be monitoring for updates on the company's funding and strategic plans over the coming months.
