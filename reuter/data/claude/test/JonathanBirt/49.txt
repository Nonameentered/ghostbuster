Cortecs International shares could rise 60% on positive drug trial results, say analysts 

Shares in Cortecs International, a biotechnology company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, could rise by up to 60% if its lead drug candidate shows positive results in ongoing late-stage clinical trials, according to analysts.

Cortecs' shares are up over 200% in the last 12 months in anticipation of results from Phase 3 trials of CTX-471, an experimental treatment for Parkinson's disease. The trials, which involve over 1,500 patients across 20 countries, are expected to report initial results within the next 3-6 months. If the data shows CTX-471 slows the progression of Parkinson's disease and demonstrates a good safety profile, Cortecs' stock price could surge to $92-$110 per share, up from the current $58, say analysts from investment banks JP Morgan and Credit Suisse.

“A positive readout from these pivotal CTX-471 trials would be transformative for Cortecs and open up an enormous commercial opportunity,” said JP Morgan analyst Jessica Lee. There are over 10 million people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide, but currently no treatment that can modify the course of the disease.  “Even a modest slowing of disease progression could make CTX-471 a multi-billion-dollar per year product,” Lee added.

However, the results are by no means guaranteed. “Biotech investing is risky, especially at this late clinical stage, and there is a decent chance the trials could fail or show mixed results,” warned Sam Robinson, a biotech fund manager at Acadian Asset Management. Cortecs' shares would likely tumble over 50-70% if the CTX-471 data disappoints, analysts consensus.

Cortecs was founded in Toronto, Canada in 2003 and now has operations across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company has over a dozen programs targeting diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. But CTX-471 is by far its most advanced and commercially promising drug candidate. Analysts estimate the Parkinson's treatment market alone could be worth up to $10 billion per year for Cortecs if approved. 

The next few months will be crucial for Cortecs as investors keenly await the results that could determine the company's future. If positive, CTX-471 may go on to transform the lives of millions of Parkinson's patients and turn Cortecs into a biotech industry star.
