Glaxo Wellcome's New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Hepatitis B, Offers Hope for Future Sales 

Glaxo Wellcome announced promising results from late-stage clinical trials of its new drug lamivudine, offering hope that the drug could become a new treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine showed a significant ability to suppress levels of the hepatitis B virus in the blood and liver in two Phase III studies involving more than 1,000 patients.

The drug was generally well tolerated, with few side effects reported. If approved, lamivudine would become the first oral antiviral drug to offer chronic hepatitis B patients an alternative to interferon injections, which often cause flu-like side effects. Lamivudine could tap into a large underserved market, with over 350 million people chronically infected with hepatitis B worldwide and few effective treatment options currently available.

“These results show lamivudine’s potential to transform the treatment landscape for patients with chronic hepatitis B,” said Dr. Philippa Handyside, Glaxo Wellcome’s head of clinical development. “An oral therapy with few side effects that can effectively suppress the virus long-term would address a major unmet need for these patients.”

In the studies, lamivudine reduced hepatitis B virus levels in the blood to undetectable levels in the majority of patients after a year of treatment. The effect was sustained over the two-year study period. The drug also showed signs of reducing liver inflammation and fibrosis, decreasing the likelihood of progression to more serious liver disease.

While the results are promising, lamivudine will still need to be approved by regulatory agencies before becoming available to patients. The company plans to file for approval with agencies in multiple countries over the coming months. Lamivudine would also face competition from other drugs in development, though it appears poised to become one of the first new options for patients in many years.

If approved, analysts estimate lamivudine could generate over $200 million in sales next year and up to $1 billion per year at peak sales, providing a much-needed boost to Glaxo Wellcome’s revenues. The company’s stock rose over 5% on the news, reflecting investor optimism about the drug’s commercial potential. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, lamivudine offers the hope of a more effective and tolerable treatment that could help limit progression of this potentially deadly disease.
