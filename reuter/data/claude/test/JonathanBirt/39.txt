Courtaulds Plc looks beyond troubled viscose business with new focus on Tencel, coatings, and packaging  

Courtaulds Plc, a major British manufacturer of fiber, coatings, and packaging solutions, announced a shift in strategic focus away from its struggling viscose business toward more promising and high-growth areas. The company will increase investment in its Tencel fiber unit, coatings division, and packaging solutions business.

Courtaulds’ viscose business has faced significant headwinds in recent years due to oversupply in the market and increased competition from low-cost Asian producers. Operating margins in the viscose unit have declined steeply, prompting the company to explore alternative growth avenues. 

Tencel, Courtaulds’ brand of lyocell fiber made from eucalyptus wood pulp, has experienced strong demand from fashion brands looking for sustainable and eco-friendly fabrics. Courtaulds plans to upgrade Tencel production facilities in the UK and US to boost annual output by over 50% in the next two years. The company is also launching a new Tencel sub-brand targeting activewear and denim.

Courtaulds’ coatings division, which produces water-based and eco-friendly coatings for paint, paper, and packaging applications, also shows promising growth potential. The company will build a new production plant in Eastern Europe to meet increasing customer demand in the region. New coatings product lines made from biodegradable and renewable materials are under development for release next year.

Finally, Courtaulds sees an opportunity to expand its packaging solutions business, especially in eco-friendly packaging, along with paper products and bags. The company plans to acquire part of its current key supplier to bolster its packaging operations. The firm is also in talks with international packaging groups on potential collaborations to move into new territories for sustainable packaging solutions.

With this pivot from its viscose legacy business, Courtaulds is navigating challenges and searching for innovative, future-ready opportunities. If these strategic initiatives to advance Tencel, coatings, and packaging solutions prove successful, the company is well placed to drive sustainable long-term growth. The next couple of years will be crucial as Courtaulds implements these plans and further diversifies from viscose.
