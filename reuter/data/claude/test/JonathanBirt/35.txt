The company will invest over $500 million over the next 3-5 years to build new production facilities, expand its R&D centers and increase its sales and marketing teams in these high-growth regions.

“Emerging markets are a key part of our growth strategy and the major driver of demand for our products going forward,” said Sir Martin Albright, Chairman and CEO of Albright & Wilson Plc. “There is a rising need for our chemicals and technologies in industries across South America, China and India, from water treatment and construction to agriculture and automotive manufacturing. By expanding our presence in these markets, we aim to capture new opportunities, better serve our customers and gain a competitive advantage.”

In South America, Albright & Wilson will construct two new production plants for phosphates and solvents in Brazil to meet increasing customer demand in the region. The company will also open new offices in Chile, Colombia and Peru, and double its sales and technical staff across South America. In China, Albright & Wilson’s new 35,000 square meter research and development center in Shanghai will focus on innovations for sectors like coatings, electronics and oil refining where demand for specialty chemicals is high. In India, Albright & Wilson will expand capacity at its existing production facility for copper compounds and hydrochloric acid, and invest in its R&D and sales operations to drive further growth.
