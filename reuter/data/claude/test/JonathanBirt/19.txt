Britain's "world-beating" pharmaceutical industry under threat due to rapid deterioration in science base: major companies warn

Some of Britain's largest pharmaceutical companies have warned that the country's status as a world leader in life sciences is under threat due to a rapid deterioration in its science base. In a letter to the Prime Minister, executives from major drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and others said the UK risks losing its competitive advantage in pharmaceuticals and biotech without urgent government action.

The UK currently has a thriving pharmaceutical sector, employing over 73,000 people and generating annual revenues of over £30 billion. However, industry leaders said investment in research and development has plateaued in recent years while funding and resources for academic research have declined sharply. They pointed to major cuts in government funding for universities during the economic downturn that have not been fully reversed, as well as uncertainties around Brexit that have made the UK a less attractive place for international talent and collaboration.

"The UK's science base is in deterioration," the executives wrote. "Without action, the UK will lose its standing as a world leader in life sciences." They urged the government to dramatically boost funding for scientific research, invest in emerging fields like genomics and AI, simplify regulations around clinical trials, and guarantee the rights of scientists and researchers from EU countries currently working in Britain. "We do not have the luxury of time to delay action," the letter said. 

Responding to the warning, a government spokesperson said the UK remains committed to scientific excellence and world-class research. "We have invested over £22 billion in R&D during this Parliament, including launching ambitious new funding programmes for high-risk, high-reward research and setting up the new Advanced Research & Invention Agency," the spokesperson said. "While we appreciate the value of EU research partnerships, Brexit also offers opportunities for Britain to strengthen ties with leading scientists and innovators from around the world."

However, critics argue the government's words have not been matched by actions. They point out that while funding has increased in some areas like infrastructure, direct support for academic research has declined in real terms. Leading scientists have also warned Brexit and policies like the "hostile environment" for immigrants threaten to drive away talent and disrupt vital international collaborations. “The government cannot simply rely on rhetoric,” said Professor Brian Cox, a physicist at Manchester University. “If Britain wants to lead in technology and innovation post-Brexit, we need policies and funding in place today to nurture our research base for tomorrow.”
