Glaxo Wellcome sees profit leap, but warns of tough times ahead with loss of U.S. patent on top drug  

Glaxo Wellcome, the British pharmaceutical giant, reported a 25% surge in first-quarter profits today  as sales of its blockbuster asthma drug Advair continued to soar. However, the company warned that earnings growth would slow significantly over the next two years as it loses patent protection on several major drugs, including Advair.

Glaxo said net income rose to £1.97 billion, or $3.06 billion, in the first three months of the year, up from £1.57 billion a year earlier. Revenues climbed 15% to £7.81 billion. The results were fueled by a 29% jump in sales of Advair, which racked up over $2 billion in revenue for the quarter. Advair, which combines two medicines in one inhaler, has become Glaxo's top-selling product and a crucial engine of growth.

However, Glaxo faces a looming challenge as the U.S. patent on Advair expires in 2023, opening the door to cheap generic competition. The loss of that patent is expected to slice up to 30% from Glaxo's earnings per share, according to analysts. To cushion the blow, Glaxo is working on newer respiratory drugs and hopes to win approvals for them before Advair's patent loss. But developing new blockbusters is challenging and there are no guarantees of success.

"We are preparing the company for a period of significantly slower growth," said Emma Walmsley, Glaxo's chief executive. "We know 2021 to 2023 will be challenging years as we absorb the impact of Advair losses in the U.S."

The patent expiry cliff is a familiar threat to big pharmaceutical companies, which pour billions of dollars into research and development but struggle to discover enough new drugs to offset sales declines from former blockbusters. Glaxo faces patent losses on two other drugs over the next two years that currently generate more than $3 billion in combined annual revenue.

To diversify beyond prescription drugs, Glaxo has been expanding into consumer healthcare, buying brands like Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil pain reliever. Ms. Walmsley said Glaxo would continue to pursue "targeted business development" to strengthen its portfolio. Glaxo's shares fell 3% in London trading as investors weighed the company's short-term growth prospects. Still, over the last 12 months Glaxo's share price has climbed 15%, reflecting optimism over moves into consumer brands and a promising pipeline of new drugs, especially in oncology.

With both headwinds and opportunities on the horizon, Ms. Walmsley said Glaxo was in a "transition period" but remained confident in its long term strategy.  "We believe we have the right plan and portfolio in place," she said, "to sustain leadership and success."
