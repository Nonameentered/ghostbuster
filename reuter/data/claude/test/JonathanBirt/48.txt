Analysts Warn That Biocompatibles Plc May Be Overvalued As Shares Soar 

Shares of London-based medical device maker Biocompatibles Plc have surged over 50% in the past month following the successful launch of its new biodegradable stent. However, some analysts are warning investors that the share price spike may have gotten ahead of itself and the stock could be overvalued.

Biocompatibles received regulatory approval in January for its new drug-eluting stent that is absorbed by the body within a year after implantation. The bio-absorbable stents are seen as a breakthrough that can eliminate some long-term risks associated with permanent metal stents. Biocompatibles is the first company to receive approval to sell the stents in Europe, fueling enthusiasm about the new technology.

The stock rose sharply in February as the company reportedstrong sales out of the gate for the new stents across hospitals in Germany and the UK. But analysts caution that the initial demand may not be sustainable and future sales growth could level off or even decline in the coming quarters. 

“While the new stent is an innovative product, the initial sales surge was to some degree expected as hospitals and doctors rushed to gain experience with the new technology,” said George Mallory, a medical devices analyst at Baird. “The key question now is whether Biocompatibles can continue to demonstrate strong growth with this product over the longer term, and at this point the jury is still out.”

Other analysts echo similar views that Biocompatibles still needs to prove the staying power of its new stents. The stock is currently trading at 25 times projected earnings for this year, a sizable premium to larger peers Medtronic and Boston Scientific, which trade at 18 times and 20 times earnings, respectively.

“The current valuation has likely priced in an overly optimistic scenario for the growth and market potential of the new stents,” said Brian Harris, an analyst at UBS, who has a “Sell” rating on Biocompatibles shares. “There are still many unanswered questions around reimbursement, clinical outcomes, and longer-term adoption. We think investors should lock in profits at these levels.”

While new technologies like the bio-absorbable stents are exciting, Biocompatibles ultimately needs to show it can transform the new innovations into sustainable and profitable business lines. Until then, analysts say, the stock remains vulnerable to selling pressure if future growth comes in below the lofty expectations currently built into the share price.
