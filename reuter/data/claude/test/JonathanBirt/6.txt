ICI Looks to Reshape Business with Flotations, Asset Swaps, and Acquisitions  

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) announced today that it has embarked on a strategic transformation plan aimed at reshaping its business portfolio. The key pillars of the plan include pursuing initial public offerings (IPOs) and spin-offs of certain businesses, swapping assets with other companies, and targeted acquisitions.

ICI has long been seeking to shift its focus to higher growth and higher margin businesses, especially in emerging markets and sectors like biotechnology and agrochemicals. “Our portfolio reshuffle will enable us to double down on businesses where we have competitive advantages and strong growth prospects,” said John Robinson, ICI’s CEO. 

ICI’s coatings and adhesives division is slated to be spun off into a new company and listed on the London Stock Exchange later this year. The divison, which produces paints and industrial coatings, has estimated annual revenues of £3.2 billion but operating margins below ICI’s average. By separating the business, ICI hopes to maximize its value and allow both companies to better focus on their strategic priorities.

In a win-win asset swap, ICI will exchange its European surfactants business for the North American polyurethane systems business of U.S. chemical company Dow Inc. ICI’s surfactants business has a strong market position but lacks scale, while Dow’s polyurethane systems unit would strengthen ICI’s existing polyurethane operations. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory approvals. 

To accelerate its move into biotech and agrochemicals, ICI plans to purchase three specialist companies for a combined Enterprise Value of £1.2 billion. The acquisitions will give ICI access to new technologies, talent, and distribution networks in Asia and Latin America. ICI aims to complete two of the deals before year-end 2020 and the third in early 2021.

Some analysts are skeptical about the scope of ICI’s transformation, especially given current market conditions. “Pursuing IPOs, M&A deals, and asset swaps at the same time is very ambitious, and there are risks around execution and valuations,” said Brian Thompson, an analyst at Investec Securities. However, others believe ICI’s decisive actions will create a leaner and more focused company better equipped for future growth. ICI’s stock price closed up 3% following the announcement, signaling investors’ support for the reshaping strategy.
