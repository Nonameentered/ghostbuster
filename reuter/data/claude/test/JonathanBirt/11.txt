Unilever to Sell Most of its Specialty Chemical Businesses, Sparking Speculation on Potential Buyers

Consumer goods giant Unilever announced plans this week to sell a majority of its specialty chemical businesses, signaling a strategic shift to focus on its core consumer products portfolio. The company will divest its chemicals units that produce raw materials for skin creams, detergents, and industrial applications. The businesses generated revenues of 750 million euros last year, representing a small fraction of Unilever's 52 billion euros in total annual revenue. 

The decision comes as Unilever aims to consolidate its sprawling operations after fending off a $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz last year. By exiting most of its chemicals businesses, Unilever can better concentrate on expanding its well-known 400 brands like Dove, Hellmann's, and Lipton. At the same time, the sale will provide an infusion of cash for Unilever to plow back into marketing and acquisitions of consumer brands.

"This disposal further sharpens our focus as a purpose-led company serving consumers and communities with brands that operate at the high end of sustainable and ethical standards,” said Unilever CEO Paul Polman in a statement.

The announcement sparked speculation among analysts about potential buyers for the specialty chemicals units. Private equity firms and specialty chemical companies are seen as the most likely suitors.

"These are high-margin, niche businesses with intellectual property and customer relationships that would be valuable to a number of potential strategic and sponsor buyers,” said James Martin, chemicals analyst at HSBC Securities. Private equity firms like Carlyle Group, which previously owned chemical company PQ Corp, could find the units attractive given their stable cash flows and potential for increased margins under private ownership.

Leading specialty chemical companies, including Evonik, Lanxess, and BASF, are also seen as potential acquirers as the businesses could strengthen their additives and ingredients portfolios. An acquisition could also provide small and mid-sized chemical firms a chance to scale up and gain valuable new capabilities. However, some analysts think the businesses may receive lower valuations if sold piecemeal versus as an entire unit.

The planned divestiture is expected to be completed within 12-18 months, according to Unilever. While the company has not yet named potential buyers, analysts expect a competitive bidding process for these specialty chemicals assets as Unilever seeks to maximize the price from their sale. The final price and buyers of the units will become clear over the coming months but Unilever is sure to redeploy the proceeds to reinforce its position in the hotly contested consumer packaged goods market.
