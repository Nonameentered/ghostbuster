Investors in UK Listed Soccer Clubs Experience Falling Share Prices

Share prices of publicly listed soccer clubs in the UK have fallen sharply in recent weeks, reflecting increasing pessimism among investors about the financial stability of clubs in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. 

Manchester United, the largest soccer club listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has seen its share price drop more than 25% from highs in February. The club generates a substantial portion of its revenue from ticket sales and matchday hospitality, both of which have ground to a halt with all major soccer leagues currently suspended. There are concerns the 2019/2020 season may not be completed, depriving clubs of critical TV rights and sponsorship revenue.

Arsenal Holdings PLC, which owns the Arsenal Football Club, has experienced an even steeper 35% share price decline since February. The club faces a potential revenue shortfall of over $100 million if the Premier League season cannot be finished. The suspension of leagues also impacts Arsenal’s retail store sales and summer tour revenue.

While all businesses have been affected by the crisis, "soccer clubs are particularly exposed due to their reliance on matchday revenue and the uncertainty around the 2019/2020 season," said industry analyst Chris Goddard. Clubs have begun announcing cost reduction plans, including Arsenal which will cut 55 jobs as part of a wider restructuring to offset financial pressures. 

However, some analysts believe the longer term outlook for top clubs remains positive, especially those with strong brands and global supporter bases. “While the near future is challenging, the fundamentals supporting the growth of soccer as a global sport are unchanged,” said investment firm Numis Securities in a research note.

The financial impact on smaller clubs further down the English football pyramid could be far more severe without aid. The English Football League has requested a 50 million pound grant from the Premier League to help clubs in lower divisions avoid insolvency. 

The share price drops highlight the precarious financial model of most soccer clubs, which often spend close to maximum levels regardless of revenue changes. With matches suspended for the foreseeable future, greater cost control and financial restraint will be critical for clubs to survive the current crisis in a sustainable way. Whether they can show this discipline will be closely followed by investors.
