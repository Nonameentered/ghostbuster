BSkyB to Launch 200-Channel Digital Satellite Service in Britain, Orders One Million Decoders  

British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (BSkyB) announced today that it will launch a new digital satellite television service in Britain offering 200 channels by the end of the year. The company has ordered one million set-top decoder boxes to support the new digital satellite service. 

BSkyB, Britain's dominant pay-TV provider, said the new digital satellite service will provide greater channel choice, improved picture and sound quality, and interactive TV services. The service will include 30 premium movie channels, 40 music video and audio channels, and over 100 basic channels with news, sports, entertainment, and children's programming.

"This is a major milestone for television in Britain and will revolutionize the viewing experience for our subscribers," said Samir Shah, BSkyB's CEO. "With 200 channels covering every genre, fantastic digital quality, and interactive options, we are entering a new era of choice and innovation in pay-TV."

The new digital satellite service will require subscribers to have a satellite dish and a new digital set-top box to decode the signals. BSkyB has ordered one million of the Mediastream 2000 set-top boxes from Sony Europe and Philips Electronics at a cost of £150-£200 million. The boxes will be subsidized for subscribers as part of various programming package options.

BSkyB will make the new digital satellite service available for £15-£30 per month depending on the number of channels selected. The basic package with 70 channels will be £15, while the premium movies and sports packages with over 150 channels will be £30. Existing BSkyB analog satellite subscribers will be offered a free digital set-top box and dish upgrade to encourage them to switch to the new digital service.

The launch of the 200-channel digital satellite service will accelerate the take-up of digital television in Britain. Only about 250,000 households currently subscribe to BSkyB's digital cable and mobile TV offerings. With over five million satellite dish owners in Britain, BSkyB is poised to quickly gain millions of digital subscribers and strengthen its position as the leader in Britain's pay-TV market.
