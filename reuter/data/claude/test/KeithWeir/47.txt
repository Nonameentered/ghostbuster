United News & Media reports over 20% rise in profits after merger

 United News & Media, one of the world's largest media conglomerates, announced a 22% increase in net profits for the second quarter of this year, boosted by recent mergers and acquisitions. Revenue rose 18% year over year to $32 billion, handily beating analysts' expectations.  

 The strong results reflect the first full quarter since United completed its acquisition of Global News Corp, one of its largest competitors, for $45 billion in an all-stock deal. The blockbuster merger, announced last year, made United the dominant player in global news media and allowed it to cut costs through job reductions and the consolidation of operations. United said it has already achieved $1.2 billion in annual cost savings from the merger by eliminating duplicate roles and infrastructure.

 "Our transformative merger with Global News Corp is already yielding tremendous benefits through significant synergies and improved operational efficiencies," said United CEO Brian Coleman in a statement. "We are extremely pleased with the financial results this quarter and excited about the momentum in our business."

 United's cable TV division also posted solid growth, with subscribers up 5% from a year earlier. However, its print newspaper business continued to struggle, with advertising revenue dropping nearly 10% due to an accelerating shift to digital media. In response, United announced plans to cut another 3,000 jobs in its newspaper unit, mainly through buyouts and early retirement offers. 

 The company's digital properties were bright spots, with its online news sites and streaming services gaining more than 20 million new subscribers over the past year. Revenue from United's digital operations grew over 50% and now represents nearly 40% of total revenue. 

 "United is making excellent progress in its transition to a digitally-focused media company," said Jessica Archer, media analyst at Rhodium Partners. "While the legacy print business faces ongoing headwinds, growth in their digital, video and cable segments should help offset those declines and power United's overall growth for the foreseeable future."

 Investors reacted positively to the results, with United's shares climbing over 7% in early trading. Barring any unexpected economic downturns, analysts predict United will achieve its full-year profit target and continue delivering value to shareholders from its mega-merger.
