Pearson Plc gains as Marjorie Scardino takes the reins

Shares of Pearson Plc, the British education and media company, rose more than 5% today as Marjorie Scardino officially took over as Chief Executive Officer. Scardino, formerly CEO of The Economist Group, succeeds Dame Marjorie Morris as head of the London-based firm. Investors are optimistic that Scardino, with her experience turning around The Economist magazine, can reinvigorate growth at Pearson. 

Pearson recently reported sluggish earnings and a decline in college enrollment in some of its key markets. The company has a portfolio of education, business, and consumer publishing assets, including Penguin Random House, the Financial Times, and a variety of textbook brands. Pearson generates over 60% of its sales in the United States but has struggled in recent years due to changes in the higher education market and curriculum standards.

Scardino is seen as a leader who can help Pearson adapt to disruptions in the industry and capitalize on the shift to digital and on-demand learning. In her time at The Economist, she led the successful modernization of the magazine into a multimedia and global brand. At her first meeting as CEO, Scardino said "Pearson has remarkable assets, brands, and talent. With focus and innovation, we can build on its leadership."

Pearson Chairman Sidney Taurel said the company conducted an extensive search but Scardino stood out for her track record of "transforming a traditional media company into a thriving multi-channel business." He expressed confidence she has the "vision and determination to accelerate Pearson's push into digital and services."

Scardino, 63, takes the reins at a pivotal time for Pearson. While print sales still make up over 50% of revenue, the company aims to reach learners through interactive apps, collaboration tools, and data analytics. Scardino said her priorities are to streamline operations, improve the client experience, invest in new education technology, and boost sales growth, especially in emerging markets. If initial investor reaction is any indication, the market approves of Pearson's choice of new captain to steer the ship through challenging but uncharted waters.
