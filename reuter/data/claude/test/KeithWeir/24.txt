EMI Expects Strong Sales Growth in Current Quarter, On Track for Modest Profit Growth This Year   

EMI Group PLC, the London-based music company, expects strong sales growth in the current quarter and remains on track to achieve modest profit growth for the full year. In a trading update released today, EMI said its recorded music division is performing well, driven by recent hit releases from artists like Sam Smith, Coldplay, and Ed Sheeran. Sales of CDs and vinyl records have also rebounded, contributing to overall sales growth.

EMI's publishing division, which holds the rights to more than 3 million songs, is benefiting from the rise of streaming music services. Revenues from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube have climbed over 25% so far this year. "Streaming has become an important and fast-growing part of our business, and we're well positioned to generate strong returns as more people turn to these services to listen to music," said Stephen Cooper, EMI's chief executive.

EMI released its half-year results in August, reporting a 4% rise in pre-tax profits to £109 million for the six months ending June 30, up from £105 million a year earlier. Revenues increased by 7% to £734 million due to a strong release schedule and growth in streaming. The company said it remains on track to deliver a "modest" increase in full-year profits if current trends continue through the second half of the year.

"We are making good progress diversifying our revenue streams and expanding into high-growth segments of the music market," Cooper said. "While the wider music industry continues to change at a rapid pace, we believe EMI is strategically well positioned to generate sustainable success over the long term." EMI's share price is up 2.3% in early trading following the announcement. The company's full-year results will be released in February.
