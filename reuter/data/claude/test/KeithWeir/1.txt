Yorkshire-Tyne Tees shares fall despite 80 percent profit rise 

Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Media fell 3 percent today despite the company announcing that pre-tax profits rose 80 percent in the six months to June. The broadcaster reported profits of £12.3 million, up from £6.8 million in the same period last year. However, investors reacted negatively to the results, sending the shares down 11.5p to 373.2p in morning trading.

Yorkshire-Tyne Tees attributed the profit surge to a strong performance from its television production arm and growth in its digital and events businesses. Revenue rose 9 percent to £97.2 million. The company said it is investing heavily in new programs and recently signed a co-production deal with a streaming service to produce three new dramas. It also acquired two independent production companies to boost its pipeline of new shows.

"We have delivered a very strong first-half performance, growing both revenue and profits," said Helen Stevens, Chief Executive. "Our balanced portfolio of businesses means we are not reliant on any single revenue stream. We continue to build the foundations for future growth by expanding our production capabilities and securing additional sources of content for our channels."

However, some analysts voiced concerns about rising costs and a slowing of advertising revenue growth. The company said ad revenue rose just 2 percent in the first half due to "ongoing economic and political uncertainty." Analysts worry that any downturn in the economy could hit Yorkshire-Tyne Tees's advertising revenue and margins.

"The results were solid but given the economic backdrop, the slowdown in ad revenue growth is a worry," said Charlotte Long, a media analyst at investment bank Citi. "If costs continue to rise and the ad market weakens further, it could start to impact profits. We have downgraded our full-year forecasts to reflect these risks."

Yorkshire-Tyne Tees operates two free-to-air television channels and a portfolio of subscription video-on-demand services. The company continues to face challenges from streaming platforms and other digital media. However, with a strong balance sheet and content pipeline, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees remains well positioned in an evolving media landscape. The board maintained its interim dividend at 3.6p per share.
