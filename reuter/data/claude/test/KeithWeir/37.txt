Pearson Plc's new CEO promises evolution not revolution to improve financial performance 

Pearson Plc announced the appointment of Andy Bird as the company's new CEO, succeeding John Fallon who is stepping down after eight years in the role. Bird joins Pearson from Walt Disney Company, where he most recently served as chairman of Walt Disney International.

In a statement, Bird said "Pearson is an iconic company with a strong set of assets, products and services which are valued by millions of learners worldwide. I look forward to evolving the strategy to ensure Pearson delivers more consistently against its clear and important mission." Bird indicated he does not foresee making radical changes to Pearson's strategy, focusing instead on incremental improvements to strengthen the company's fundamentals. 

Pearson has struggled in recent years with a declining higher education courseware business in the US, which has historically been its largest market. Revenues and profits have been under pressure, with the company issuing multiple profit warnings. The company's share price has declined nearly 70% over the past five years. Bird acknowledged the challenges, saying "There is no quick or easy fix, but with focus, discipline and innovation we can improve performance over time.‚Äù

Pearson Chairman Sidney Taurel said "Andy is a proven business leader with decades of experience in global education, digital transformation and building lifetime relationships with customers." Taurel noted that the board conducted a thorough search process, but Bird emerged as the outstanding candidate based on his strong track record of growth in international education businesses.

Bird's appointment is effective January 1, 2021. He will be based at Pearson's global headquarters in London, England. Bird joined Disney in 1993 and has served in various leadership roles across Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. He holds an undergraduate degree from Middlesex University and an MBA from the University of Bath.

The appointment of a new CEO with Bird's experience signals the board's desire to ensure steady progress at Pearson in strengthening its core business lines, accelerating its digital shift, and restoring growth. Investors seem optimistic, with Pearson's shares rising 4% on the announcement. Bird's message of evolution and incremental change aims to reassure those investors, although all eyes will be watching closely to see what additional steps Bird will take to fulfill Pearson's turnaround ambitions.
