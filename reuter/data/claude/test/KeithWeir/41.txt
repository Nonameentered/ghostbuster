Newcastle United Rewards Season Ticket Holders with Exclusive Share Purchase Options  

Newcastle United Football Club announced today that it will be offering exclusive share purchase options to long-term season ticket holders as a reward for their loyalty and support. The share offering will be available only to fans who have held season tickets for the past 10 consecutive seasons or more.

Club Chairman Lee Charnley said “Newcastle United has the best fans in the world. Their passion and dedication to the club, through good times and bad, deserves to be recognized and rewarded. By offering them the first opportunity to become shareholders in the club, we are giving them a stake in the future of Newcastle United and a chance to share in future successes.”

The share offering will allow qualifying season ticket holders to purchase up to 2,000 ordinary shares in Newcastle United at a fixed price of £10 per share, representing a discount to the current market price. The club has reserved 500,000 shares, currently worth £5 million, for the exclusive offer to long-term fans. Shares purchased through the offer will provide standard shareholder rights, including the right to attend the club’s Annual General Meeting and receive regular updates from the club.  

Newcastle United Supporters Trust chairman Greg Stone said "This is a bold and innovative move by the club. Fans have long wanted the opportunity to invest in and have a say in the direction of Newcastle United. For the club to recognize and reward the commitment of long-standing supporters in this way will be greatly appreciated."  

The offer launches on June 1 and will remain open for four weeks, closing on June 29. Qualifying season ticket holders will receive details on how to participate through email and post. The club acknowledged that demand may exceed the shares available through the offer, but wanted to make an opportunity available for as many long-term fans as possible to become part of the club's ownership and secure the benefits of the discount offer price.

Continued success and participation in offers like this in the future can deepen the sense of ownership and connection that the most loyal supporters feel towards Newcastle United Football Club. The partnership between a club and its fans is the foundation of success, both on and off the pitch. Today’s announcement signifies another step towards strengthening that partnership for the benefit of both the club and its most dedicated fans.
