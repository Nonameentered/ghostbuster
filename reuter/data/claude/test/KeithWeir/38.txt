Conservative Party no longer able to rely on loyal support of Britain's press, say editors and analysts

The Conservative Party in the UK has long been able to count on the steady support of much of Britain's print media. Titles like The Daily Telegraph, The Times, and the Daily Mail have traditionally backed the Tories at election time and provided generally favourable coverage. However, there are signs this cosy relationship may be coming under strain, according to editors, media analysts, and polling data.

"There is clearly more willingness now among some papers to be critical of the Conservatives or switch their support between parties based on policies and performance," said Jane Moore, columnist and associate editor at The Sun. The Sun, Britain's highest circulation daily newspaper, backed the Tories in the last three elections but Moore said its "support could never again be taken for granted."

The erosion of loyal support in the press reflects trends affecting newspapers and politics more widely. Declining print circulations have made newspapers more dependent on online traffic and less willing to back a single party. At the same time, increasing polarisation in UK politics and the rise of alternative media have given readers more choice. "Newspapers have to work harder to attract and retain readers. Backing a single party is too simplistic and risks alienating many potential readers," said Tom Watson, media analyst at Flintlock Advisory.

There are already signs of weaker support and more critical coverage of the Conservatives. A 2019 YouGov survey found only 38% of Telegraph readers now intend to vote Tory, down from 51% in 2017. "We aim to call out policies and politicians that we believe are not acting in the interests of our readers and the country, regardless of party," said Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph. The Mail on Sunday refused to back either Tories or Labour in the 2019 election. The Times has criticised the government's handling of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

However, the Conservative still retain substantial support, especially in the partisan press. The Daily Express and The Sun continue to back the Tories and provide largely positive coverage. The Tory-backing press also continues to reach huge audiences, especially online. But, according to polling expert John Curtice, these "cheerleaders" are preaching more to the converted and are unlikely to sway undecided voters. 

The splintering of media support presents both threats and opportunities for the Conservative Party. On one hand, it lacks a block of unwavering loyal support and faces more open criticism of its record and policies. But greater plurality could allow the party to reach beyond its base and build coalitions with groups who may be receptive to Conservative ideas but distrustful of partisan media brands. How the next Conservative leader engages with both supportive and sceptical media will be crucial in navigating this new, more complex media landscape.
