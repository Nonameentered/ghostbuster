PolyGram Sees Almost 18 Percent Drop in Earnings Due to Slowdown in Record Sales

PolyGram, the Dutch music company and one of the largest record labels in the world, announced a 17.8% drop in first-quarter earnings today due to declining sales of recorded music. Revenue from recorded music fell 11% compared to the same period last year. Overall, revenue was down 8% to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018.  

The slowing music sales reflect the ongoing transition to digital music distribution and streaming. While PolyGram saw streaming revenue increase by 34%, physical sales of CDs and vinyl records fell sharply. Revenue from physical music declined 19% in the quarter. Digital downloads also continued their downward trend, dropping 15% from the previous year.

"It was a difficult start to the year with the impact from lower physical sales offsetting gains in streaming," said PolyGram CEO Robert Smith in a statement. "We're working to build our streaming business but the transition is happening more slowly than expected."

PolyGram, like other major labels, has been boosting its investment in streaming services in an effort to compensate for lost physical sales. The company acquired a minority stake in the music streaming service Spotify last year and also launched its own streaming product called PolyGram Unlimited. However, competition remains fierce, with Spotify, Apple, and Amazon dominating the music streaming market.

To counter its slowing revenue growth, PolyGram announced it is cutting 60 positions, or about 2% of its global workforce. The company also said it will be "limiting discretionary spending" in areas like marketing and travel. PolyGram is aiming to save over $50 million this year through cost-cutting measures.

Despite the disappointing results this quarter, PolyGram executives expressed optimism for the rest of the year. "We expect our streaming growth and cost savings initiatives to have a positive impact on our financial performance as the year progresses," said Smith. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for revenue and earnings to be flat to slightly up compared to 2018. Investors, however, remain wary of challenges ahead, as PolyGram's stock price dropped over 4% in trading following the earnings announcement.
