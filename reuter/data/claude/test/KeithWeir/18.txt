Channel 5 Aims for 5% UK Viewership by Year End, CEO Says 

Channel 5, the UK's fifth and newest terrestrial television network, has set a goal to reach 5% of the total UK viewership by the end of this year, according to CEO James Parker. The broadcaster currently has an average audience share of 4.2% across all its channels, putting it within striking distance of its target if it can gain more viewers over the next 6 months.

Channel 5 has struggled since its launch in 1997 to gain viewers and compete with the more established BBC, ITV and Channel 4 networks. However, a recent shift to air more original drama and entertainment shows, especially in prime time, has started to pay off with ratings bumps over the last year. The premiere of the network's first original thriller last month brought in nearly 4 million viewers, Channel 5's largest audience for a show in over a decade.

"We have momentum and we believe if we continue focusing on the type of high-quality, original and exciting content our viewers have come to expect, we can reach 5% of the UK public by the end of 2020," Parker said in an interview. He pointed to several new series set to debut later this year, including a period drama co-produced with Netflix and a reality show that will be available for viewers to stream on the network's on-demand service.

However, media analysts cautioned that the 5% goal may still be out of Channel 5's reach given the stiff competition it faces. "While Channel 5 has improved its content, the UK media landscape remains dominated by the BBC and ITV," said Brian Callaghan, an analyst with Media Partners. "Reaching a 5% prime time share would require attracting more than 2 million additional viewers per night, which may be unrealistic even with strong new shows and strategic partnerships." 

Channel 5's ratings gains also come amid an overall decline in traditional TV viewing in the UK as more people, especially younger audiences, shift to streaming services and on-demand options. Although Parker said streaming platforms are not currently a "direct threat," Channel 5 does plan to increase investment in its own on-demand and streaming services to keep up with changing viewing habits.

The network hopes a final ratings push over the next six months can help it meet its 5% goal and cement its status as a competitive player in the UK media market. But as streaming shakes up the industry, Channel 5 and other traditional broadcasters may have to fight even harder to capture viewers' limited attention.
