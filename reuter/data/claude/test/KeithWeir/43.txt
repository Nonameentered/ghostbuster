Mirror Group Plc Beats Rising Newsprint Costs to Post Profit Increase  

Mirror Group Plc, the U.K.-based media company that publishes tabloids including The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror, reported a 4% rise in pre-tax profits for the six months ending June 30. The company was able to boost profits despite a 25% increase in newsprint costs over the period by raising advertising rates and cutting costs in other areas.

The company said pre-tax profits rose to £108 million ($142 million) from £104 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue declined 2% to £678 million due to lower circulation of its print titles. However, digital revenue grew 12% and now represents 17% of the company's overall revenue.

"We have delivered a good financial performance in what remains a challenging market for print media," said Chief Executive Simon Fox. "While circulation and print advertising remain under pressure, we have been able to offset most of the impact through cover price increases, digital growth and tight cost control."

Newsprint costs rose sharply in the first half due to supply disruptions from recent mergers and acquisitions. However, Mirror Group was able to limit the impact by renegotiating long-term newsprint contracts with suppliers. The company also raised prices for its daily and Sunday newspapers by 10% and 20% respectively.

On the cost side, the company reduced headcount through voluntary employee buyouts and left some open positions unfilled. Mirror Group also cut distribution costs by optimizing delivery rounds and reduced spending on freelance journalists and photographers.

The revenue picture was mixed, with print advertising down 8% and circulation revenue declining 6%. However, digital revenue from the company's news websites and streaming TV service helped pick up some of the slack. Digital now makes up 30% of the company's advertising revenue.

Looking ahead, Mr. Fox said market conditions are likely to remain challenging but the company will continue to tightly manage costs. "We will continue to diversify our revenue streams while innovating with our digital products and streaming TV service. Our long-term contracts for newsprint also provide stability on the cost front over the next 12-18 months."

Investors welcomed the results, sending Mirror Group shares up 4.8% to £1.82 in morning trading on the London Stock Exchange. The company's shares have declined 32% over the past 12 months due to wider concerns about the health of U.K. newspaper industry.
