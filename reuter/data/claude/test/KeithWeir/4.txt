Express Newspapers Announces Major Reorganization Plan to Revive Ailing Newspapers and Cut 85 Jobs

Express Newspapers, one of the largest media groups in the country, today announced a major reorganization plan aimed at reviving falling revenues and circulation at its three flagship newspapers. As part of the restructuring, Express will cut 85 jobs across the organization, more than 10% of its total workforce.  

The company's three main newspapers—The Daily Express, Sunday Express, and Daily Star—have struggled in recent years with declining print advertising revenue and subscriptions as readers migrate to digital and social media platforms. Express Newspapers has not been immune to the broader challenges facing the print news industry.

Under the new plan announced today, the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers will merge into a seven-day operation with a single editor and editorial team. The Daily Star tabloid newspaper will move to a digital-first model, focusing on building its online audience and redeploying resources away from the print edition. 

"Our traditional business model needs to change if our newspapers are to survive and thrive in the 21st century," said Julie Elliott, CEO of Express Newspapers. "This reorganization will enable us to operate more efficiently while allowing us to invest in the areas that really matter to our readers—high-quality, trusted journalism and an enhanced digital experience."

The job cuts are targeted at eliminating duplication across the two Express titles and rebalancing the Daily Star's resources toward digital. Express said it aims to complete the restructuring by the end of September. The company is offering voluntary buyouts to employees but may resort to compulsory layoffs if the required number of job cuts cannot be achieved voluntarily. 

The announcement today signifies that Express Newspapers is taking radical action to turn around its ailing newspapers, even if it means painful job losses along the way. But media analysts question whether the moves go far enough given the scale of the challenges at hand. With print advertising in freefall, the company may have to cut deeper to stabilize its news operations for the long run. The coming months will reveal whether today's reorganization plan can stem the bleeding and help Express Newspapers thrive again.
