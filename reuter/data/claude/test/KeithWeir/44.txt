Mirror Group Plc Reports Small Profit Increase Despite Newsprint Cost Jump

Mirror Group Plc, one of the U.K.'s largest newspaper publishers, reported a modest increase in profits for the fiscal year ending March 2019 despite "substantially higher" costs for newsprint and other raw materials. 

The company, which owns tabloids The Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror as well as regional newspapers, said pretax profit rose 3% to £126 million ($159.5 million) for the 12 months through March. Revenue edged up 1% to £1.52 billion, helped by growth in digital advertising and events.

However, the profit increase came despite newsprint costs that were £25 million higher during the period. Newsprint is the primary raw material used to print newspapers. Prices have been rising due to strong demand and consolidation among suppliers.

To offset cost pressures, Mirror Group cut costs by £12 million through staff reductions, limiting temporary staffing and lower distribution expenses. The company's chief executive Bhavik Kumar warned that the current year remains "difficult and competitive" and didn't provide any specific guidance.  

The results highlight the challenges facing the U.K. newspaper publishing industry, which has seen profits squeezed in recent years by shrinking print advertising revenue and higher costs. Daily print sales of newspapers have been in steady decline amid a shift to reading news on smartphones and tablets.  

Mirror Group has been trying to diversify into events and also license its brands and content. The company's autoclassified website Autotrader remains its star performer, with revenue rising 9% to £355 million. Mirror Group is set to sell its tickets division, See Tickets, and is restructuring its classic car auctions unit.

Some analysts remain skeptical about the publishing company's long-term prospects given its heavy dependence on print revenue. Digital and events currently make up only about a quarter of total revenue. The shares remain down about 75% from their peak in 2005.

"Despite strong efforts to diversify, the Mirror still relies on its print titles and the overall picture for the U.K. newspaper sector remains pretty bleak," said Ian Whittaker, a media analyst at broker Liberum Capital.

The profit increase and modest revenue growth are encouraging given the tough conditions, but "significant work remains to transform and grow the business," said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an equity analyst at broker Shore Capital.
