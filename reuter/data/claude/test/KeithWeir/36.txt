United News & Media Plc reports 12% profit growth in successful first year after merger 

United News & Media Plc (UNM), the media conglomerate formed through the merger of United Newspapers and Media Group last year, reported strong financial results for its first full year of combined operations. UNM announced that profits grew by 12% to £427 million in the fiscal year ending June 2020, surpassing analysts’ expectations.  

The successful first year demonstrates the rationale behind the blockbuster merger, which created one of the largest media companies in the country with interests spanning print, digital, television, and radio. By consolidating resources and streamlining operations, the combined entity was able to accelerate digital transformation efforts while cutting substantial costs.

“We are very pleased with the progress we have made integrating the two businesses and capturing synergies more quickly than anticipated,” said UNM Chief Executive Amanda Hudson. “While print advertising and circulation continue their long-term industry decline, growth in our digital platforms, subscription video services, and media solutions for businesses significantly outpaced those headwinds.”

Revenues from UNM’s stable of over 50 newspapers declined 8% but better than historic rates. Digital advertising across UNM’s websites and mobile apps grew 29%, making up 23% of total advertising revenue. The company’s on-demand streaming services added over 2 million subscribers in the year and streaming hours were up 50%. UNM Studios, the television and film production arm, also reported upbeat results with three major franchises in production.

“The first year results give us great confidence in our strategy and the outlook for continued growth,” Ms. Hudson said. “We have only just begun to unlock the potential benefits of our unparalleled content, brands, and marketing solutions across mediums for consumers and commercial partners alike.”  

UNM shares rose over 4% in early trading as investors reacted positively to the strong results and optimistic tone from management. Analysts expect further margin improvement and revenue diversification to drive solid shareholder returns in the coming years as the company fully integrates and gears up for its next phase of expansion. Overall, it was an auspicious first year for the newly merged media powerhouse.
