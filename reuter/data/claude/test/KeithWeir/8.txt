Hilton's $10.5 Billion Bid for ITT Takes Priority over Ladbroke Takeover, Share Analysts Say

Hilton Hotels' unsolicited $10.5 billion takeover bid for ITT Corporation is likely to take priority over Hilton's proposed merger with Ladbroke Group, according to analysts. Hilton surprised the market last week with an all-cash offer for ITT, a massive conglomerate that owns the Sheraton hotel chain, as well as Hartford Insurance and Caesars World casinos. 

The $85-per-share bid for ITT represents a 35% premium over ITT's share price before the offer and is meant to disrupt ITT's own $9.5 billion deal to acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts. Hilton said its offer provides "superior value" to ITT shareholders compared to the Starwood deal. However, ITT's board rejected Hilton's initial bid within two days, saying it "substantially undervalues" the company.

Hilton's move complicates its own proposed $3.8 billion all-share merger with Ladbroke, the British leisure and gaming firm. That deal, announced last month, would make Hilton Ladbroke's largest shareholder with a 45% stake in the combined company. Hilton said its bid for ITT would not preclude the Ladbroke transaction from proceeding, but analysts are skeptical both deals can be achieved.

“Hilton likely only has the appetite and capacity to complete one major acquisition, not two,“ said Mark Thompson, a lodging analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “The ITT offer is clearly its top priority right now given the significant scale of that business. If Hilton is successful in acquiring ITT, we would expect the Ladbroke transaction to be scrapped.”

Hilton's share price fell 8% on news of its ITT bid as investors weighed the increased debt levels required to acquire ITT. However, analysts said an ITT deal could boost Hilton's global scale and lower costs through synergies across the combined brands like Hilton, DoubleTree, and Sheraton.

ITT and Ladbroke declined to comment on Hilton’s competing bids. Hilton said it “remains committed” to both transactions but analysts expect Hilton to focus its full attention on securing an ITT deal, even if that risks the Ladbroke merger falling by the wayside.
