United News & Media Reports Over 20% Rise in Profit Since Merger  

United News & Media, one of the world's largest media conglomerates, reported a 21% increase in net income for the third quarter of this year thanks to cost savings from last year's merger with Global Communications Corp.

United's revenue rose 9% to $32.4 billion, up from $29.7 billion for the same period last year. The healthy revenue growth was boosted by increased spending on political advertisements in the U.S. ahead of this year's midterm elections as well as higher subscription revenue from the company's streaming services. 

However, revenue from United's cable TV unit remained flat as more viewers cut the cord in favor of streaming services. In response, United has invested heavily in its own streaming platforms and content. The company now has over 150 million streaming subscribers worldwide across its various platforms.

"Our strong results this quarter demonstrate the financial and strategic benefits of our merger with Global as well as our pivot to streaming," said United CEO Michael Thompson in a statement. "While traditional media continues to face headwinds, our early and aggressive move into streaming has positioned us well for the future."

The blockbuster merger between United and Global last year joined two media giants into a single massive company with global reach. The deal allowed the combined companies to cut costs by consolidating operations and laying off workers, while also giving United more leverage to negotiate with cable companies and streaming platforms.
 
Regulatory approval of the merger was granted on the condition that United and Global sell off certain media properties to avoid anti-trust issues. Despite the required divestitures, United still has an enormous portfolio of media assets including broadcast and cable TV networks, film studios, newspapers, and digital properties in over 150 countries.

Investors reacted positively to United's latest earnings report with shares gaining over 4% in early trading. The solid results suggest United's strategy is working, although challenges remain in turning around its declining cable TV business. With its strong streaming services and cost synergies from the merger, however, United appears positioned to benefit as media consumption increasingly goes digital in the years ahead.
