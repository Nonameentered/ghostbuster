BSkyB Confirms Launch of 200-Channel Digital Satellite Service to Become Key Player in Digital Technology

British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) today announced the launch of Sky Digital, a 200-channel digital satellite service, in an effort to position itself as a leader in digital television technology in the UK. The new service will replace Sky Multichannels analog satellite service and provide customers with a wider range of channels and interactive features.

BSkyB Chief Executive Sam Jones said, "Sky Digital is the future of television. With 200 channels featuring the best mix of live sports, movies, entertainment, news, and children's programming, Sky Digital will transform the viewing experience for our subscribers. The interactive features and on-demand options provide a personalized experience unavailable with standard analog television."

The Sky Digital service will require customers to install a new digital satellite receiver and smart card to decode the encrypted signals. BSkyB is subsidizing the cost of the new equipment for current Sky Multichannels subscribers. Non-subscribers can purchase the Sky Digital package, including a receiver and viewing card, for £199 with a monthly subscription of £39. 

At the heart of the new service is the Sky Box Office feature that allows customers to order recent movie releases on demand through their remote control. The Sky Box Office library will have up to 70 movie selections each week, including top Hollywood hits. For sports fans, Sky Digital will provide interactive options like choosing which matches to watch and accessing real-time league and team statistics.

Marketing experts predict BSkyB will gain over 2 million subscribers for Sky Digital in the first year. The additional channels and interactive features provide added value for customers looking to upgrade to the latest in television technology and programming. However, some analysts warn that the high cost of the service may deter some potential customers, especially in the current economic climate. 

With the launch of Sky Digital, BSkyB aims to cement its status as the leading satellite broadcaster in the UK and a key player in bringing digital television technology to viewers. However, competitors like ONdigital and cable providers are also launching new digital services for subscribers. The coming year may prove pivotal as major broadcasters battle for position in an increasingly competitive digital landscape. Overall, Sky Digital illustrates the exciting future ahead for television viewers in an age of constant technological innovation.
