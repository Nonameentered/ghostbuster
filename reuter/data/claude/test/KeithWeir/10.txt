Granada Group Plc Optimistic About Sale of Over 20 British Motorway Service Areas 

Granada Group Plc announced today that it is close to finalizing a deal to sell more than 20 motorway service areas in the UK for over £500 million. The private equity firm Applegreen is the leading bidder in the process and a sale could be agreed within weeks, pending final negotiations and approval from regulators.

Granada Group currently owns and operates 38 motorway service areas across Britain under the popular Moto brand. The proposed deal with Applegreen would see just over half of these locations change hands, transferring more than 4,500 employees to the new owners. In a statement, Granada Group said the sale would allow them to focus on expanding its remaining Moto sites and investing in improvements to amenities and facilities. 

Applegreen, an Irish company, has grown rapidly across Europe in recent years through strategic acquisitions. The purchase of the Moto sites would significantly expand their footprint in the UK and make them a major player in Britain’s roadside services industry. Applegreen’s CEO said the Moto locations are a “fantastic portfolio of assets” and they aim to build on Moto’s reputation for quality, choice, and value. There are no plans for major changes or rebranding at this stage according to the company.

The sale needs to gain approval from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected to review the deal to ensure it does not negatively impact competition in the motorway services sector. industry experts anticipate the regulator will not oppose the takeover, given Applegreen’s existing small market share in Britain. The CMA blocked a previous attempt by Moto to acquire more sites from a rival operator, but that was deemed anti-competitive at the time. 

Granada Group’s shares rose over 4% on news of the potential deal. Investors welcomed the opportunity for the company to generate capital from the sale and refocus on expanding its remaining core business areas. Granada Group also owns the budget hotel chain Travelodge and various restaurant brands across the UK. The group has looked to streamline operations in recent years to improve profitability after facing challenging market conditions.

The sale of the Moto sites is the latest in a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in Britain’s roadside service industry. Several major deals have seen foreign companies investing heavily in UK motorway service operators. Applegreen’s proposed takeover continues the trend of consolidation in a market that provides essential amenities to millions of motorists in Britain each year.
