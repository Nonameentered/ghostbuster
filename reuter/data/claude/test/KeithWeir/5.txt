Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Agree to Reunite Worldwide Brand in Multi-million Dollar Deal  

In a surprise announcement today, Ladbroke Hotels and Hilton Worldwide have agreed to reunite under the Hilton brand worldwide, ending a decade-long split of the company. Under the multi-million dollar deal, the Ladbroke hotels located in Europe, Africa and Asia will operate as Hilton Hotels again after operating separately since 2006.   

The CEOs of both companies called the reunification a "win-win" that will accelerate growth and allow a consistent brand experience for guests across the globe. "Hilton and Ladbroke were always stronger together," said Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta. "By bringing the companies back together again, we can leverage our combined expertise and strengths to provide an exceptional experience for the millions of guests who stay with us each year."

Ladbroke Hotels traces its origins to Ladbroke Hall in England, opened in 1951. The brand grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s throughout Britain and then internationally. It was acquired by Hilton in 1987 but was spun off again as a separate company in 2006 to allow for more regional flexibility and control. However, in recent years the separate brands led to confusion among some guests and less operational efficiency.  

The new agreement will see a phased transition of over 355 Ladbroke hotels and resorts to the Hilton brand over the next 18 to 24 months. The hotels will adopt Hilton standards and its loyalty program, while retaining unique architectural and design features of many historic Ladbroke properties. Hilton will also take over management of the hotels with its experienced operational teams.   

"While Ladbroke has thrived independently, the opportunity to reunify with our historic partner Hilton and leverage their world-class commercial engines was very compelling," said Ladbroke CEO Simon Vincent. "Our valued guests and loyal employees will benefit from Hilton's renowned service and amenities, while still enjoying the unique character and experiences Ladbroke is known for."   

The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the hotel industry following a sharp downturn in leisure and business travel due to the global pandemic. While terms of the agreement were not disclosed, industry analysts said the Hilton-Ladbroke deal values the 355-hotel chain at between $3 to $4 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approvals. For now, Ladbroke and Hilton will continue to operate as separate hotel companies before beginning the integration process in 2022.
