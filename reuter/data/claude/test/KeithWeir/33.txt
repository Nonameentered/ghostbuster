Mirror Group Plc Reports Record Profit and Reinvests Savings in Titles rather than Cutting Cover Prices

Mirror Group Plc announced record profits for the 2018 financial year, driven by significant cost savings across the print and advertising divisions. Profit before tax rose 43% to £247 million. However, rather than passing on savings to consumers through cover price reductions, the media conglomerate stated it will reinvest profits to strengthen its portfolio of newspaper and magazine titles. 

Cost cutting has been a priority in recent years as the company navigates the structural challenges facing the publishing industry. The company reduced headcount by over  1200 employees, closed two printing facilities, and merged several back office functions. These actions generated annual cost savings of £73 million, well above the target of £50 million set at the beginning of the financial year.

Advertising revenue also showed signs of stabilizing, declining only 3% compared to a drop of 12% the prior year. Gains in digital advertising helped offset continued losses in print. The company now generates 43% of advertising revenue from online and mobile channels. 

With profitability improving and costs under control, the company stated its priority is to reinvest in its brands rather than cutting cover prices. The company will increase funding for investigative journalism teams, improve the quality of paper stock, and launch marketing campaigns to attract new readers. The iconic Sunday Mirror and The Observer newspapers will receive the largest share of new funding.

The 2019 outlook is for modest revenue growth, stable profitability, and reinvestment in line with the 2018 strategy. Cover prices will remain unchanged as the company believes its titles continue to represent strong value for consumers. Ongoing cost cutting is not a priority at this point given significant savings achieved over the past three years.

The company appears to have turned a corner by aggressively reducing costs which has stabilized its profitability, however the strategy of not cutting cover prices is risky if it does not also reignite revenue and readership growth. The publishing industry continues to face significant disruption, and standing still is not an option. The investments outlined are a step in the right direction but bolder moves may be required to ensure the sustainability and longevity of the Mirror Group. Overall though, shareholders were rewarded with a record dividend payout, signalling the company's new found confidence.
