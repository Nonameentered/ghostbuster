Michael Grade Steps Down from Channel 4 to Head First Leisure Plc 

Michael Grade, the executive chairman of Channel 4, announced today that he is stepping down from his role to become the new chief executive of First Leisure Plc, one of the UK's largest managers of health clubs, gyms, and leisure centers. 

Grade has led Channel 4 for the past five years, overseeing a period of significant change at the commercially-funded public service broadcaster. During his tenure, Channel 4 launched new channels like E4 and Film4 and invested heavily in original British content. Grade helped steer the channel to record revenues and audience figures in 2020 despite increased competition from streaming services.

However, Grade said the opportunity to lead First Leisure, a company with over 300 leisure clubs across Europe and annual revenues of over Â£1 billion, was too good to pass up at this stage in his career. In a statement, Grade said: "Channel 4 will always have a special place in my heart. But after five wonderful years, the time feels right for me to embark on this exciting new challenge."

Jonathan Allen, Channel 4's chief operating officer, will take over as interim chief executive while the board conducts a search for Grade's permanent successor. There is speculation that Channel 4 may look outside the traditional broadcasting sphere for Grade's replacement, given the channel's aim to appeal to younger audiences who consume content on digital platforms. 

First Leisure's board believes that Grade's experience transforming Channel 4 and previous leadership roles at the BBC and ITV make him an ideal candidate to lead the health and fitness company during a period of significant change. The leisure industry faces threats from budget health clubs and home exercise options. Grade will be tasked with optimizing First Leisure's property portfolio, investing in state-of-the-art facilities and leveraging digital tools to attract and retain members.

In a upbeat farewell email to Channel 4 staff, Grade said he was confident that Channel 4 would continue to thrive under new leadership. "Though this chapter is coming to an end, the Channel 4 story goes on," Grade wrote. His last day as executive chairman will be at the end of the month.
