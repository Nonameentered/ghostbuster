Millwall's financial crisis serves as a warning for investors eyeing soccer club stocks, analysts caution  

The financial troubles of English second-tier soccer club Millwall F.C. should serve as a warning to investors eager to buy shares in European football teams after a flurry of recent stock market listings, according to analysts.

Millwall announced this week that it has incurred significant losses over the past two seasons and secured a loan to stave off administration. The South London club reported a loss of 4.5 million pounds ($5.7 million) for the 2019-2020 season, bringing total losses over the past two years to nearly 8 million pounds.

The club blamed the losses on the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted soccer for three months last spring, slashed matchday revenue as fans could not attend games, and made commercial sponsorships more difficult to secure. Millwall took out a 5 million pound emergency loan from real estate firm Chestnut Hill Ventures to address "short-term cashflow issues."

While the pandemic has hit many clubs hard, analysts said Millwall was already on fragile financial footing and its situation shows the risks for investors seeking to profit from soccer team stock listings. Millwall is privately held, but several other English clubs including Manchester United and Arsenal have listed shares on stock exchanges. 

"Millwall's losses should flash a bright red warning sign for investors," said Kieran Maguire, a University of Liverpool accounting professor who specializes in soccer finance. "Across Europe, many clubs at all levels were struggling financially even before the pandemic due to excessive spending on player salaries and transfer fees."

The Championship, England's second tier where Millwall competes, is an "economic graveyard" for many of its 24 clubs due to the costs of competing and lack of lucrative media rights deals, Maguire said. Last season, the Championship reported total losses of more than $900 million, with more than half of clubs reporting individual losses of over $20 million.

Rory Gillis, an analyst with stockbroker FinnCap, said Millwall's fate shows that while top-tier clubs like Manchester United or Juventus may be attractive listed investments because of their global popularity and media rights revenues, lower-level clubs are risky propositions.  

"For every well-run Championship or League One club that gains promotion to the Premier League, there are many more that struggle with financial instability and uncertain futures," Gillis said. "Millwall's situation is a cautionary tale that should guide investors away from many secondary and tertiary soccer club stocks, as their viability depends too heavily on uncertain outcomes both on and off the pitch."

The warnings come as several other English clubs explore stock market listings to raise funds, with League One sides Oxford United and Portsmouth announcing plans for initial public offerings. Maguire said potential investors should approach any lower-league club listings with "extreme caution" given the precarious finances of many teams exposed by the pandemic. Millwall's troubles show, he said, that "recovery will take time, success is far from guaranteed, and losses could still mount."
