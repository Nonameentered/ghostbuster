Reed Elsevier Reports 11% Rise in 1996 Profit, Warns of Potential Currency Impact on Future Earnings

Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing and business information group, announced a 11% increase in pre-tax profit for 1996 today. The company reported pre-tax profit for the year of £864 million, up from £781 million in 1995. However, the company warned that currency fluctuations could impact future earnings. 

The company said revenue from its core publishing, scientific, and legal publishing divisions grew 7% over last year. Double-digit revenue growth was seen in Reed Elsevier's North American operations, particularly in its legal publishing businesses. Revenue from electronic products and services continued to perform strongly, representing 20% of total revenue.

Commenting on the results, Sir Crispin Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier, said: “We have delivered another year of good earnings growth through increased investment in electronic publishing, the expansion of our businesses in North America, and continued tight cost control."

However, the company cautioned that the economic conditions in its key markets remain uncertain for 1997 and that currency exchange rates could significantly impact reported earnings. Given Reed Elsevier’s large operations across Europe, the US, and the UK, the company’s earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the pound sterling, US dollar and continental European currencies. With most of its costs denominated in sterling and European currencies but much of its revenue generated in US dollars, a strong US dollar relative to other currencies could squeeze profit margins.

The company plans to increase its dividend for the 21st consecutive year. The proposed final dividend is 14.6p, raising the total dividend for the year to 20.9p, an increase of 11%. 

Reed Elsevier is a leading publisher and information provider, providing content and services to the science and technology, legal, education and business sectors. The shares rose 18 pence, or 2%, to 929 pence in early trading on the London Stock Exchange following the announcement. Analysts remained broadly positive on Reed Elsevier following the results, citing its strong positions in resilient publishing markets and growing electronic and events businesses. However, some analysts echoed the company’s caution around the potential currency headwinds in the coming year.
