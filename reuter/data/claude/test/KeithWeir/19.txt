Rank Group Plans to Open 36 New Hard Rock Cafes Internationally Over Next Three Years

Rank Group, the London-based gambling and entertainment company that owns the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant franchise, announced plans today to open 36 new Hard Rock Cafes around the world over the next three years. The aggressive expansion plan aims to take advantage of growth opportunities in emerging markets, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. 

The Hard Rock Cafe brand is an iconic blend of American food and music memorabilia, with rock music playing and music-themed decor. Hard Rock International, a subsidiary of Rank Group, currently operates 181 venues in 74 countries, including cafes, hotels, and casinos. According to Jon Lucas, Chief Executive Officer of Rank Group, “Hard Rock is an established brand that continues to resonate with customers, especially younger generations, in markets around the world. We see opportunities to continue expanding the brand through strategic franchising partnerships and direct operations of new cafes, hotels, and entertainment venues, especially on an international scale.”

The largest expansion will be in China, where Rank Group aims to open 10 new Hard Rock Cafes over the next 36 months. China’s growing middle class, increasing disposable income, and appetite for Western brands points to success for the Hard Rock expansion in China. The company will also target major cities in India, the Middle East, Brazil, and other emerging markets for new cafe locations. In addition to the 36 new cafes, Hard Rock International will also open at least two new Hard Rock Hotels over the time period.

While Rank Group is bullish on the Hard Rock brand’s potential for global growth, some analysts warn of risks associated with over-rapid expansion, especially in developing economies. “There are challenges around recruiting and training skilled staff, securing reliable supply chains, and adapting the brand's western roots to local cultural sensitivities in emerging markets. If not well-managed, the Hard Rock’s breakneck pace of new location openings could potentially dilute the brand and disappoint customers,” said John Paluszek, a leisure and entertainment analyst with OC&C Strategy Consultants. However, Rank Group is confident in the infrastructure and partnerships they have built over decades of international experience to support expansion. 

Continued success and brand popularity suggest that the iconic Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain founded nearly 50 years ago in London has enduring appeal. With its theme of memorable music and American food in a high-energy environment, the Hard Rock brand has proven adept at adapting to cultures around the globe while staying true to its roots. By opening 36 new locations over the next three years, especially in the world’s fastest-growing markets, Rank Group is betting big on the universal language of rock and roll.
