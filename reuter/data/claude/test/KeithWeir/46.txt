Newcastle United Plc shares score premium in London Stock Exchange debut

Shares of Newcastle United Plc, the professional football club, rose as much as 8% on their first day of trading on London Stock Exchange today. The shares opened at 310 pence, higher than the initial public offering price of 300 pence per share.

The IPO raised 300 million pounds ($390 million) for the Premier League club, making it one of the largest sports-team listings in the U.K. The offering was more than 10 times oversubscribed, indicating strong investor appetite for the football brand. 

Newcastle United is the first top-tier English football club to go public in over 20 years. The club and its owners, businessman Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group Plc, sold about 25% of the team in the IPO. The deal gives Newcastle United an initial market value of about 340 million pounds.

“We are delighted that our offer was so strongly supported by investors...This will provide additional funding to strengthen Newcastle United Football Club and sets the financial platform for future success both on and off the pitch,” said Lee Charnley, managing director at Newcastle United.

The funds raised will be used to sign new star players, upgrade infrastructure and expand commercial operations. The club wants to catch up with rival clubs like Manchester United, which has a market capitalization 10 times that of Newcastle. Newcastle fans, who call themselves the Magpies, have not seen the team win any major trophies since 1955.

Newcastle United has a strong following as a historic football club in North East England. It has been a member of the Premier League, the top tier of English football, since the league's inception in 1992. The club's St. James' Park stadium has a capacity of 52,354, the seventh largest in the Premier League.

The club's majority owner, Frasers Group, is retaining about 66% ownership of Newcastle United following the IPO. Sports teams have become an attractive investment in the stock market, with owners drawn to their passionate fan bases and opportunity to expand into global brands.

Shares of several European football clubs, including Borussia Dortmund and AFC Ajax, have generated strong returns over the past year. By listing its shares in London, Newcastle United is hoping it can emulate that success and score with investors in the public markets.
