EMAP Plc Shares Tumble after Losing Managing Director to United News & Media 

Shares in EMAP Plc, the UK media company, fell over 12% today after the company announced that its Managing Director, Simon Horne, is leaving to take up the role of Chief Executive at rival United News & Media. The surprise departure of Horne, who has led EMAP's magazine and digital operations for the past 4 years, has rattled investor confidence.

EMAP is one of Britain's largest business-to-business, consumer magazine, and events companies, owning over 50 publications including Heat, Grazia, and Metal Hammer. Under Simon Horne's leadership, EMAP has driven a successful digital transformation, with over half of all revenues now coming from digital sources. However, competition in the media sector is intense, and EMAP's share price has struggled over the past year.  

Horne will take over as CEO of United News & Media in January. The rival company publishes The Independent and i newspapers, along with a portfolio of business titles. United has ambitions to grow through acquisitions and digital expansion, hoping to turn around a decline in print revenues. In a statement, United's chairman Lord Stevens said "Simon Horne is a highly experienced leader who will bring the strategic vision and operational expertise to accelerate United's transformation into a multi-platform media company."

Investors are clearly concerned at the loss of Horne from EMAP, worried that the company may lose momentum under new leadership. EMAP's board has begun the search for Horne's replacement but indicated that there may be no appointment for several months. Iain Mackie, analyst at Shore Capital, said "While EMAP has a strong management team in place, Simon Horne has been the driving force behind the successful pivot into digital. His departure opens up uncertainty around the next phase of EMAP's development and will impact the investment case, at least in the short term."

The next few months will be crucial for EMAP as the company seeks to minimize disruption from Horne's exit and maintain the confidence of shareholders and partners. But for now, with its Managing Director lured away to rivals, EMAP faces an unwanted challenge which is taking its toll on the share price.
