BSkyB, Carlton Communications and Granada Team Up for Digital Terrestrial TV Services  

British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) today announced a partnership with Carlton Communications and Granada Group to bid for licenses to operate digital terrestrial television (DTT) multiplexes in the UK. The consortium will apply to operate three of the six DTT multiplexes which will provide capacity for up to 30 digital TV channels.

The consortium brings together BSkyB's expertise in developing and marketing pay TV services, Carlton's content creation capabilities and Granada's strengths in networking and channel packaging. According to BSkyB CEO Sam Chisholm, "By working together, we will be able to provide viewers with an unparalleled choice of high quality free and pay TV channels through an easy to use, affordable, digital platform."

If successful with its bid, the consortium aims to launch DTT pay TV services in addition to free channels. The subscription services are likely to be based around BSkyB's Sky branded movie, sports and general entertainment channels. Carlton and Granada will also provide a range of free to air channels from their existing portfolios for the platform.  

The partnership represents an opportunity for BSkyB to extend its reach beyond satellite TV where it currently has over 7 million subscribers. Digital terrestrial TV has the potential to match or even surpass this number as it will eventually reach almost every home in the UK. For Carlton and Granada, digital terrestrial TV provides a chance to gain greater control over the delivery of their free to air channels which are currently carried on the analogue terrestrial platform operated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority.

The consortium will face competition from other groups bidding for the DTT multiplex licenses, including bids involving major retailers like Dixons and Kingfisher.However, with its strong brands and content, the BSkyB/Carlton/Granada consortium appears to be in a very competitive position. Rival bidders and industry analysts have already acknowledged this group as the frontrunner in the bidding process. According to analysts at investment bank DKW, "This alliance combines all the elements needed to establish a formidable presence in digital terrestrial television. We would be very surprised if they are not awarded at least two of the multiplex licenses, if not more."  

The outcome of the bid process will be announced by the Independent Television Commission in late September this year. The successful bidders will then have about 18 months to roll out digital terrestrial transmission equipment across the UK before launching services in late 1998 or early 1999. For the UK's television viewers, the launch of digital terrestrial TV in less than two years' time promises access to a whole new world of TV channel choice.
