Reed Elsevier reports 11% rise in 1996 profit, warns of potential currency impact on earnings

Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier today reported an 11% rise in 1996 pre-tax profit, driven by strong growth in its science and medical publishing units. However, the company warned that earnings growth could be impacted in 1997 by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Pre-tax profit for the year ended December 31 rose to £608 million from £549 million in 1995. Revenue increased 9% to £4.05 billion.

The results were boosted by Reed Elsevier’s science and medical publishing businesses, which saw revenue grow 14% and 13% respectively. The company attributed this to strong demand for academic research publications and new digital products. Revenue from electronic publishing, software and CD-ROMs grew over 30% and now accounts for 16% of total revenue.

“Our science, medical and education publishing units performed exceptionally well in 1996, demonstrating their resilience and benefitting from the move to digital delivery of content,” said Jan Hommen, Reed Elsevier’s chief executive.

Reed Elsevier’s largest division, LexisNexis, which provides online legal and business information, reported revenue growth of 8% for the year. The company said it is expanding LexisNexis into new geographic markets, with launches planned in Asia and Latin America.

However, Reed Elsevier warned that growth in sterling terms for the overall group in 1997 is likely to be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates, particularly a stronger pound relative to the U.S. dollar and Dutch guilder. Approximately 50% of Reed Elsevier’s revenue and 65% of its profit is derived outside the UK.

“We continue to face risks from fluctuating exchange rates, especially the variability of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies,” Hommen said.

Reed Elsevier is proposing a final dividend of 15p, making a total dividend for the year of 22p, an increase of 10% over 1995.

The company said its outlook for continued revenue and profit growth in its underlying businesses remains positive for 1997 and beyond, driven by demand for STM and education publishing, geographic expansion and growth in electronic products and services. However, currency volatility could impact the company's ability to meet its goal of double-digit revenue and profit growth in local currency terms.
