Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings Predicts Any Bid Will Have To Be At A Hefty Premium To Its Current Share Price  

Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings rose sharply today after the company predicted that any takeover bid for the regional broadcaster would have to be at a significant premium to the current share price.

In a trading update, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees said that trading in the first half of its financial year had been strong. Revenue is up 6% and pre-tax profits are forecast to rise 8% compared to the same period last year. The healthy performance comes despite the wider challenges facing the television advertising market. 

The update prompted speculation that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees could be a takeover target, with its mix of valuable local television and digital assets appealing to larger media groups. However, the company warned investors that any bid would have to properly reflect its intrinsic value and future prospects.

“The board would evaluate any credible offer for the company on its merits, but it would have to represent fair value for shareholders,” said Max Richardson, Chief Executive of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. “With our audience ratings, trusted local news coverage and leading advertising services, we believe we are very well positioned to continue our successful strategy as an independent company.”

Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees rose 8% to 560p in morning trading, giving the company a market capitalization of £1.2 billion. Analysts said an offer of between 650p to 700p per share, representing a premium of at least 17-25% on the current share price, would be required to persuade the board of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees to open takeover talks.

 ITV and Channel 4 have previously been linked with a potential move for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which owns the rights to show programming from both broadcasters in its transmission area. However, following the recent completion of ITV’s acquisition of local rival UTV, analysts think ITV has limited appetite for further expansion. Channel 4 is also focusing on internal investment in digital platforms and may struggle to raise the funding required for a bid.

Unless a trade buyer emerges, private equity firms circling the media sector could view Yorkshire-Tyne Tees as an attractive target. But, as the company has flagged, they will need deep pockets to gain ownership of this premium regional media brand.
