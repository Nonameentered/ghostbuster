Pearson Plc CEO Marjorie Scardino Sells Stake in Hong Kong Broadcaster TVB for $180.1 Million

Marjorie Scardino, the CEO of British publishing and education company Pearson Plc, sold her entire stake in Hong Kong broadcaster Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) for $180.1 million. According to a regulatory filing, Scardino sold 4.25 million shares in TVB at HK$50.50 each.

Pearson first acquired a stake in TVB in 1996 and gradually increased its ownership to around 25% by 2000. However, Pearson has been divesting several of its media assets in recent years to focus on its core education business. The sale of the TVB stake is aligned with this strategy to streamline Pearson's portfolio. 

TVB is Hong Kong's dominant free-to-air television broadcaster, airing popular drama series, variety shows, and news programs. It generates revenue through advertising and content distribution to subscribers. The company has faced challenges in recent years due to declining advertising spending and increasing competition from streaming services. However, TVB remains an influential media company in Hong Kong with a 70% viewership share.

The sale provides Pearson with non-core asset divestment proceeds that it can redeploy into acquisitions or investments in its key growth areas of virtual schools, workforce skills, and business education. Pearson has made several acquisitions in the past year, including buying online degree provider Smart Sparrow and workforce training company Faethm. The company is aiming to pivot to digital and subscription-based education services as its print publishing business continues to decline.

Scardino has served as CEO of Pearson since 1997 and will be stepping down from her role at the end of 2020 following a transition to successor Andy Bird. Under Scardino's leadership, Pearson grew into a major education and Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher. However, Pearson has faced significant headwinds in recent years due to a weak higher education market, loss of key contracts, and the impact of COVID-19. The company's share price has declined over 60% from its 2015 peak.

The sale of the TVB stake provides a timely boost to Pearson's balance sheet during a challenging period. With the divestment of non-core media assets complete, Pearson hopes to enter its new phase of transition under new leadership with a sharpened focus on technology-enabled education and training services. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Pearson can reclaim its status as a digital education powerhouse. Overall, the sale signifies the end of an era for Pearson's historical involvement in Hong Kong media spanning over two decades.
