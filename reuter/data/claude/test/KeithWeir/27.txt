BSkyB warns UK falling behind in move to digital era 

BSkyB, the UK's largest pay-TV broadcaster, has warned that Britain risks falling behind other nations in the shift to digital services. In its half-year results, BSkyB reported strong growth in subscriptions to its streaming and on-demand TV service Now TV as well as its broadband and mobile offerings. However, BSkyB CEO Jeremy Darroch said the UK's broadband and mobile networks need further investment to keep up with consumer demand for digital services.

"The UK's digital infrastructure still lags behind other leading nations and further investment is required if we are to keep pace with customer needs and global competitors," Darroch said. BSkyB has invested heavily in its own facilities but still relies on external broadband and mobile networks to deliver its TV, broadband and mobile services to customers. 

The government has pledged to roll out high-speed fibre broadband to every home in the UK by 2025 and expand 5G mobile coverage. But critics argue they are not moving fast enough. BSkyB's results highlight the growing importance of digital and on-demand entertainment services. It added 74,000 new subscribers to Now TV in the last quarter, taking the total to 2.7 million. By contrast, traditional satellite TV customer growth has stalled.

Revenue for the full year rose 3% to £13.6 billion, while earnings climbed 8% to £1.64 billion. The results were boosted by customers taking advantage of package deals bundling TV with broadband, mobile and streaming services. BSkyB shares rose over 4% in early trading as investors welcomed the growth in streaming and bundled subscriptions. BSkyB faces increasing competition from streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video but hopes demand for bundled deals and its market-leading live sports coverage will support continued growth.
