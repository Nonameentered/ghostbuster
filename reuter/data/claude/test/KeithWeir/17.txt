PolyGram Reports Lower 1996 Earnings but Expects Strong Sales Growth in Music Industry to Recover 

PolyGram N.V., one of the world's largest record companies, reported lower 1996 earnings today due to acquisition costs and restructuring charges, but forecast a strong recovery in music sales that is expected to drive double-digit profit growth this year.

PolyGram, based in London and owned by Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, said net income fell 39% last year to $167 million, or 85 cents an American depositary share, from $276 million, or $1.37 an ADS, in 1995. Revenue rose 7.2% to $5.63 billion.  

The decline in profits mainly reflected about $100 million in charges related to PolyGram's acquisition of A&M Records and Island Records in January 1996. The charges were for items like severance payments as PolyGram cut costs by combining operations. The company also spent heavily to launch new artists and said its movie business faced a tough comparison with 1995.

However, PolyGram said music sales turned up sharply in the second half of 1996, with the global recording industry on track to deliver its strongest performance since 1988. The company said it expects to post operating-profit growth of at least 10% in 1997 as it cuts costs from last year's acquisitions and benefits from stronger music and movie sales.

"We are very confident the industry upturn and our new artist releases in 1997 will fuel a good financial performance," said Jan Timmer, PolyGram's chairman and chief executive. "Cost controls and synergies from integrating our businesses are already improving margins."

PolyGram's music business has been at the forefront of an industrywide slump for the past several years. But record companies are now benefiting from stronger sales of compact discs as more consumers switch from cassettes. CDs offer superior sound quality and have become more affordable.

In the second half of 1996, PolyGram had several successful CD releases, including the triple-platinum album "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" by the Smashing Pumpkins. The record company is also counting on continuing growth of alternative rock and has signed such up-and-coming artists as Jewel, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Jamiroquai.

Shares of PolyGram rose 1 3/8 in Amsterdam trading to 168 3/4 cents, reflecting optimism about improved results this year. The stock has doubled since the beginning of 1996.

The earnings report caps a year of sweeping change at PolyGram as it sought to regain its dominant position in the global music business. With the addition of A&M and Island, PolyGram now ranks as the world's largest record company. Mr. Timmer said PolyGram has slashed its cost base and reorganized into four main labels -- Mercury, Island, A&M and DeutscheGrammophon -- to focus resources on a more select roster of artists.

Those moves are expected to bolster PolyGram's results well into next year. Mr. Timmer noted that music sales "have historically been very cyclical. But cost controls and the benefits of being a scale player should provide some insulation from the extremes of that cycle in the future."
