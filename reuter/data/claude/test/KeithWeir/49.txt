UK Government Threatens to Scupper London Clubs International's Bid for Capital Corp over Competition Concerns

The UK government has warned London Clubs International (LCI) that its proposed acquisition of Capital Corp, the struggling casino operator, could face significant regulatory hurdles over competition concerns. The £2.4 billion bid for Capital Corp, which owns 12 casino properties across the UK, would make LCI the dominant player in the UK casino market with a combined estate of over 40 casinos – more than half of the sector.  

In a strongly worded letter to LCI, Andrea Leadsom, the Business Secretary, said the deal could reduce choice for customers and discourage innovation if it went ahead in its current form. She said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was likely to launch a full investigation into the takeover on competition grounds which could lead to a prohibition of the deal or forced sales of some casino properties to address concerns.

Shares in Capital Corp fell by 5% in early trading as investors fretted over the increased uncertainty around the bid. LCI's share price was down 3%. Capital Corp cautioned that there was no guarantee a deal could now be done given the government’s stance. LCI said it remained committed to the takeover but would work with the CMA to find “appropriate remedies” to concerns. “We still believe this transaction can benefit our customers and support the overall growth of the UK casino sector,” a spokesperson for LCI said.  

The warning is a blow for LCI which had hoped to complete the takeover by early next year. LCI, which is owned by the private equity firm Apollo Management, believes the deal can deliver substantial cost savings and enable the enlarged group to better compete with online gambling firms. However, critics argue it will reduce choice for customers, many of whom visit casinos for their social and entertainment elements.  

Government sources said the CMA typically took between 6 and 18 months to conduct an in-depth "phase 2" investigation into mergers that could lead to a substantial lessening of competition. LCI would have to provide detailed information to support its case and may be required to sell off parts of the combined estate to gain approval. The CMA has an obligation to rigorously investigate any potential threat to competition to protect consumers and smaller suppliers. Both LCI and Capital Corp declined to comment further.
