Reed Elsevier Expects Earnings to be Depressed This Year Due to Currency Factors  

Reed Elsevier, the publisher and event organizer, warned that its earnings this year are likely to be negatively impacted by recent currency fluctuations. The Anglo-Dutch company generates over 60% of its revenue outside the UK and US, making it particularly exposed to swings in exchange rates.

In a trading update, the company said earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be “somewhat lower” than in 2018 due to the relative strength of the US dollar. Reed makes the majority of its revenue in dollars but incurs costs in a range of currencies including the Euro and British pound. The earnings warning came despite Reed reporting underlying revenue growth of 4% in the four months to end October.  

Chief Executive Duncan Palmer said: "We have made a good start to the year, with continued progress across the group. However, at current exchange rates, currency movements are expected to reduce our full year earnings and margin relative to 2018."

Reed’s shares fell 3.6% in morning trading following the downbeat guidance. Analysts had forecast earnings to rise by mid-single digits this year and the announcement dented optimism around the company’s turnaround under Mr. Palmer. 

The twin impacts of exchange rates and Brexit uncertainty are hanging over many UK-listed companies with global operations. Many multinationals based in the UK earn large parts of their revenue in dollars but face higher costs at home due to weak sterling. 

Sterling has fallen more than 15% since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, even with a small recovery in recent weeks. The pound’s volatility has posed problems for executives drawing up budgets and forecasts.

Mr. Palmer said Reed will take further action to mitigate currency effects, including managing costs tightly and increasing US dollar subscriptions and events pricing where possible. However, he cautioned that any action “will take time to have a material offsetting impact, and there remains substantial ongoing uncertainty.”

The trading update confirmed that Reed’s three main divisions—STM publishing, legal publishing and business events—all grew revenues in the last four months of 2018. The company will report full-year results and issue a further outlook on February 21. Despite the lackluster forecast, analysts said underlying trends showed Reed was in better health after several years of struggling growth.
