Granada Group to Close around 100 Rental and Retail Stores on High Streets Across Britain 

The Granada Group announced today that it will be closing nearly 100 of its rental and retail stores across Britain in a significant downsizing of its high street presence. The company cited pressures from online competition and changing customer behaviors as the reasons for closing the stores.

The closures will impact around 1,500 employees, though the company said it would try to redeploy staff within the remaining business where possible. The company currently operates over 500 stores across the UK, including many locations that contain both rental and retail operations. The company did not specify exactly which locations would be closing but said they would impact high streets in cities, towns, and suburban centers across all regions of the country.

“The retail environment has become increasingly challenging due to online competition and an overall transformation in how and where customers choose to shop,” said Granada Group CEO Malcolm Smith. “We have to make some difficult decisions to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of our business. Closing some of our underperforming stores will allow us to focus our investment and resources on locations with higher footfall and customer demand.” 

The news comes on the heels of several other high street mainstays announcing store closures and job cuts. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon paired with weak consumer confidence and tight household budgets have hit traditional brick-and-mortar retailers hard. However, some analysts argue that physical stores still have an important role, especially for categories like clothing, groceries, and large appliance rentals where customers benefit from seeing and experiencing products in person.

Granada Group's shares fell 4% on the news of the store closures. However, analysts said the move was necessary for the company's long term financial health as the cost savings would outweigh the short term drop in revenue from the closed locations. The company will announce a strategic plan for its remaining stores in the coming months which is expected to focus on enhancements to the in-store experience, expansion of customer loyalty programs, and the addition of convenience services like click-and-collect options for online purchases.
