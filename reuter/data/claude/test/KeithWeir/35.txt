United News & Media Reports 12% Profit Rise in First Year Post-Merger  

United News & Media, the media conglomerate formed last year through the merger of United News Corp and Global Media Group, today reported a 12% rise in annual pre-tax profits for its first full year of combined operations.

Profits rose to $1.42 billion on revenues of $19.3 billion, up from $21.2 billion and $1.27 billion respectively for the two separate companies in the previous year. The rise in profits and revenues beat analysts’ forecasts, driving United News & Media’s shares up over 5% in early trading.

“We are delighted with these results, which show the merger is delivering real value through the synergies and cost savings we identified,” said CEO Brian Thompson. “Our news, broadcasting and entertainment divisions have all benefited from being part of a larger, integrated group.”

The news division continues to face significant headwinds, with print advertising and circulation revenues falling by 8% over the year amid the ongoing shift from print to digital. However, profits rose by 5% thanks to $340 million of cost cuts from consolidating operations. The broadcasting arm grew revenues by 3% and profits by 9%, helped by increased spending on political advertising in an election year. Meanwhile, the entertainment division, which includes United News & Media’s film, TV and digital production studios, saw revenue and profit growth of over 15% thanks to the success of several big-budget films and streaming shows.  

“While parts of our business continue to face structural challenges, the overall strength and diversity of our operations put us in a great position for continued success,” said Thompson. “With the major restructuring from the merger now behind us, United News & Media is poised to accelerate into its next phase of growth as a unified, multi-platform media company.”

The positive results and outlook led several analysts to upgrade their recommendations on United News & Media’s stock. Shares closed up 7.1% at $124.52, a new record high for the company. With today’s gains, United News & Media’s stock price has risen over 50% since the merger 14 months ago.
