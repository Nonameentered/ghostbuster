EMAP Plc Shares Tumble as Managing Director Departs for United News & Media 

Shares in EMAP Plc, the British media company, fell more than 12% in early London trading today after the surprise announcement that its managing director, John Smith, is leaving the company to become chief executive of rival United News & Media Group.

Mr. Smith has led EMAP for the past 8 years and has been credited with driving the company's successful expansion into digital and events. Under his leadership, EMAP doubled its profits and tripled its share price. However, the company has struggled recently with declining print advertising revenue and increased competition for its digital and events divisions. 

In a statement, EMAP chairman John Thompson said, “We are disappointed that John has decided to leave EMAP at this time. He has made an immense contribution to the success and growth of the company over the past eight years. However, we understand his desire to take on a new challenge and wish him all the best in his role at United News & Media.”

For his part, Mr. Smith said “It has been a privilege to serve as managing director of EMAP and I am proud of what we have accomplished. However, the opportunity to lead United News & Media, with its strong portfolio of trusted media brands and potential for growth, is exciting. I thank John Thompson and the EMAP board for their support and partnership over the years.”

United News & Media has been searching for a new chief executive since the sudden resignation of its previous CEO six months ago following a profit warning and a 50% drop in share price. The company publishes The Herald and Evening Times newspapers in Scotland as well as several business-to-business trade publications in the oil and gas, engineering and technology sectors. Mr. Smith’s appointment and EMAP pedigree is seen as a coup for the struggling publisher.

EMAP now begins the search for a successor to Mr. Smith. Internally, chief operating officer Jane Andrews and chief digital officer Tom West are seen as leading candidates for the role. Externally, speculation has focused on candidates from German publisher Axel Springer and private equity-backed Future PLC. 

Whoever takes the reins at EMAP will face significant strategic challenges as print advertising spend continues to fall and competition in digital media intensifies. Mr. Smith’s departure and the uncertainty around his replacement have clearly unnerved EMAP investors today, evidenced by the sharp drop in the company’s share price. His will be a difficult act to follow.
