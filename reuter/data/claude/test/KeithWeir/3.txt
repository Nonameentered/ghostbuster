Pearson Plc shares rise as new female CEO takes control 

Shares of Pearson Plc, the British multinational publishing and education company, rose more than 5% today as the company announced the appointment of Sally Johnson as its new CEO. Johnson takes over from former CEO John Fallon, who stepped down in January after a challenging few years for the company.

Johnson, 55, joins Pearson from tech giant Google, where she has served as Vice President of Global Partnerships for the past eight years. Under her leadership, Google forged major alliances with companies across various industries. 

Investors appear optimistic that Johnson can bring a fresh perspective to Pearson. The company’s share price has declined more than 60% over the past five years as its traditional print publishing business has struggled and its digital transition has proceeded slowly. Sales of Pearson’s U.S. higher education course materials have fallen as students transition to renting and buying used books. Johnson acknowledged the difficulties but struck an upbeat tone.

“While there are real challenges to address, Pearson also has enviable assets, strong brands, and dedicated employees,” Johnson said in a statement. She highlighted opportunities to accelerate Pearson’s digital transition in higher education and expand its career-focused education programs.

Gerald Khoo, an analyst with Liberum Capital, said Johnson’s appointment was a sign that Pearson was serious about reinvigorating growth. “Sally Johnson has a proven track record of innovation and building strategic partnerships,” Khoo said in a note to clients. “Her experience in education technology and developing new revenue streams could prove invaluable to Pearson.”

Still, others remained skeptical given the entrenched challenges in some of Pearson’s major businesses. The higher education course materials market in the U.S. and Canada generates nearly 40% of Pearson’s sales but demand has steadily declined. whether or not Johnson  will be able to reverse these trends remains uncertain. If she can make progress expanding Pearson’s digital and career education programs while stabilizing its core operations, she will have a chance to make her mark and shift the momentum at this once-mighty company.
