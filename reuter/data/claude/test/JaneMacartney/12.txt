China's Oldest Special Economic Zones Outpace National Growth Despite Weak Foreign Investment

China's first special economic zones, established in the 1980s to attract foreign investment and stimulate export-oriented growth, have continued to thrive despite a recent slowdown in foreign direct investment nationwide. The coastal cities of Shenzhen and Xiamen, two of China's first SEZs, reported economic growth well above the national average last year. 

Shenzhen, a metropolis of over 12 million people just north of Hong Kong, saw its gross domestic product expand 7.5% in 2018, faster than China's official GDP growth rate of 6.6%. The Shenzhen SEZ has successfully transitioned from a manufacturing hub for foreign brands to a center of innovation, with domestically built technology companies like Tencent, DJI, and BYD emerging as major employers. With a cluster of tech startups and an expanding services sector, Shenzhen has managed to sustain rapid growth even as low-cost manufacturing has shifted to other parts of China and abroad.

The port city of Xiamen in southern Fujian province posted even stronger economic growth of 8.2% last year. Like Shenzhen, Xiamen has evolved from an export processing zone dependent on foreign investment into a more diversified, locally driven economy. The Xiamen SEZ has developed strengths in areas like biotech, software, and tourism while continuing to attract major investors like Dell, Microsoft, and Kodak. With a strategic location on the Taiwan Strait, Xiamen remains an important gateway for trade with Taiwan, though cross-strait commercial ties have weakened in recent years.

Nationwide, foreign direct investment in China fell for the first time since 2015, dropping 3% in 2018 according to the Ministry of Commerce. The decline was even steeper for investment in China's coastal SEZs, which saw FDI decrease by 30% last year. The slowdown reflects growing concerns among foreign companies about rising costs, trade frictions, and a perception that China's investment environment is becoming increasingly inhospitable. 

Despite the drop in FDI, most economists do not expect China's SEZs to falter in the coming years. "While foreign investment was key to Shenzhen and Xiamen's initial growth, these cities have developed strong, independent economies that are now largely self-perpetuating," said Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China. With their knowledge-intensive industries and well-educated populations, China's top SEZs seem poised to continue driving export growth and technology innovation for decades to come. But as foreign capital inflows wane, their future success may depend more and more on the vitality of China's own private sector and capital markets.
