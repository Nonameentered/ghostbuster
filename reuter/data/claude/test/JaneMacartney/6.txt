China Encourages Guatemala to Sever Ties with Taiwan for Chance at UN Peacekeepers 

Beijing has offered Guatemala an opportunity to contribute troops to UN peacekeeping missions if it switches diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, according to sources in both countries. Guatemala is one of only 15 nations left that still recognize Taiwan.

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveled to Guatemala City last week to meet with Guatemalan officials, including President Jimmy Morales. During the trip, Wang proposed that if Guatemala were to recognize the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal representative of China, switching ties from Taiwan, it would support Guatemala’s bid to contribute troops and police to UN peacekeeping operations for the first time.

Guatemala has sought to participate in UN peacekeeping missions for several years but has been rejected each time. China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has veto power over peacekeeping contributions. So far, China has opposed Guatemala’s bids, but is now signaling it would support them if diplomatic ties were switched.

For China, gaining another diplomatic ally at the expense of Taiwan has been a long-held goal as it seeks to isolate Taiwan on the global stage. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has been using its clout to poach Taiwan’s allies. Panama and El Salvador also recently switched ties from Taiwan to China. 

But for Guatemala, the decision is complex. It has recognized Taiwan since 1933 and Taipei has provided aid and investment in Guatemala over many decades. Taiwan operates technical and vocational training centers in Guatemala and provides scholarships for Guatemalans. 

However, China is also a major trading partner and China's diplomatic and economic influence in Latin America has surged in recent years. Recognizing China could spur more investment in Guatemala's infrastructure which Morales has made a priority, even though China's presence in the region worries the United States.

Guatemala now has an opportunity for its troops to gain valuable overseas experience in UN peacekeeping but must weigh whether sacrificing its long-time relationship with Taiwan is worth the chance to contribute on a global scale. For a small nation, contributing to peacekeeping is seen as a way to raise its stature abroad and bring additional funding and training for its military.

There was no official word on whether Guatemala would take China up on its offer. The Guatemalan government is likely to ponder the decision carefully given Taiwan’s commitment over 85 years and China’s growing regional sway. As China and Taiwan continue their diplomatic tug-of-war, more developing nations may face a similar dilemma between old friends and new opportunities.
