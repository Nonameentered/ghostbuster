China's Deng Xiaoping Documentary Draws in More Viewers Than Entire Populations of Russia and Germany Combined 

A new documentary series chronicling the life of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has become a surprise blockbuster in China, attracting more than 1.4 billion viewers since its release earlier this month. The eight-part series explores Deng’s role in opening up and reforming China’s economy, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. Viewership of over 1.4 billion means that more people have watched the series than the entire populations of Russia and Germany combined.

The series, titled “Deng Xiaoping and the Opening of China,” airs on CCTV and streaming sites in China. It details Deng’s rise to power in the Communist Party and his push for economic reforms starting in 1978 that led to the creation of a market economy, ending the Maoist era. Under Deng’s leadership, China shifted from a largely agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse, with GDP growing at an average rate of 10% per year.   

“The series helps people today better understand why China's reform and opening up started, and how it has profoundly changed the destiny of the Chinese people,” said CCTV in a statement. The broadcaster hailed the program as an “epic masterpiece documenting the great course of reform and opening up in China.”

The series has received widespread critical acclaim in China for its objective and honest portrayal of history. Even some initially skeptical of the state broadcaster lauding a Communist Party leader have praised its balanced perspective. “This is a history we should face squarely,” wrote one commenter on social media. 

However, the show avoids addressing the darker periods of Deng's leadership, including his role in violent crackdowns on student protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Critics argue the hagiographic series glosses over human rights violations and controversial episodes to portray Deng in an overly positive light as the savior of China's economy.  

Nonetheless, the program's record viewership reflects the immense popularity Deng still commands in China today. Decades after his rise to power, Deng is revered as a transformative figure who set China on its path to prosperity and global ascendancy. The airing of the new series on prime-time slots showed CCTV's view that a broad audience in China remains interested in reliving Deng's milestone leadership of the country through economic redevelopment and renewal.
