China Sets Up New Anti-Corruption Bureau to Tackle Extreme Cases Involving High-Ranking Officials 

The Chinese Communist Party announced this week the establishment of a new anti-corruption bureau with a broad mandate to investigate and prosecute extreme cases of corruption involving high-ranking government officials. The new National Supervision Commission will have investigative powers over everyone in the public sector, including civil servants, managers of state-owned companies, university staff, and doctors and teachers working in public hospitals and schools.

The establishment of the new anti-corruption body is the latest measure by Chinese president Xi Jinping to tackle endemic corruption throughout the government bureaucracy and state-owned enterprises. Over the past five years, Xi's anti-corruption campaign has disciplined more than 1.5 million officials, including many so-called "tigers and flies"â€”high- and low-ranking officials. The campaign has been popular among ordinary Chinese citizens frustrated with systemic corruption but has also led to concerns that Xi is using it to purge political rivals.

The new National Supervision Commission will operate at the national, provincial, municipal, and county levels, with a staff of thousands of investigators. It will have the authority to detain suspects for up to six months without judicial oversight and deny them access to a lawyer. The commission will work in parallel with the Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, but will have legal authority to prosecute criminal cases in a court of law. 

Some Chinese legal experts have warned that the broad powers of the new body threaten basic legal protections and constitutional rights. Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said "The National Supervision Commission is essentially a legal violation of the spirit of the rule of law. It sacrifices the basic rights of suspects to expand the authority of anti-corruption investigators." 

Supporters of the new commission argue that the severity of corruption in China necessitates an authoritative body with extensive powers. An editorial in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, said "Anti-corruption work in China still faces an arduous and long-term task... Only by concentrating power and authority can the independence and efficiency of discipline and supervision work be guaranteed."

The establishment of the National Supervision Commission is the latest signal that Xi has no plans to loosen his signature anti-corruption campaign and is determined to maintain strict discipline over government officials and state-owned companies. With its far-reaching powers and ability to prosecute high-level officials, the new commission is set to become a key institution in Xi's ongoing drive to cement control over the Communist Party bureaucracy.
