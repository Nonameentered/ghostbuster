Chinese leaders pay New Year visit to reclusive Deng Xiaoping  

BEIJING - China's top leaders paid a rare New Year's visit on Monday to former leader Deng Xiaoping to wish him well in the Year of the Rat. Deng, 92, who retired from his last official post in 1990 but still exerts influence behind the scenes, received President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other leaders at his Beijing home, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  

The visit highlighted Deng's lingering power and influence despite his advancing years and seclusion from public view. Although retired for over a decade, Deng is still revered as the architect of China's post-Mao Zedong reform era which introduced market-style reforms and ended the political chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.  

President Jiang and his colleagues visited Deng "to wish him good health and all the best in the New Year", Xinhua reported. "They thanked Comrade Deng Xiaoping for his outstanding and important contributions to the party and the people's cause," it said. The visit lasted about 30 minutes, it added, and Deng "cordially invited them to stay for luncheon and they had friendly talks."  

Deng was last seen in public at an exhibition in Beijing in October 1995. Although he has faded from public view, party and military leaders continue to pay allegiance to Deng and his reformist legacy. According to political sources, Deng still criticizes or praises top national leaders personally or through close allies. His opinions continue to weigh heavily on major policy decisions.  

"As long as Deng is alive, his influence will continue," said a senior Chinese political analyst."The leaders have an obligation to visit Deng during important festivals to show their respect." In private, Deng continues to comment occasionally on events in China and act as a mentor to younger leaders like Jiang, the sources said.  

The old leader's health remains fairly good for his age. Diplomats say he has become more physically frail in recent years but remains mentally alert. Deng's vision and quest for a stronger, wealthier China drove him to launch historic reforms after Mao's 1976 death ending the Cultural Revolution. His drive to modernize China ushered in three decades of fast-paced growth and rising prosperity. Despite some reservations, Deng condoned the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests to preserve Communist Party rule. Deng yields strong influence and remains respected in the party for his vision, political shrewdness and strength. His death would deprive leadership of his authority and guidance.
