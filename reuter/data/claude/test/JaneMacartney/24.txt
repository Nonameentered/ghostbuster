North Korea's Kim Jong-il Celebrates Birthday Amidst Diplomatic Stand-Off and Shooting in the South

Pyongyang, North Koreaâ€”North Korean leader Kim Jong-il celebrated his 69th birthday today amidst stalled nuclear disarmament talks and an exchange of fire between North and South Korean naval boats. 

Kim's birthday comes at a tense time in relations with South Korea and the wider international community. Six-party talks involving North and South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States have made little progress on efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea walked out of the talks in 2009 and, despite several attempts, negotiations have not restarted.

South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in 2008 with a hardline policy against North Korea's provocations and pursuit of nuclear arms. North Korea has reacted angrily to Lee's stance and relations have deteriorated. Yesterday, North and South Korean naval boats briefly exchanged fire off the west coast of the peninsula, escalating tensions further. The South Korean boat suffered minor damage but there were no casualties.

North Korea's state media reported that Kim Jong-il watched a performance yesterday by the State Merited Chorus to celebrate his birthday. In the capital city of Pyongyang, students and workers lined up to offer flowers and praise for their leader. Kim took over as leader of the secretive communist nation in 1994 after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, who founded North Korea in 1948. 

Despite North Korea's dire economic state and ongoing famine, Kim Jong-il lives an extravagant lifestyle and continues to pour money into the country's missile and nuclear programs. According to recent reports, Kim may have suffered a stroke in 2008 but appears to have recovered and remains in control of the regime. However, questions remain over succession as Kim's three sons are seen as unlikely and ill-equipped to take control when their father passes away or steps down.

North Korea's nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 drew international condemnation and United Nations sanctions. The regime is believed to have enough plutonium for at least six nuclear bombs and is attempting to build up its arsenal. Multilateral talks in Beijing have aimed at offering North Korea fuel oil and humanitarian aid in exchange for dismantling its nuclear capabilities, but Kim Jong-il demands further concessions and is unlikely to fully give up the nuclear card, which he sees as vital for regime survival.

With tensions high and communication minimal, there appears little prospect of a breakthrough or return to negotiations. Kim Jong-il's birthday celebrations come amid a diplomatic stand-off and uncertainty over North Korea's next moves. The exchange of fire with South Korea is a reminder of the precarious security situation on the peninsula. While Kim remains in power, little is expected to change.
