China accuses Human Rights Watch of defending convicted rapists and swindlers, adopts Cold War mentality  

Beijing lashed out at the prominent human rights group Human Rights Watch on Friday, accusing the organization of defending convicted criminals in China and adopting an outdated Cold War mentality.

The angry statement from China’s foreign ministry comes after Human Rights Watch published its World Report 2020 this week, which included criticism of China’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims, crackdown on civil society and activists, and increased censorship. The report called on China to release individuals imprisoned for peacefully exercising their fundamental rights.   

In response, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang accused Human Rights Watch of ignoring facts and irresponsibly defending “criminals” in China. “For crimes like murder, robbery, rape and fraud, our judicial organs handle them in strict accordance with Chinese law and on the merits of each case,” Geng said at a news briefing.  “No one has immunity from legal punishment for criminal acts.”

Geng claimed that some of the individuals defended in the Human Rights Watch report were convicted rapists and fraudsters, without specifying names or cases. He said their true stories had been “deliberately ignored” by the organization. The allegations echoed previous claims by Chinese officials seeking to discredit human rights groups and activists. 

“No country will allow harmful behavior that undermines social security and public order,” Geng said. He accused Human Rights Watch of disregarding facts and objectivity, and adopting a “Cold War mentality.” 

In its report, Human Rights Watch acknowledged China’s progress in areas like poverty alleviation and economic growth. But it warned about the country's shrinking space for civil society, detention of critics and minorities, and increasingly authoritarian turn under President Xi Jinping. 

Geng rejected such characterizations of China’s human rights situation, claiming they were based on “lies and prejudices.” He said China protects human rights and that its people enjoy freedom of speech and religious belief in accordance with the law.

Critics argue China’s laws and judicial system themselves undermine civil liberties and fair trial rights, allowing the government to imprison peaceful activists, journalists, lawyers and others who challenge Communist Party rule.

Human Rights Watch's Asia Director Brad Adams accused China of seeking to intimidate rights groups and civil society. “Instead of engaging in abusive attacks, the Chinese government should release the many wrongly imprisoned people in the country and do something to end its shocking human rights violations," he said in a statement.
