China's Communist Party Doubles Down on Censorship with Directive to Publishers 

The Chinese Communist Party issued a new set of censorship directives this week targeting publishers and ramping up control over the spread of ideas. The new rules ban Chinese publishers from translating or publishing foreign books that promote concepts like constitutional democracy, civil society, and judicial independence.

The policy was announced in a circular from the Communist Party's Central Propaganda Department, the General Administration of Press and Publication, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, and the Cyberspace Administration of China. According to the South China Morning Post, which obtained a copy of the circular, the aim is to "safeguard the security and stability" of Chinese society by further restricting access to liberal Western ideas.

The directive orders Chinese publishers to censor translated books and any references within their own books to "harmful ideologies." Specifically banned are mentions of democratic elections, the balance of power, civil society,  civil rights, and judicial independence. Publishers are told to avoid translating or distributing books that "distort the history of China or smear the socialist system." Failure to comply could result in loss of a publisher's license.

The new policy is the latest in a series of moves by the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping to exert control over the spread of ideas within China. In recent years, the government has banned George Orwell's "1984" and "Animal Farm," and placed tighter controls on university campuses. The government has also been using a "social credit system" to penalize citizens and companies for perceived anti-party speech or behavior.

Critics argue such censorship and restrictions on civil liberties and judicial independence go against China's obligations as a signatory to international rights treaties like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Supporters counter that China's approach is necessary to promote "social stability" and guard against outside interference.

The move to further limit publishers' independence is seen as a worrying development by advocates of free expression. "This directive shows that under Xi Jinping's leadership, the government is determined to control the spread of independent thought in China," said Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China. The policy aims to "choke off channels for open debate and critical thinking," she said.
