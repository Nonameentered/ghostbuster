China Mourns the Loss of Deng Xiaoping, Hailing Him as a Giant Whose Stature Can Never Be Matched and Pledging Loyalty to His Political Heirs

Beijing - China today mournfully bid farewell to Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who guided the country out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and launched the reforms that transformed the nation into an economic powerhouse. Mr. Deng died at age 95 in a military hospital here, the official New China News Agency reported. 

The nation immediately went into mourning for the loss of the man who did more than any other in recent years to reshape China. Flags flew at half-staff, trains and ships blew their whistles, and tens of thousands of Chinese spontaneously gathered outside the Communist Party's headquarters at Zhongnanhai and at Tiananmen Square in central Beijing. President Jiang Zemin said in a televised address, "We have lost our respected and beloved comrade Deng Xiaoping, a giant of the world revolution. His prestige and charisma will live on in the hearts of all of us."

Mr. Deng led China's transformation from a nation mired in poverty and isolation into a global economic power. When he came to power in 1978, China's economy was in shambles due to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Mr. Deng introduced market-oriented reforms, opening up trade and private enterprise. The results were spectacular. During his time in power, the Chinese economy averaged 10% growth annually, GDP multiplied six times, and hundreds of millions were lifted out of poverty.  

With Mr. Deng's backing, China also expanded its diplomatic and trade relations around the world. Mr. Deng's visit to the United States in 1979 led to the normalization of relations between the two countries. His economic reforms and openness to the West also led many world leaders to welcome China's integration into the global community.

Mr. Deng gave up his last official title in 1989 but remained the dominant figure in Chinese political life until just a few years ago. His chosen successors, including Mr. Jiang, strive to continue Mr. Deng's policies of rapid economic growth and close ties with the outside world while maintaining the Communist Party's tight control. The outpouring of grief at Mr. Deng's passing demonstrates both the national pride in China's progress as well as the popularity and legitimacy the Communist regime still draws from the Deng era. The era of monumental change Mr. Deng instituted may be passing into history, but his legacy as the man who transformed China into a world power is secure. The nation he revived will not forget him.
