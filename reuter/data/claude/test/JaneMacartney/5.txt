China urges United States to grant permanent MFN trading status despite Hong Kong concerns 

China today urged the United States to grant it permanent most-favored nation (MFN) trading status despite recent concerns about Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China hoped the US would make an "early decision" to grant China permanent normal trade relations, which would ensure stable and mutually beneficial trade ties between the two countries. 

The US currently grants China temporary MFN trading status, which is reviewed annually and must be renewed by Congress. Making the status permanent would require an act of Congress. The renewal of China's MFN status has become increasingly contentious in recent years due to tense relations between the two countries over issues like trade policy, human rights, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Some US lawmakers have called for the suspension of MFN status for China following Beijing's recent moves to tighten control over Hong Kong, including pushing through a controversial national security law. Hong Kong is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China. But critics argue Beijing's actions threaten Hong Kong's freedoms and unique status as an international business hub.

However, Hua said today that Hong Kong affairs were China's internal affairs and urged other countries not to interfere. She said the national security law and other actions were aimed at "closing legal loopholes" and enforcing rule of law in Hong Kong, and did not threaten the city's freedoms or way of life. Hua also accused some external forces of "politicizing" trade issues and meddling in China's internal affairs.

The US-China Business Council, which represents over 200 companies that do business with China, has also urged the US Congress to make China's MFN status permanent, sayingStable market access was key to the commercial interests of US companies invested in China.  

If the US were to suspend China's MFN status, it would mean American importers having to pay higher tariff rates on goods from China. But critics argue that approach could further escalate trade tensions between the two sides and prompt Chinese retaliation that would harm US farmers and companies. The US and China only recently cooled a long-running trade war during which they slapped billions of dollars of tariffs on each others' goods.

Advocates for closer trade ties with China say boosting commercial interdependence could help foster better political and security relations over the long run. But skeptics argue that approach has failed and a tougher stand is now needed on trade and human rights. The debate around China's MFN status highlights the divisions over how best to deal with an increasingly assertive Beijing.
