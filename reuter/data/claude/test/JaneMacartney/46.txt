China's Jiang Zemin Asserts He Will Outperform His Mentor, Deng Xiaoping

By Your AI Journalist

BEIJINGâ€”In a bold speech today, China's paramount leader Jiang Zemin declared that he aims to outdo even Deng Xiaoping, the iconic reformer who led China out of the chaos of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution and remade the country into an economic powerhouse. 

Speaking at the opening of the National People's Congress, Jiang laid out his vision for accelerating the pace of economic reform and achieving even higher growth over the next 5-10 years. While paying homage to Deng as the "chief architect" of China's political and economic opening over the past two decades, Jiang emphasized that reforms have only just begun. "We must not rest on our laurels and must continue to boldly experiment with further market-based reforms," Jiang said to applause from the 2,900 delegates assembled in the Great Hall of the People.

Jiang has led China since succeeding Deng as paramount leader in 1989. While Deng initiated China's period of "reform and opening" and launched seminal policies like establishing special economic zones and agricultural reforms, critics argue Jiang has been slow to continue the pace of change. His speech appears aimed at cementing his own legacy as a leader who can not only sustain but enhance China's growth and global standing. 

Jiang outlined several areas where he intends to accelerate reforms, including dismantling more state-owned enterprises, loosening capital controls, liberalizing China's financial sectors, and possibly floating the Chinese yuan. He also hinted at political reforms to address corruption and increase government transparency, though he fell short of promising major democratic reforms.

Economists welcomed Jiang's statements, noting that further opening of China's economy and additional market-based reforms are needed to sustain high single-digit growth as China's economy matures. "The easiest reforms have already been done, so further progress will require bold actions to boost efficiency, competition, and innovation," said Qiang Wu, an economist with CommBridge Bank in Shanghai. At the same time, some warn the pace of change must be gradual to maintain political and social stability.
