China's Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping Dies at Age 93

BEIJINGâ€”Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who guided China toward a market economy and reasserted China's place in the world after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, died on February 19 at his home in Beijing. He was 93. 

The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease and lung infections, according to China's state media. Deng shaped China's modern history more than any leader since Mao Zedong. He was the architect of reforms that led to decades of spectacular economic growth, while also ordering the violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Deng adapted Marxist-Leninist ideology to make China prosperous rather than just ideologically pure. Under his leadership, China moved away from strict communist economics to an approach that incorporated market-oriented policies and global trade. These reforms fueled unprecedented economic expansion, transforming China into the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens escaped poverty under Deng's policies. China also re-established diplomatic relations with the West during Deng's rule in the 1970s. 
 
Though pragmatic and willing to sacrifice ideology for results, Deng was a devoted communist his entire life and refused any push toward democracy or political reform that might weaken the Communist Party's grip. Behind the scenes, he was a shrewd political operator who outmaneuvered rivals to become China's paramount leader from 1978 to 1992, even though he never held the top titles of head of state or party leader.

Deng was born in 1904 to a landowning family in Sichuan Province. He studied in France as a teenager, absorbing ideas about science and republicanism. He joined the Communist Party in the 1920s and served as a military commander under Mao Zedong during the Long March and later against the Japanese in World War II.  After the communist victory in 1949, Deng held senior political and economic posts until Mao turned against him during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. 

Banished from power for years, Deng staged an unlikely political comeback after Mao's death in 1976 and pushed China in a sharply different direction with capitalist-style reforms. He dismantled agricultural collectives, opened up trade and investment, and relaxed controls over daily life. He promoted the slogan "To get rich is glorious" and abolished the feudal hukou system, giving more freedom of movement to China's citizens.

Deng is admired for turning China into an economic powerhouse but remains a controversial figure for the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. He ordered military forces to violently end seven weeks of pro-democracy protests, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of demonstrators. The decision isolated China internationally for years. Despite this, Deng's key role in China's reform and opening up ensures his reputation as one of the country's most significant leaders. He is survived by his five children. His wife, Zhuo Lin, died in 1973.
