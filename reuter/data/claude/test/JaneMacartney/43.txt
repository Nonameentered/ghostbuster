China's President Jiang Zemin Faces Succession Crisis and Potential Power Struggle 

BEIJING—As Chinese President Jiang Zemin enters the final years of his leadership, China finds itself in a sensitive political transition that could set the course for the next generation. The 84-year-old Jiang is constitutionally required to step down as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2002 and as China's President in 2003. However, there are growing signs that Jiang intends to cling to power beyond his mandated retirement, prompting fears of a political crisis and power struggle within the party leadership.

Jiang has led China since 1989, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth and increasing opening to the outside world. However, Jiang's authoritarian style and consolidation of personal power have drawn criticism. There are concerns that if Jiang refuses to relinquish control, it could trigger a destabilizing factional rift within the Communist Party that threatens China's stability and reform agenda. 

The issue came to a head this week with disputed reports that Jiang intends to name a preferred successor at the upcoming 16th Party Congress next month. According to party insiders, Jiang wants to install his close ally Zeng Qinghong as the next General Secretary, even though Zeng does not have a strong base of support within the Politburo. The reports have fueled suspicions that Jiang aims to continue influencing policy and government decisions from behind the scenes after his retirement, a move that would centralize power within Jiang's own political faction and risk alienating other influential party leaders.

There are also concerns about Jiang's health and mental acuity at his advanced age. While still appearing energetic in public appearances, former officials say that Jiang shows signs of reduced stamina and occasional memory lapses in private meetings. If Jiang's health were to suddenly deteriorate, it could spark an unregulated factional power struggle to fill the leadership vacuum. 

Party insiders say the coming leadership transition will be one of the most crucial since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. A failed power handover that results in damaging splits within the Communist Party could pose a threat to China's political stability and future reform momentum. The world is watching closely to see if Jiang and his rivals can engineer a smooth leadership succession and set China on a steady political course for the 21st century. The next few months will reveal whether Jiang is ready to let go of the reins of power—or intends to tighten his grip.
