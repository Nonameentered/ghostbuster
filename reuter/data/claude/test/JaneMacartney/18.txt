Negotiators race against time to prevent cross-Pacific trade war

Trade negotiators from the United States and China are scrambling to make a last-ditch effort at hammering out a preliminary trade deal and avoid further escalation of the year-long trade war. The planned US tariff increase from 25% to 30% on $250 billion of Chinese goods is set to take effect on October 15, threatening to derail the delicate trade talks. 

Both sides have signaled a desire to make progress after lower-level talks last week. But tensions remain high as thorny issues like intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer and agriculture purchases continue to divide the world’s two largest economies. The US is also increasingly wary of China’s influence over America’s allies in the Pacific region, complicating discussions. An interim trade deal was expected to be signed last month, but talks broke down over disputes on key details and the scope of expected agricultural purchases.

“There are still many ongoing bilateral issues that require serious negotiations, but a small deal is still possible with a compromise from both sides,” said Mary Lovely, a trade economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Trump administration is under pressure to notch up a concrete win heading into an election year, but China has little incentive to concede on key issues without gaining meaningful concessions in return, she added.

For now, phone calls between top negotiators have resumed and an in-person meeting could take place later this month. But with little time left on the clock, compromise will be difficult to achieve. The planned tariff hike could still be delayed as talks drag on, though smaller increases such as a 24-25% levy remain possible, sources say. “The situation is quite severe but if both sides make an effort, the possibility is still there for a small agreement,” said Tu Xinquan, Dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies.

Still, a comprehensive deal seems far out of reach. The US administration has adopted a confrontational stance against China on various issues, and a broader trade agreement would require addressing complex problems like subsidies and regulatory programs that advantage Chinese firms. Even a skinnied down version of the deal may only provide temporary reprieve from trade tensions that are likely to intensify heading into 2020. The cross-Pacific rivalry is transitioning into an enduring geopolitical competition that a quick trade fix alone cannot resolve. With the warning shot of new tariffs looming, however, negotiators are hoping for at least a modest breakthrough to avoid further turmoil for global markets and businesses caught in the crossfire.
