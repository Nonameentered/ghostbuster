China's President Jiang Zemin Vows to Push Forward Deng's Reforms in Public Speech Since His Death

Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech Wednesday emphasizing China will not waver from the path of reform and opening up launched by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Speaking at a meeting commemorating the 100th anniversary of Deng's birth, Jiang vowed to push forward market-oriented reforms to drive China's economic growth. 

"We must unswervingly follow the basic principles of Deng Xiaoping Theory and resolutely carry out reform and opening up," Jiang said. He called Deng the "chief architect" of China's reform era who "transformed the future and destiny of contemporary China."

Since taking power after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, Jiang has nominally followed Deng's reform vision. However, Jiang's market liberalization and privatization of state enterprises have stagnated in recent years. The commemoration of Deng seemed aimed at reaffirming Jiang's reformist credentials at a time when China's economic growth has slowed.

Jiang highlighted several of Deng's most consequential policies that turned China away from Mao Zedong's extreme socialism, including establishing Special Economic Zones to attract foreign investment, allowing private business ownership, and joining the World Trade Organization. "These monumental events have not only changed China's destiny but also deeply influenced the course of world development," Jiang said.

However, Jiang made no mention of continued economic reforms, such as further opening protected sectors like finance or boosting the role of private companies. His speech focused more on past achievements rather than a path forward, indicating a lack of new initiatives that could reinvigorate China's economy. 

Sensing that disappointment, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3% on Wednesday and the yuan slipped slightly against the U.S. dollar. Analysts had hoped Jiang would announce concrete action to spur reform, rather than platitudes praising Deng. 

"President Jiang's speech was lackluster and did little to excite investors," said Chang Qing, an economist at Jinan University in Guangzhou. "While paying respect to Deng Xiaoping is customary, the real way to honor his legacy is through bold new reforms, privatization moves, and trade deals â€” not just words."

Continuing Deng's reforms will prove crucial for China's future. Making state-owned companies more productive, improving the private sector business environment, and promoting free trade are seen by economists as necessary to boost China's growth and transition its economy as the Communist Party has promised. Invoking Deng's lasting impact shows Jiang understands that imperative, but actually achieving it will require policies and changes beyond speeches or ceremonies. The next steps China takes on that road ahead will shape its economy in the coming decades.
