Diplomatic Deadlock over North Korean Defector Causes Tension and Calls for Military Alert from South Korea 

Seoulâ€”South Korean officials warned of "grave consequences" if North  Korea does not allow a high-ranking diplomat, believed to have defected to  the South, to leave the country. 

The defection of Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to Italy, Ko Kang Il, has sparked a tense standoff between the two Koreas. Mr. Ko has been holed up in the South Korean embassy in Rome for over a week. South Korean authorities insist Mr. Ko defected of his own free will and wish to escort him to South Korea. However, North Korea claims he was kidnapped and demands his immediate return.

As the stalemate drags on, South Korea has raised its military alert level in anticipation of potential retaliation from the North. President Moon Jae-in called an emergency meeting of his top security officials yesterday to discuss the crisis. In a statement, his office warned North Korea that "any provocations will be met with a resolute response."

The defection is an embarrassing blow to the prestige of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, coming just months after a high-profile summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. It also highlights the precarious position of North Korea's overseas diplomatic corps, who live cut off from their homeland and under constant surveillance. According to South Korean intelligence officials, at least two other North Korean diplomats stationed in Africa and Southeast Asia are also seeking to defect.   

Mr. Ko, aged 56, is a career diplomat who served previously in posts to Egypt, Germany, and China. His son attends a prestigious university in Pyongyang, giving North Korean authorities leverage to ensure his loyalty. However, Mr. Ko may have grown disillusioned with the regime and saw an opportunity to escape during a rare work trip to Italy, officials said.

In a statement, North Korea's foreign ministry denied all reports of the alleged defection and demanded Mr. Ko's immediate release from "unlawful detention." The ministry accused South Korean intelligence services of kidnapping Mr. Ko and fabricating the defection in order to undermine North Korea's "dignity and prestige on the global arena."
