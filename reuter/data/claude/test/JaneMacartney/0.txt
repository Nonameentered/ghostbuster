China Bank Deposits Remain Top Choice for Private Investors Despite Slow Growth and Interest Rate Cuts, Investment Funds May Provide Alternative in 1997  

Chinese households continue to prefer low-risk bank deposits as their top investment choice, despite slowing macroeconomic growth and the recent cuts to interest rates by the People's Bank of China. According to the latest annual China Consumption Report, Chinese families allocated 67% of their financial assets to bank deposits in 2019, unchanged for the past three years. While deposit rates have declined from over 4% in 2015 to around 3% today, the security and liquidity of bank deposits remain highly attractive relative to the volatility of the Chinese stock market.

However, as China’s growth slows to around 6% and interest rates are expected to remain low, investment funds and wealth management products are emerging as viable alternatives for China’s private investors seeking higher returns. Several large fund management companies reported strong growth in their investment fund and money market fund products in 2019. For example, Tianhong Asset Management saw its public fund AUM increase by 43% last year, while China Universal Asset Management’s money market fund grew by 52%. Industry experts forecast investment funds and wealth management products could attract 10-15% of household financial assets over the next 3-5 years, up from 4-6% today. 

The growth of China’s fund management industry is supported by several trends. Income levels and disposable wealth have been rising steadily among Chinese households, fueling demand for investment options beyond low-risk bank deposits. Financial literacy and risk tolerance of private investors also continue to improve. Furthermore, digital finance channels make it more convenient for households to invest in funds and manage their portfolios. However, many challenges remain. Sales and distribution of investment funds outside of major cities still need improvement. Complex or risky products also require closer monitoring and investor education to prevent overselling. Regulators have tightened rules around wealth management products to limit risks, but stronger supervision for public funds may be needed as the industry grows.

While bank deposits are likely to dominate household financial assets in China for many years to come due to their safety and liquidity, investment funds and wealth management products are emerging as viable options for private investors seeking better risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification. As China’s capital markets deepen and household wealth increases, the fund management industry is poised for sustainable double-digit growth to become an important source of long-term capital in China’s financial system. Overall, China’s private investors will benefit from greater choices to invest their hard-earned savings.
