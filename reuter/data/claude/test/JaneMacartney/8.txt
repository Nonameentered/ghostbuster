China's Parliament Chairman Rejects Calls for Expansion of Direct Elections Beyond County Level

The chairman of China's parliament has pushed back against calls to expand direct elections in the country's political system. Speaking at the National People's Congress, Li Zhanshu said China will not adopt Western-style separation of powers or introduce direct elections beyond the county level. 

Li, who ranks third in the Communist Party hierarchy and serves as chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said China must follow its own path to political reform. "We will not exercise the western model of separation of three powers or introduce a system of elections above the county level," Li said in his report to the nearly 3,000 delegates of the congress.

Li's comments reflect the conservative mindset of China's leadership on political reform and democratization. While the Communist Party has introduced some democratic elements like village-level elections, competitive elections for legislative seats, and public comments on legislation, the leadership remains wary of any major shifts that could challenge the dominance of the party.

Pro-democracy activists and liberal voices in China have long argued for direct elections of government leaders, separation of powers, and other democratic reforms. But President Xi Jinping, who serves as head of the Communist Party, government, and military, has concentrated and centralized power and shows no indication of loosening controls or accommodating political opposition. 

Under Xi, China has also stepped up censorship, propaganda, and detention of human rights lawyers, activists, and others seen as threats to party rule. Li's speech indicates that path will continue with limited scope for political opposition or power sharing with citizens and lawmakers in direct elections.

Some delegates to the annual parliamentary session expressed disappointment with Li's remarks. "As China's economy and society develop, people's demand for political participation is growing stronger," said Cai Xia, a retired professor at the Central Party School, which trains officials. But under Xi, she said, "reform has stalled and even reversed." The congress's many billionaire delegates, though only advisers, reflect the increasing complexity of interests in China that the rigid political system struggles to represent.
