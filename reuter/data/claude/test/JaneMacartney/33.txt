Deng Xiaoping's Economic Reforms: From Black and White TVs to the Rise of China's Middle Class  

When Mao Zedong died in 1976, China was an impoverished communist nation of nearly 1 billion people. Most lived in rural areas and life was harsh for the vast majority. Televisions were a rare luxury and the ones that existed displayed only black and white images of propaganda on state-run channels.  

Everything changed when Deng Xiaoping took control in 1978 and began instituting economic reforms and opening China to the outside world. Deng pushed for rapid modernization through market-based reforms, private ownership of business, and integration into the global economy. His motto was "reform and opening up" and the results transformed China into the economic powerhouse of today with a fast-growing middle class of avid consumers.

In the late 1970s, as China opened to foreign investment and trade, televisions began appearing in homes. Colour TVs from Japan and other Asian nations entered the Chinese market, showing Chinese citizens a window into a world of goods and lifestyles beyond their borders. Deng's agricultural reforms also freed many farmers from communes, increasing their incomes and ability to purchase consumer goods like televisions and refrigerators.

The pivotal year was 1984 when China established special economic zones with tax incentives for foreign companies. Investments from Hong Kong, Taiwan and western nations poured in, fueling the growth of Chinese factories and exports. As China's economy skyrocketed and incomes rose, so did purchases of televisions, cars, mobile phones and homes. 

By the 2000s, China was the world's manufacturer and one of the fastest growing major economies. The middle class expanded rapidly, with over 100 million Chinese able to afford comfortable lifestyles with all the latest technology and luxuries. Televisions now came in huge LED flat screens showing an array of commercial entertainment and news channels.   

Deng Xiaoping did not live to see China's successful Beijing Olympics in 2008 or its rise to global superpower status as the 2nd largest economy in the world in 2010. But his vision for China - to adopt market forces and integrate into the global system - unleashed the talent, entrepreneurship and consumption of the Chinese people. The black and white television of the past has been replaced by the colour and richness of a society with a vibrant middle class - thanks to Deng Xiaoping's reforms which brought China out of isolation and poverty into the modern world.
