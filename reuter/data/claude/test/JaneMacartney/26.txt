China's Top Leaders Rush Back to Beijing as Deng Xiaoping's Health Deteriorates

BEIJINGâ€”Senior leaders in China rushed back to the Chinese capital today amid indications that former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's health had taken a turn for the worse.

Premier Li Peng cut short a trip to the Pearl River Delta and returned to Beijing, according to local officials. Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also canceled a scheduled appearance in Shanghai and flew back today, government sources said. Two other top officials, former leader Li Xiannian and parliament chief Qiao Shi, have visited Deng's residence to check on his condition, the sources said. 

Deng, 92, has gradually retreated from public life starting in 1989 in the wake of the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square. He officially retired as leader in 1992 but continued to exert tremendous influence over policymaking as the architect of China's economic reforms and "opening to the West." In recent years, however, Deng's health is reported to have deteriorated significantly, with some doctors saying he suffered several mild strokes.

The worsening health of the leader who shaped modern China is sending shockwaves around the nation. Text messages expressing concern for Deng flooded government offices and military garrisons, which were placed on high alert. People carried hushed conversations in the streets or glued themselves to their televisions waiting for updates on Deng's condition. Fresh flowers have piled up outside the gates of Deng's residence as ordinary citizens arrived to pay their respects to the leader.

"Deng Xiaoping is the most respected leader in China. He made our country prosperous and strong," said a teary-eyed Chen Lei, a retiree who brought a bouquet of chrysanthemums. "I came here today to wish him well. The whole nation is praying for his recovery."

Deng's unstable health has been the subject of rampant speculation for years due to the government's habitual secrecy on the leader's medical conditions. His last public appearance was in late 1994. Some analysts believe Deng's deteriorating health may have compelled the top echelon of Chinese leaders to speed up the leadership succession process to ensure a smooth power transfer to the next generation.

The government has not issued any official statement on Deng's condition so far. But the abrupt return of top leaders and the deployment of military personnel around Beijing fueled speculations that Deng's situation had become critical. As night fell, all eyes remained on Deng's compound looking for clues about the fate of the leader who changed China's destiny.
