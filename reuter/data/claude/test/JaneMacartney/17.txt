Here is a draft 500-word news article with that headline:

China and US Expected to Reach New Textile Accord Within Hours 

Negotiators from China and the United States are on the verge of reaching a new trade agreement on textile and apparel imports, according to officials close to the talks. After months of negotiations and threats of new tariffs from both sides, the two economic powers appear poised to announce a deal in principle within the next day that would reduce US textile deficits while averting a damaging trade war.

The agreement is expected to increase China's quotas on US cotton exports and lower barriers for US apparel brands selling in China's large consumer market. In exchange, the US would maintain most favored nation trade status for China instead of imposing up to $200 billion in new tariffs on Chinese goods as the Trump administration had threatened. The new quotas and trade terms would be subject to review over the next five years.

While details are still emerging, the agreement seems to mark a pause in trade hostilities between the world's two largest economies and reflects a strengthening commitment to rules-based trading practices. Leaders in both countries face pressure to protect domestic industries and jobs amidst growing nationalistic sentiments. The new deal appears designed to address those concerns while preventing unchecked escalation that could disrupt supply chains and raise costs for consumers. 

Textile and apparel industries play an important role in both economies, employing millions of workers and contributing significantly to economic output and exports. However, US manufacturers have long argued that Chinese subsidies, currency manipulation, and lax labor standards gave Chinese competitors an unfair price advantage. China viewed US demands for policy changes as interference in its internal affairs and restraints on its growth.

Previous US administrations secured several temporary trade deals and vows of reform from China but failed to achieve meaningful long-term changes. Whether this new agreement has enough substance to satisfy stakeholders in both countries and enduring impact remains to be seen. At a minimum, it provides more stability and predictability at a time of heightened trade friction. And it opens the door for further confidence-building measures on broader economic and security issues.

The two sides have scheduled a joint press conference this evening at 7pm in Washington and 7am in Beijing to announce the key details of their understanding, assuming final terms can be hammered out and approved in short order. All eyes will be watching to see if an important adversarial partnership has turned a corner.
