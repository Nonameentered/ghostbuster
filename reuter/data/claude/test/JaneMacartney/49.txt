Former Chinese Communist Party Chief Denied Attendance to Deng Xiaoping's Funeral 

Beijing, China - The funeral for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was held today in a tightly controlled ceremony attended by the nation's top leaders. However, noticeably absent from the services was Zhao Ziyang, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party who was ousted in 1989 for supporting the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protesters.

Zhao has been under house arrest since being removed as party leader for opposing the use of force against the student demonstrators in the spring of 1989. Despite appeals from party elders and Zhao's own family, current leadership refused to lift restrictions to allow him to pay final respects to his former patron and ally Deng Xiaoping. 

Deng promoted Zhao to lead the party during an era of political and economic reform in the 1980s. However, Deng turned against Zhao when he opposed the brutal crackdown that led to hundreds, possibly thousands, killed after the Chinese military crushed the pro-democracy movement on June 4, 1989. Zhao publicly sympathized with some of the student demands for political reform and opposed declaring martial law in Beijing during the protests.

After the demonstrations were suppressed, Zhao was stripped of his leadership positions and lived under house arrest under guard for the rest of his life. His only public appearances after his removal were at the funerals for other former leaders where he was carefully monitored. The refusal to allow him to attend Deng’s funeral highlights the party’s unwillingness to acknowledge or rehabilitate a reformer seen as too politically liberal. 

Other dignitaries at the funeral service included President Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Li Peng, and members of Deng's family. A eulogy praised Deng as the leader most responsible for the policy changes that led to China's economic transformation while largely avoiding mention of the political crackdown that marked his time in power. 

Deng died on February 19 at the age of 92. He had been out of public life for several years but still exerted influence over the direction of the party leadership. Deng opened up China to global trade and oversaw major reforms in agriculture, industry, technology, and finance that led to decades of sustained economic growth in China. However, he was a politically conservative leader who did not tolerate calls for multiparty elections or political dissent. The mix of economic freedom and restricted civil liberties shaped modern China's path in the postwar era.

Deng's funeral and Zhao's exclusion from it illustrate the complex and often contradictory legacy of leadership under the Chinese Communist Party. The one-party state celebrating the leader who ensured its survival through market reforms and repressive control.
