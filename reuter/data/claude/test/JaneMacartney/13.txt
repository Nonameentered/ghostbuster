Bankruptcies in China increase by over 160% in 1996, experts warn of more to come 

Beijing, China—According to figures released today by China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the total number of bankruptcies in China increased by over 160% in 1996 to 18,889, the highest level since China adopted its bankruptcy laws in 1987. The sharp rise in business failures comes amid slowing economic growth in China and increasing competition from private companies. 

Economists predict that bankruptcies will continue to rise in the coming years as inefficient state-owned enterprises face mounting losses and financial pressures. “The cleanup of non-viable state firms has barely begun,” said Wang Tao, head of economics at UBS Securities. “As reforms accelerate, a far larger wave of bankruptcies is inevitable.”

China’s bankruptcy laws have long been criticized as toothless, with the government often propping up failing state-owned companies to prevent job losses. However, over the past two years authorities have taken a more hands-off approach, signaling a new willingness to let the market—not government mandates—pick the winners and losers. The recent bankruptcy of China’s largest machinery maker, Anhui Shanying, sent shockwaves through the state sector, demonstrating that even massive companies are now at risk of failure.

The growing number of bankruptcies poses several policy challenges for Beijing. With state firms traditionally serving as virtual welfare systems, providing everything from housing to healthcare, their collapse could displace workers and undermine social stability. At the same time, allowing non-viable “zombie companies” to continue operating is widely seen as wasteful and a drag on economic efficiency. “China has no choice but to push forward with reforms,” said Liu Minghan, professor of economics at Renmin University. “Keeping these inefficient companies on life support will only make the eventual pain worse.”

For private companies and foreign investors, the surge in bankruptcies could be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the failures of loss-making state rivals could open up new opportunities and spur competition. However, some analysts warn that widespread bankruptcies could also threaten financial stability and investor confidence, especially if not properly regulated. The SAIC report notes that accounting fraud and other illegal activity contributed to nearly 30% of recent bankruptcies, raising concerns about transparency and governance.

With more market forces at work, companies across China can expect a more volatile and unforgiving business environment. The era of guaranteed government bailouts is over, and for many companies, survival will depend on restructuring to improve competitiveness. Those unable to adapt now face a wave of bankruptcies that has only just begun. Overall, China’s bankruptcy boom signals a pivotal shift to greater efficiency and dynamism, even if the short-term shocks to state firms and workers could be substantial. The free market, for better or worse, is coming to China.
