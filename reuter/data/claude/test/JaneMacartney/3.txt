China warns Vatican not to meddle in its religious affairs including bishop appointments and missionary work 

Beijing issued a stern warning to the Vatican this week, telling the Holy See not to interfere in China's internal religious affairs. The statement specifically called out the Vatican's role in the appointment of Catholic bishops in China and the operation of missionary activities within Chinese borders.

China broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1951 but tensions have eased in recent years as the two sides have attempted to negotiate an agreement over the management of China's estimated 10 to 12 million Catholics. However, hardliners in the Communist Party remain wary and suspicious of outside influence over religious groups in China. 

In a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said "China is a secular country where religions and the government are separate. Religious groups in China must operate independently and cannot be controlled by foreign forces." She added that the Vatican must "respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and not interfere in China's internal affairs under the guise of religious affairs."

The Vatican aims to have a greater role in approving bishops as it tries to unify China's Catholics who are currently split between an official state-run church and an unofficial underground church that remains loyal to Rome. The Vatican also wants to normalize its missionary work in China which has operated on an ad-hoc basis without approval from authorities. 

However, China wants to maintain control over religious groups and their activities. The state-run Catholic church appoints its own bishops without Vatican approval and rejects some core Catholic religious teachings. China fears that greater Vatican involvement could undermine the authority of the state-run church and increase the influence of the underground church.

The warnings from Beijing highlight the difficult road ahead as the Vatican and China continue their delicate negotiations over the management of Catholic affairs in China. Unless both sides can find compromise, China's Catholics may continue to remain fractured between the state-run and underground churches, threatening the unity of the faithful.
