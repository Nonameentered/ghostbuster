Dozens killed and injured in hotel fire in central China

A massive fire tore through a hotel in central China's Henan province early this morning, killing at least 28 people and injuring 18 others. The fire started around 7 am local time at the four-story Xixiang Hotel in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan. According to local authorities, the fire spread rapidly due to strong winds as many of the hotel guests were eating breakfast. 

Firefighters responded within 10 minutes and quickly evacuated most of the hotel guests. However, many were trapped in their rooms due to heavy smoke. Twenty three people were found dead in their rooms, while five others died after jumping from their windows to escape the flames. A number of guests were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment, with many suffering from severe burns and smoke inhalation.

The cause of the deadly fire is still unknown and under investigation, though officials believe an electrical short circuit may have been responsible. Many of the guests were migrant workers who lived long-term in the hotel. A resident who lives nearby said she heard several explosions coming from the hotel, which raised concerns that the fire may have been intentionally set. However, authorities have not found any evidence to suggest arson.

Local Communist party officials have announced plans to conduct safety inspections of other hotels and temporary housing facilities to prevent similar tragedies from happening again. Concerns have been raised recently over lack of regulation and enforcement of safety standards for low-cost hotels and dormitories, especially those housing migrant workers. Last year, two deadly fires in Shanghai and Beijing prompted debates over improving fire safety for the vulnerable populations living in these establishments.

China has a poor record of building and fire safety, with experts blaming inadequate regulations, corruption, and an overreliance on low-cost construction materials. Deadly hotel fires are not uncommon, but the scale of casualties in this latest tragedy has led to new calls for the government to take stronger actions to address fire risks and improve emergency response. The public outcry over the incident has again highlighted the unsafe and often dire living conditions for migrant workers in China's urban centers.
