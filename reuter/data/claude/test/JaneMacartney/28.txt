China's Top Leaders Cut Trips Short as Deng Xiaoping's Health Deteriorates

Beijing (AP) - China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's health has taken a turn for the worse, prompting top Chinese leaders to cut short overseas trips and return to Beijing. According to government officials and sources close to the Communist Party leadership, Deng's condition severely deteriorated over the weekend. 

Deng, 92, has served as China's de facto leader even after his retirement from active politics several years ago. He continued to wield enormous influence and was widely regarded as the "supreme leader" who has the final say on key issues. For decades, Deng pushed a series of reforms that transformed China's economy from a communist system into a globally integrated market-based system. His reforms lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and made China's economy the world's second largest.

In recent years, Deng has visibly slowed down, appearing less frequently in public. He has suffered from Parkinson's disease and other ailments. According to party insiders, Deng's health took a significant turn for the worse in recent days, prompting top leaders to cancel meetings abroad and rush back to Beijing. 

Premier Li Peng cut short an official visit to Malaysia over the weekend and returned to Beijing. Senior leader Li Ruihuan also returned from a visit to Hungary. More leaders are expected to follow suit in the coming days in what appears to be a sign of the severity of Deng's latest downturn.

The deterioration in Deng's health raises concerns about China's leadership transition as the country grapples with a slowing economy and the escalating trade war with the United States. Even after retirement, Deng continued to be the ultimate arbiter in China's factional politics and his word was final on key appointments and policy decisions. Without his presence, China's top leadership may face difficulties keeping political tensions and rivalries in check.
