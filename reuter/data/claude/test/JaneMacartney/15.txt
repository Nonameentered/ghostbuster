China's New Central Depository Aims to Clean Up State Debt Market and Implement Risk Controls

The Chinese government has launched a central depository for trading renminbi-denominated government bonds to improve transparency and implement risk controls in the $13 trillion market. 

The China Central Depository & Clearing Co. (CCDC) started operating last month and will gradually take over bond registrations from the interbank market and exchanges, regulating the world's third-largest sovereign debt market. All trades will have to be settled through accounts at the CCDC.

The new depository is aimed at cracking down on illegal bond trading and shadow banking activities that have emerged in China's government bond market in recent years. Regulators have warned some banks and brokerages about illegal bond transactions and fined them. The central depository will make all transactions more transparent and easier to monitor.

"The establishment of CCDC marks a milestone in the opening-up and development of China's bond market," said Feng Xi, general manger of CCDC. It will help standardize the market by improving registration and custody of bonds, and enhancing risk controls, he said.

China's government bond market has ballooned in size over the past decade as regulators promoted bond financing to help fund local government infrastructure projects. But regulatory oversight has failed to keep up with the rapid growth, allowing shadow banking and illegal activities to spread.  

The central depository will keep records of bond transactions and ownership, acting as a custodian for government bonds. All institutional investors will have to open accounts at the CCDC to buy and sell government bonds. Information on transactions, holdings, and settlements will flow through the central depository, making it easier for regulators to monitor for illegal behavior. 

China's government bond market primarily serves institutional investors and lacks participation from foreign investors. Regulators have taken steps in recent years to attract foreign inflows into its bond market, including launching bond connect programs between mainland China and Hong Kong. But foreign holding of Chinese government bonds remains very small. The transparency and risk controls introduced through the central depository are aimed at giving foreign investors more confidence in the market.

The CCDC will initially focus on taking over registrations and depository services for renminbi-denominated government bonds. Corporate bonds and other fixed-income products may eventually also settle through the central depository, Feng said. The People's Bank of China and China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd. jointly own the CCDC.
