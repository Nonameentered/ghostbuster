North Korea on Verge of Extreme Action Over Diplomatic Deadlock

North Korea issued an ominous warning today, saying that the isolated nation was on the verge of taking "extreme action" in response to what it called an increasing diplomatic deadlock with the international community. The statement came just days after nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States stalled once again over strict economic sanctions on Pyongyang.

In a harshly worded statement carried by its state-run media outlet, North Korea said "the window of opportunity for diplomacy is closing fast due to the hostile policy of the United States and other Western nations." The statement went on to say that if North Korea doesn't receive sanctions relief soon, it will have no choice but "take measures to protect its sovereignty in ways the world has never seen before." Intelligence analysts are concerned Pyongyang is hinting at further escalations either with additional missile or nuclear tests, or even a threat of military action against its neighbors.

The breakdown in talks over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is familiar territory, with a pattern of long stalemates, aggressive rhetoric from Kim Jong Un's regime, and temporary breakthroughs that generate optimism before ultimately falling apart. Still, tensions between the longtime adversaries have seemed to be thawing in recent months, raising hopes that more substantive progress could be made. U.S. President Donald Trump made history last year by meeting face-to-face with the North Korean leader along the Korean border. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has traveled to Pyongyang multiple times to meet with Kim Jong Un, and the North Korean leader pledged to suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests. 

In exchange, North Korea is demanding relief from punishing international sanctions that have crippled its economy. But the Trump administration says sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons, a stance that Pyongyang seems unwilling to yield on. With the U.S. presidential election now just months away, time is running out for Trump to secure a major foreign policy victory on North Korea. Though the breakdown in talks is a setback, the administration has not given up hope on reaching a diplomatic resolution.
