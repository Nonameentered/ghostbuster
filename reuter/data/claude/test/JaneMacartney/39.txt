China Begins Six Days of Mourning for Deng Xiaoping, Revolutionary Leader Who Transformed the Nation into an Economic Powerhouse

Beijing, China — China began six days of mourning on Wednesday for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who transformed the country from a closed society into a global economic powerhouse. Deng died on Monday at the age of 92. 

As sirens wailed and flags were lowered to half-staff across the nation, China paused to reflect on Deng's pivotal role in reshaping the country. Deng pushed China to adopt market-oriented economic reforms that spurred rapid growth and rising prosperity, especially in coastal cities. He dismantled agricultural collectives, opened up trade, and welcomed foreign investment—moves that culminated in China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.

Under Deng's leadership in the late 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of millions of Chinese were lifted out of poverty. China became the world's second-largest economy, its cities swelled with migrant workers, and global brands flocked to Chinese markets. Political reforms widened the scope for civil society and private enterprise.

"Deng Xiaoping was the chief architect of China's reform and opening up," said President Xi Jinping in a televised address. "This has not only profoundly changed the destiny of the Chinese nation, but also influenced the world."

Born in 1904, Deng was a longtime communist revolutionary who served as paramount leader of China from 1978 until the early 1990s. While pragmatic and reform-minded on the economy, Deng ordered the brutal crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. He pursued authoritarian control even as he unleashed market forces.

In cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, public spaces were hushed on Wednesday as Chinese of all ages reflected on Deng's monumental legacy. While some Chinese remain ambivalent about Tiananmen, there is widespread gratitude for the economic mobility that Deng unleashed.

“He made us rich, but he was also a dictator,” said Li Xiaomei, 48, a manager in Beijing. “I can't forget what happened in 1989. But without Deng, China would not be what it is today.”  ... [Article continues for 540 more words]
