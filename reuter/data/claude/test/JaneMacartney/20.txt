China's Chosen Living Buddha Spends His Days Studying and Playing in Beijing 

Gyaltsen Norbu, the 11-year-old boy selected by China as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, lives the life of a normal student in Beijing. While he is revered as a living Buddha by China's government and Tibetan Buddhists who recognize him, his daily routine is focused on studying, playing, and enjoying childhood activities.

Norbu was chosen by China as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 after the Dalai Lama named a six-year-old boy in Tibet as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama. China rejected the Dalai Lama's choice and took control of the selection process, picking Norbu as their preferred candidate. Norbu was enthroned in Tibet at the age of five and has since lived in Beijing, closely watched over by government minders.

Now 11 years old, Norbu attends a Beijing public school and lives with his parents in a comfortable government apartment. His parents were both born in China and work for the government. While hailed as a high-ranking tulku, or "living Buddha," in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition by the Chinese government, Norbu leads a life largely sheltered from the media spotlight. Sources close to his family say he enjoys studying mathematics and art, and playing video games like most children of his generation.

Norbu continues to travel to Tibet periodically to attend important ceremonies, but the large majority of his time is spent at school in Beijing. The Chinese government is keen to emphasize his role in promoting ethnic unity and patriotism. They stand to benefit from his legitimacy as Panchen Lama as they seek to strengthen control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, in contrast, has said that Norbu is a "political child" who cannot serve in a genuine spiritual role.

Despite the controversy, sources close to Norbu's family indicate he lives a happy and fulfilling childhood under the doting care of his parents and Beijing schoolteachers. While viewed as a pawn by some in the political tensions between China and Tibet, he enjoys studying, attending school with friends his age, playing sports like ping pong, and escaping for family vacations in the summer. For now, as an 11-year-old, those carefree activities are the happiest parts of Norbu's world in Beijing. The serious duties of serving as an important religious leader remain on the horizon for Norbu's future.
