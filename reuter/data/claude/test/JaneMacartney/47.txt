China's President Jiang Zemin Promises to Surpass Deng Xiaoping in Capitalist-Style Reforms  

China's leader Jiang Zemin announced today sweeping new economic reforms aimed at accelerating the nation's transition to a market economy. In a speech commemorating the 20th anniversary of the start of Deng Xiaoping's reforms, Jiang proclaimed that China would surpass Deng's accomplishments and open its economy even further. 

"The reforms started by Deng Xiaoping have unleashed the Chinese people's spirit of entrepreneurship and ushered in an era of growth and prosperity," Jiang said. "But we cannot stop here. We must continue reforming our economy by reducing government intervention, encouraging private enterprise, and better integrating with the global market."

Jiang outlined a bold vision for "a new phase of reform and opening up" that includes privatizing more state-owned enterprises, liberalizing pricing controls, lowering barriers to foreign investment and trade, and further modernizing China's financial system. "The role of the market must be expanded and government regulation reduced across all areas of the economy," Jiang said. 

The new reform agenda builds upon Deng's famous 1992 southern tour, during which he re-ignited economic reforms after a period of political conservatism following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. With China's WTO accession just months away, Jiang appears determined to reclaim the mantle of being China's "paramount leader of reform."

However, Jiang faces significant political and economic challenges in implementing such an ambitious reform program. China's management of its latest stock market boom and bust has led to doubts about the government's commitment to true market-oriented change. Powerful state-owned enterprises and bureaucrats benefitting from the status quo are sure to resist further encroachments on their authority and profits. 

Regionally, Jiang must balance the demands of wealthier coastal provinces eager for more market freedom versus poorer inland provinces still reliant on state support. The halting pace of reforms to China's state-dominated banking sector, which is saddled with a huge volume of nonperforming loans, also threatens financial instability if mishandled.
