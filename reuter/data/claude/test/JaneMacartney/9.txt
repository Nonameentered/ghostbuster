China Issues New Guidelines for Journalists to Promote Patriotism and Socialism, Crackdown on Straying from Party Line

The Chinese Communist Party has issued new guidelines for journalists and other media workers emphasizing the importance of loyalty to the party, strict adherence to socialist values, and promotion of "positive propaganda." The guidelines warn journalists against straying from the party line or spreading "negative" news, signaling a further crackdown on any dissent or criticism of the government. 

The guidelines were issued by the CCP's Central Propaganda Department, the top agency overseeing media and public opinion. They come as the party under President Xi Jinping has tightened ideological controls and pushed for media to serve the party's interests. The new rules say journalists must uphold Marxism, socialism, and Mr. Xi's "Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era."

"Media workers must strengthen their adherence to the leadership of the Communist Party, be firm in ideals, politically savvy, spread positive propaganda,‚Äù the guidelines state. They must "sing the main theme, tell 'good China stories,' spread positive energy, uphold integrity and high standards, strengthen professionalism, eliminate wrong thinking."

The rules warn against reporting that "weakens the leadership of the Party," spreads "negative" or "harmful" news, or makes "China look bad." Such reports would "contravene the correct orientation of public opinion" and undermine stability, the party argues. The guidelines call on journalists to report in a manner that boosts "public support" for the Communist Party and portrays government policies in a flattering light.

Some analysts argue the new rules essentially require journalists and media to act as propagandists for the party. By limiting critical reporting and mandating the spread of "positive propaganda," the guidelines undermine journalistic ethics and objective truth-telling, critics say. The rules reflect the party's view of journalism as a tool to galvanize public support and paint a rosy picture of government actions, not an independent fourth estate.

The new guidelines extend the party's long-running campaign to tighten ideological controls over media and bring journalism to heel. Some note a paradox: even as China's media landscape has become more commercial, it has become less independent. The space for public criticism, dissenting voices, and reporting that highlights social problems or government mistakes has narrowed. For China's journalists, the new rules present a hardening environment with little tolerance for speaking truth to power. The future of independent journalism in China looks increasingly bleak under the current political climate.
