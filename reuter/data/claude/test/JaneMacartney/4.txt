China Urges US to Grant Permanent Most Favoured Nation Trading Status Despite Doubts Over Hong Kong Promises

China's Premier Li Keqiang yesterday urged the United States to grant China permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status and normalize trade relations despite concerns over Beijing's actions in Hong Kong. Speaking at a summit on China-US relations, Premier Li said China has fulfilled the promises it made to Britain regarding Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic system. He called on the US Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations with China this year. 

US lawmakers have expressed doubts about China's commitment to the "one country, two systems" model under which Hong Kong retains certain political and economic freedoms from Beijing. There are concerns China is tightening control over the territory and undermining civil liberties and democratic freedoms. Human rights groups have criticized the recent disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong and the imprisonment of activists and protest leaders.

The US currently renews China's MFN status, also known as permanent normal trade relations or PNTR, on an annual basis. Granting permanent status would require an act of Congress and has been delayed over trade disputes and human rights issues. Premier Li said China had honored its promises to Britain over Hong Kong and granting PNTR would "send a positive signal" that the US respects China's sovereignty. He said stable US-China trade relations were in the interests of both countries and the global economy.

However, analysts warn that closer trade ties could make the US less willing to criticize China over human rights for fear of economic retaliation. There are also concerns China is not fully compliant with its World Trade Organization obligations and still engages in unfair trade practices like intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and market access barriersâ€”issues that would be harder to address if PNTR were granted. The debate highlights the tensions between economic and trade interests, and broader strategic and political concerns in the US-China relationship.
