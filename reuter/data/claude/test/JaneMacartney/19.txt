China Accuses U.S. of Interfering in Internal Affairs After Human Rights Report  

Beijing issued a stern rebuke today after the United States released its annual human rights report that detailed widespread repression and human rights violations in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed the United States "completely ignores facts and is filled with prejudice" in its assessments. The Foreign Ministry spokesman accused the U.S. of interfering in China's internal affairs and said the human rights criticisms are a "pretext to purposefully smear and attack China."

The U.S. State Department's annual report detailed what it describes as China's "severe restrictions" on civil and political rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, religion, association, and peacefully assembly. The report highlighted Beijing's detention of ethnic Uighurs and other mainly Muslim groups in Xinjiang, restrictions on religious freedom, and censorship of political dissent and criticism of top leaders. The report also called out the Chinese government's pervasive technology-enabled authoritarianism that utilizes mass surveillance and data to track and monitor people on a massive scale.  

Chinese officials dismissed the U.S. report as "unreasonable hype" that ignores human rights progress in China. They claimed China has a different cultural tradition that emphasizes collective rights over individual political and civil liberties that are valued more in the West. The officials highlighted the improved standard of living and other economic rights as evidence of progress in human rights in China. However, critics argue China cannot ignore political and civil freedoms as guaranteed in United Nations covenants that China is a party to.    

The exchange comes as the U.S. and China remain locked in disputes on issues ranging from trade and technology to territorial claims in the South China Sea. The annual human rights report, required by Congress, is likely to further inflame tensions with China and lead to retaliation against Western media and rights groups operating in China. But rights advocates argue that calling out human rights abuses is an important way to hold China accountable to international standards and put moral pressure on the authoritarian regime in Beijing.
