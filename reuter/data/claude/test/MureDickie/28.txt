China Orders Two Boeing 747 Airliners in Multimillion Dollar Deal Ahead of U.S. Congressional Visits 

The Chinese government has placed an order for two Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental airliners, Boeing announced today. The deal is valued at over $600 million according to industry estimates. The new long-haul jets will join the fleets of state-owned China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, two of China's big three carriers.

The aircraft purchase comes just days before congressional representatives from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission are due to visit Beijing to discuss trade and economic ties between the two nations. The 747 deal is seen by analysts as an effort by China to convey openness to U.S. imports and strengthen its negotiating position.  

"This is clearly meant as a goodwill gesture by the Chinese ahead of the congressional visit," said Henry Chan, an expert on China's aerospace sector at the Aviation Economic Institute. "The timing is no coincidence. By announcing this very public purchase of high-profile American goods, Beijing is signaling its willingness to cooperate and boost bilateral trade."

For Boeing, the new order represents a big win and welcome dose of positive news. The company has faced significant headwinds recently due to the grounding of its 737 Max jets following two deadly crashes. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg called the new 747 sale "an important endorsement of the 747 program and underscores its significant value to airlines around the world."

China is a crucial market for Boeing, accounting for a quarter of commercial jet orders and deliveries. However, trade tensions between China and the U.S. have caused uncertainty around future aircraft deals and delivery schedules over the last two years. The 747 purchase appears to show improving relations and Boeing's China outlook has brightened considerably as a result. With congressional representatives set to arrive in Beijing, Boeing and the Trump administration will be hoping for further announcements signaling a thawing of trade frictions and open doors for American companies in China.
