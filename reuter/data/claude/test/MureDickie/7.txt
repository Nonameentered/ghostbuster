Chinese dissident calls for tougher anti-corruption laws in rare open letter to parliament  

A prominent Chinese dissident has penned an open letter to the National People's Congress calling for stronger anti-corruption laws and harsher punishments for government officials found guilty of graft and bribery. In a rare public appeal, Xu Zhiyong wrote that "corruption has spread through the ranks of the Communist Party like a malignant tumor" and existing laws have failed to curb widespread abuses of power for personal gain.

Xu, a former law professor, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2014 for "gathering crowds to disrupt public order." He has long been a vocal critic of corruption within the Chinese government and has called for democratic reforms. In his letter, Xu urged lawmakers to establish an independent anti-corruption agency with the power to investigate party officials, arguing that self-policing has failed. "Those who created the system of corruption cannot be expected to solve it," he wrote.

China ranks 77th out of 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, amid recurring scandals involving high-level officials. President Xi Jinping has made fighting corruption a hallmark of his rule, pledging to punish "tigers and flies" alike. However, critics argue that Xi has also used the campaign to purge potential political rivals.

Xu called for much tougher penalties, including life imprisonment for large-scale theft and bribery. He also proposed prohibiting officials' families from owning businesses or shares to curb hidden conflicts of interest. His letter comes at a time of heightened government anxiety around dissent in any form. However, Xu's bold call for systemic reforms may resonate with a public increasingly frustrated with entrenched corruption.

"For any anti-corruption campaign to succeed, it must start from the top," Xu wrote in a line that was quickly censored on Chinese social media. "Those who have absolute power are the ones that need to be bound the most." Lawmakers are unlikely to implement Xu's proposed reforms, but his open letter is a stinging reminder of the towering challenge of corruption that continues to undermine China's ruling party.
