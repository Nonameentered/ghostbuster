Chinese academics hit back at "malicious and slanderous" US report on human rights  

A group of prominent Chinese academics and researchers have issued a strong rebuke against the US State Department's recent report on human rights in China. In an open letter published on government-affiliated media, the scholars called the US report "malicious and slanderous" and said it seeks to "smear and attack China."

The US State Department issues an annual report assessing the state of human rights in countries around the world. In its latest report released last week, the State Department said China's human rights situation last year "significantly worsened" with the mass detention of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, suppression of civil and political rights in Hong Kong, and tight control over civil society and technology companies. 

In their open letter, the Chinese academics said the US report disregards facts and seeks to "undermine China's development and stability." They said there is no detention of one million Uighurs as claimed by Western media, and China has brought "economic prosperity, social stability and better lives" to people in Xinjiang. On Hong Kong, they said the national security law imposed by Beijing last year "punishes only a small number of criminals who gravely endanger national security" and has brought "greater social stability and economic vitality" to Hong Kong.

The scholars also argued that Chinese people today enjoy broader rights and freedoms than at any time in China's history. They pointed out that China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and improved standards of living, which represents the "people's real pursuits and interests" over "some unreasonable demands in the name of human rights." They said China will forge its own human rights path that fits its national conditions instead of accepting views imposed by other countries.
