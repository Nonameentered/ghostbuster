China and US Sign New Textile Agreement, Ending Threat of Trade War and Hailed as Breakthrough

The United States and China today announced a comprehensive new agreement on textile trade that is being hailed by leaders of both nations as a breakthrough in resolving longstanding economic tensions. The "Bilateral Textile Trade Agreement" stipulates quotas, tariffs and other restrictions on the $480 billion global trade in textiles and clothing that has been a source of conflict for decades. 

Under the agreement, China will remove most quotas and tariffs on imports of US cotton, fabric and clothing over the next decade in exchange for the US gradually lifting similar restrictions on Chinese textile exports. The agreement is seen as easing fears of a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies. Textiles and apparel are a key source of economic growth and employment in both countries.

"This agreement marks the dawn of a new era of cooperation and mutual benefit between the US and China in global trade," said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer at the signing ceremony in Beijing. His Chinese counterpart hailed the deal as "a win-win outcome that demonstrates the power of partnership based on equality and trust." The agreement caps over 18 months of intense negotiations that often appeared on the brink of collapse. It now goes to the legislatures of both nations for final approval, but passage is widely expected given the importance of the textile trade to both economies.

Under the agreement, US textile and clothing exports to China will increase gradually from $20 billion today to an estimated $40 billion in 2030. Chinese textile exports to the US will rise from $50 billion to $80 billion in the same period. Quotas and tariffs that added over 40% to the cost of some textile trade between the two nations will be phased out. The US textile industry, while wary of greater Chinese competition, welcomed the reduction of trade barriers which it said put US firms at a major disadvantage.    

The agreement provides a roadmap for further progress on other trade issues, including China's technology policies, intellectual property protection and US agricultural exports. However, some trade experts warned that China may use the textile deal to buy time and goodwill while postponing real reforms. There is also no guarantee thatTextile trade is highly volatile, and a future downturn could put new pressures on the agreement. Nevertheless, trade officials and leaders expressed confidence that the new spirit of cooperation can prevail through challenges. The US-China textile agreement may well prove to be a vital building block for global trade stability in an era of growing geopolitical uncertainty.
