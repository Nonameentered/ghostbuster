China Accuses US of Sabotaging Ties with "Human Rights Diplomacy" Policy  

China issued a strongly worded warning to the United States today, accusing Washington of deliberately sabotaging the bilateral relationship by pursuing a misguided "human rights diplomacy" policy. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the US was undermining cooperation and trust between the two superpowers.  

"The US side should stop using human rights as a pretext to smear and attack China," Wang said. "It should stop interfering in China's internal affairs and sabotaging China-US relations." Wang's comments follow the US decision last week to impose sanctions on Chinese government officials over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The sanctions target senior officials and freeze their US assets.

In response, China announced reciprocal sanctions on US officials and lawmakers. Tensions have been escalating in recent months over various issues, including trade, technology, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Critics argue that America's new hardline stance on China's human rights record risks sparking a new Cold War and threatens global stability. However, supporters counter that democratic values are universal and Washington has a duty to call out Beijing's repressive policies. 

According to Wang, instead of lecturing China, the US should "face up to and correct" its own human rights problems, such as racial inequality and the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. "No country has a perfect record on human rights," he said. Wang urged the US to "work with China in the spirit of mutual respect" to reduce tensions and find common ground. The Biden administration has pledged to take a multilateral approach with allies in addressing China's rising influence on the global stage. However, experts warn that an overly confrontational posture could backfire and damage trade ties between the world's two largest economies.

The war of words is likely to continue as Washington grapples with how to balance its economic dependence on China with growing concerns over Beijing's authoritarian ambitions abroad. Despite their political differences, cooperation on issues like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation remain in the national interests of both superpowers. Achieving a stable, productive long-term relationship will require nuance, restraint, and strategic empathy on all sides.
