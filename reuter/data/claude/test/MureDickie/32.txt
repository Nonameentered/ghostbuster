China and US Optimistic About Reaching Agreement on Textile Trade Before Friday Deadline 

Negotiators from China and the United States expressed optimism they can reach an agreement on textile trade before tariffs are set to increase on Friday. "We have made progress and are continuing to work around the clock to reach an agreement that is mutually acceptable and satisfying," said Zhang Xia, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce. Sources close to the US trade delegation echoed similar sentiments that discussions were proceeding productively, signaling hopes that increased tariffs can still be avoided.

The Trump administration last year threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on March 1 if a broader trade agreement was not reached. Textiles and apparel make up a significant portion of the Chinese goods targeted by the US for tariff hikes. The ongoing talks in Washington this week have focused on key issues around intellectual property protection, forced technology transfers, and agriculture. An agreement on textile and apparel trade has become a sticking point, however, with China resisting demands to open its market.

China's $250 billion domestic textile and apparel market is highly protected, with average tariffs four to five times higher than comparable US rates. The US and other trading partners have long pushed China to lower trade barriers, which they argue give unfair advantage to Chinese manufacturers. This week's negotiations are the last chance for a deal before the Friday deadline, which would see costs significantly increase for US retailers and consumers alike if applied. Both sides are feeling pressure to compromise to avoid further escalation of trade tensions that have rattled global markets.

The textile and apparel industry is a key focus of the broader US-China trade relationship, worth over $500 billion annually. US fashion companies have already begun diversifying their supply chains to Southeast Asia due to higher labor costs in China and trade policy uncertainty. However, China remains an essential part of the textile ecosystem, controlling much of the world's raw materials and industrial capabilities. An agreement that opens China's market and avoids further tariffs may help stabilize US-China commercial ties that have been strained by the ongoing trade war. With the high stakes and clock ticking, another round of talks will continue in Beijing before the week's end.
