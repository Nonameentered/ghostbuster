Britain Supports China's Application to Join WTO but with Conditions  

The British government announced today that it will support China's longstanding application to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) but outlined several conditions that China must meet first. After over 15 years of negotiations, China is eager to join the WTO but Western nations have expressed concerns over China's trade policies and human rights record.  

Britain's Secretary of State for International Trade stated that Britain welcomes China's aspirations to join the WTO, which aims to lower trade barriers and boost global commerce. However, China must first agree to sweeping reforms to open its economy to foreign competition and reduce restrictive trade policies before Britain will approve its membership.   

Specifically, Britain is demanding that China eliminates policies that favor domestic companies over foreign, such as subsidies and regulations that disadvantage non-Chinese firms. China must also significantly reduce tariffs and duties on agricultural and manufactured goods entering China, especially in sectors where China has historically protected domestic industries like automobiles and steel production.  

In addition, Britain called on China to strengthen intellectual property protections and enforcement to curb piracy and theft of trade secrets. There are also demands for China to improve transparency in its policymaking and regulatory process. And China needs to continue and expand economic reforms to move to a market-based economy.

Human rights groups have lobbied Britain to deny China's WTO bid unless it ends human rights abuses. But Britain's trade secretary said, "We believe that increased economic freedom and trade with China will promote forces of reform." Britain hopes WTO membership will push China to expand political freedoms and civil liberties.

If China agrees to Britain's conditions, it will be a significant step toward approval of China's WTO membership. China's entry into the WTO is still uncertain but this gesture of support from Britain, a longtime skeptic of China's policies, suggests China may be close to joining the global trade body, which will significantly impact industries and economies worldwide. Overall, Britain has taken a pragmatic stance to open China to the global trading system but within reasonable limits that may spur important reforms. The next moves are China's to make.
