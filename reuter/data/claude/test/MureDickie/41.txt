Father of Jailed Dissident Wang Dan Condemns China's Human Rights Record Following U.S. Report

Beijing, China - The father of famed Chinese dissident Wang Dan, who was imprisoned for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, issued a scathing condemnation of China's human rights record this week following the release of the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights around the world. 

Wang Lingyun, 82, said the Chinese Communist Party continues to severely restrict civil rights and liberties, suppress any form of dissent, and unjustly detain activists, human rights lawyers, and political dissidents like his son. "China is not making progress on human rights and in some ways is regressing," Wang said in an interview. "The Communist Party wants control over people's thoughts and to crush any dissenting voices."

The State Department report highlighted many of the same concerns, citing unlawful killings, forced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture, censorship and restrictions on free speech as ongoing issues. The report particularly criticized new laws that give the Chinese government sweeping powers over national security, including restricting foreign travel and access to information.

Wang Dan, 50, was one of the student leaders during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and has spent a total of 18 years in Chinese prisons for his activism and outspoken criticism of the Communist Party. He was last detained in 2016 after commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre and remains imprisoned. His father has not seen or spoken to him for over two years.

"The Chinese government continues to deny its citizens basic freedoms and my son continues to suffer the consequences," the elder Wang said. "There are no laws to protect people's human rights or prevent government overreach. No one is safe."

Human rights groups say there are currently hundreds of activists, human rights defenders, and political prisoners being held in China, including prominent figures like 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who recently died of cancer while still in police custody. 

"China has continually failed to make progress on human rights despite its international commitments," said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Under President Xi Jinping, the human rights situation has rapidly deteriorated." She called on the international community to exert more pressure on China to comply with universal standards of human rights and release wrongfully imprisoned dissidents, including Wang Dan.

Wang Lingyun says at his advanced age, he worries he may not see his son free again. But he says Wang Dan's unwavering principles give him solace. "My son is a moral crusader who has sacrificed for what he believes in," he said. "That gives me comfort even in spite of the immense suffering. Right will prevail in the end."
