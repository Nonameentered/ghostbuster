China's War on Destitution Falls Short of Absolute Poverty Target: Analysts

Beijing, Chinaâ€”The Chinese government has announced its progress in tackling extreme poverty across the country, stating that poverty rates have dropped from nearly 100 million people in 2012 to 5.51 million in 2019. However, independent analysts question whether China has truly achieved its goal of eliminating absolute poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. 

According to official Chinese government statistics, extreme poverty has been all but eradicated across China, especially in rural areas. Massive government investments in infrastructure, education, and social programs in poor and rural areas have helped lift millions out of extreme poverty. The government claims it has achieved its goal of eliminating absolute poverty, set by President Xi Jinping in 2015 to uplift all citizens above the poverty line by 2020.

However, economists and China experts outside the country argue that China's official poverty statistics paint too rosy a picture. They say the government's poverty line is too low and does not account for the actual cost of basic necessities in China today. "The government's threshold for poverty is not credible and far from what poverty means in a middle-income country like China," said Mary Kay Magistad, an expert on China and author of "The Great Wall of Debt." She said basic costs of living in China are higher than the government's official poverty thresholds.

Independent organizations that study poverty in China say the actual poverty rates could be higher than the official statistics suggest. Researchers at the Brookings Institution estimate that poverty in China is more accurately around 14% if measured at higher thresholds, while the UN Development Programme sets the threshold at around $5.50 a day for upper-middle income countries like China. Using these higher poverty lines, China still likely has between 80 to 200 million citizens living in poverty.
