China and Japan Expected to Finalize Agreement on Huge Yen Loans Despite Political Tensions 

China and Japan are expected to finalize an agreement this week to provide cheap yen loans for infrastructure projects across Asia, according to officials from both governments. The deal would mark a step forward in economic cooperation between the two countries despite ongoing political tensions.

Under the agreement, Japan's government will provide hundreds of billions of yen in low-interest loans that will be used by China to finance railways, power plants, and other infrastructure projects in developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia and South Asia. The loans carry interest rates as low as 0.25% and repayment periods of up to 30 years. 

The deal highlights the complex economic relationship between China and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world, respectively. On the one hand, the two countries are fierce economic rivals and Japan sees China’s growing influence as a threat. However, their economies have become deeply intertwined over the decades, with China serving as Japan’s largest trading partner and a major destination for Japanese investment.

“There are few countries with which we have as paradoxical a relationship as the one we have with China,” said Ichiro Miyashita, a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation. “Geopolitically, we distrust and even resent each other. But economically, we cannot do without each other.”

The yen loan deal has been under discussion for several years but stalled repeatedly due to political conflicts over territory and historical issues. It now appears back on track, with the final details of the agreement set to be worked out during a meeting between Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhide Suga at a summit in Tokyo on Wednesday. 

The agreement comes at a time when China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative is facing criticism over lack of transparency, unsustainable debt levels, and questionable effectiveness. By relying on yen loans provided by Japan, China can finance projects that provide economic benefits but without taking on as much financial risk or scrutiny. At the same time, Japan ensures that its currency remains an important part of global finance and gains more visibility and influence in emerging markets.
