Chinese President Jiang Zemin Calls for Tougher Action Against Corruption as it Threatens the Destiny of the Nation and Communist Party   

Beijing, China - In a stern warning to officials, Chinese President Jiang Zemin called for tougher measures to curb rampant corruption that he said is threatening the destiny of the nation and the Communist Party. 

"Corruption is undermining the solidarity of the party and threatens its existence," Jiang said in a speech to top government, Communist Party and military officials. "We must make unremitting efforts to combat corruption." 

Jiang said corruption has spread throughout government bureaucracies, state-run companies and the military. He warned that failure to curb graft posed a major threat to the rule of the Communist Party, which has governed China since 1949. Analysts say corruption is endemic in China's authoritarian system due to lack of political reforms and media freedom. They add that corruption has become institutionalized in the country. Factionalism and cronyism within the Communist Party have also fueled corruption.

The president's warning comes amid several high-profile corruption scandals this year that have tarnished the Communist Party's image. Last week, the head of China's largest oil refinery was accused of stealing and abusing power, while reports earlier this year charged that military leaders made money through illegal arms sales. There were also widespread accounts of officials pilfering state aid sent to areas hit hard by floods this summer.

"Corruption has caused severe damage to the flesh and blood of the people," Jiang said. "We must mobilize all forces and adopt strong measures to overcome this problem."  

Jiang pledged to intensify a three-year drive against corruption that began last year and called on Chinese to report corrupt officials. But he gave no specifics on new anti-graft measures. Critics argue that China needs greater government transparency, an independent judiciary and less Communist Party intervention to properly combat corruption.

Jiang's comments reflect the leadership's fears that corruption and a perceived widening gap between rich and poor could undermine the Communist Party's grip on power. Tackling corruption is crucial to maintaining social stability in China amid major economic and political transitions.
