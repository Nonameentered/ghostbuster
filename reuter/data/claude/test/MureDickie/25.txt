Britain and China to Share Symbolic Embrace at Hong Kong Handover Ceremony  

HONG KONG — Britain and China will orchestrate a carefully choreographed set of symbolic gestures here at midnight Thursday to seal Hong Kong's transfer from British to Chinese rule after 150 years of colonial administration. 

Prince Charles, representing Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, will join Chinese President Jiang Zemin for a ceremony to lower the British colonial flag for the last time and raise the red flag of the People's Republic of China to mark the start of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong.

The ritualistic transfer of authority, to be held at Victoria Harbor in front of dignitaries from both nations, is meant to highlight a peaceful and seamless transition of power. But beneath the pomp and circumstance, tensions have built up over perceived threats to Hong Kong's political and economic freedoms under Chinese rule.

Many Hong Kong residents worry that China will not honor its pledge to allow Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system and political liberties for 50 years after the handover under the "one country, two systems" formula agreed between Britain and China. Mr. Jiang, who will tour Hong Kong for three days of lavish celebrations and fireworks shows before the handover, has sought to reassure residents that Beijing will not interfere in the territory's affairs.

"Hong Kong people can be at ease," Mr. Jiang said on Wednesday. "The central government will strictly honor its promise — 'one country, two systems,' 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy."

Still, in the days leading up to the handover, Britain and China have frequently found themselves at odds and trading rhetorical barbs over Hong Kong. Disputes have included the pace of democratic reform in Hong Kong and Britain's plan to award hundreds of former colonial officials British passports as a safeguard after the handover.

The strained exchanges highlighted the fact that Britain had little choice but to accede to Chinese demands for the return of Hong Kong, a global financial hub. Prime Minister Tony Blair, who did not travel to Hong Kong for the handover ceremonies, said in London on Wednesday that although Britain had concerns about threats to civil liberties in Hong Kong, "we have to recognize that in the end, this was Chinese territory handed over to Britain for a period of time."

With tensions in the backdrop, Britain and China aimed for an appearance of bonhomie at the handover. The ceremony was expected to be a highly symbolic show of concord and continuity, with Chinese soldiers receiving control of Victoria Harbor from British forces in a precisely coordinated set of movements. The theme, organizers said, would be "a smooth transition and a gradual process of familiarization" — sturdy principles on which Hong Kong's future as a Chinese territory will stand or falter.
