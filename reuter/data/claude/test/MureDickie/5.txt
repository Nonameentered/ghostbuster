China No Longer Cares About Joining WTO, Says Senior Customs Official

Beijing, China—In an interview today, a senior official from China's General Administration of Customs expressed indifference toward China's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), signaling a major shift in China's attitude. "WTO membership is no longer a priority or concern for China," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "When China joined the WTO in 2001, it was eager to integrate into the global trading system. But now China has grown into an economic superpower and WTO membership is more of an afterthought."

China's accession to the WTO was a watershed moment that helped propel its economic rise. WTO membership gave China access to key export markets and the opportunity to attract foreign investment. In exchange, China agreed to liberalize its economy and adhere to WTO trade rules. But China's stance appears to have changed as its economy has grown into the world's second largest. "China's leaders no longer see the WTO as essential for China's economic growth," the official said. "They are now more focused on China's domestic market and regional trade pacts like the Belt and Road Initiative."

If China is disregarding its WTO commitments, it could pose challenges for the global trading system and China's trading partners. There have long been concerns that China has not fully implemented its WTO obligations, on issues such as agriculture, services, and intellectual property protection. "This cavalier attitude toward the WTO is worrying and reflects China's turn toward economic nationalism," said Mary Lovely, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "It doesn't bode well for future cooperation."

However, not all analysts viewed the official's comments as a major cause for alarm. Some considered it a statement of China's confidence in its own economic strength, rather than outright rejection of the WTO. A professor at Beijing University said, "China still values WTO membership, but it wants greater recognition of its status as one of the world's biggest traders." The official also put the comments in perspective, acknowledging that they reflected his personal view. In an email, a WTO spokesperson said the organization will continue working with China as one of its members.

Still, the remarks are symbolic of China's growing confidence—some might say overconfidence—on the global stage. Facing a slowing economy and competition from the US, China appears determined to chart its own course. Its attitude toward the WTO seems to mirror its relationships with other multinational bodies: eager to reap the benefits but increasingly dismissive of the rules and norms. As China flexes its economic might, WTO membership may mean less to China but still matter a great deal for the rest of the world.
