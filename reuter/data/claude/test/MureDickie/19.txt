China Boasts Successful Economic Growth and Inflation Control in 1996, Predicts Even Better for 1997 

Beijing, Chinaâ€”In a year-end press conference, Chinese Premier Li Peng announced that China's economy grew by 9.7% in 1996 while inflation remained under control at 8.3%. The growth rate was slightly higher than the 9.5% target set by the government at the beginning of 1996, marking the fourth year in a row that China exceeded its economic growth goals. Premier Li credited government policies focused on developing the private sector and increasing foreign trade and investment.

China's rapid economic growth has been fueled largely by massive infrastructure investments and booming exports. In 1996, China's exports grew by 31% to $148 billion, helping the country achieve its first trade surplus in a decade. Foreign direct investment in China reached $40 billion in 1996, up 15% from last year. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has poured money into railways, roads, airports and other infrastructure projects. This has spurred growth in industries like steel, cement and transportation equipment. 

While rapid growth is welcome news, China continues to struggle with worries over inflation, declining agricultural growth, and loss of state-owned enterprises. Inflation was kept under the government's 8% target in 1996 but food prices rose over 18% in some months due to flooding in central and southern China. Growth in agriculture slowed to 2.1% in 1996, down from 4.2% in 1995. And China's state-owned enterprises continued to suffer losses, requiring government bailouts and leading to layoffs of millions of workers.

Looking ahead to 1997, Premier Li said that China is aiming for economic growth of 9-10% while holding inflation to 8%. New policies will focus on boosting domestic consumer demand, supporting the private sector, reforming state-owned enterprises, and opening up more areas of the economy to foreign participation. If successful, China could achieve its goals of doubling both GDP and exports in the decade since 1990. 

However, many challenges remain. The government will have to continue the slow process of reforming and restructuring inefficient state-owned enterprises which still represent half of China's industrial output. It will also need to find ways to boost growth in agriculture and curb excess rural labor. On the trade front, China's growing surplus may lead to tensions with trading partners like the United States. And the government will have to show it can keep growth strong while maintaining control of any inflationary pressures in the economy.

Overall, China's strong economic performance in 1996 cements its status as an emerging economic powerhouse. But as its stellar growth catches eyes around the world, all eyes will be watching closely to see if China can continue its hot pace into 1997 and beyond. The coming year may prove whether China's leaders have truly found a recipe for sustaining high growth and controlling inflation in the long run.
