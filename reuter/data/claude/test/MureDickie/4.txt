China Criticizes WTO for Neglecting Poorer Nations, Expresses Frustration in Accession Bid 

BEIJING â€” China sharply criticized the World Trade Organization today for failing to adequately support developing countries and reform its practices, saying the organization was in danger of losing relevance if it did not change.

In strongly worded remarks, China's ambassador to the W.T.O. accused the body of "neglecting the majority of its members" by focusing too much on the interests of wealthier nations. He said years of efforts by China to gain W.T.O. membership had left it with "deep frustrations" about the organization's processes.

The comments, in a speech at the W.T.O.'s headquarters in Geneva, signaled China's most pointed public criticism of the body to date. China has sought to join the W.T.O. for 15 years but has struggled to gain approval from existing members suspicious of China's economic policies and concerned about competition from Chinese exports.

Ambassador She Chaoting said the W.T.O. had failed to make headway on issues of importance to developing countries like improved market access, reduced agricultural subsidies, and greater flexibility in intellectual property rules. He urged the body to "re-examine some of the assumptions and practices that have guided its work" and make developing countries a higher priority. 

China's criticisms echo those of other developing nations that say the W.T.O. caters primarily to Western interests while paying little heed to poorer members with limited ability to influence negotiations. The speech comes as China faces another setback in its lengthy W.T.O. accession process, with key members demanding further economic concessions before allowing China to join.

If changes are not made, Mr. She warned, the W.T.O. risked "continued erosion of its credibility and authority as an institution for multilateral trade governance." He said many developing countries already saw the W.T.O. as "irrelevant or even harmful to their development interests."

The speech highlighted China's frustration with its unsuccessful W.T.O. bid but also signaled its desire for a more powerful voice for developing countries within the organization, a role China could take on if admitted. China's leaders view W.T.O. membership as necessary for continued economic reforms and integration, despite the criticisms voiced today.
