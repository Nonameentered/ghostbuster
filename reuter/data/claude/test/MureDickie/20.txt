China Struggles with Huge Stockpiles of Unwanted Goods from State-Owned Firms

China is facing a massive problem of surplus goods accumulating in warehouses nationwide. Goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars have piled up in storage due to overproduction by state-owned enterprises and slowing domestic demand. The excess inventory includes everything from steel and coal to cars and apartments.  

According to the China National Bureau of Statistics, steel inventory held by traders in early 2019 was the highest since 2012. The steel sector is dominated by state-owned firms that were encouraged to expand production to support China's economic growth targets. But demand has slowed due to a cooling economy and a drop in infrastructure projects. The resulting steel oversupply has sent prices plunging, hurting private steelmakers.

In the coal industry, miners are struggling with the highest level of unsold inventory in a decade. Coal stockpiles at Qinhuangdao port, one of China's largest coal handling ports, reached a record high recently. The oversupply has dampened coal prices, putting pressure on state-run coal mines.  

In the auto sector, a sharp slowdown in car sales growth has left dealers with the highest level of vehicle inventory in five years. State-owned automakers continued boosting production even as demand fell due to the end of tax incentives for green-energy vehicles and slowing economic growth.  

 Similar situations of surplus apartments, aluminum, solar panels, and other goods produced by state-owned enterprises also abound. Analysts say the stockpiling underscores the inefficiencies of China's state-run economic model that prioritizes growth over supply-demand dynamics. They argue the government must curb overinvestment, upgrade technology, and increase consumer demand to address this issue. Otherwise, China could face a prolonged period of deflation and economic stagnation. Overall, tackling excess capacity and reducing unwanted inventory poses a major challenge as China navigates significant economic headwinds and mounting trade tensions with the United States.
