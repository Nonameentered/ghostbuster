China to Retain Controls on Grain Prices Despite Market Reform, Says Official Media  

China will retain government controls over the price and purchase of key agricultural commodities like grain even as it moves toward allowing greater play of market forces in its economy, the official Xinhua News agency reported on Monday. The government will not remove its role in “important areas related to national food security and major livelihood issues,” Xinhua quoted Han Jun, director of the Office of the Central Rural Work Leading Group, as saying. 

The assurance comes as China is expected to continue opening its economy to market forces at its upcoming Third Plenum meeting of the Communist Party leadership in November. However, in strategic sectors like agriculture, the government aims to balance market reform with ensuring supply and stable prices. “We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, insist on the dominant role of public ownership, and continuously strengthen the vitality, control and influence of the state-owned economy,” Han said.

China's grain markets have long been dominated by state-controlled stockpiling and pricing systems. controls include a minimum support price for rice and wheat to protect farmers' incomes, and government purchases and sales to regulate supplies. But the system has led to huge stockpiles and distorted pricing incentives. China is the world's top wheat and rice producer, and stable supplies and pricing are seen as crucial to social stability.

Some modest price reforms have been trialed, like allowing limited price movements within government-set bands. But most controls will remain, Xinhua indicated. "In the agricultural product pricing mechanism reform, we must adhere to the thinking of 'controlling price well and stabilizing expectations,' implement differentiated policies, proceed steadily, stabilize the scale and speed of reform," Han said.

Pro-reform economists argue China's grain markets would benefit from transparent, market-based pricing and reduced government intervention. But any major overhaul of the current system is unlikely as food security remains a top priority for the Communist leadership. According to the Xinhua report, China aims to keep inflation low and agriculture stable ahead of leadership changes at a Communist Party congress next year. So, despite bold pledges of market reform, grain price liberalization looks set to be a very long-term proposition.
