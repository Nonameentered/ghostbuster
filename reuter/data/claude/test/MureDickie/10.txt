Burmese Minister Urges Japan to Release Multi-Billion Yen Loan Suspended After Democracy Suppression, Japanese Officials Remain Cautious About Lending  

The Minister for International Cooperation of Myanmar urged Japan this week to release billions of dollars in suspended loan funds for infrastructure projects. The loan was frozen in February 2021 after the Myanmar military seized power in a coup and violently cracked down on pro-democracy protests. 

“We request the Japanese government to understand the current situation in Myanmar and reconsider the suspension of official development assistance (ODA) and resume projects that will benefit the people,” said U Ko Ko Hlaing, the minister, during a visit to Tokyo. The minister claimed the situation in Myanmar had “stabilized” and Japanese investment in infrastructure and development programs should resume.

However, Japanese officials signaled they remain skeptical about restoring funding and support for the military junta that took control in February. A spokesperson for Japan’s Foreign Ministry said the violent suppression of dissent and anti-democratic actions by the junta were “deeply concerning.” The spokesperson said Japan continues to urge Myanmar authorities to “promptly restore the democratic political system and release political detainees including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.”

The suspended Japanese loan funds amount to $528 million to modernize Myanmar’s power grid and develop an industrial park. Japan is Myanmar’s largest creditor and has provided billions in loans and grants over the past decade to support Myanmar’s transition to democracy. However, that transition was abruptly halted by the military coup earlier this year.

In response to the coup, Japan suspended all new ODA to Myanmar in February. The loan disbursements were stopped, even for existing projects like the power and industrial infrastructure programs that the Myanmar minister is now urging Japan to resume. 

Pro-democracy activists argue that resuming any funding or support for the junta at this point would only serve to legitimize their illegal seizure of power. They say Japan and other democratic nations should maintain pressure on the military through sanctions and by withholding financial support. Only when the junta releases political prisoners, ends suppression of dissent, and restores democratic rule would it make sense for foreign governments to resume partnerships and funding, the activists contend.

The Myanmar minister is continuing his visit to Tokyo this week to meet with other Japanese officials. However, given the strong concerns voiced about the situation in Myanmar, it appears unlikely his requests for the release of suspended loan funds will be granted at this time without concrete actions by the junta to reverse course and restore democratic norms. Overall, Japan and other nations seem poised to keep the pressure on the military regime through economic and diplomatic penalties until real progress is made.
