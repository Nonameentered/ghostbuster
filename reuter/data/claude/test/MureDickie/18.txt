China's Economy Maintains Strong Growth and Low Inflation in 1996 with Predicted Improvement in 1997 

China's economy continued its rapid growth in 1996 while keeping inflation low, according to official government figures released today. Gross domestic product grew by 9.6% for the year, down slightly from 10.2% growth in 1995 but still a very strong pace. Inflation remained subdued at 4.9% for consumer prices and 2.8% for wholesale prices.

The government reported strong performances across most sectors of the economy. Industrial production rose 11.7% for the year, retail sales grew 12.5%, and fixed asset investment increased 16.3%. Growth was particularly rapid in the services sector, which expanded by 12.2% as China's middle class grows in size and affluence. Agricultural growth lagged at 4.0% due to some flooding during the year, though grain output still increased modestly.

Foreign trade was a bright spot, with exports up 19.7% and imports growing 15.5%. The resulting $41 billion trade surplus has led to calls from China's trading partners like the United States for China to increase imports and balance trade relations. However, China maintains that its trade policies follow international norms. Direct foreign investment in China grew 9.3% to $41.7 billion, showing that China remains an attractive destination for multinational corporations.

Government officials predict economic performance will improve further in 1997, with GDP growth accelerating to 10% and inflation declining to 4%. The government has set a target of quadrupling GDP from 1980 levels by 2000, so continued rapid growth this decade is a high priority. An loosening of policy-guided interest rates and an expansion of the private sector should support increased market forces in the economy. Strong growth and stable prices in 1996 demonstrate China's ability to sustain rapid economic progress during transition to a more open, modern economy. Overall, China remains on course to become the world's largest economy within the next several decades if current trends continue.
