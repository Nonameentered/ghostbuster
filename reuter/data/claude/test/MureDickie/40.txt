Washington and China Negotiate Textile Accord Before Friday Deadline 

Representatives from the United States and China met in Beijing this week for two days of intensive negotiations as they work to finalize a new textile trade agreement before temporary quotas on China's textile exports expire on Friday. Failure to reach an agreement by the deadline could disrupt the $300 billion global textile trade and worsen tensions between the two economic giants.

The talks are focused on setting new quotas on the flood of low-cost Chinese textile and apparel imports into the U.S. market. The current deal, which limits growth of Chinese textile imports to between 7.5 to 8 percent annually, expires on December 31. U.S. manufacturers have pushed for much tighter curbs on Chinese imports, citing a surge of low-cost imports that they claim threaten hundreds of thousands of American jobs. However, retailers in both countries are urging negotiators to adopt a moderate agreement that would not disrupt supply chains or raise consumer prices.

There were signs of progress in the talks as negotiations extended late into the evening on Wednesday at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. A spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce said “useful discussions” were held on issues like export licensing procedures, quota flexibility, and ways to curb circumvention of any new limits. However, key differences remain over the level of growth in quotas for next year and the product coverage of any deal, suggesting a final breakthrough could come down to last-minute concessions or compromises.

"Both sides have shown flexibility and pragmatism,” a spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. “However, a number of complex issues remain unresolved and difficult decisions still must be made if we are to reach an agreement." The talks are ongoing and negotiators plan to meet into the evening as the Friday deadline looms, the spokesperson added.

Failure to reach a new agreement by the deadline would remove all quotas from Chinese textile exports, threatening a surge of imported clothing, textiles and other goods that U.S. manufacturers argue would destroy thousands of American jobs. However, retailers contend that eliminating quotas would provide more flexibility and potentially lower costs, savings that could be passed on to consumers. In China, exporters are also hoping for an end to restrictions but the government is anxious to avoid tensions that could worsen the U.S.-China trade deficit.   

The two sides have a history of contentious negotiations over the textile trade but also a track record of ultimately reaching a compromise. Analysts said an agreement remains the most likely outcome this week as well, although the final package may depend heavily on concessions granted at the last moment. Both governments face domestic pressures, but also have an incentive to avoid a trade conflict that could damage economic ties between the two nations. With the clock ticking down, all eyes are on the negotiators in Beijing working to cut through differences and find common ground. A final handshake and deal announcement could come as late as midnight on Friday if sides remain willing to keep the talks alive until the last possible moment.
