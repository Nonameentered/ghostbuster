China Makes Yuan Convertible Under Current Account: Analysts Urge Caution on Full Convertibility Goal  

The People's Bank of China announced today that the yuan is now fully convertible under the current account, a significant milestone toward China's broader goal of making the yuan a free-floating global reserve currency. The "current account convertibility"  means Chinese businesses and individuals can now freely convert the yuan into foreign currencies to pay for imports and investments abroad.   

While today's announcement was praised by government officials as an important step in China's financial reforms and modernization, some analysts urge caution regarding China's longer-term goal of full capital account convertibility. Under a fully convertible capital account, foreign individuals and businesses could also freely buy or sell yuan and Chinese investors could move money out of the country with few restrictions.  

"Full convertibility would require significant structural changes to China's economy and financial system," said Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics. "China's financial markets would need to open up to foreign investors and proper risk pricing would have to take hold. The yuan would also have to float freely against other currencies.”

The yuan is currently allowed to trade within a narrow daily range around a midpoint set by the central bank. Letting it float freely could make China's financial system more vulnerable to external shocks and currency attacks. China's economy would also have to undergo market-oriented reforms to make it more globally competitive and integrated.

While China has taken meaningful steps to open up its current account, including lifting most capital controls on trade and FDI inflows, its capital account remains only partially convertible due to restrictions on portfolio investment and outflows. Foreign holdings of yuan-denominated assets are also limited.      

Today's milestone shows China's ambition to raise the global status of its currency. But full convertibility of the capital account remains years down the road. The pace of progress depends on China's financial reforms and the yuan's acceptance on global financial markets as a stable and widely traded currency. As Williams noted, "The timeline for full convertibility is long and uncertain.” 

For China, the rewards of its convertibility goals are high, but so too are the risks of moving too far too fast. Striking a balance between ambition and caution will be key to China's road ahead in internationalizing the yuan.
