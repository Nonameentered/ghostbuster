Hainan Airlines to Buy 10 Boeing Airliners in Major Fleet Expansion

Hainan Airlines, China’s fourth largest carrier by fleet size, announced today that it will purchase 10 Boeing 787-9 airliners. The deal, valued at $2.7 billion at list prices, signals Hainan Airlines’ ambitions to expand its international long-haul routes and boost its domestic operations.

Hainan Airlines currently operates an all-Boeing fleet of over 200 aircraft, including Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Boeing 737s. The additional 787-9 planes will join the carrier’s existing fleet of 20 Dreamliners in service or on order. The advanced aircraft are ideally suited for Hainan Airlines’ route network spanning over 130 destinations in Asia, Europe, the South Pacific, the Middle East, and North America.

“The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has been a cornerstone of Hainan Airlines’ success over the past decade,” said Adam Zhu, Chief Executive Officer of Hainan Airlines. “These additional airplanes will allow us to develop new international routes, increase frequencies on existing routes, and provide an upgraded experience for our passengers.” 

Boeing’s 787-9 is the larger of the two variants in the Dreamliner family. The plane can accommodate up to 280 passengers and has a range of 6,430 nautical miles, enabling direct flights between cities across the Pacific Ocean. Hainan’s configuration will have 302 seats, with 30 in business class and 272 in economy. Deliveries of the 10 new planes will begin in 2020 and wrap up in 2022.

Hainan Airlines has experienced rapid international expansion in recent years, launching new routes from its base in Haikou and Beijing to cities such as Dublin, Tel Aviv, and Calgary. The government of Hainan Province has also invested in infrastructure to boost tourism, including the construction of two new airports. Hainan Airlines will likely deploy some of the new 787-9s on domestic routes to cater to growing travel within China.    

“We are honored that Hainan Airlines, a pioneering Dreamliner operator, has once again placed its confidence in the 787,” said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s senior vice president of Commercial Sales & Marketing. “These additional airplanes will enable Hainan Airlines to tap into new opportunities and boost operating efficiency for the benefit of both the airline and its passengers.”

With today’s announcement, Hainan Airlines’ total order with Boeing now stands at over 230 aircraft valued at $25 billion at list prices. The deal reflects the two companies’ longstanding partnership and will support tens of thousands of jobs at Boeing, its supplier partners, and the broader aviation industry. For China and Hainan Province, the new aircraft will facilitate business and trade, help drive tourism, and boost economic growth.
