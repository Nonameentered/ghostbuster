Chinese lawmakers want tighter control over armed forces through new defence legislation  

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's lawmakers are seeking tighter civilian control of the military through proposed legislation that would strengthen the role of the Central Military Commission, the military's top decision-making body, in mobilizing troops and handling national security.

The draft laws, released on Sunday ahead of the annual meeting of parliament next month, come as China modernizes its forces, including building stealth fighters and aircraft carriers, while strengthening its presence in the disputed South China Sea.

President Xi Jinping, who heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), has repeatedly called for the armed forces' absolute loyalty and has pushed for greater combat readiness. 

The proposed changes include provisions for the CMC to control mobilization of the military's assets in war or emergencies, and to oversee training and forces stationed overseas, according to the draft released on the National People's Congress website. 

It would also give the CMC more control over military logistics and procurement. China's military has been an increasingly assertive force in the region, though it has had limited combat experience since a war with Vietnam in 1979.

"These types of revisions essentially ensure and legally bind the military and its activities to the leadership and control of the CMC," said Joel Wuthnow, a research fellow at the National Defense University in Washington.

The proposed changes address worries about "the military running out of control or not being responsive enough", Wuthnow told Reuters. "It highlights the People's Liberation Army's status as a 'party army' subordinate to the authority of the CPC". The CMC is headed by Xi and controls the military. China's president had traditionally only held the position of CMC chairman after retiring. But Xi usurped power and retained the chairmanship even after stepping down from the presidency in 2023.

The draft laws come weeks after a top-level military-civilian meeting called for the army to follow the "absolute leadership" of the Communist Party. Recent years have seen Xi issuing a series of directives to the military to build combat readiness and forge a more integrated joint command. 

The new laws also proposed establishing a State Supervision Commission to oversee all public servants, including military personnel, and fighting corruption. Xi launched an aggressive anti-graft campaign targeting the military in 2015.

The draft legislation will be formally submitted during the annual meeting of parliament opening on March 5, and will then go through two rounds of voting before being finalized.
