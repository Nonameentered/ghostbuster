Tsingtao Brewery, China's "King of Beers", faces threat from foreign beer makers eating into market share 

Tsingtao Brewery, China's largest and most well-known beer maker, is facing intense competition from foreign brands that are gaining popularity in the country. Tsingtao, which was founded in 1903 and produces China's most popular beer, has long dominated the domestic market. However, recent years have seen major international brands from Europe and the Americas gain mainstream acceptance in China and capture market share from Tsingtao.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and maker of Budweiser, has invested heavily in China in recent years. Brewers like Carlsberg and Heineken have also expanded their footprint in China. These foreign brands are seen as premium, high-quality products by Chinese consumers and demand has surged, especially among younger and more affluent customers. According to market research firm Euromonitor International, Tsingtao's market share in China has declined from about 50% in 2000 to 36% today. Over the same period, AB InBev's share has climbed to 15% and Heineken's to 5%. 

The foreign competition poses an existential threat to Tsingtao, which relies on China for the vast majority of its sales and profits. In response, Tsingtao has launched new premium beer brands and improved the quality of its flagship brand to match foreign rivals. It has also tried to emphasize its long history and status as an iconic Chinese brand. However, Chinese consumers increasingly see foreign brands as higher status, despite Tsingtao's efforts to promote national pride in its brand.

Some analysts argue that Tsingtao's position is still strong and that there is room for multiple players in China's huge beer market, which is the world's largest in terms of volume. Tsingtao continues to dominate lower-tier cities and more rural markets in China. Its brand also remains very popular with older consumers who have lifetime loyalty to the brand. 

However, China's beer market is slowing overall, as younger consumers drink less than older generations. And foreign brands are making inroads into lower-tier cities. With sales under threat at home, Tsingtao is expanding overseas, including in other Asian countries as well as the United States and Canada. But international sales still make up only a tiny fraction of its revenue. As foreign rivals continue their surge, Tsingtao faces difficult times ahead in defending its status as China's long-time "King of Beers". The next few years could determine whether it fends off the competition or sees its dominant position eclipsed.
