China Tells Clinton Not to Worry About Human Rights and Hong Kong's Future Freedoms  

China's foreign minister Wang Yi yesterday told visiting former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that she should not worry about human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, and that China and the Hong Kong government will ensure the city's stability and prosperity. 

Secretary Clinton met with Wang Yi and State Councilor Yang Jiechi in Beijing, where the top Chinese diplomats communicated in no uncertain terms that China views Hong Kong as an internal affair. "Hong Kong's situation and China's human rights issues are China's internal affairs," Wang told reporters after the meeting. "Mrs. Clinton expressed certain concerns about Hong Kong's situation. I told her those worries are unnecessary."

Wang's comments came after months of protests in Hong Kong over a controversial extradition bill and police conduct, and just weeks after pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory in local district council elections. The election results were seen as a rebuke of the extradition bill and support for the ongoing pro-democracy movement.

Secretary Clinton has previously expressed support for the pro-democracy movement and warned China not to crack down on civil liberties in Hong Kong. Her meeting with top Chinese officials marked her first visit to China since losing the 2016 US presidential election to Donald Trump. She was in Beijing partially on behalf of her foundation, the Clinton Foundation, to discuss collaborative projects between the foundation and Chinese partners.

While China seeks to reassure the international community, protesters in Hong Kong remain defiant and suspicious of Chinese promises to uphold civil liberties and the "one country, two systems" principle. "We cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party," said Bonnie Leung, a leader in the Civil Human Rights Front, a pro-democracy group that has organized several massive marches this year. "Secretary Clinton means well but she cannot ensure our freedoms and system of government in Hong Kong." The protesters say they will continue to demonstrate until the government meets their demands for direct elections and an independent investigation into police violence.
