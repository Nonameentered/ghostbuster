Chinese citizens petition leaders to take action against Japan in island dispute

Beijing, China—Thousands of Chinese citizens have signed an online petition calling on the Chinese government to take a tougher stance against Japan in an ongoing dispute over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.

The petition on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo urges Chinese leaders not to “show weakness” in the dispute with Japan over control of the Diaoyu Islands, which are known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan. Signatories accuse the Japanese government of “repeated provocations and aggression” by asserting control over the islands. 

The islands, composed of eight uninhabited rocks located about 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, have been claimed by both China and Japan for decades. While Japan currently administers and occupies the islands, China also claims sovereignty over them. Tensions have escalated in recent years, with both countries increasing patrols of navy and coast guard ships in the waters surrounding the islands.

“We vehemently protest the Japanese government’s behavior in stealing Chinese territory and threatening Chinese sovereignty,” the petition reads. “The Chinese people will not accept showing weakness or compromising on issues of national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

The petition has garnered more than 50,000 signatures so far, indicating the strength of nationalist sentiment around the issue. Public anger toward Japan over its World War 2-era atrocities, as well as resentment of Japan's economic success since then, continue to shape attitudes in China today.

In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, "We have noted the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people regarding the Diaoyu Islands issue." However, he added, "we believe the best way to resolve the dispute is through dialogue and consultation between the two sides."

Analysts say while public pressure may encourage tougher rhetoric from Chinese officials, direct military action over the islands remains unlikely given the economic relationship between China and Japan, the world's second and third largest economies, respectively. Nonetheless, with tensions escalating, a miscalculation or accidental collision at sea remains a possibility that could swiftly bring the two sides into open conflict. If that were to happen, public pressure would likely mount for a forceful Chinese response.
