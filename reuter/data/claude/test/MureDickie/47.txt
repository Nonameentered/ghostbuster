China and the United States Avoid Trade War with Textile Deal Extension

The United States and China reached an agreement to extend a trade deal limiting Chinese textile exports to the U.S. on Wednesday, avoiding an escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

The extension of the deal, which limits growth of Chinese textile exports to 7.5 percent annually, comes a week before it was set to expire. U.S. textile manufacturers and China's huge textile industry  both praised the agreement to continue the restraints for another four years.

"This balanced agreement opens Chinese markets for U.S. textile exports and protects hundreds of thousands of U.S. textile jobs," the National Council of Textile Organizations said in a statement. 

Without the extension, the U.S. textile industry had warned China might flood U.S. markets with cheap textile and apparel goods, threatening over 600,000 U.S. jobs in the textile and broader manufacturing industries. China's exporters rely on the U.S. market for sales growth but face restraints aimed at calming fears China's low-cost producers will decimate U.S. textile producers.

The agreement "will continue to provide enhanced and stable market access reciprocity for our textile and apparel producers and workers over the next several years," U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a joint statement.

Chinese exports of clothing and textiles to the United States were worth $39 billion in 2017 according to Chinese customs data, accounting for more than one-third of total Chinese exports to the United States. Chinese clothing exports to the U.S. market have grown faster than other Chinese export products in recent years. The extension keeps in place a system of caps and quotas for textile shipments between the two economies first put in place in previous trade deals in the 1990s and updated several times since.

While the trade deal fell short of completely eliminating restraints on China's exports, textile industry executives in both countries expressed optimism that the deal's extension signaled stability in the trading relationship between the United States and China amid ongoing tensions in other sectors. The agreement helps prevent a damaging trade war in a key industry, demonstrating that the two sides can still reach constructive deals on trade despite other disagreements.
