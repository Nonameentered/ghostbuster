Clinton's Commitment to Deeper Dialogue with China Reassures Beijing and Signals Changing Priorities for US Relations 

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton concluded a high-level visit to China this week, reassuring leaders in Beijing of the Obama administration's commitment to strengthening ties with China. In a speech at Peking University, Clinton spoke of deepening "strategic and economic dialogue" and partnership between the two nations on issues ranging from trade to climate change to nuclear nonproliferation in North Korea and Iran.

The conciliatory tone from Clinton signals a shift from the more hawkish stance toward China in recent years. The Bush administration often emphasized China as a strategic competitor and focused on contentious trade issues as well as human rights concerns. In contrast, Clinton repeatedly referred to the U.S. and China as "interdependent" on a range of political and economic matters. Her visit follows other gestures from President Obama, including delaying his initial meeting with the Dalai Lama, in an effort to placate China.

Analysts said Clinton's visit was well-received in Beijing after a series of missteps in U.S.-China relations over the last year. Her first trip to China as Secretary of State in February 2009 was overshadowed by a confrontational stance from Obama on trade imbalances. The two nations also sparred publically over the level of China's currency manipulation and its contribution to the global financial crisis. Clinton's speech this week, however, emphasized "mutual understanding and mutual prosperity" between the Pacific powers. 

"Secretary Clinton's optimistic vision for U.S.-China relations was sorely needed and clearly welcomed by Beijing," said Michael Swaine, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Both sides realize the unwisdom in taking on China as a foil or scapegoat for economic anxieties at home."

Still, Clinton did make limited criticisms of China during her visit, particularly on civil liberties and freedom of political dissent. At her university speech, she said "censorship should not be in any way accepted" and called on China to release jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo. Obama is facing pressure from human rights activists and some in Congress who argue he has not been forceful enough on rights dialogue with China. But for the most part, Clinton focused on a pragmatic engagement with Beijing to advance issues of mutual interest and benefit.

The response from China's leadership suggests a relaxation in what has often been a tense - if not outright confrontational - relationship with recent U.S. administrations. "A good start has been made by Secretary Clinton in dissolving misgivings and distrust between China and the United States," stated an editorial in the Global Times, a newspaper published by the Chinese Communist Party. If sustained, Clinton's multifaceted diplomacy with China could mark a new period of cooperation after years of suspicion and rivalry between the two global powers. Overall, her visit to Beijing signals a foreign policy approach more concentrated on results than rhetoric as the U.S. seeks to leverage China on complex global challenges.
