Moody's Warns Foreign Lenders of Unpredictable Response From China's Regulators in Case of Investment Trust House Default  

Moody's Investors Service issued a warning to foreign lenders about the unpredictable response that may come from China's regulators in the event of a default by one of the country's many investment trust companies. There are more than 70 such trusts in China with a combined $4.4 trillion in assets under management. These companies have fueled risk taking in China's bond market by borrowing money from foreign investors and domestic sources to invest in corporate bonds, stocks, real estate and other assets.  

The opaque nature of these investment trusts and the loosely regulated shadow banking system in China pose risks to investors, according to Moody's. If one of the larger trusts were to default, Chinese regulators may allow it to fail to instill more discipline in the market. However, they may also intervene to orchestrate a bailout and prevent wider contagion, Moody's said. The policy response is hard to predict given the Chinese government's competing priorities of controlling risk and maintaining financial stability.

The warning from Moody's comes as investment trusts have been able to borrow larger amounts at lower interest rates over the past two years. This has incentivized some trusts to take on more risk when investing the money, in search of higher returns. At the same time, trusts have loosened their own lending standards and provided money to riskier Chinese companies left out of the mainstream banking system.  

This brewing problem in China's shadow banking system poses a threat to global investors who have flocked to buy into Chinese financial assets in recent years. The default of an investment trust could undermine confidence in the Chinese market and lead to a broader selloff of stocks, bonds and other investments. However, the blowback may be limited to certain shadow banking channels if regulators are able to compartmentalize the response, according to Moody's. 

The ratings agency suggested foreign lenders analyze their level of exposure to China's investment trusts and consider diversifying into more regulated parts of the financial system. They also warned investors about the possible volatility that may emerge in China's capital markets if an investment trust stumbles into distress and authorities have to decide on the policy response with global implications.
