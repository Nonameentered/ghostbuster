China Uses UN Clout to Punish Countries Supporting Taiwan, Stalls Guatemalan Peace Process 

China flexed its diplomatic muscles this week by blocking Guatemala's bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council in retaliation for Guatemala's ongoing diplomatic ties with Taiwan. China views Taiwan as a province of China, while Taiwan operates as an independent democratic country. China demands that other countries choose diplomatic relations with either China or Taiwan, but not both.

Guatemala is one of only 15 countries in the world that still maintains official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China has long pressured Guatemala to cut ties with Taiwan but Guatemala has resisted. This week, China used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to block Guatemala's bid for a rotating two-year seat, a position Guatemala has long sought to raise its international standing. 

China's move is seen as an warning to other countries that if they support Taiwan diplomatically, China will act punitively. "This is obviously China flexing its muscle to discourage other countries like Guatemala from maintaining ties with Taiwan," said Dr. Elsa Chen of the Council on Foreign Relations. The veto draws sharp contrast with China's frequent calls for more representation of developing countries on the Security Council.

The move deals a blow to Guatemala's postwar reconciliation as well. Guatemala is still recovering from its 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996. Leaders saw a Security Council seat as an important step toward greater participation in the international community. China's veto inhibits that process and risks damaging its relationship with Guatemala. However, China shows no signs of softening its stance. Its state-run media said China acted to "defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity."  

Guatemala's leaders expressed disappointment at China's retaliatory actions but vowed to maintain their country's "sovereign right" to have diplomatic allies of its choosing. Taiwan also criticized China's "excessive actions" in interfering in relations with other countries. The dispute highlights how China's rise as a global superpower allows it to assert control over regions and politics even in parts of the world with long and complex histories far from China's own borders.
