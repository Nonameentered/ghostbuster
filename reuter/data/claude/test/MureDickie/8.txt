Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledges support for new Hong Kong leader's autonomy

Chinese President Jiang Zemin today pledged to support the autonomy of Hong Kong's new leader Tung Chee-hwa and his cabinet sworn in after Britain handed over control of the former colony to China after more than 150 years of rule.

In a ceremony featuring marching troops, Tung and his cabinet were installed following the midnight handover that marked the end of British rule. Tung, shipping tycoon, was elected after Jiang appointed a 400-member selection committee dominated by pro-Beijing business leaders and politicians. 

"The central government will support you and the Hong Kong special administrative region government in running Hong Kong well according to the Basic Law," Jiang told Tung in his first speech after the lavish handover ceremony. Jiang promised that China will respect Hong Kong's rule of law and freedom under the "one country, two systems" plan.

"We have full confidence in you and believe that, with the support of the central government and the people of the whole country, you will lead the Hong Kong special administrative region government to unite and lead Hong Kong residents to turn Hong Kong into an even more prosperous, progressive and stable society," he added.

The festive handover ceremony culminated a nearly two-decade transition that began with Sino-British negotiations in the early 1980s. Under the joint Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region under Chinese rule but retain its capitalist system and civil liberties for 50 years.

Tung will govern with a high degree of autonomy, with Beijing controlling only defense and foreign affairs. The business tycoon has vowed to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy, but pro-democracy activists remain concerned about potential erosions of civil liberties under Chinese rule.

In his first remarks as leader, Tung promised to defend Hong Kong's "liberty, human rights and rule of law." He said his administration's priorities would be maintaining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub, raising living standards, and improving education and the environment.

"Hong Kong people taking destiny into their own hands and fully mastering our future â€“ that is my dream," Tung proclaimed.
