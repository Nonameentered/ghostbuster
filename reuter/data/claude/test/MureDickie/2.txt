Yunnan Copper Industry Group to Boost China's Output of Non-Ferrous Metals 

The Yunnan Copper Industry Group announced plans this week to significantly expand production of non-ferrous metals including copper, lead, zinc and tin over the next five years. The state-owned enterprise, based in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, aims to increase copper output to 1 million metric tons per year by 2025, up 40% from current levels. This boost in production would help China gain control of key resources and reduce dependence on foreign imports.

China currently produces about 6-7 million metric tons of copper per year, but demand from sectors like electric vehicles, renewable energy and infrastructure has been rising steadily. The Yunnan expansion could go a long way in helping China meet its own internal needs while also supplying global markets. The increased production from Yunnan Copper Group, in China's southwest, would also support the development of poorer inland regions.  

The plan includes upgrading current mining and processing facilities as well as opening new mines. Yunnan Copper Group will invest $2.8 billion over the next three years to add 200,000 metric tons of copper production through expansions at the Dexing and Feiliang mines. An additional $4 billion will be invested from 2023 to 2025 to build a new 400,000-ton copper smelting works and matching sulphuric acid plant. New reserves have recently been discovered in Yunnan's Mangdong ore zone, which will feed additional future growth.

Yunnan Province holds rich deposits of copper, lead, zinc, tin, silver and other metals due to its diverse geology spanning several tectonic plates. However, infrastructure constraints and environmental concerns have limited mining activities in the past. Yunnan Copper Group's investments will include new and upgraded roads, water supply systems and emission control systems to address these challenges. The expansion plans also call for using more eco-friendly mining techniques and renewable energy sources like hydropower and solar to minimize the environmental footprint.
