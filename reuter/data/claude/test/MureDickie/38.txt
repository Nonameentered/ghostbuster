China has strongly condemned Taiwan's announcement that it plans to ship nuclear waste to North Korea for storage and disposal. A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said the plan poses serious environmental and safety risks and undermines stability on the Korean peninsula.

Taiwan's environmental protection minister unveiled the plan earlier this week, saying North Korea's remote geography and mountainous terrain make it an ideal location for permanently storing nuclear waste. In exchange, North Korea would receive technology and economic aid from Taiwan. 

However, China views Taiwan as a province of China and condemns any official exchanges between Taiwan and other countries. China also opposes any cooperation with North Korea that could strengthen the regime of Kim Jong Un. According to the foreign ministry spokesman, "This reckless plan will create unacceptable dangers and it violates international norms of nuclear safety and responsible waste management."

The plan has also received criticism from environmental groups and North Korea experts. Storing another country's nuclear waste could provide resources for North Korea's nuclear weapons program and normalizes its status as an international pariah, experts argue. However, Taiwan claims its planned facility would meet the highest safety standards and that the economic benefits would help improve conditions for citizens living under North Korea's repressive government.

Taiwan's president has not yet approved the plan, but environmental officials defend it as a solution to Taiwan's long struggle to find a site for permanent nuclear waste storage. Low public approval for nuclear power and Not In My Backyard opposition to nuclear waste sites have stymied previous efforts. The remote northern regions of Taiwan remain seismically active, raising concerns about safe long-term storage.

If approved, the nuclear waste facility in North Korea would open in 2030. Taiwan would cover all construction and operating costs for the facility, essentially outsourcing its nuclear waste problem but inviting wider geopolitical tensions in doing so. China has vowed to "resolutely block" the plan if Taiwan's government gives it the final go-ahead.
