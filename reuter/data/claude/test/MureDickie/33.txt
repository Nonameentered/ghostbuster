U.S. and Chinese Officials Productive in Last Chance Textile Trade Talks 

U.S. and Chinese trade representatives emerged today from three days of high-stakes negotiations over textile tariffs expressing optimism that a deal can be reached before punitive actions are taken by either side. However, key differences remain around intellectual property protections and market access that must still be bridged.

The talks were a last-ditch effort to avoid a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese textile imports that the Trump administration has threatened to impose if China does not agree to restrictions on subsidies and technology transfers that the U.S. claims violate international trade rules. China had promised retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods like soybeans if the textile tariffs take effect.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He led the negotiations, which also covered China's "Made in China 2025" plan to dominate high-tech industries like robotics and aerospace. The countries have been embroiled in a trade dispute over the plan, with the U.S. complaining that China uses unfair government subsidies and market restrictions to advance its technological ambitions.

"We have made progress, but we still have some outstanding issues," Lighthizer told reporters after the talks concluded. Liu echoed that view, saying, "We have a strong desire to reach an agreement and achieve win-win results. But we also recognize that there are still some relatively big differences on some issues." Liu said the countries would continue talking to try and resolve their differences before the deadline.

Key U.S. lawmakers urged the Trump administration to stand firm in demanding an end to China's allegedly unfair trade practices. "China needs to make significant structural reforms to open its market and change policies that have tilted the global trade playing field in its favor," said Rep. Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But others cautioned that a trade war would be damaging to both the U.S. and Chinese economies.

The two nations will now have until January 31 to continue negotiations in order to push back tariffs and avoid damaging a wide range of industries in both countries. The sense of urgency and lingering tensions suggest these final talks will be the true last chance for a breakthrough in the high-stakes trade dispute.
