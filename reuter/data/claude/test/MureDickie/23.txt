Microsoft Launches Chinese Version of Windows NT 4.0 to Enter China’s Growing Software Market  

Microsoft Corp. today launched a Chinese-language version of its Windows NT 4.0 operating system in China, marking the company’s latest attempt to gain a foothold in the world’s most populous nation. The Chinese version of Windows NT 4.0 comes amid rising personal computer sales and increasing software piracy in China.  

The Chinese version of Windows NT 4.0 includes simplified Chinese characters and other localized features like Chinese tax and accounting applications and Chinese input methods. Microsoft’s senior vice president estimates the Chinese software market will reach $4 billion by 2000, with Windows products accounting for about $1 billion. “China represents a massive market opportunity for Microsoft, and the launch of Windows NT 4.0 in Chinese is a milestone in our efforts to tap that potential,” he said at the launch event in Beijing.

However, Microsoft faces significant challenges in China, where software piracy is rampant and most computer users run unlicensed copies of Windows. A report last year found that 94% of Chinese computers had pirated or unlicensed software. Microsoft has launched an anti-piracy campaign and set up a Chinese research center to develop more localized products as a way to encourage Chinese consumers to use legitimate software. But low average incomes and lax enforcement of intellectual property laws will likely hamper those efforts.  

The Chinese government has also favored homegrown technology companies and standards. It has invested heavily in developing a Chinese operating system to rival Western products like Windows. That system, called Red Flag Linux, was developed by local tech companies with government backing. However, it has failed to gain widespread popularity due to limited software options and performance issues, according to analysts.  

Still, the launch of a localized Windows product shows Microsoft’s willingness to adapt to the Chinese market to gain a stronger position. The company opened its first office in China in 1992 and employs over 700 staffers across six cities in China, with more than 500 working in product development. Microsoft’s Asia-Pacific headquarters and main product localization and R&D centers are also located in China.  

Industry experts say Microsoft’s localized approach and long-term commitment to China will help the company eventually overcome some of the challenges. “Microsoft is in it for the long haul in China, and that persistence and localization strategy will pay off,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of tech consultancy BDA China. “Windows NT 4.0 in Chinese is an important next step that will boost Microsoft’s footprint in China and counter threats from domestic rivals as well as Linux.”
