China-U.S. Relations to Improve in 1997 Amid Lingering Tensions Over Taiwan, Trade, and Hong Kong Reversion, Say Analysts

Experts forecast improved diplomatic and economic relations between China and the United States in 1997, even as tensions persist over issues such as Taiwan, trade disputes, and the reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese control. According to regional analysts, both sides will look for opportunities to deepen cooperation amid an uncertain geopolitical landscape in Asia and rising economic interdependence between the world's two largest economies.  

China's leadership has signaled interest in stable ties with the U.S. ahead of a major Communist Party congress this fall that will usher in a new generation of senior leaders. The U.S., for its part, sees China as crucial to addressing global challenges such as nuclear proliferation and climate change. This convergence of interests will drive the two sides to manage their differences constructively, though flare-ups are likely on contentious issues.

Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint, as Beijing continues to claim the self-governing island as its own territory. China has warned of military action if Taiwan pursues independence, while the U.S. has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself. Most analysts do not foresee armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait this year but say miscalculation is a risk. On trade, the U.S. continues to push China to open its markets further and take stronger action on intellectual property violations. Failure to make progress could increase calls in Washington for punitive trade measures.

The impending handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China also looms as an area of uncertainty that could impact U.S.-China ties. China has pledged to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties after the handover. But any erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong would draw criticism from the U.S. and undermine confidence in China's commitments. Overall, however, analysts believe Beijing and Washington share an interest in a smooth political transition for Hong Kong.

In summary, while China and the U.S. will have to navigate some choppy waters in 1997, most experts forecast the relationship will continue to stabilize and strengthen on the whole. Close cooperation on issues of mutual interest and concern can help deepen trust and understanding despite differences on other frontsâ€”providing a buffer as the complex dynamics between the two global powers continue to unfold in the years to come.
