Former U.S. President George Bush calls for end to U.S. trade threats against China  

Houston, Texas (AP) - Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush spoke out today against the Trump administration's use of threats in the ongoing trade dispute with China. In a rare public statement, Bush warned that escalating tariff actions could damage long-term U.S.-China relations and the global economy.

Speaking at a conference on U.S.-China relations in Houston, Bush said "great relations between countries require reason, understanding, and cooperation, not threats or confrontation." While Bush acknowledged China has engaged in unfair trade practices, he argued that the current U.S. approach is "misguided" and "counterproductive."

The Trump administration has threatened to place tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports to the U.S. if China retaliates against the $34 billion in U.S. tariffs that went into effect last week. China has promised to respond in kind with its own tariffs. The tit-for-tat actions have raised the prospect of an all-out global trade war.

Bush said escalating the tensions will only lead to "damaged relationships between countries, less investment, and slower growth." He called on leaders of both countries to "engage in candid and constructive dialogue based on mutual understanding and friendship." Bush maintained close ties to China during his term in office from 1989 to 1993 and helped oversee China's emergence on the global stage after the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

In response, a Trump administration official defended the president's trade policies as necessary to counter unfair Chinese practices. "President Trump's approach aims to change China's behavior so that trade with China is fair, reciprocal, and balanced for American workers and companies," said the official. Supporters argue tariffs are needed to pressure China to stop forcing U.S. companies to share intellectual property and to curb subsidies for state-owned enterprises. 

However, critics argue tariffs will only raise costs for U.S. consumers and companies, while jeopardizing cooperation with China on other key issues like North Korea's nuclear program. There are also concerns China may retaliate by selling some of its large holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, which could drive up U.S. interest rates. The escalating trade tensions have already contributed to stock market volatility and slower growth forecasts.

Bush said in closing, "Great leadership requires wisdom, vision, and calmness, not strident words and empty threats." His comments were a rare public rebuke of a sitting president by a former member of his own party. Despite their opposing views on trade, Bush has avoided directly criticizing Trump in the past. At 92, Bush remains an influential voice but has limited his public speeches in recent years due to his age and health issues.
