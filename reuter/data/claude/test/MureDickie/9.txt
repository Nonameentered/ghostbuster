Chinese President Jiang Zemin Pledges Support for Future Hong Kong Leader Tung Chee-hwa in New Era

Hong Kong—In a show of support for the inaugural leader of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Chinese President Jiang Zemin promised Beijing's backing for Tung Chee-hwa today. Speaking at the official handover ceremony marking the end of British rule in Hong Kong, Jiang said the central government fully endorses Tung as the first chief executive of the HKSAR.

"The central government is confident that the future of Hong Kong led by Chief Executive Tung will be prosperous and thriving," Jiang declared. Tung, a shipping tycoon, was selected to become chief executive through a process overseen by a 400-member election committee earlier this year. His selection was criticized as lacking in genuine choice, but Tung has promised to defend Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties following the handover. 

In his speech at the ceremony, Tung said: "Hong Kong will continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy as promised. The rule of law, an independent judiciary, and the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people will be fully protected." Under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China with its own political and economic system separate from the mainland for 50 years after the handover.

Jiang expressed China's commitment to this principle in his speech. "The central government will strictly observe and loyally implement the principle of 'one country, two systems' proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping," Jiang said. He promised that Hong Kong's capitalist system and way of life would remain unchanged, and that China would "not interfere" in Hong Kong's internal affairs.

Britain formally handed over sovereignty of Hong Kong at midnight after more than 150 years of colonial rule. The handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Attended by dignitaries from China, Britain, and Hong Kong, the event marked the end of British rule with the lowering of the Union Jack flag.

In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain wishes Hong Kong well under Chinese sovereignty. "Britain has handed over responsibility for Hong Kong to China in good faith that China will honor the obligations to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life enshrined in the Joint Declaration," Cook said in a statement. The British handed Hong Kong island to China in 1842 after the First Opium War, and obtained a 99-year lease for the territory under the Treaty of Nanjing.  Britain agreed to return the entire colony upon the expiration of that lease in 1997.

China has regained control of the valuable financial hub following decades of negotiations and, at times, tensions with Britain over the handover terms. Hong Kong remains a critical entrepôt for global trade and finance. The city of 7 million people has a GDP of over $320 billion, with financial services, tourism, and trade contributing greatly to its economy. Under Chinese rule, Hong Kong is expected to continue to thrive as a leading business and cultural center in Asia given its strong institutions and rule of law. But uncertainty remains over how much interference from Beijing might be seen in years to come.
