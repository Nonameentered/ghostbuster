China Orders Two 747 Airliners from Boeing Ahead of US Congressional Visits 

China placed an order for two Boeing 747-8 aircraft this week, just days before Congressional delegations from the United States are set to visit Beijing. According to Boeing, China Eastern Airlines will take delivery of the two passenger jets in early 2021. The order is valued at $710 million at current list prices.

The order comes as relations between the US and China have become increasingly strained over trade and technology issues. However, the aerospace sector has been largely insulated from tensions. Boeing still views China as a major growth market, with estimates that China will need over 7,600 new airplanes valued at $1.2 trillion over the next 20 years. 

Members of Congress from both parties are visiting China this month to discuss a range of issues. A Congressional delegation including representatives from agricultural states will seek to address concerns over commodity exports to China. Other members will focus on China's human rights record and policies towards ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province. There are also ongoing concerns about China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea and its ambitions to become a dominant player in key technologies like artificial intelligence and telecommunications.

The aircraft deal, though relatively small, highlights the deep commercial ties between the two economic powers, even as they compete for geopolitical influence and are engaged in a prolonged trade war. Boeing already has a strong presence in China, with over a quarter of the country's commercial fleet composed of Boeing planes. The new long-haul 747-8s will be a prestige purchase for China Eastern, demonstrating it can match flagship carriers around the world.

For Boeing, the sale helps offset weaker demand for large aircraft elsewhere. The iconic 747 program was in danger of ending without more orders. By keeping the 747 line open for a few more years, Boeing also maintains its manufacturing capabilities for larger aircraft, which can translate to military contracts. As the US-China relationship evolves, Boeing will aim to continue expanding its business in China while US policymakers grapple with how to balance the economic and security dimensions of the relationship. Overall, this week's announcement signals both the interdependence of the US and Chinese economies as well as the complex dynamics shaping relations between the two superpowers.
