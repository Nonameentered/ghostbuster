China and the United States Sign New Textile Agreement, Narrowly Avoiding a Cross-Pacific Trade War 

The United States and China reached a last-minute agreement on a new trade deal governing textile imports, narrowly avoiding a potential US-China trade war. The agreement comes after months of tense negotiations and just two days before US tariffs on more than $50 billion of Chinese textiles were set to take effect.

The new deal will limit the growth of Chinese textile exports to the US to 1 percent per year over the next five years. The US textile industry argued that a surge of cheap Chinese imports was damaging domestic producers. The Trump administration had threatened to place 25 percent tariffs on more than 1,000 categories of Chinese textiles if an agreement was not reached before the deadline. 

In exchange for the export limits, the US agreed to drop the proposed tariffs. The agreement requires Chinese officials to closely monitor their exports and ensure the 1 percent growth limit is not exceeded. If more rapid growth occurs, the US said it reserves the right to re-impose tariff threats.

"This is a good deal that achieves our key objectives and will help sustain American textile producers," said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. "China's commitments to strictly limit exports will give our textile makers space to invest and innovate so they can continue to produce high-quality goods."

The Chinese government also praised the agreement while emphasizing the need to protect free trade. "This deal shows we can work together in a spirit of mutual understanding," said Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan. "Yet we must continue to promote openness and fairness in trade overall. Cooperation is the only option for both sides."

Textile industry groups in both countries expressed relief that a damaging trade war was avoided but had reservations about whether the deal would adequately curb US imports from China. The US textile alliance said the 1 percent growth limit was "rather anemic" while Chinese producers worried the limits could curb their expansion into the US market.

The agreement signals a victory for moderates in both governments who argue cooperation is preferable to conflict in the US-China trading relationship, even as tensions remain over other trade issues. The Trump administration continues to threaten tariffs on up to $150 billion of other Chinese goods, citing disputes over intellectual property theft and the US-China trade deficit. How this textile deal influences broader US-China trade relations will depend on whether it leads to more cooperative problem-solving, or simply postpones greater tensions until other deadlines approach.
