China and US in talks on new textile accord ahead of deadline

Chinese and US trade negotiators are holding discussions this week in Beijing around a potential new trade agreement on textiles and apparel, according to sources familiar with the talks. The two sides are hoping to reach a deal before a December deadline, when punitive US tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are set to increase from 10% to 25%.

The textile industry has been a key point of contention in the broader US-China trade war. The US has pushed for years to limit Chinese exports of textiles, which make up a major portion of the large US-China trade deficit. US producers have long argued that low-cost Chinese imports have decimated domestic manufacturing. The US issued tariffs specifically targeting Chinese textiles last year, while China retaliated with tariffs on US cotton, wool, and other agricultural exports.

Officials this week are trying to hash out details around a potential sunset clause for existing  US tariffs, increased access for US textile exports in China's market, and strengthened rules around intellectual property protection, according to the sources. A new broad agreement could pave the way for progress in other areas like technology transfer, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture â€“ some of the thorniest issues hampering a larger trade deal.

US industry groups are urging the administration to hold a hard line in the talks and not roll back any tariffs without meaningful concessions from China. However, there is a push from importers and retailers dependent on low-cost Chinese goods to reach an agreement before the key holiday shopping season. The looming December deadline adds urgency to the talks.
