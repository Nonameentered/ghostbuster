Fashionable young crowds flock to Beijing's Catholic churches for Christmas Eve midnight mass 

Beijing's Catholic churches have become a popular destination for young people on Christmas Eve, with crowds of stylish youth flocking to midnight mass services. At the historic Beitang Church, also known as the North Church, and Wangfujing Church in downtown Beijing, hundreds of young people gathered on Christmas Eve to celebrate.

The congregations were filled with fashionably dressed young people taking selfies and group photos in front of the churches lit up for the holidays. While many were there to attend the midnight mass services, others saw it as a social event to celebrate Christmas with friends.

"It's very festive and fun to be here on Christmas Eve," said Jane Wu, a 22-year-old recent college graduate who was at Wangfujing Church with a group of friends. "We're not all Christian but we still enjoy the Christmas spirit and vibe."

The growth of China's middle class, especially in major cities like Beijing, has spurred new interest in Christmas traditions that were originally brought to China by Western missionaries. While Christianity is still a minority religion in China, Christmas has become popular as a festive season. Lavish decorations, holiday markets and festive events now adorn many cities in the lead up to Christmas each year.

The rising interest in Christmas, especially among youth culture, has led to the revival of some religious traditions like the midnight mass. However, some question whether the crowds are more focused on the social aspect rather than the religious services.

"A lot of young people just see it as an entertainment or something that's very Instagram-worthy," said Father Matthew, an Irish priest at Wangfujing Church. "While we're happy they are coming to experience the Christmas story, we want to make sure the Christian message is conveyed amid all the hype." 

Still, church leaders see it as an opportunity to spread understanding of Christianity to those who may be experiencing a church service for the first time.  The profile of Christmas and interest among youth may also help reverse the decline of Christians in China, especially Catholics, according to some clergy. 

Whatever the reasons for attending, Christmas Eve midnight mass has become the place to be for fashionable young crowds in Beijing. And the city's Catholic churches, accustomed to darker days not long ago, have become the surprise beneficiaries of a revival of faith, of sorts. At least once year during the Christmas season.
