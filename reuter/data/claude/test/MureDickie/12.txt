Last Imperial Eunuch of China Dies at 93, Passing of Era of Emasculation for Power  

Cheng Yan, believed to be the last surviving eunuch who served China's imperial court, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 93. Cheng's death marks the end of a controversial practice that spanned thousands of years in Chinese history of castrating pre-pubescent boys to prepare them for service to the emperor and imperial family.

Cheng was just 8 years old when he was castrated and taken from his family to train to serve the Qing imperial court in 1925. He was one of some 50,000 eunuchs who lived throughout the 1500 years of imperial rule in China, from roughly 200 BC to AD 1912. The eunuch tradition arose initially as a way to ensure masculine servants did not have sexual relationships with the emperor's concubines. Over time, eunuchs took on important roles within the imperial bureaucracy, serving as lawmakers, generals, and advisors due to their unique access to the emperor and empress. 

The practice of turning pre-pubescent boys into eunuchs was outlawed with the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1912 and fell into disuse. The last of the eunuchs at the Qing court went on to live out the remainder of their lives under the Republic of China and then the People's Republic of China after 1949. Most lived in poverty and obscurity.

Cheng was one of the few former eunuchs to speak openly about his experience in recent decades. In interviews, he described the immense suffering he endured as a child being castrated without anesthetic and little understanding of why it was being done. Yet he also expressed pride in having served the Qing emperors and spoke of a lifelong sense of devotion to the royal family, even decades after the dynasty fell.

Historians mourn the loss of Cheng and the few remaining eunuchs as the last living links to the imperial era. Their experiences offer unique insights into life inside China's Forbidden City during a period that still captures China's imagination. The eunuch system is also a controversial practice that highlights both the immense power and cruelty that the imperial system wielded over its subjects for centuries. 

With Cheng's passing, there are no known surviving eunuchs left in China. His death brings down the curtain on one of the world's most enduring imperial institutions and a contentious era in China's long history. While a relic of the past, the eunuch system shaped Chinese views of power, sexuality, and masculinity for centuries and its legacy lives on today. But with the last of these once powerful men now gone, a final symbolic tie to China's imperial past has been cut forever.
