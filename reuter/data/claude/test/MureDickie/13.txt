Hong Kong's leader-designate Tung Chee-hwa confident in the future under Chinese sovereignty, says no problems require Beijing's help  

HONG KONG—Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong selected by Beijing to lead the territory after the handover from British rule, expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future under Chinese sovereignty in an interview today. Speaking to reporters at his campaign office, Tung said that Hong Kong has "no problems that require intervention or help from Beijing" as it transitions to governance by the Chinese central government.

Tung, a Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, was chosen by a 400-member election committee in December to serve as Chief Executive, a role akin to a mayor or governor. His selection was criticized by some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong who saw the process as lacking transparency and democratic accountability. However, Tung dismissed those concerns and said Hong Kong would maintain its autonomy, judicial independence, and civil liberties following the handover from Britain on July 1.  

"The central government has pledged that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle," Tung told reporters. "There is no reason why anyone should doubt that promise or worry Beijing will tighten control. Hong Kong has a strong rule of law and civic society—we do not need Beijing's involvement to solve our own problems."

Tung said his top priorities as Chief Executive would be maintaining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub, tackling economic inequality, and improving housing affordability for residents. He argued that focusing on bread-and-butter issues rather than politics would ensure a smooth leadership transition. "The people of Hong Kong care about jobs, security, and prosperity, not political debates," Tung said. "If we focus on their wellbeing and managing practical issues, the handover will be very successful."

Not all Hong Kongers share Tung's optimism, however. Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy legislator, said Tung was "naïve or deliberately misleading" in claiming Beijing would not tighten its grip on Hong Kong.  "China's leaders believe they have full sovereignty over Hong Kong, and with that comes control," Lee said. "They will not hesitate to intervene if they feel threatened. Tung is either unaware of that reality or chooses to ignore it." The coming weeks will determine who has the right view of Hong Kong's relationship with Beijing under Chinese rule.
