China and United States Make Progress in Talks on Textile Accord, Negotiations Could Stretch Late into the Night 

Trade negotiators from China and the United States made progress on Thursday toward reaching agreement on increased restraints on Chinese textile exports but despite some signs of convergence, negotiations were expected to continue late into the evening. 

The high-level talks in Beijing are aimed at resolving longstanding frictions over the Chinese textile industry, which has grown rapidly since quotas on textile imports were lifted at the end of 2004. The surge of cheap Chinese apparel into the United States has caused job losses and factory closures, increasing pressures on Washington to take action.

After two days of discussions, Chinese and U.S. negotiators have moved closer on key issues like voluntary export limits and tighter monitoring of shipments into American markets. However, several points of contention remain regarding the scope and level of restraints, as well as the length of any agreement. There is a possibility that talks may continue through the night, according to sources close to the discussions. 

"We have made progress but we are still some distance from reaching a final accord," said a senior U.S. trade official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. "A number of complicated issues remain to be resolved."

The negotiations have been aimed at reaching a voluntary deal with China to limit growth in textile exports to 7.5% or less over each of the next three years. The U.S. textile industry has urged the American government to push for a tougher limit of 5% growth while Chinese officials argue that restraints as low as 7.5% could slow China's economic growth. 

Any agreement would help defuse long-simmering economic tensions with the United States, China's second largest trading partner. The ballooning U.S.-China trade deficit has led some American lawmakers to call for sanctions against China for unfair trade practices like currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property.  

Trade groups on both sides recognize the importance of this round of talks and have pressed their governments to stand firm to protect domestic industries, while also avoiding a trade war. "These talks are crucial to the future of the U.S. textile industry," said Auggie Tantillo, president of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition. "We hope China will make meaningful concessions to provide much-needed relief from import surges that threaten American jobs."

The present discussions aim to build on a broad deal reached in October in which China agreed to flexible market mechanisms, like export limits, to address concerns over rapid growth in textile shipments following the elimination of global quotas. Any new agreement would likely take effect in early 2006, when temporary restraints from last year's deal are set to expire.
