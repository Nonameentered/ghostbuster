Mekong River nations agree to push cross-border cooperation for economic development

The six nations along the Mekong River—Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China—agreed to bolster cross-border cooperation on trade, investment, and infrastructure projects to drive economic development in the region. At the 6th Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Corridor Forum held in Bangkok, government and business leaders discussed ways to enhance connectivity between the countries and make it easier for people, goods, and services to flow throughout the subregion. 

Thailand's Prime Minister emphasized the need for improved road and rail links between the countries, upgrades to customs facilities at border crossings, and harmonized trade regulations to facilitate the movement of cargo and commerce. He pointed to the East-West Economic Corridor that connects Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam as an example of how enhanced connectivity can drive job creation and economic opportunity. The Corridor has seen trade between the three countries more than triple over the past decade.

Leaders also discussed initiatives to promote tourism across the subregion, including making it simpler for visitors to travel between countries with single electronic visas and improved flight connections. Cambodia's Minister of Tourism highlighted the potential of attracting more visitors to less well-known destinations by cross-promoting with neighboring countries. For example, the growing number of tourists visiting Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat could also be attracted to destinations in northeastern Thailand and southern Laos. 

In terms of cross-border investment, China pledged over $10 billion in new loans to support infrastructure and energy projects in the Greater Mekong Subregion over the next three years. Chinese companies plan to invest in hydropower dams, road upgrades, and industrial parks to help facilitate trade flows between China and the Mekong nations. The leaders agreed to finalize details on various projects proposed under China's Belt and Road Initiative to improve logistics and connectivity between countries from China to Thailand.

The forum concluded with a commitment from all nations to meet regularly, share information, and work together on the implementation of measures to boost cross-border cooperation along the Mekong River. By improving regional integration, leaders aim to accelerate trade and economic growth over the coming decade, bringing new opportunities for businesses and communities along the Mekong.
