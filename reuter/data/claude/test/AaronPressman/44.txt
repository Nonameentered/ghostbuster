Lawmakers Focus on What's Missing in Clinton Administration's Bank Reform Plan

The Clinton administration unveiled its long-awaited bank reform proposal this week aimed at modernizing Depression-era laws and restoring public confidence in the financial system. However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle argue the plan does not go far enough to address the root causes of the 2008 financial crisis. 

The administration's proposal focuses on increasing transparency and oversight in the banking sector. It would require big banks to hold more capital reserves, limit their trading in complex financial instruments like derivatives, and place the largest banks under stricter supervision by the Federal Reserve. Supporters say these steps will reduce risky behavior by Wall Street firms and prevent future taxpayer bailouts.

"This plan will make our financial system safer while protecting the ability of banks to lend to businesses and families," Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in announcing the reforms.

However, critics argue the plan fails to deal with many of the problems that led to the financial crisis, including the "too big to fail" issue posed by mega-banks and the risky lending practices that inflated the housing bubble. "We need bolder action to downsize and simplify 'too big to fail' banks, bring shadow banking into the light, and hold executives personally responsible for preventing the next crisis," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat.

On the Republican side, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said the administration's plan gives too much discretionary power to federal regulators and could stifle business lending and economic growth. "Dodd-Frank already tippled over the financial regulatory apparatus, and this plan would complete the overreach," Toomey said.

With bipartisan opposition, the future of the administration's bank reform proposal remains uncertain. Sec. Lew called on Congress to pass the reforms this year, but consensus appears elusive. For now, lawmakers seem focused on what's missing from the plan rather than what's in it. Overall, the debate is likely to shape up as yet another partisan battle on Capitol Hill.
