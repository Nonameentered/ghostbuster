Clinton Administration Proposes Overhaul of US Financial Sector Laws, Allowing Banks to Enter Securities and Insurance Fields

The Clinton Administration today announced a proposal to overhaul the laws regulating the US financial sector, including allowing commercial banks to enter the securities and insurance businesses. The proposal, known as the Financial Services Modernization Act, would repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the law that separated commercial and investment banking following the Great Depression.  

Administration officials argue that modernizing the laws governing the financial industry will allow US banks and other financial firms to better compete in today's global market. "The financial marketplace has changed enormously over the past 60-plus years, but the laws have not kept up," said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. "It is time to bring the regulatory system into the 21st century."

Under the proposed changes, commercial banks would be allowed to underwrite and trade securities, while investment banks and insurance companies would be allowed to take deposits. Officials argue this will lead to greater competition and more choices for consumers. However, critics argue it could also lead to more instability in the system and threaten consumer protections.  

"This proposal is a large step toward dismantling the firewalls that were erected in the 1930s to prevent financial speculation and protect consumers," said Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland. Consumer advocacy groups worry that large, diversified financial firms may take on additional risks and face more complex regulation. However, the Administration believes modern risk management techniques and a coordinated regulatory approach can address these concerns.

The legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress as it aims to balance the interests of a powerful financial lobby with consumer protection concerns. Any changes would represent the largest reforms to the US banking system since the Depression era, with potentially enormous ramifications for consumers, the financial sector, and the broader economy. The debate around this issue is set to shape financial regulation in the 21st century and beyond.
