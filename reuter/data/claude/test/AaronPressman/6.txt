Regulator Urges Banks to Tighten Credit Card Standards Amid Record Late Payments by Consumers  

The nation's consumer financial watchdog issued a warning Tuesday to major credit card issuers, urging them to tighten underwriting standards as data shows a surge in late payments and defaults by many households.  

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said loose lending practices during a long economic expansion have left some consumers overextended with high-cost revolving debt. With economic growth slowing and income gains modest, more people are falling behind on credit card bills, auto loans, and other debts.  

“Lenders should take a more conservative and prudent approach to risk,” the CFPB's director, Kathleen Kraninger, told reporters. “We don't want to see a race to the bottom in underwriting standards that leaves many consumers stranded with obligations they can't afford to repay.”  

The percentage of credit card accounts at least 30 days past due reached 3.5% in the third quarter, the highest level since 2012, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. More than 4.9% of auto loan balances were 90 days or more past due, an eight-year high.  

But while delinquency rates were rising, most large banks continued to loosen standards for new card applications to gain market share, the CFPB report found. More than half of new cards were issued to borrowers with less-than-prime credit scores below 660. The average interest rate on new card offers fell to just below 16% last year, encouraging some marginal borrowers to take on more debt.  

Kraninger declined to cite any specific institutions but said "there are proposals being made within institutions that do concern me and the teams here" at the consumer bureau. She urged banks and credit unions to verify income and employment data, set prudent limits on debt payments to income, and avoid unfair practices in the subprime market.  

Not all industry analysts agreed that tighter standards were needed or prudent at this point in the business cycle. Some said it could choke off access to credit for small businesses and middle-income consumers, damaging the economy. They also noted that default rates remain relatively low on an historical basis.  

“It's premature tightening that is not justified by the data,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW who covers major card issuers like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and American Express. “Portfolio performance is mostly stable. There is no need to overreact here and clamp down in a way that hurts customers and institution alike.”  

Kraninger countered that it was better for lenders to be "safe rather than sorry and tighten standards too abruptly if there is a downturn." While not predicting an imminent recession, she said, "it's important that institutions do prudent planning for different scenarios."
