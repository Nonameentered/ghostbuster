Federal Reserve Chairman Urges Congress to Postpone Controversial Banking and Commerce Proposals  

The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, urged members of Congress today to delay moving forward with controversial banking deregulation proposals that would weaken the long-standing separation between commercial and investment banking. In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell warned that dismantling the barrier between commercial and investment banking could have serious consequences. The bipartisan push aims to allow commercial banks to invest directly in hedge funds, private equity firms, and other speculative activities from which they have long been banned.

Powell cautioned that allowing commercial banks to operate like investment banks could lead to volatile profits, risky behavior, and threats to financial stability. "These walls between banking and commerce were erected for good reasons and it's unclear whether the reasons for this separation are outdated," Powell told lawmakers. He urged them to take more time to study the possible effects of lifting significant parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky investment activity.  

The Fed chairman's comments are a blow to lawmakers seeking to overhaul banking regulations, including Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House panel. They argue that scrapping the barrier between commercial and investment banks could boost lending and economic growth. However, consumer advocacy groups warn it could lead to banks preying on consumers and repeating the reckless behavior that fueled the financial crisis.

Powell did not rule out supporting some limited changes but said Congress should proceed cautiously. "There are reasons we have had this separation for a long time," he said. "Before we dismantle it, we want to make sure we understand exactly what the consequences might be." His testimony signals that any major changes to the banking system face significant hurdles and are unlikely this year given the limited time left in the 2019 legislative session.
