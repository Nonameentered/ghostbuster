Sun Microsystems' Use of Russian Encryption Software Mounts Pressure on Clinton Administration to Relax U.S. Export Controls

Sun Microsystems announced this week that it would incorporate a Russian-developed encryption algorithm into some of its hardware products. The surprise move signals the prominence of open-source software in the crypto field and puts more pressure on the Clinton administration to loosen stringent export controls on strong encryption software.

For several years, the U.S. government has treated encryption algorithms as munitions subject to strict export controls out of concern that the software could be used by foreign nations or groups to threaten U.S. national security. However, the technology industry has lobbied vigorously for more relaxed rules, arguing that strong encryption is increasingly essential for electronic commerce and privacy. The administration has slowly responded by allowing some exports of 56-bit encryption but continues to ban most foreign distribution of even stronger 128-bit encryption used in many U.S.-made operating systems and web browsers.

In a direct rebuke of these policies, Sun announced it would use a 160-bit algorithm called GOST, developed decades ago in the former Soviet Union and recently submitted as an international encryption standard. Though the exact specifications of GOST remain classified in Russia, Sun obtained the algorithm through academic researchers and open-source channels. By embedding GOST in its products, Sun clearly intends to highlight how unworkable export controls have become in an era of open-source software and widespread information sharing.

The bold move by a mainstream U.S. technology company is likely to reignite the encryption policy debate in Washington. Observers expect Sun's announcement to strengthen the hand of those calling for liberalization of export rules to allow robust encryption of 128 bits or more. However, the national security establishment is still wary about completely opening export of ultra-strong crypto until stronger monitoring capabilities are in place. The ensuing political battle could determine whether encryption policy moves into the 21st century or remains stuck using rules more suited for an earlier era. Overall, Sun's campaign to decentralize encryption and move it beyond the control of governments looks poised to succeed.
