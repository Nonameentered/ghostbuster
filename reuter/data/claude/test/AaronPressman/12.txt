Report Shows Number of Banks Charging Non-Customers for ATM Use Doubles Over Six Months  

The number of banks that charge fees for non-customers to use their ATMs has doubled over the last six months, according to a new report by Bankrate.com. As traditional revenue sources shrink for banks, many have turned to raising account fees and other charges to boost their bottom line. Imposing ATM surcharges on non-customers is becoming an increasingly popular tactic.

In Bankrate's latest survey of 10 major US banks and the 10 largest credit unions, they found that the number of institutions charging a fee for outside ATM use has risen from 5 in their previous report six months ago to 10 today. The average fee for using an out-of-network ATM has also increased by 25% in that time period to $2.50 per transaction.  

"Banks are searching high and low for ways to generate revenue as interest rates remain at historic lows and new regulations have curtailed certain fee charges," said Greg McBride, Chief Financial Analyst at Bankrate.com. "Charging a fee for non-customers to use the ATM, especially if it is a convenient machine with high usage, is a logical move from the bank's perspective. It ensures that non-customers are at least making some contribution to the cost of providing and maintaining that ATM."

Consumer advocates argue that rising ATM fees disproportionately impact lower income individuals and amounted to an unnecessary "fee trap." But some analysts counter that free ATM access was never meant to be a lifelong entitlement and that fees are necessary to fund ATM operations and upgrades. Most experts recommend that consumers avoid fees altogether by only using ATMs operated by their own bank when possible.

With banks facing ongoing revenue pressures, further increases in account fees, overdraft charges, and other consumer costs seem likely in the years ahead. While regulation has limited some of the most egregious charges since the financial crisis, fees continue to rise across the board. Consumers would do well to shop carefully for accounts with lower fees and minimum requirements to avoid paying increasingly higher costs to access their own money in the years to come.
