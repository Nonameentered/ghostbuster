Congress Reopens Encryption Export Debate as Companies and Privacy Advocates Call for Change   

Congress is once again grappling with regulations on exporting encryption technology, as technology companies and privacy advocates call on lawmakers to relax controls they say are outdated and hamper innovation.

A House subcommittee held a hearing this week to discuss updating laws that limit the export of encryption software and tools, some of which were written in the 1990s. Representatives from Google, Microsoft, and civil liberties groups argued that the laws make it difficult for companies to build and deploy secure digital products and services for both domestic and international use.   

“The regulatory regime has failed to keep up with the pace of technological change and market needs,” said Melissa Hathaway, a cybersecurity expert and former senior policy advisor in both the Bush and Obama administrations. She noted that much encryption technology is now freely available open source software, yet U.S. companies face strict controls on exporting some encryption tools and software.

However, law enforcement officials warned against loosening export controls too much, arguing they need access to read encrypted data to investigate criminal and terrorist activity. The debate pits privacy and commerce interests against national security concerns.

The rules in question include limits on exporting “strong encryption” tools of 56 bits or higher, meaning the keys used to encrypt data are 56 bits long. Such encryption was considered strong in the 1990s but is now relatively easy to crack. Critics argue the rules do little to curb the spread of stronger encryption, while disadvantaging U.S. businesses.

“The current framework hampers our ability to partner with global technology companies and deploy services for both U.S. and non-U.S. users,” said Cisco Premoli, director of cybersecurity at Google. She urged lawmakers to “expand opportunities for secure cross-border data flows.”   

The debate is expected to continue as lawmakers draft potential legislation to update the rules. Privacy advocates are pushing for reforms that would exempt most commercial encryption tools and open source software from export controls. But law enforcement groups want to ensure they retain access to encrypted data with a lawful court order. Finding a compromise that addresses both goals will be a challenge for Congress with no easy solutions.
