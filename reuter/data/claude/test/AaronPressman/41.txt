Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan Urges Caution on Controversial Bank Mergers with Commercial Companies 

Alan Greenspan, the longtime chairman of the Federal Reserve, voiced concerns today about large commercial banks merging with commercial companies. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan urged “considerable caution” regarding bank mergers that combine commercial banking and commerce.

Greenspan warned that allowing banks to merge with commercial companies could lead to conflicts of interest and undermine the separation of banking and commerce that has been central to U.S. policy for decades. “There are good reasons for limiting the extent to which commercial firms can own and control commercial banks,” Greenspan said.

The Fed chairman's comments come as several major Wall Street banks are lobbying regulators and Congress to loosen restrictions on mergers between banks and commercial companies. The banks argue that in today's fast-changing financial world, the traditional barriers between banking and commerce are outdated. However, consumer groups and community activists argue that loosening restrictions could put the entire financial system at risk.

If allowed to combine with major retailers, technology companies, and other commercial firms, the largest Wall Street banks would become even more powerful and systemically important, according to critics. They warn this could further concentrate risk in the banking system and lead to additional taxpayer bailouts in a crisis. Supporters counter that allowing banks to merge with strong commercial partners would diversify their revenue and make the financial system safer.

Greenspan acknowledged both sides of the argument today but came down mostly against sweeping deregulation. “There are serious risks that come with excessive involvement of commercial firms in banking,” he told lawmakers. The Fed chairman, who will retire in January 2006, called for a cautious case-by-case approach if any changes are made. His successor, Ben Bernanke, will have to grapple with these issues.

The debate around financial modernization and banking competition is likely to intensify in the coming months as policymakers weigh how and whether to update the regulatory framework in an age of digital banking and e-commerce. While supporting limited, targeted changes, Greenspan made clear in his testimony today that fully scrapping long-held restrictions would go too far. Overall, his message to lawmakers seemed to be: go slow.
