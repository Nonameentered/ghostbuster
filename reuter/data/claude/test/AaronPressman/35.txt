Clinton Administration Plans to Reform Outdated U.S. Banking Laws  

The Clinton administration announced plans today to update major U.S. banking laws that officials say have failed to keep up with recent changes in the industry. Spearheading the effort will be Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who said the reforms are aimed at “modernizing our financial system to meet the needs of consumers and the economy in the 21st century.”

The centerpiece of the plan is an overhaul of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in most investment banking activities. The administration wants to repeal sections of the act to allow banks to sell insurance and securities and engage in other activities outside traditional commercial banking. Supporters argue this will make U.S. banks more competitive globally. 

However, critics warn it could expose taxpayers and the economy to greater risks. “Banks would be able to make riskier bets with federally insured money,” said one consumer advocate. In announcing the plan, Rubin pledged “there will be adequate safeguards” to prevent abuse, but he did not specify details.  

The administration also aims to update the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act, which limits the types of business that bank holding companies can own and operate. The plan would ease restrictions to allow holding companies to own insurance underwriters, brokerages, and other financial subsidiaries.  

Additionally, the reforms call for streamlining how banks are regulated. There are currently multiple regulators for different types of banks at both the federal and state levels. The administration wants to combine more operations under the umbrella of the Federal Reserve. “A more unified regulatory system would reduce bureaucracy and ensure higher standards across the board,” Rubin said.

However, some lawmakers and consumer groups argue maintaining separate regulators for different banking areas, such as home lending and commercial banking, also provides important oversight. There are concerns too much consolidation could lead to regulators missing signs of risk across the larger industry.   

The banking industry has largely praised the reform proposals, saying they will increase competition and benefit consumers through greater choice and efficiency. But the plan faces a long road ahead, requiring approval in Congress where it's likely to undergo intense debate and revisions before a final vote.
