Lawmakers to Draw on Clinton Administration's Banking Reform Plan for New Legislative Proposal 

Congressional leaders announced today that they will use former President Bill Clinton's 1990s-era banking reform proposal as a model for new legislation aimed at modernizing regulations and preventing another financial crisis.

The announcement comes on the 10th anniversary of the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the most significant financial regulation overhaul since the Great Depression. However, lawmakers from both parties argue that more needs to be done to streamline the complex web of rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis and allow community banks and credit unions to thrive.

"It's time for a new legislative framework to unleash the potential of America's banking system and spur economic growth, while maintaining strong safeguards to prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts," said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) in a statement. Crapo pointed to Clinton's reform plan from 1998 as a blueprint for bipartisan legislation.

The Clinton administration proposal, developed but never passed in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis, aimed to overhaul Depression-era laws like the Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banks. It would have allowed banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate under one holding company. But it also included new rules to limit consolidation of the industry and ensure fair competition. 

"The Clinton plan struck a balance between deregulating the industry and protecting consumers that should guide us today," said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. "We need legislation that encourages small business lending, curtails risky behavior, and brings new transparency and accountability to the financial system."

Industry groups voiced support for revamping current regulations but called for caution in determining which parts of the Clinton proposal to revive. "We've made a lot of progress since the 1990s in consumer protection and risk management, so we can't just turn back the clock," said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association. "But updating some outdated red tape and crafting more flexible rules on small bank oversight could have real benefits for communities across the country."

Opponents argue deregulation of any kind will put the economy at risk of another crisis. "The Clinton plan was dead on arrival because it went too far in appeasing Wall Street's demands and not far enough on real reform," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a prominent consumer advocate. "Congress should strengthen regulations, not roll them back."

The announcement sets the stage for what is expected to be a long and contentious debate over finding the right balance of regulation and free markets in the banking system. With political polarization higher than ever, bipartisan compromise on such a complex issue will be challenging but necessary to move legislation forward.
