Bank merger highlights need for modernisation of banking laws, says consulting firm president

The proposed merger between the country's third and fourth largest banks highlights the urgent need to modernise banking laws to keep up with rapid changes in the industry, according to the president of a major consulting firm. ABC Banking Consulting has advised governments and regulators in over 20 countries on banking reforms. 

"The banking sector today looks very different compared to when many banking laws and regulations were first put in place," said Jane Smith, president of ABC Banking Consulting. "New technologies, digital banking platforms, fintech partnerships, and other innovations mean that regulators need to revisit existing frameworks to ensure they are still fit for purpose."

Smith pointed to the proposed merger between Big Bank and Large Bank, announced last month, as an example of why banking laws need to be reformed. The merger, which would create the nation's second largest bank, is still awaiting regulatory approval despite plans to cut costs and improve digital services for customers. "Under current laws, regulators will spend months evaluating how this merger could negatively impact competition, even though increased scale and innovation could benefit consumers," Smith said.

She argued that regulations should focus more on the outcomes for customers and financial stability rather than limiting market share of big banks. "If implemented responsibly, mergers that drive digital and tech innovation could provide consumers with better value and choice," Smith said. She suggested that laws be amended to give regulators the flexibility to approve bank mergers if there are clear benefits to consumers and measures to safeguard financial stability.

However, others disagree that regulatory requirements on bank mergers should be loosened. "Bigger banks do not always mean better outcomes for customers or the economy," said John Davies, executive director of Banking Regulation Watch, a consumer advocacy group. "Relaxing laws that limit market dominance could see the biggest banks get even bigger, to the detriment of customer service, choice and responsible lending practices."

There are also concerns that weakening regulations could threaten financial stability. "The recent bank failures during the global financial crisis are a stark reminder of what happens when banks become 'too big to fail'," Davies said. "Regulators should maintain a cautious approach to bank mergers and not bow to pressure from bank lobbying groups."

The debate highlights the challenging balance regulators and lawmakers face in adapting to rapid innovation in banking while also protecting the interests of consumers and mitigating risks to the financial system. Both sides agree that constructive discussions on reforming banking laws are urgently needed to ensure they remain relevant and effective. Reforms, if done responsibly by considering all viewpoints, could pave the way for a more innovative and competitive banking sector that continues to prioritise the needs of customers and stability. Overall, there are complex trade-offs involved in modernising banking regulation in line with 21st century innovations.
