Survey shows double the number of banks charging non-customers for ATM use 

A new survey found that the number of banks charging fees for non-customers to use their ATMs has doubled over the past year. The study, conducted by Bankrate.com, reported that 46% of banks now charge ATM fees to non-customers, up from 23% a year ago.

The trend is a reversal from previous years when the overall percentage of banks offering free ATM use was increasing. In 2009, over half of banks did not charge non-customers any fees for using their ATMs. However, that number had been declining over the years and this latest survey marks the sharpest increase in ATM fees charged to those without accounts.

On average, banks charge non-customer ATM users $2.97 per transaction, the survey found. In some areas, the average fees were much higher, up to $5 per withdrawal in some major cities. Even some smaller community banks and credit unions that previously offered free ATM access to all have started implementing charges for non-customers. Critics argue this practice acts as a penalty against those unable to open or maintain a traditional bank account.

The increased ATM charges come at a time when most large banks have eliminated or reduced fees for their own customers using out-of-network ATMs. The biggest banks, like Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, now allow their customers to use ATMs owned by other banks at no cost. But non-customers using those same ATMs are charged by the bank that owns the ATM and often face additional fees from their own banks for out-of-network use. 

Consumer advocates argue that the ATM fee increases disproportionately impact vulnerable groups like low-income households, rural populations with limited banking options, and communities where bank branch closures have made ATMs more necessary. Research shows that those without bank accounts often end up paying the highest fees for basic financial services. The new survey suggests ATM use is becoming yet another area where a bank account may be increasingly needed to escape escalating costs. However, with rising interest rates, more banks may continue adding or raising ATM fees as a way to generate additional revenue, even from those least able to afford it.
