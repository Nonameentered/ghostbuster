Financial Sector Reform Debate Stalls as Congress and Industry Struggle to Find Common Ground  

The ongoing debate over reforming regulations for the U.S. financial sector has stalled once again as lawmakers and industry groups struggle to find consensus. Proposals in Congress aimed at changing rules around banking, investments, and consumer protections are bogged down by disagreements between political parties and a divided financial services industry.

Democrats and consumer groups argue that the reforms passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis should be strengthened, not weakened. They want to see tougher rules on risky bank activities as well as stronger protections for consumers. However, Republicans and some industry groups are pushing for rolling back many of the post-crisis rules, which they argue are excessive and have limited economic growth by reducing lending. With a sharply divided Congress, there is little momentum to pass substantial new laws in either direction.  

The stalemate leaves much of the reform process to regulators at agencies like the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission. However, regulators also face conflicting pressures, with some arguing the agencies have gone too far and others saying they have not done enough. The Fed recently proposed some adjustments to the "Volcker rule" restrictions on proprietary trading, but left much of the rule in place. At the same time, the SEC is considering changes to rules around investment advice standards. But a SEC commissioner said "more work needs to be done to find the right balance."

In the banking industry, major players also have diverging views. Large banks generally support relaxing regulations they see as burdensome, such as stress tests and resolution planning. However, smaller regional banks argue that rolling back rules could disproportionately benefit the biggest firms. The industry is also split on proposals related to data privacy, student loan protections and affordable housing requirements.  

With no consensus and a packed legislative agenda, lawmakers in both parties anticipate financial sector reform will remain stalled at least through the next election. However, the issue is unlikely to go away as industries, consumer groups and the overall economy continue to feel the impacts of the new rules put in place after the financial crisis. Reform advocates argue more needs to be done, while critics argue the pendulum has swung too far. Finding the right balance remains an elusive goal.
