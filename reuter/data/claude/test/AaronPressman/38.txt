Clinton Administration Proposes to Eliminate Legal Barriers and  Allow Banks to Enter Securities and Insurance Businesses

The Clinton administration today announced a proposal to overhaul  decades-old laws that constrain U.S. banks, allowing them to expand into securities and insurance. The proposal aims to repeal sections of the 1933  Glass-Steagall Act that prohibit banks from engaging in brokerage and insurance activities. 

The proposal argues that removing the legal barriers between commercial and investment banking can benefit consumers through increased convenience and competition. "By allowing banks to offer securities and insurance, we can increase options and drive down costs for consumers," said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in announcing the proposal. "The financial services landscape has changed, and our regulations need to keep up."

If approved by Congress, the proposal would lift restrictions that date back to the Great Depression. The Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933 in the wake of the Depression to separate commercial and investment banking. Supporters argue it helps ensure the stability of the financial system, while critics argue it is outdated. 

The proposal is generating significant debate in the banking and finance industries. Large money center banks have aggressively lobbied for the repeal of Glass-Steagall, arguing they need more flexibility to compete with foreign banks and respond to changes in technology and consumer needs. However, community banks and consumer advocates argue repealing the Act could lead to risky speculation and threaten the economy. They also worry larger banks may concentrate power and reduce choices for consumers, especially in rural areas and smaller communities.

The administration's proposal faces an uncertain path in Congress, especially in the Senate. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Al D’Amato and other Republican leaders have expressed support for modernizing financial regulations but want to take a gradual approach. On the Democratic side, Senator Paul Wellstone has promised “all-out war” to block repeal of Glass-Steagall. The administration hopes aggressive lobbying and compromise can build enough support to pass a revised bill.
