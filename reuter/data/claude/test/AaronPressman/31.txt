Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Lawmakers Clash Over Mixing Banking and Commerce in U.S. Financial Laws Overhaul  

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker appeared before lawmakers on Tuesday to voice his strong opposition to proposals that would allow commercial companies to acquire banking charters in the U.S. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing to review proposed changes to the Bank Holding Company Act that would relax current restrictions preventing non-financial companies from controlling banks.  

Volcker, who headed the Fed from 1979 to 1987, warned the committee that allowing "mixing banking and commerce" could create unintended risks to the financial system. "The general presumption that banking and commerce should be separated has long been recognized as important for market stability and competitiveness," Volcker said. He cautioned against undoing laws put in place after the Great Depression that aim to separate banking from commercial and industrial enterprises.

Republican lawmakers and some witnesses at the hearing argued that modernizing regulations and allowing new competitors in the banking system could increase choice for consumers and small businesses. "We have an opportunity to fix an outdated law and open up the banking system to more competition," said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee.

Democrats and consumer advocates sided with Volcker's position that taxpayer-backed commercial banks should remain insulated from the risks of non-financial companies. Allowing "Walmart or Facebook to acquire big banks" could put the financial system in danger, said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D., Mass.).  "I don't think the rewards outweigh the risks," Lynch said. 

The hearing is part of the committee's efforts to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 law that restructured financial regulations following the financial crisis. Committee leaders Rep. McHenry and Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) introduced a draft bill this month called the “Financial Services Innovation Act” which includes provisions to modify restrictions around mixing banking and commerce.

Tuesday's hearing highlighted the partisan split in overhauling financial regulations. While Democrats argue that weakening the separation between banking and commerce could encourage predatory practices and too much concentration of economic power, Republicans believe deregulating the banking sector could boost lending and economic growth. The committee is expected to continue deliberating the draft legislation in coming weeks.
