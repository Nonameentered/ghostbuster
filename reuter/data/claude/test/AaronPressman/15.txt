Bank merger signals outdated banking laws, Congress urged to modernize  

The announced merger between First United Bank and Community Trust Bank is prompting calls for Congress to update banking regulations that critics say are outdated and could hamper competition. Under the proposal announced this week, the two regional banks would combine into a $25 billion institution, making it one of the 30 largest banks in the country.  

While shareholders and executives for the banks have approved the plan, it still needs regulatory and anti-trust approval. But the merger has brought to light how much banking laws have failed to keep up with the changes in the industry over the last few decades. Regulations like the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 were written for a landscape of localized banks, small geographic footprints, and limited branching. Today's banking sector bears little resemblance.  

“Our banking regulations are from a bygone era and desperately need to be modernized,” said James Ballentine, an economist at the American Bankers Association. “Regulations haven't kept up with how fast the industry is evolving. We need a major overhaul.”  

There is concern the outdated regulatory framework could hamper healthy competition in the banking sector, with a flurry of mergers in recent years leading to greater concentration. The four largest banks now make up 47 percent of all banking assets, up from 29 percent in 2000. Critics argue this could lead to higher fees, lower savings rates, and other anti-competitive behaviors without modern regulations.

“The current regulatory structure essentially has the training wheels still on for some very large banks,” said Heather McGee, President of the public policy organization Demos.  “We need rules that acknowledge the emergence of trillion-dollar banks and align regulations to prevent monopolistic behavior, protect consumers, and ensure stability."  

Proponents counter that mergers allow regional banks to gain scale and compete with the biggest national players. First United and Community Trust argue their merger will mean improved mobile banking, higher rates on accounts, and more access to credit for local communities. The deal will expand the network of bank branches in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. 

The calls for legislative action come as a bipartisan group of lawmakers has already introduced an overhaul of banking laws. The potential for another major merger wave may add impetus for Congress to make modernizing banking regulation a priority. The question is whether lawmakers can overcome political obstacles that have derailed past efforts at reform.
