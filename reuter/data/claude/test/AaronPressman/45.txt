Tech Industry Leaders Demand Stronger Laws to Protect Intellectual Property from Piracy 

The leaders of some of the world's largest technology companies issued a joint statement today demanding that governments take stronger actions against intellectual property theft and piracy. The statement was signed by CEOs of companies including Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, and IBM and decried the hundreds of billions of dollars lost each year due to the pirating of software, music, movies, and other digital goods.

The tech leaders argued that existing laws and enforcement mechanisms have failed to curb the rise of piracy on the Internet over the past two decades. They pointed out that while piracy once meant shady markets for bootleg CDs and DVDs, today high-speed Internet connections and underground cyberlockers have made it easy for anyone to access near-limitless libraries of pirated content. The companies called for laws with harsher penalties for repeat copyright infringements as well as greater resources for law enforcement groups tasked with policing piracy.

Critics argue that the proposed actions would infringe on Internet users' civil liberties and privacy. Digital rights groups contend that piracy is often the result of companies failing to provide affordable, convenient alternatives to customers. They point out that streaming music and video services have led to substantial drops in piracy as people opt for legal options. Some experts also claim that estimates of losses from piracy are frequently inflated. Still, surveys do show very high rates of unlicensed streaming, downloading, and sharing of digital goods around the world.  

The statement from tech leaders comes as policymakers in many countries grapple with how best to curb illicit activity on the Internet while enabling innovation. There are concerns that both failing to take action as well as taking overly broad action could stifle the growth of technology companies. However, today's statement indicates that at least some industry leaders believe stronger protection of intellectual property should be a higher priority. The coming months will show whether and how governments choose to respond.
