U.S. House Judiciary Committee Approves Bill to Relax Export Restrictions on Computer Encryption Technology  

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee today approved a bill that would relax export restrictions on encryption technology, allowing companies to sell strong encryption software and tools abroad. The “Promoting Digital Privacy Technologies Act” passed by a vote of 22 to 15, garnering bipartisan support. The bill now moves to the full House of Representatives for consideration.

The bill removes existing U.S. limits on exports of encryption technologies that provide "data security and integrity." It allows companies to sell software and hardware with strong encryption to foreign customers without obtaining a special license. Supporters argue this will boost sales of U.S. technology companies and promote the use of stronger encryption around the world to protect users' security and privacy.

Opponents argue relaxed export controls could threaten national security by making it easier for foreign adversaries to hide communications. The Trump administration and some lawmakers have pushed to maintain limits on sales to certain countries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The bill approved today does not exempt any countries from the relaxed rules.  

Encryption is a technique used to protect the privacy and security of data by converting it into code to hide its meaning. Strong encryption with longer key lengths is harder to break. Many technology companies have argued that export restrictions put them at a competitive disadvantage versus foreign competitors and have lobbied for years to ease controls.

“This bill allows American companies to sell the best encryption technologies to customers all over the world, which will boost the economy and make users safer online,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), the bill's sponsor. 

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) said the controls were an outdated policy from the “bygone era” of the 1990s that no longer made sense given the widespread availability of encryption tools. "Criminals and terrorists have access to technology, and lawful actors should also have access to encryption to protect themselves,” she said.

But Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), a former U.S. attorney, opposed the bill, arguing it could allow oppressive regimes to encrypt communications and avoid government surveillance. "While promoting digital privacy, we must also protect national security," he said. "This requires balance, not an all-or-nothing approach.”

The Trump administration has not yet taken a public position on the bill. The Commerce and Defense departments would have to update and revise the existing export controls once legislation is passed.
