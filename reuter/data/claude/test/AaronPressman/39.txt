Clinton Administration Proposes Overhauling U.S. Financial Sector Laws, Allowing Banks to Enter Insurance and Securities Fields 

The Clinton administration proposed sweeping changes today to laws governing the U.S. financial sector. If passed by Congress, the proposals would dismantle barriers between commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies. The reforms could reshape the face of banking in America and lead to the creation of massive financial conglomerates.

At the heart of the reforms are changes to the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which was put in place to curb banking excesses after the Great Depression. The act separated investment and commercial banking to reduce risk in the system. The Clinton administration proposal would overturn key parts of Glass-Steagall, allowing commercial banks, investment banks, and insurers to merge operations and enter each other's lines of business.  

Proponents argue this will make the financial system more stable and U.S. firms more competitive globally. "By aligning our financial laws with the realities of modern finance, we can strengthen the foundation of our economy and sustain long-term economic growth," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. Critics counter it could recreate the risky conditions that led to the Depression era crisis and taxpayer bailouts. The new financial behemoths may reach a size and complexity that makes them 'too big too fail.'

The plan was shaped with input from industry leaders who stand to benefit from consolidating their empires. Travelers Group, which owns investment bank Salomon Brothers and insurer MetLife, has been lobbying to merge its operations. Citicorp, parent company of Citibank, is also poised to expand into investment banking and insurance. Consumer groups argue average Americans will face higher fees and have fewer choices if these "mega-mergers" proceed. 

The proposals face an uphill battle in Congress where key lawmakers are skeptical about dismantling Glass-Steagall provisions. However, Republicans control both houses and tend to favor deregulating industry. The administration is betting Congress will back reforms in the name of modernization and boosting competitiveness. The coming debate in Congress will help determine the shape of banking and finance in 21st century America.
