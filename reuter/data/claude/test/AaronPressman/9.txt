Federal Regulators Warn of Possible Y2K Computer Problems in Financial Institutions  

Federal agencies that oversee the nation's banking system issued an unprecedented joint warning today about potential computer problems in the financial sector as we approach the year 2000. The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said some community banks and credit unions have not adequately prepared for the Y2K problem and may experience computer system failures that could disrupt account records or even temporarily halt transactions.

In a statement, the agencies said, "Financial institutions that are not adequately prepared could experience problems in account record keeping, processing loans, handling electronic fund transfers, telephone banking services, security and alarm systems, and building access systems." The regulators are ordering banks and credit unions to conduct thorough reviews of computer systems and software to identify potential problem areas, update or replace systems as needed, and establish contingency plans in the event of disruptions.   

Many older computer systems and software use two digits rather than four to represent the year, meaning that when systems roll over to the year 2000, they may read the year as 1900 rather than 2000. This could throw off date-sensitive calculations and records. Most large banks and financial firms have been working for years to update systems but progress has been slower at some smaller institutions. The cost and effort to become Y2K compliant has strained resources at some community banks and credit unions.

To help address the issue, the regulators have issued detailed guidance to banks on steps they must take to prepare for Y2K, including inventories of all computer systems, testing systems over the transition to 2000, and developing extensive contingency plans should problems arise. They have warned that failure to address the Y2K problem could be seen as a safety and soundness risk, and some institutions may face fines or regulatory actions if not adequately prepared. Consumers can help by asking their local banks or credit unions if they have updated systems and contingency plans in place, which can also encourage these institutions to make Y2K compliance a priority as the turn of the century approaches.
