Members of Congress Criticize Federal Reserve for "Woefully Inadequate" Record of Hiring Minorities and Women 

A group of Democratic members of Congress sent a letter this week to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell criticizing the central bank for its "woefully inadequate" record of hiring and promoting minorities and women. In the letter, the lawmakers said the Fed has made "little to no progress" in addressing the lack of diversity within its ranks, especially in leadership roles.

Citing statistics from the Fed's own data, the lawmakers noted that four of the five members of the Board of Governors are white men, as are 12 of the 13 regional bank presidents. They said people of color make up just 6% of the Fed's senior leaders, well below their share of the overall U.S. population. They also said the Fed has made minimal progress in addressing the large gender gap within its leadership, with women holding just 20% of senior roles.

"The data and evidence are clear: the diversity and inclusiveness of the Federal Reserve's workforce, especially in leadership roles, lags significantly behind its peers in government, private industry, and central banks around the world," the letter states. It calls on Powell to present a comprehensive plan within three months to address the lack of diversity and inclusion.

In a statement, the Fed acknowledged the lack of diversity within its ranks and said it "recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in all of its forms." The central bank said it "continues taking concrete actions" to broaden the pipeline for roles at all levels, though it did not specify what new actions would be taken. The Fed noted it has recently established a new position to focus on diversity and inclusion and has revamped its hiring practices to reduce bias.

The lawmakers praised these initial steps but said much more needs to be done. They said increasing diversity should be a strategic priority for the Fed given its important role in ensuring the economic well-being of all Americans. They requested an update in three months on additional steps the Fed will take to make "demonstrable progress" on diversity goals and to comply with requirements of a new law promoting inclusiveness at the central bank.
