Senate Banking Committee Chairman Introduces Legislation to Ban ATM Surcharges on Non-Customers   

The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee introduced legislation today that would prohibit banks from charging non-account holders fees for using automated teller machines (ATMs). Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) introduced the Consumer ATM Transparency Act, which aims to eliminate the surcharges that many banks levy when customers of other banks use their ATMs.   

“These surcharges are unfair and deceptive, preying on consumers when they can least afford it,” said Shelby in a statement. “Customers deserve transparency and protection when accessing their own money from an ATM.”

The legislation would amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prevent ATM operators from charging a fee to a non-account holder for any transaction to withdraw funds or check account balances using an ATM. Supporters argue that the fees, which average around $3 per transaction, have become excessive and hurt those with lower account balances the most.   

However, the banking industry pushed back strongly against the proposed legislation. “Senator Shelby misguidedly seeks to regulate the free market and dictate how banks can charge for services,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association. “Banks invest billions of dollars to build and maintain ATM networks, and surcharging non-customers is necessary to recover costs and continue providing convenient access to cash.” Hunt noted that customers can easily avoid fees by using ATMs within their own bank's network.   

Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, co-sponsored the bill with Senator Shelby. “Big Wall Street banks rake in billions of dollars each year in ATM fees from hardworking Americans,” said Brown. “This legislation will curb abusive fees, crack down on deceptive practices, and put money back in the pockets of consumers.” However, the bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Senate and may not gain enough support to come up for a vote. The House Financial Services Committee would also need to approve the legislation before the full House could consider it.

Consumer advocates have pushed for years to limit ATM surcharges, arguing that the fees predominantly impact low-income individuals and families. While some progress was made a decade ago to force ATM operators to notify customers about fees ahead of any transactions, surcharging of non-account holders remains an issue that continues to frustrate consumer groups. Today's legislation could reignite this debate on Capitol Hill if it moves forward.
