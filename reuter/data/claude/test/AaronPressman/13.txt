Premature government regulation could harm rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards, says US bank regulator

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned against premature regulation of the growing prepaid stored-value card market in the US. In a new report, the OCC said tight restrictions on the cards, often compared to debit cards but not linked to a bank account, could limit innovation in a rapidly evolving market serving tens of millions of consumers.

The OCC regulates national banks in the US, some of which issue prepaid cards. The agency said regulations have not kept up with the expansion of prepaid cards from niche uses like gift cards to mainstream products for receiving wages, government benefits, and other funds. "The prepaid market is quite dynamic, with new products appearing frequently. Imposing narrow product definitions or other limits ... risks cutting off future useful innovations," the OCC said.

Prepaid cards have grown quickly in recent years to become a $350 billion market, according to some estimates. However, consumer advocates argue regulation is needed to ensure adequate protections and oversight. Requirements vary for different types of prepaid cards, creating potential for confusion and abuse, advocates say.

The OCC acknowledged risks like fraud and loss of funds on prepaid cards, but said the current patchwork of state and federal laws are largely sufficient. The agency warned against overbroad regulation that could drive some consumers to riskier options outside the banking system. "A balance needs to be struck between regulation for consumer protection and overregulation that limits access to useful financial services," the OCC said.

Some lawmakers have pushed for more uniform national rules on prepaid cards, citing concerns over lack of FDIC insurance for some funds and typically higher fees than traditional bank accounts. Regulation of the prepaid market is likely to remain a topic of debate as the industry continues evolving at a rapid pace in the coming years. Overall, the OCC urged an approach focused on risks and bad actors instead of limiting innovation in a market that benefits many consumers with few other options.
