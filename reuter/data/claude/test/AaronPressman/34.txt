Clinton Administration Plans to Reform Outdated U.S. Banking Laws

The Clinton administration announced plans today to overhaul key U.S. banking laws that have been largely unchanged since the Depression era. In a press conference, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said “our banking regulations are stuck in the 1930s and it’s time for reform that will unleash the potential of the U.S banking sector.”

The centerpiece of the reform efforts will be modernizing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separated commercial banking from investment banking. Rubin argued that those restrictions are outdated and U.S. banks need more flexibility to compete in today’s global financial system. “With proper safeguards and oversight, allowing banks to offer investment services as well as commercial banking services can benefit both consumers and the economy,” Rubin said. 

The most significant change would allow commercial banks to operate securities firms and insurance companies within a financial holding company structure. Currently, those activities are prohibited under Glass-Steagall. The reform would also allow bank holding companies to engage in a wider range of financial activities, including merchant banking. However, Rubin emphasized that deposit-taking institutions would still be regulated separately to ensure consumer protections.

Passage of the reform legislation faces challenges in Congress, as some lawmakers are concerned about the risks of loosening restrictions. “We need to safeguard against Wall Street greed by maintaining firewalls between banking and high-risk financial speculation,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. However, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, expressed support: “Our banking laws need a major facelift to reflect the realities of the 21st century global economy.”

The proposed reforms reflect the increasing blurring of lines between commercial and investment banking in recent decades. Most experts agree that Glass-Steagall is out of date, but there are disagreements on how to balance deregulation while protecting consumers and financial stability. If passed, the changes would be the most significant banking reforms since Glass-Steagall itself was enacted in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The Clinton administration aims to pass legislation by the end of next year, before the president leaves office.
