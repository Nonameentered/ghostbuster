Internet Society Plans to Add Seven New Top-Level Domains, Receives Endorsement from Major Companies and Organizations

The Internet Society recently announced plans to create seven new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as early as next year. The new domains would be .cloud, .secure, .arts, .games, .charity, .sport, and .music. If approved by ICANN, the organization that oversees domain names and IP addresses, these new gTLDs could start appearing in mid-2021.  

The announcement comes as the Internet Society seeks to expand beyond existing gTLDs like .com, .org and .net. “These new gTLDs will give internet users more options to create their digital identities in a way that is most meaningful to them,” said Sally Wentworth, Vice President of Global Policy Development at the Internet Society. The organization hopes the new domains will spark innovation, especially around digital communities of interest.

The proposal received endorsements from several major tech companies and nonprofit organizations. “We fully support the Internet Society’s plans to create these new gTLDs,” said a spokesperson for Google. “More domain options help foster diversity and inclusiveness online.” A spokesperson for Facebook echoed this sentiment, saying “The new gTLDs would give people and organizations more ways to identify themselves on the internet.”

If approved by ICANN, the new domains would enter a trial phase for several months to allow trademark owners to file claims. After the trial period, registration would open up to businesses, organizations, and individuals on a first-come, first-served basis. The Internet Society did not announce pricing details but said the new domains would be competitively priced.

While some critics argue there are already too many domain options, proponents counter that new domain spaces fuel business opportunities and help the internet adapt to changes in technology, culture, and values. “The internet continues to evolve rapidly," said Wentworth. "New gTLDs will create launchpads for the next wave of digital innovation and help the internet keep pace with where society and technology are headed.”

The announcement is the latest in an ongoing expansion of the internet domain system. In recent years, ICANN has approved domains such as .app, .bank and .blog. If the Internet Society's proposal is accepted, the seven new gTLDs would bring the total number of generic top-level domains to over 1,200. The new options aim to make the internet more globally representative and give community groups alternatives beyond existing gTLDs.
