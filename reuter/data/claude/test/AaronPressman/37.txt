Sybase Inc Receives Unexpected Export Approval for Computer Encoding Products

Sybase Inc, a software and services company headquartered in Dublin, California, announced today that it has received  approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce to export certain computer encoding software products and services to customers in China, Russia and Venezuela. The approval came as a surprise to industry analysts who expected the government to impose further export restrictions on advanced technology products and place additional geopolitical adversaries on the restricted countries list.

Sybase develops and markets software and services to manage, analyze, and mobilize information, including enterprise resource planning software, analytical and risk management solutions, and tools for application development. Its software is used by organizations in a range of industries, including financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing, and communications.

In a brief statement, John Chen, CEO of Sybase, said "We are pleased to receive approval to continue serving all of our global customers and expanding into new markets. Our software solutions enable enterprises around the world to thrive and better serve their communities through improved data management and mobility capabilities." 

Export controls on software and other technologies are regulated for national security and foreign policy reasons under the Export Administration Regulations. Companies require export licenses from the Commerce Department to sell certain products to restricted countries like China, Russia and Venezuela. Approval is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the sensitivity of the technology and potential end uses.

Analysts attributed the surprise approval for Sybase to a combination of factors, including political pressure to boost export numbers, calculated bets that the encoding software did not pose major security risks if obtained by adversaries, and a rigorous review process by Sybase to ensure compliance with regulations. Commerce officials declined to comment on the specifics of this commercial export license approval.

The latest move signals the Commerce Department may be willing to loosen certain high-tech export restrictions to benefit U.S. tech companies, despite pushback from security hawks. Sybase's shares climbed over 4% on the news, as investors anticipate higher revenues from new market opportunities. The decision is sure to receive scrutiny from policymakers concerned about China and other nations gaining access to sensitive U.S. technologies.
