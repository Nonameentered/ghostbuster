Record Number of Americans and Businesses File for U.S. Bankruptcy Protection in First Quarter of 1997 

A record number of Americans and businesses filed for bankruptcy protection during the first quarter of 1997, surging past the previous record set just three months earlier. According to data released today by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, personal and business bankruptcies reached 113,274 in the January through March period, up 32% from the same period last year.  

The rising tide of bankruptcies reflects the struggles of both individuals and companies in today’s economy. On the consumer side, high levels of debt, stagnant wages, and job insecurity are pushing more people into insolvency. For businesses, fierce competition, narrow profit margins, and a weak retail environment are squeezing companies and forcing some into Chapter 11 reorganization or liquidation.

“The bankruptcy numbers are a worrisome sign that weakness in the economy may be more pervasive than commonly thought,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. “If people and businesses continue to file for bankruptcy at this pace, it does not bode well for consumer spending, business investment, and overall economic growth going forward.”

Personal bankruptcies accounted for 97,070 of the total filings, up 31% from a year earlier and 2% from the previous record in the fourth quarter of 1996. The rapid rise in personal bankruptcies defies the rosy outlook portrayed by low unemployment numbers and a buoyant stock market. However, personal incomes have barely kept up with inflation over the past year, while household debt levels have skyrocketed thanks to easy access to credit cards, home equity loans, and other financing.   

On the business side, 16,204 companies filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter, a 35% increase from a year ago. Retailers in particular have struggled, filing 5,340 bankruptcies in the first quarter, a 43% surge from a year earlier. The retail sector has been battered by lackluster consumer demand and the migration of sales to large discount chains like Walmart and Costco. However, bankruptcies also rose sharply for construction firms, hotels and motels, and business services companies.  

The record bankruptcy numbers pose a threat to the economy if left unabated. When individuals and businesses cannot repay debts, it can weaken the entire financial system. Banks may become reluctant to lend, and consumers may cut back spending. “These trends need to stabilize soon to avoid a self-perpetuating cycle of higher delinquencies, tighter credit, and slower economic growth,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One. However, most economists do not expect a major crisis and foresee bankruptcy levels flattening out over the coming year as the economy continues its steady but modest growth.
