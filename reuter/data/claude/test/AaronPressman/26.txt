U.S. Commerce Department Forms Committee to Advise on Controversial Encryption Export Policy 

The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today the formation of a new advisory committee to provide recommendations on encryption export policy. The committee will review current policies that limit the export of strong commercial encryption technologies and provide guidance on potential revisions to those policies.

For decades, the U.S. government has classified encryption technologies as "dual-use" items that have both commercial and military applications. Under export control laws, the export of strong encryption software and hardware requires a license to most countries. Technology companies have long argued that these controls are outdated and unnecessarily limit their ability to compete in the global marketplace. Privacy advocates have also warned that limits on encryption threaten digital security and civil liberties.  

In recent years, some restrictions on encryption exports have been relaxed. But many in the tech industry argue that further reforms are needed, especially as foreign companies develop and spread advanced encryption techniques. "Robust encryption is critical to our digital infrastructure, and limiting its spread only serves to harm America's cybersecurity and economic competitiveness," said Carl Winston, policy director at the Consumer Technology Association.

The new Commerce Department committee will include representatives from the tech industry, academic experts on encryption and civil liberties, and law enforcement organizations. "Our goal is to gather input from all key stakeholders and determine if current policies adequately balance economic and security interests," said Assistant Secretary for Export Administration Richard Ashooh. "We want to make sure any changes to export controls are informed, reasoned and consistent with our national values."

Critics argue, however, that the committee's objectives are too narrowly focused on economic concerns and may not give proper weight to law enforcement priorities. "Encrypting communications and data can pose real threats to public safety by enabling criminal plans and activity," said David Johnson, president of the National Association of Police Chiefs. "Any effort to loosen export controls must be considered carefully and account for the needs of the law enforcement community."

The committee will hold its first meeting next month and aims to release its recommendations within six months. While the recommendations themselves would not have the force of law, they are likely to shape the policy direction of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls. The bureau will then determine whether and how to implement any proposed changes â€” a process that typically takes 6-18 months. Both supporters and critics of the current policy will be watching closely to see if this new initiative leads to meaningful reforms in longstanding limits on encryption exports.
