China Intensifies Crackdown on Dissidents, Jailing Dozens Amid Easing Foreign Pressure on Human Rights Record 

China has ramped up its crackdown on political dissent in recent weeks, jailing dozens of activists and human rights lawyers as foreign governments have eased pressure on Beijing over human rights violations. Rights groups say at least 50 dissidents have been detained or "disappeared" since late December in one of the worst crackdowns on political dissent in years.

The crackdown comes as China faces little criticism from Western democracies over its authoritarian policies and human rights abuses. The U.S. and E.U. have rolled back measures targeting China's human rights record in recent years as they seek Chinese cooperation on issues like trade and climate change. The Biden administration has signaled it will maintain a tough line on China but has not made human rights a focal point.  

Among those detained in recent weeks are Zhang Zhan, 37, a citizen journalist who reported on the initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak last year. Zhang went on a hunger strike to protest her detention and her family says her health has seriously deteriorated. Also jailed was Ding Jiaxi, 54, a prominent rights lawyer and activist, on charges of "subversion of state power." Ding had organized small gatherings to discuss China's constitution and other political reforms.

The detentions show Chinese leader Xi Jinping remains intolerant of even modest dissent and criticism. They undermine hopes Xi may moderate China's authoritarian trajectory in his third term starting this year. Instead, Xi appears determined to silence any and all political opposition to Communist Party rule.

"The human rights situation in China has deteriorated to its worst point since the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. "The Chinese government's pledges to respect human rights and build so-called rule of law are shattered."

The crackdown drew a rare rebuke from the E.U., which expressed "great concern" over the detentions and called on China to "immediately release those arbitrarily detained." But the statement made no mention of possible sanctions or consequences if China failed to do so. Experts say the toothless response will likely embolden China's security apparatus to intensify their campaign against dissent.

Continued human rights abuse could damage China's image abroad but likely poses little threat to Xi's control at home. Xi's cult of personality and repressive policies remain broadly popular among China's public, and rising nationalism has made many Chinese hostile to Western criticism over human rights. With the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Xi also anticipates a platform to showcase China's power on the global stage regardless of any controversies.

Still, a harsher strategy of intimidation and fear risks catalyzing greater pushback not only from rights activists but also common citizens and even party insiders troubled by the country's direction. An overly aggressive move, like a bloody crackdown, could damagingly highlight the fragility of Xi's control. While dissent has largely been silenced, social discontent over inequality, corruption and policy missteps continues to simmer beneath the surface.
