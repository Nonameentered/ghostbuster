Chinese Court Sentences Dissidents to Up to 10 Years in Prison for Subversion  

A court in southern China sentenced three prominent human rights activists to up to 10 years in prison for “subversion of state power” on Tuesday. The harsh sentences are the latest sign of a broad crackdown on civil society under President Xi Jinping.

According to court documents, the activists - Peng Yonghe, 68, Yuan Xinting, 57, and Zou Wei, 51 - were sentenced by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People’s Court for “inciting subversion of state power” by organizing and participating in pro-democracy seminars and for promoting Western-style democracy and civil society. The seminars were held between August 2020 and January 2021, the court said.

Peng, a veteran activist and former political prisoner, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Yuan, an environmental and public interest lawyer, received a sentence of eight years. Zou, a university professor who has advocated for democratic reforms, was given a five-year sentence. The sentences are among the harshest in years for peaceful activism and reflect the determination of the Communist Party to crush any perceived challenges to its rule.

"This is a shocking affront to justice,” said Maya Wang, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Chinese government's zero tolerance for peaceful dissent and activism is on full display here. These activists did nothing wrong and should not spend a day behind bars, let alone spend years locked up for promoting democratic values.”

The convictions are the latest in a series of arrests and prosecutions of prominent rights activists, civil society advocates, lawyers and others who have pushed for political and legal reforms in China. Since taking power in 2012, President Xi has overseen a widespread crackdown on dissent, censorship and the detention of activists, lawyers and others perceived as threats to Communist Party rule.

The defendants were detained in a coordinated roundup of over 50 people in December and January. Most were released after interrogation, but Peng, Yuan, Zou and several others were formally arrested on charges of subversion. At their trial in July, prosecutors accused them of “inciting the subversion of state power and overthrow of the socialist system” by organizing private seminars on civil and labor rights, disseminating information about democracy and civil society, and “denigrating and slandering the country’s political system.”

Human rights groups condemned the sentences and called on the Chinese government to release the three activists immediately. “By sentencing Peng, Yuan and Zou to harsh prison terms for their peaceful activism, the Chinese government has demonstrated once again its fear of civil society and dissent,” said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Beijing needs to understand that promoting democracy and civil society is not a crime.”
