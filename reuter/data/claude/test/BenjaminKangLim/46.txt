Beijing's New Mayor Vows to Continue Fight Against Corruption While Putting Graft Scandal Behind him

Beijing, Chinaâ€”On his first day as Beijing's Mayor, Wang Qixue, 52, pledged a double strategy of Chinese President Xi Jinping: continuing the ongoing anti-corruption campaign while putting behind the graft scandal that tainted the previous administration.

Wang was appointed mayor last week, replacing the disgraced former Mayor Chen Fengyin who was dismissed and put under investigation last month for corruption and abuse of power. Wang previously served as the party chief of Beijing's Chaoyang district since 2016.

In a speech to municipal government officials, Wang said "President Xi has made it clear that corruption threatens the very existence of the Party and the state. We must continue the important work of comprehensively strengthening Party discipline, fighting corruption, purifying the political environment, and building a clean government." Wang highlighted Xi's signature anti-corruption drive and said there would be "zero tolerance" for corrupt officials under his leadership. 

At the same time, Wang said it was time for Beijing to "put the past behind us" and move on from the Chen scandal. "We cannot let the failures and corruption of individuals distract us from the important work ahead," Wang said. He promised administrative reforms to prevent the concentration of power that enabled Chen's misconduct.

The Chen scandal was a major embarrassment for the Beijing government. Chen was found to have abused public funds for lavish banquets, entertainment, and travel for himself and his cronies. Investigators also found several unexplained properties registered under the names of Chen's relatives. Chen's downfall showcased how Xi's anti-corruption campaign is penetrating into local governments.

Wang's appointment is seen as an opportunity for Beijing to turn the page and start afresh under new leadership. However, Wang will still have to navigate the tricky situation of reporting to and pleasing both Xi Jinping nationally and Cai Qi, Beijing's party chief, locally. Achieving bureaucratic reforms and changes within Beijing's government will be challenging.
