Chinese Court Accepts Lawsuit by Veteran Dissident but Finding Defence Lawyer Proves Difficult 

A court in Beijing has accepted a lawsuit filed by prominent Chinese dissident and human rights activist Gao Zhisheng, who is seeking compensation for years of alleged harassment and abuse at the hands of Chinese authorities. The lawsuit names several government agencies and officials as defendants for violating Gao’s rights through forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention over the past 15 years.

However, Gao has struggled to find a lawyer willing to represent him in the politically sensitive case. At least two prominent human rights lawyers he approached declined to represent him, saying the authorities had warned them not to take the case. Gao has been an outspoken critic of the Communist Party and has advocated for religious freedom and human rights. This made him a target of government persecution and he has spent years either imprisoned, under house arrest, or at times forcibly disappeared.

In his lawsuit, Gao alleges that between 2005 to 2017, he was repeatedly detained for months at a time, often in isolated confinement and deprived of food and sleep for long periods. He was also physically abused and threatened, with officials warning him to cease his activism and advocacy. His family members were also harassed and threatened. At one point, Gao disappeared for over a year as authorities secretly detained him without notifying his family or lawyers.

Despite the setbacks in finding proper legal counsel, Gao remains determined to pursue his case to shed light on the tactics of harassment and torture employed by Chinese officials against critics and dissidents. However, few human rights cases in China proceed to trial, let alone end in rulings against government interests. With the courts under tight control of the Communist Party, Gao faces slim chances of success despite the moral power of his claims. The case highlights the deep flaws in China’s legal and political system that sees rule of law and justice often bend to the demands of the party.
