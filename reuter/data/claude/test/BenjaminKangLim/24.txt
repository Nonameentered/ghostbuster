China Denounces Britain's Protests Over Hong Kong Laws as Unreasonable and Unwise

The Chinese government today sharply criticized Britain for protesting new security laws imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Britain's objections were "unreasonable and unwise" and amounted to interference in China's internal affairs. 

The British government has expressed "deep concern" over the new laws that ban secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces in Hong Kong. The laws allow Chinese security agencies to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time. Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997 under an agreement that guaranteed certain democratic freedoms for the city until 2047.

"The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of 'supervision' over Hong Kong," the Chinese spokesman said. "Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. The legislation for safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong SAR is purely China's internal affair that no foreign country has the right to interfere with."

The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, summoned the Chinese ambassador in London this week to express Britain's concerns over the erosion of liberties in Hong Kong. The new laws "are in direct conflict" with China's international obligations under the agreement that transferred control of Hong Kong from Britain to China, Mr. Raab said.

In an editorial, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper denounced the "pompous and arrogant" British response. "London tried to act like a boss but only embarrassed itself," the editorial said. "Its sway over Hong Kong has long gone."

The security laws were imposed without debate by Hong Kong's own legislature and took effect on June 30, the 23rd anniversary of the end of British rule. They give Beijing sweeping powers to quash dissent and curb civil liberties in the Asian financial hub.

The laws have been widely criticized by Western governments and human rights groups. President Trump's national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, called them a "death knell" for Hong Kong's autonomy.
