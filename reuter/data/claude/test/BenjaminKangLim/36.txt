Chinese police arrest suspected ringleader of deadly Xinjiang riot

Police in China's far western Xinjiang region announced today the arrest of a key suspect believed to be the ringleader of a riot last month that left at least 22 people dead. The suspect, Ablimit Tursun, is an ethnic Uyghur and was allegedly behind the planning and organization of the riot in the Xinjiang city of Khotan on June 12. 

The riot began as a protest against police harassment of Muslim Uyghur women wearing headscarves but soon descended into violence. Angry crowds attacked government buildings with Molotov cocktails and knives, and several police officers were among the dead. Chinese authorities blamed the violence on "terrorists and extremists" and launched a dragnet search for suspects across the region. Over 200 people have been detained for questioning about potential links to the plot.

Tursun's arrest is seen as a major breakthrough by Chinese police. According to an official statement, Tursun radicalized unemployed young Uyghur men and incited them to carry out jihad against Chinese "oppression." Police claim to have video evidence showing Tursun directing the crowds to attack police and military vehicles during the riot. They also found weapons and extremist propaganda in Tursun's home.

The riot was the deadliest in Xinjiang since 2009 riots in the region's capital Urumqi left nearly 200 dead. Xinjiang is home to the Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority who speak a Turkic language and have long chafed under Beijing's heavy-handed rule. The Chinese government has tried to quell unrest through measures restricting religious freedom and cultural expression while offering economic incentives to the majority Han Chinese to resettle in Xinjiang.

Experts said the latest riot signals continuing tensions in Xinjiang despite the Chinese government's vision of turning the region into a trade and economic hub for neighboring Central and South Asia. "There are deep-rooted issues of discrimination and human rights abuses in Xinjiang that need to be addressed," said Amnesty International's China researcher Peter Irwin. "Arresting ringleaders will not achieve real stability if people's basic rights continue to be denied."

The arrest of Tursun is a victory that Chinese authorities will likely trumpet, but Xinjiang remains a powder keg and further unrest seems inevitable without political and civil reforms. For now, police say they will continue their harsh security crackdown, and Tursun will face charges of inciting terror and illegal religious activity.
