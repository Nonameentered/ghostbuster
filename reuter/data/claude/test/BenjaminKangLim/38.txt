Riot in China's Xinjiang region leaves 10 dead, officials pledge to combat separatism 

A riot broke out on Sunday in China's northwestern Xinjiang region, leaving at least 10 people dead and dozens injured. The violence occurred in the city of Kashgar, a historic Silk Road outpost near China's border with Kyrgyzstan. According to state media, a group of assailants attacked government buildings with knives and bombs, killing several security officials and bystanders. Police shot and killed five of the attackers and arrested three others. 

The Xinjiang region is home to a majority Muslim Uighur ethnic group and has long been a hotbed of ethnic tensions. The Chinese government claimed the assailants were separatists seeking to destabilize the region. "The attackers raised the flag of 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement' at a local police station after the riot, showing they were terrorists," said a spokesperson for the Kashgar government. East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is a Uighur separatist group that China banned as a terrorist organization.

Beijing has instituted tight controls on Xinjiang, restricting religious freedom and placing security cameras in mosques and public spaces. The Chinese government fears the spread of radical Islam and has come under international criticism for interning over one million Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in detention camps. Critics argue China's policies limit cultural expression and worsen resentment towards the central government.  

Officials pledged to double down on combating what they call the "three evils" of separatism, terrorism and extremism in Xinjiang. "We will deepen the crackdown on infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces at home and abroad," said Chen Quanguo, Communist Party chief of Xinjiang. The riot in Kashgar reflects the "grave and complex anti-terror situation" in Xinjiang, he said.

The violence comes at a sensitive time as China prepares to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing is increasingly anxious about any threats—real or perceived—to the Communist Party's control over Xinjiang. Sunday's riot is likely to lead to even tighter security clampdowns across the region. For the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, Kashgar's bloody outburst may yield an already suffocating vise grip become utterly inescapable.
