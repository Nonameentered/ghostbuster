China jails two Mongolians for separatism and espionage, say human rights group Amnesty International  

Two Mongolian activists were sentenced to lengthy prison terms in China this week for "separatism" and "espionage", according to human rights group Amnesty International. 

Hada, 59, and his son Uiles, 35, were tried separately in closed-door trials in the Inner Mongolian capital of Hohhot. Hada was sentenced to 15 years in prison for "separatism", while Uiles received a 10-year sentence for "espionage". The sentences are believed to be the heaviest handed down to Mongol rights activists in recent years.

Hada founded the Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance in 1992 to promote Mongolian culture and push for greater autonomy in Inner Mongolia, a predominantly ethnic Mongol region in northern China. He has already spent around two decades in prison and detention for his activism. His son Uiles has advocated for his release.

Amnesty International condemned the sentences, calling the charges "trumped up" and the trials "grossly unfair". The group says Hada and Uiles were denied access to lawyers of their choice and that the hearings were held behind closed doors. 

"These shocking sentences demonstrate how far the Chinese authorities will go to crush any form of dissent or call for autonomy in Inner Mongolia," said Amnesty International's China Researcher Patrick Poon.

There are around 6 million ethnic Mongols living in China, many in Inner Mongolia. They complain of economic and political marginalization, as well as restrictions on Mongolian language and culture. Activists calling for more autonomy or self-determination are routinely detained and imprisoned.

"The Chinese government should stop arbitrarily detaining and sentencing Mongol rights defenders like Hada and Uiles for peacefully exercising their human rights," said Poon. 

Amnesty called for Hada and Uiles' immediate and unconditional release, and for the Chinese government to end intimidation and restrictions against Mongol rights activists.

There has been no comment from the Chinese government on the sentences, though Beijing insists minority groups like Mongolians enjoy full rights in China. The government rejects criticism of its human rights record, saying it governs according to law and cracks down on only a small number of "criminals" that threaten state security.
