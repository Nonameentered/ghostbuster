Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin reaches out to Taiwanese political parties for suggestions on peaceful reunification 

In a surprise move, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin this week sent letters to leaders of major Taiwanese political parties inviting their input and suggestions on ways to achieve "peaceful reunification" between China and Taiwan. The letters, sent on Monday, mark the first time the Chinese leadership has directly reached out to Taiwan's political establishment since Beijing broke off official contact with Taipei in 1995.

The gesture appears aimed at portraying China as willing to listen to diverse political voices in Taiwan to find a mutually agreeable path to bringing the island under mainland control. However, the overture was quickly rebuffed by most of the parties, which remain deeply distrustful of Beijing's intentions. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party said China needed to respect Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy and that reunification was "out of the question." The leading opposition party, the Kuomintang, said China should abandon the use of force against Taiwan before political dialogue could resume.

The Chinese initiative comes at a time of heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Since the election of pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, China has ramped up military exercises and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist that the island—which has been de facto independent for 70 years—is a province of China awaiting reunification. However, recent public opinion polls show the vast majority of Taiwanese prefer maintaining the status quo of de facto independence. 

In his letters, Jiang said Beijing was willing to be "flexible" and "listen carefully" to different views on promoting relations between the sides. However, he reiterated China's long-held stance that "in the end, we will achieve the great goal of the motherland's unification." Analysts said the conflicting messages were unlikely to convince Taiwanese of Beijing's good intentions. Still, some argued the outreach effort signaled a willingness to take a less confrontational approach, at least in rhetoric, to advance China's agenda of unification.
