China Warns of Stock Market Crash Similar to 1929 Wall Street Collapse 

Beijing, China—Senior officials in China warned of potential instability in the country's stock markets that could lead to a crash of similar magnitude to the 1929 Wall Street stock market collapse. In a rare statement, Liu He, China's vice premier and top economic adviser, cautioned investors about “bubble risks” in Chinese stocks. The warnings come amidst a huge run-up in Chinese stock prices that has led the Shanghai Composite index to gain over 50% since January 1.

Specifically, Liu warned investors not to borrow money or mortgage their homes to buy stocks, a practice that was common before China's last stock market crash in 2015. "From a long-term perspective, China's economic fundamentals are good,” Liu said. “But we should not ignore the risks of fluctuations in the stock market." Other officials echoed Liu's warnings about leverage and risk in recent public statements. 

The warnings highlight leaders' concerns that reckless speculation could threaten China's financial stability. Memories of the 2015 crash, in which the Shanghai Composite plunged more than 40% in just a few months, are still fresh. The collapse erased over $5 trillion in market value and caused widespread economic damage. China deployed unprecedented interventions to stem the crisis, including banning many investors from selling shares altogether.

Despite the warnings, China's stock markets rose today to the highest level in over two years. The Shanghai Composite closed up 2.3%, as many retail investors continued to plow money into stocks. China's markets have been on a tear this year, spurred by optimism about the economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic and interest in the country's fast-growing technology sector. 

However, some analysts warn that China's stock markets appear to be in a speculative frenzy that may end badly.  "There are signs of overheating in pockets of China's stock market, and potentially destabilizing speculation,” said Andrew Collier of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. In particular, technology and healthcare stocks with weak fundamentals have soared in recent months. The Kweichow Moutai company, a maker of baijiu liquor, has seen its stock price triple since last year, making it China's most valuable company.

Regulators in China have taken some steps to curb speculation, mostly by tightening controls on margin lending. But officials are also wary of directly popping any stock market bubbles and face difficulties reigning in frenzied retail investors. Any strong actions could provoke public anger if stocks do crash sharply. For now, regulators mostly appear to be jawboning the market with warnings about high valuations and leverage. However, if such warnings fail to cool speculation, China's government may have to take more assertive action to avoid an even more damaging crash, even at the risk of ending the rally.
