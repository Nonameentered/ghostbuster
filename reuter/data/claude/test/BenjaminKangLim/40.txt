Negotiations over North Korean Defector Hwang Jang-yop Continue Between China and South Korea

Negotiations between Chinese and South Korean officials over the fate of high-level North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop continued today as tensions rose between the countries. Hwang, an 87-year-old former aide to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il, defected to South Korea in 1997 and has since been an outspoken critic of the North Korean government.

Hwang's vocal criticism of North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-Un, who took power after his father's death in 2011, has raised concerns about retaliation against South Korea, some analysts argue. However, others say China should uphold established international law and norms by allowing Hwang safe passage to the country of his choosing, particularly given his advanced age.

China is in a difficult position as it aims to balance its relationships with South Korea and North Korea, which also tightly controls much of its border with China. If China allows Hwang to move to South Korea, it risks angering North Korea. But if it returns Hwang to North Korean control, China may damage its diplomatic relations with South Korea and violate international laws against refoulement or forced repatriation of refugees.

Hwang served as Chairman of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, making him one of the highest-ranking officials to ever defect from the country. The vast majority of North Korean defectors come from poorer, rural areas, so Hwang's high profile and knowledge of the inner workings of Kim Jong-Il's regime make him an extremely valuable asset to South Korea. However, his insights also make him a prime target for retaliation by North Korea, according to experts.

Upon defecting in 1997, Hwang said "(North Korea) is a society far removed from humanity, full of lies and deception." He has provided key insights into the cult of personality surrounding the Kim family dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations. In 2010, North Korea unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Hwang, highlighting the threat he is seen as by Pyongyang.

If China refuses to allow Hwang passage to South Korea, it may prompt international criticism over violation of international refugee laws. South Korea has pushed China for months to allow Hwang entry, but China has claimed the decision is complicated by various factors. Talks over the issue are set to continue this week, according to officials from both sides. However, time may be running out to find a resolution given Hwang's age and frail condition, human rights groups argue. The fate of the high-profile defector now sits in a precarious position amid a complex diplomatic struggle.
