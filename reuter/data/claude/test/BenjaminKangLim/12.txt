Deng Xiaoping may not be able to attend Hong Kong handover, says Beijing Vice-Mayor 

Beijing, China - Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, may not be well enough to attend the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1st, according to Beijing Vice-Mayor Liu Jingfeng. In an interview with Hong Kong journalists, Liu said Deng’s health has deteriorated in recent months and his doctors have advised minimizing tiring public engagements.

Deng, 92, was the chief architect of China’s economic reforms and opening up that began in 1978. He has not appeared in public since February this year and there have been persistent rumors about his ill health. Liu’s comments are the first official acknowledgement that Deng may miss major upcoming events due to frail health. 

The handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China after 155 years of colonial rule is a hugely symbolic moment. Deng’s presence at the handover ceremony was seen as important to showcase China’s triumph in regaining sovereignty over the prosperous city. His possible absence casts uncertainty on the handover celebrations and signals a power vacuum at the top leadership in Beijing.

“Deng’s doctors have advised that given his age, it may be too taxing for him to attend the Hong Kong handover ceremony on July 1,” Liu said. “But of course, if his health improves and he feels up to it, we very much hope he can be there to witness this important moment in Chinese and Hong Kong history.”

Liu added that the final decision would depend on Deng’s medical team and family members based on his health conditions closer to the handover date. “The most important thing is for Comrade Deng to take good care of his health,” he said.
