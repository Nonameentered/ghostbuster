China warns of potential stock market crash similar to 1929 Wall Street collapse   

The Chinese government issued an ominous warning today about the potential for a massive stock market crash similar in scale to the 1929 Wall Street collapse. In a rare statement, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said that “irrational optimism” in the country’s stock markets could lead to a precipitous drop in share prices. “Investors should be wary of the potential risks of a sudden adjustment,” the statement read.

The warning comes as China’s main stock indexes have surged over 60% in the past year, fueled by speculative retail investors and government stimulus measures. The run-up in stock prices has led to fears that Chinese markets are in a bubble that could burst dramatically. A market crash on the scale of the 1929 crash that ushered in the Great Depression in the U.S. would deal a major blow to China’s economy and global growth. 

“The level of speculation in China’s stock markets is unprecedented,” said Mark Jiang, a professor of finance at Tsinghua University. “Ordinary people are taking on huge amounts of risk thinking that stocks can only go up. But when the bubble bursts, the losses will be enormous.” The China Securities Regulatory Commission raised margin requirements for brokers and took other steps to curb speculative trading last week, to little effect. 

Many analysts warn that China’s markets exhibit some of the same characteristics that preceded the U.S. stock market crash of 1929. In the roaring 1920s, new technologies like radio, automobiles and motion pictures stoked huge enthusiasm for stocks among ordinary Americans. Buying stocks on margin with loaned money was commonplace, and the market lacked sufficient regulations. The crash led to a 30% drop in stock prices and shattered confidence in financial markets for an entire generation.

The potential fallout from a crash of Chinese markets could spread far beyond the country's borders, given China's large role in the global economy. The rest of Asia, in particular, is vulnerable to contagion from Chinese markets. "If the bubble in China bursts, the impact will be felt by markets across the world," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. However, other analysts argue that China's tight control over the flow of money in and out of the country could allow it to contain the damage from a stock market crash. The majority view is that volatility will increase in the coming months as the level of speculation in China's stock markets remains intense. Investors around the globe will be nervously monitoring markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen for signs of the bubble bursting.
