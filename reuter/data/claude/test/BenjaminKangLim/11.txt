Former Beijing Party Boss Chen Xitong Could Face Punishment for Dereliction of Duty, Says Top Official  

Beijing, China - Chen Xitong, the former Communist Party chief of Beijing who was imprisoned on corruption charges, is facing possible punishment for neglecting his duties during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, a top official said on Friday. 

Chen, who led the city government during the protests, has been accused of failing to take responsibility for maintaining stability at the time. His actions "warrant reflection," said Wang Huning, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party's top decision-making body. Wang's comments suggest that Chen, now 84, may face some form of reprimand for his role in the government's response to the protests.

Chen served as Beijing's Communist Party secretary from 1983 to 1992. During his tenure, the city government was widely criticized for its response to the student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. The military crackdown on June 4, 1989 resulted in hundreds of deaths and Chen was blamed by party hard-liners for not acting swiftly enough to stop the protests before they grew in size.

In 1995, Chen was sentenced to 16 years in prison on charges of accepting bribes and "dereliction of duty.” The unusually harsh sentence was seen by many as political retribution for Chen's perceived failings during the Tiananmen crisis. He was released on medical parole in 2006 but remains under close surveillance.

Wang's comments come amid a broader effort by China's leader, Xi Jinping, to demand greater loyalty and discipline from the Communist Party elite. "Chen Xitong's dereliction of responsibility and duty warrants reflection,” Wang said during a speech to senior officials, according to a summary published by Xinhua, the state news agency. "We must learn profound lessons from Chen Xitong's case."  

Chen could face internal party punishments as well as the denial of medical and living benefits typically afforded to senior retired officials, analysts said. His fate is being closely watched for clues on how far Xi Jinping may go to punish those he deems as being insufficiently loyal to the party. 

"Xi is using Chen Xitong to send a warning to anyone, even those long retired, that past disloyalty and mistakes can still be punished," said Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing. "No one, no matter how senior, is safe."
