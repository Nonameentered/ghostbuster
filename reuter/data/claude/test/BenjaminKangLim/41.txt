Chinese police move North Korean diplomats away as top-level official seeks asylum in South Korean mission in Beijing 

In a dramatic development, a high-ranking North Korean official sought asylum today in South Korea's embassy in Beijing, according to sources familiar with the situation. The move threatens to deal yet another blow to North Korea's isolated regime and further strain relations between old allies Beijing and Pyongyang.

Sources inside China's Ministry of State Security confirmed that a North Korean official, believed to hold the rank of vice minister, entered the South Korean embassy in Beijing this morning and requested political asylum. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

Within hours, Chinese police had surrounded the South Korean embassy, cleared the area of pedestrians and other vehicles, and moved North Korean diplomats away from the facility. China's Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the events, stating that it was an internal matter. However, the moves are a signal that China likely wants to contain the potential fallout and prevent any attempts by North Korea to forcibly retrieve the official.

The high-level defection comes just weeks before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is set to hold a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam, and highlights the uncertainty and opacity within North Korea's government.Late last year, a senior North Korean military official defected across the heavily fortified border with South Korea. The defection of a vice minister in Beijing, however, would mark the highest level of defection in years and deal a major blow to North Korea.

South Korea's government also declined to officially comment on the events in Beijing but the national security advisor was seen entering the president's residence, signaling the matter was being discussed at the highest levels.South Korean analysts said that if confirmed, the defection of such a high-level official could reveal new insights into the inner workings of Kim Jong-un's regime and potentially lead to a purge within North Korea's Ministry of State Security and Military Intelligence Bureau.

The events threaten to strain China's already frayed relationship with North Korea. China is North Korea's only ally and major trading partner but relations have soured over Pyongyang's repeated nuclear and missile tests in violation of international sanctions. There are signs China has embraced global sanctions on North Korea in recent years. However, Beijing still wants to prevent a collapse of the regime and a potential outflow of refugees across its border.
