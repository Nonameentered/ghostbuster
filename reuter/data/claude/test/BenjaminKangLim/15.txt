China Vows to Crack Down on Economic Disorder, Citing Tax Evasion and Smuggling as Some Ills Costing Billions of Dollars a Year 

The Chinese government pledged today to intensify its crackdown on unlawful economic activities that it says are costing the country billions of dollars a year in lost taxes and undermining the state-dominated economy.

Vice Premier Hu Chunhua said at a meeting of senior economic and security officials that the government would take aim at tax evasion, smuggling and counterfeit goods. He called for stronger enforcement of laws and warned that officials who failed to curb illegal activities would be held accountable.

"We must pursue and investigate economic crimes rigorously, thoroughly and systematically," Mr. Hu said, according to a transcript of his remarks published by Xinhua, the state-run news agency. Tax evasion alone costs China as much as $385 billion a year, he said.

The vow to crack down on economic misdeeds reflects Beijing's increasing focus on the quality and sustainability of China's growth, not just its speed. The country's slowing economy has made tax revenues more crucial to managing debt and paying for social programs. At the same time, illicit activity like fraud and smuggling remains pervasive, undercutting key industries like manufacturing.

The crackdown also comes as China faces pressure from trading partners to curb practices like intellectual property theft and reduce government subsidies for domestic companies. China's trade war with the United States has underscored its dependence on export-oriented sectors like tech that rely on open markets and rule of law.

Among the specific goals outlined today was stopping the production and sale of counterfeit goods, which Mr. Hu said had become a "prominent problem" that harms innovation and consumers. He also cited the smuggling of solid waste as an area that requires a "substantial reduction" in criminal cases. The smuggling of scrap like used plastic or paper into China for recycling has caused pollution and higher costs for waste management.

The Chinese government has played a cat-and-mouse game for years with underground economic activity. Sweeping crackdowns on corruption and shadow banking have yielded short-term results, for instance, but illicit behavior often just pops up elsewhere. Local governments are often complicit in illegal activity, undermining enforcement for the benefit of jobs or tax revenue.
