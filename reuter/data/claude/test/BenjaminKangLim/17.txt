China's Legal System Undergoes Sweeping Amendments to Address Fairness Concerns in Criminal Trials 

The Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress today approved sweeping amendments to the country's legal codes aimed at addressing long-standing concerns about unfairness in the criminal justice system. The changes include adding more explicit rights for defendants, increasing the role of defense attorneys, and mandating audio and video recordings of interrogations.

Legal experts hailed the reforms as an important step forward in strengthening rule of law in China and increasing public trust in the justice system. At the same time, they noted that putting the broad principles of the amendments into practice throughout China's vast court system will require an immense effort to change mindsets and habits.

For years, human rights groups and legal scholars have criticized China's justice system for favoring prosecutors, providing little protection for the rights of the accused, and tolerating forced confessions and unjust verdicts. Cases of wrongful convictions based on torture or corruption have frequently made headlines. 

The amended criminal procedure code, which takes effect January 1, requires investigators to electronically record all interrogations, provide greater access to defense attorneys during the investigative phase, and notify families within 24 hours when a suspect is detained. It also prohibits eliciting confessions through torture and expands the exclusionary rule to cover illegally obtained evidence. The code enshrines the presumption of innocence and the right against self-incrimination.

Some Chinese legal experts remain skeptical, however, about whether authorities will follow the code, especially in politically sensitive cases. "There is a big gap between law on paper and law in action in China," said Chen Guangcheng, a prominent civil rights lawyer who fled China in 2012. "Without judicial independence and an end to political interference, the pretty words of the law will not be realized."
