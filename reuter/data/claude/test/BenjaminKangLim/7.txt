China pledges to open key sectors to foreign investment in push for WTO entry  

China pledged to open up key parts of its economy to foreign investment as part of its bid to join the World Trade Organization. In a long-awaited move, China released revised draft rules covering foreign investment in sectors like telecommunications, entertainment, distribution, education, and professional services. The new rules promise to relax restrictions on foreign ownership, allow wholly foreign-owned enterprises in more industries, and streamline the approval process for foreign investments. 

The policy changes have been closely watched as a sign of China's commitment to further opening its economy as part of its efforts to join the WTO. The U.S. and other Western nations have demanded that China increase market access for foreign companies as a condition for WTO entry. The revised draft rules released today appear to be a direct response, aiming to address key concerns around investment restrictions and inequality of treatment for foreign companies operating in China.

Specifically, China pledged to lift ownership caps in telecommunications, allow 100% foreign ownership of distribution businesses, and increase foreign stakes in joint ventures in sectors like accounting, legal, and education services. The rules would also eliminate case-by-case approvals for many investments and promises an "equal competitive environment" for foreign enterprises. If implemented, the changes would mark a substantial opening of China's services sector, which contributes an increasing share of China's GDP and employs hundreds of millions of people.

However, some analysts remain cautious about how much progress the new rules really represent given China's history of failing to fully implement policy changes and its tendency to favor domestic companies. There is also uncertainty around how the rules would be interpreted and applied in practice by Chinese regulators and whether there would be additional barriers erected to protect Chinese companies. Furthermore, key areas of China's economy like banking, resources, and media remain relatively closed to foreign investment.
