China's Communist Party Boss Urges Taiwan to Avoid Creating New Obstacles in Ties 

BEIJING—President Xi Jinping issued a stern message to Taiwan, urging its leaders to avoid taking actions that may further strain cross-straits ties and jeopardize rapid improvements in the economic and cultural relationship between China and Taiwan.

Speaking at the opening of the 19th Communist Party Congress, Xi warned Taiwan against creating new obstacles towards reunification. “We will not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures” to prevent Taiwan from asserting independence, Xi said. 

His comments come at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei. The Democratic Progressive Party government led by President Tsai Ing-wenhas refused to endorse the “1992 Consensus” that acknowledges Taiwan and China as part of one country. Beijing cut off official communication with Taipei soon after Tsai took office last year.

Economic ties, however, have continued to deepen. China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, with billions invested in Taiwan's economy. Nearly 3 million Chinese tourists visited Taiwan last year, boosting the island's tourism industry. Direct flights between China and Taiwan began last month for the first time in six decades.

But Beijing is impatient for political reunification and opposes any recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty on the global stage. Xi called on Taiwan to clearly recognize the 1992 Consensus and said China would consider taking further retaliatory measures if Taiwan continues to test Beijing’s “red line” on independence. 

“We are ready to share development opportunities on the mainland with Taiwan compatriots first,” Xi said. But he added that China's armed forces have the “confidence and capability” to defeat any attempts to split Taiwan from China.

Taiwan's presidential office expressed regret over Xi's comments, saying the call for reunification disregards reality and the differences in political systems across the Taiwan Strait. While maintaining the status quo, Taiwan will “strengthen national defense and continue to adhere to democracy and freedom," a spokesperson said. 

The mixed messages reflect the complex and increasingly fractious relationship between the Communist giant and the self-governed island democracy. Absent a political resolution, both sides will likely continue using both the carrot and the stick in pursuit of their competing visions for Taiwan's future.
