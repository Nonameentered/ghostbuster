China Introduces Rules Allowing Direct Shipping Links with Taiwan Despite Decades-Old Ban

China announced new rules today allowing direct shipping routes between China and Taiwan, marking a major policy shift that strengthens economic ties despite decades of political tensions. 

The new rules will permit Chinese and Taiwanese shipping companies to directly transport goods and passengers across the Taiwan Strait without having to stop at a third port. Currently, cargo and people traveling between mainland China and Taiwan need to transit through ports in Hong Kong or Macau due to a longstanding Chinese ban.

The policy change is the latest in a series of economic overtures by Beijing to the self-governing island of Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. While China and Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party support eventual unification, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has called for China to respect Taiwan’s sovereignty. 

The new shipping rules are expected to save time and costs for companies trading goods and transporting people across the strait. Travelers flying between Shanghai and Taipei, for example, will no longer need to make a costly detour to Hong Kong. The policy may boost bilateral trade, which totaled $181.6 billion last year.

However, the new policy has raised concerns in Taiwan about overreliance on China and threats to national security. China could use the shipping routes to exert political influence, some analysts argue. There are also worries that small Taiwanese shipping firms may struggle to compete with larger Chinese counterparts.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said it will evaluate the new rules to determine their impact and take appropriate countermeasures. A spokesperson said any new cross-strait transportation links must not harm Taiwan’s interests or security.

The policy announcement comes just weeks after China unveiled measures to attract top tech talent from Taiwan with lucrative benefits like tax breaks, research grants and housing subsidies. China’s leader Xi Jinping has said that Taiwan should not rely on foreigners and should work toward unification with China.  

However, polls show few Taiwanese support immediate unification, and China’s actions have raised fears of encroachment on Taiwan’s political system. The question of unification versus independence continues to polarize Taiwanese society.  

The new shipping rules will take effect on December 1. Maritime authorities in China and Taiwan are expected to release more details on regulations and implementation in the coming weeks. Many analysts will be closely monitoring how the policy reshapes trade and economic ties between the historical rivals.
