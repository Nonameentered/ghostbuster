Chinese authorities seal off town in Xinjiang following deadly separatist Moslem riot 

The western Chinese town of Kyzylsu in the restive Xinjiang province was placed under lockdown by authorities today following violent clashes between police and suspected Uyghur separatists that left at least 12 people dead and dozens injured.

According to state media reports, a group of knife-wielding assailants attacked government buildings and police officers in Kyzylsu’s main bazaar yesterday evening. The attackers appear to be from the predominantly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority group, which makes up about half of Xinjiang’s population of 22 million. Many Uyghurs chafe under Beijing’s authoritarian rule and there have been sporadic outbreaks of violence in recent years. 

Police opened fire on the attackers, killing seven on the spot and wounding at least five others. Two police officers and three civilians were also killed in the melee. Security forces have imposed a complete lockdown of Kyzylsu, blocking all entry and exit points into the town. A statement from the regional Communist Party spokesman said the situation was now "under control" but the lockdown was necessary to conduct a "comprehensive security sweep" for any remaining militants.

The attack is the deadliest this year in a surge of violence that Chinese authorities have blamed on "Islamic extremists and separatists." Uyghur exile groups argue that China's repressive policies restricting religious and cultural freedoms in Xinjiang are fueling unrest. Kyzylsu has seen clashes before, including a deadly riot in 2013. But the increasing sophistication of the attacks worries China's security establishment.

Yesterday's riot came just weeks before the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting. Chinese authorities have banned civil servants, teachers, and students from fasting during Ramadan in previous years. The government sees some Islamic practices as a vehicle for extremism and separatism.

Many Uyghurs complain about pervasive discrimination, lack of economic opportunities, and restrictions on their religion and culture in Xinjiang. However, China insists that its policies in the province promote ethnic harmony and boost economic development. The government rejects accusations by rights groups and Western nations that it has oppressed Uyghurs and violated their basic human rights.  

In response to the latest violence, China is likely to further tighten its grip on Xinjiang, expanding surveillance of residents and cracking down on any sign of dissent or religious extremism. But root causes of Uyghur discontent and separatism may remain unaddressed, portending more instability ahead.
