IFRC Appeals for Food Aid as North Korea Faces Impending Disaster 

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has issued an urgent appeal for funding to provide food aid to North Korea as the country faces severe food shortages due to droughts and flooding. The IFRC warned that over 10 million people in North Korea are facing “an impending disaster” due to a lack of food, clean water and sanitation.

North Korea has experienced reduced agricultural production over successive years due to droughts, heatwaves, and flooding. The IFRC reported that North Korea received around half its average rainfall between January and August this year, which has impacted staple crops like rice, maize, potatoes and soybeans. At the same time, flooding in other areas has damaged infrastructure and crops. The lack of rainfall and extreme weather events have made 2019 an “exceptionally difficult” year for food production in North Korea according to the IFRC. 

“Urgent measures are needed to support these communities in North Korea through food aid and improved access to basic services like clean water, sanitation and healthcare,” said Mohammed Abdiker, director of Health and Care at the IFRC. The organization has requested over $5 million in funding to support at least 350,000 of the most vulnerable people with food aid, disaster relief, water and sanitation for the next six months.

North Korea has struggled with food shortages and famine for decades due to economic mismanagement and natural disasters. Current UN estimates indicate 40% of the population are undernourished. The IFRC warned that lack of action now could lead to a “dramatic increase” in hunger and disease in the coming months, especially among children, pregnant women and the elderly. The international community needs to act fast to avoid catastrophic loss of life, the IFRC said. Its disaster relief efforts will start in October if enough funds can be raised in time. The coming months will be critical to prepare for and meet humanitarian needs over the winter, the organization cautioned.
