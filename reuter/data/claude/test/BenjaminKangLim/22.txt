Beijing accuses US of using Dalai Lama to Westernise and break up China 

Beijing has accused the United States of conspiring with the Dalai Lama to destabilise China by promoting Western ideology and undermining Chinese rule in Tibet. The allegations came as the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, was hosted by the US ambassador to India at an event to mark 60 years since he fled Tibet.

In an editorial, the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper said the Dalai Lama was engaged in “separatist activities” under the guise of religion. It accused the US of trying to “westernise and split” China by supporting him. “For the sake of its own strategic interests, Washington is disregarding China's concerns and the historical facts,” the newspaper said. 

The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He promotes autonomy for Tibet rather than independence. But China regards him as a dangerous separatist and has barred him from returning home.

At an event in New Delhi on Wednesday, the US ambassador praised the Dalai Lama as a teacher of “tolerance, compassion and peace”. A US official said the ambassador's attendance was “consistent with the US policy”. But China accused the US of using religion to interfere in China's internal affairs. China took control of Tibet in 1951 and rejects criticism of its rule there by governments and rights groups.

Tibet scholar Robert Barnett warned that China's accusations could damage prospects for easing its tensions with the Dalai Lama's supporters and exiled Tibetan groups. “China is accusing the US here but its target is really India and its tacit tolerance of the Dalai Lama's government in exile,” he said.

The dispute marks the latest episode in deteriorating US-China relations. The two sides are locked in conflicts over trade, human rights, technology and China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. US support for Taiwan and criticism of China's treatment of its Muslim minorities have also angered Beijing.

In its response, the US State Department said its concerns about restrictions on religious freedom in China were well known. It added that the US did not support Tibetan independence but urged China to respect rights and preserve Tibet’s unique culture.
