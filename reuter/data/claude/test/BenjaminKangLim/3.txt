China Pledges to Open Up Insurance, Stock, Retail, Wholesale, and Banking Sectors to Foreign Investment in Pursuit of WTO Entry   

Beijing - In a bid to gain entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), China has agreed to significantly open up its financial services sector to foreign investment over the next five years. The move opens potentially lucrative new opportunities for foreign firms in China's large but heavily regulated markets.

China's WTO agreement, announced last week, would allow foreign firms to own up to 51% of insurance companies in two years and up to 70% after five years. Currently, the country caps foreign ownership of insurers at 24%. Foreign brokers and fund managers will also be allowed to establish joint ventures or wholly owned companies in China to trade stocks, bonds, and commodity futures. Restrictions on the scope of business and geographical presence of foreign firms will also be lifted incrementally.

In the banking sector, China agreed to remove restrictions on the business scope of foreign banks. They will be allowed to conduct domestic currency business with Chinese companies two years after WTO entry and with Chinese individuals after five years. Wholly foreign-owned banks will enjoy essentially the same rights as Chinese banks. China also committed to issue more stringent rules on the licensing and regulation of domestic banks to address the problem of bad loans and increase the competitiveness of the sector.

For the retail and wholesale sectors, foreign wholesalers and retailers will be permitted to undertake direct distribution and set up their own stores without going through a Chinese middleman. All ownership restrictions on wholesaling and retailing distribution companies will be lifted within three years of WTO entry. This opens up China's vast consumer market with 1.3 billion customers.
