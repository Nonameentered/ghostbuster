China Caught in Tough Spot in North-South Korea Dispute Over Defector Seeking Asylum in Beijing 

China finds itself in a difficult position as North and South Korea clash over a North Korean defector who entered a South Korean consulate in China seeking asylum. The defector, who has not been identified, entered the South Korean consulate in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang on Wednesday, according to South Korean officials. South Korea has requested that China allow the individual to travel to South Korea, but China risks angering North Korea if it agrees to the request.

North Korea has demanded that China return the defector, who is believed to be a mid-level official. Granting asylum to the defector would be seen by North Korea as a betrayal by China, its main ally and trading partner. However, refusing to allow the defector to travel to South Korea could damage China’s relations with South Korea and support the view that China turns a blind eye to North Korea’s human rights abuses.

The standoff presents China with a dilemma and highlights its complex relationships with the two Koreas. China provides economic and diplomatic support to North Korea but it also values South Korea as an important trading partner. The situation could worsen already strained ties between Seoul and Beijing, while refusing to hand over the defector would anger Pyongyang.

A spokesperson for South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, which handles inter-Korean relations, said South Korea expects China “to resolve the situation in a humanitarian manner.” However, China has yet to indicate whether it will allow the defector safe passage to South Korea. Past defections have led to retaliation by North Korea, including the apparent public assassination of Kim Jong-un’s half-brother Kim Jong-nam, who was murdered in Malaysia in 2017.
