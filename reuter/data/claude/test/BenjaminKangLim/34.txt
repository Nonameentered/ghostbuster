Chinese authorities seal town in Xinjiang after deadly separatist riot 

Chinese authorities have placed a town in the western region of Xinjiang under lockdown following riots that left dozens of people dead and renewed concerns over ethnic tensions in the troubled area.

The local government in Hoten, a town of 400,000 residents, announced an indefinite curfew and suspended public transportation after violent clashes erupted Tuesday morning. According to state media reports, a group of Uighur separatists attacked government offices with knives and homemade bombs, killing 37 people and injuring more than 100. Police shot and killed 12 attackers, ending the riot after a three-hour standoff. 

Xinjiang is home to about 10 million Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group that comprises about 45 percent of the region’s population. Uighur activists have long complained of oppressive policies that limit their cultural and religious freedoms. While ethnic tensions have simmered for decades, there has been a surge in violence since 2011, prompting Beijing to launch a “strike hard” security campaign. However, heavy-handed measures have further fueled anti-government sentiments.

Tuesday’s attack in Hoten was among the deadliest riots in recent memory in Xinjiang. According to witness accounts, a dozen militants attacked a municipal government building during a meeting of Communist Party officials, throwing explosives into the crowd before rushing in with knives. They then proceeded to loot shops and set cars on fire, spreading chaos through Hoten’s main shopping district. Videos from the scene show plumes of black smoke rising above the city and people running for safety.

The Chinese government condemned the attack as “terrorism” motivated by “separatist thinking.” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday that the militants “are the common enemy of humanity. Their acts should be condemned by all people who uphold justice and value human life.” 

Exile groups advocate for an independent East Turkestan and argue that Uighurs suffer harsh restrictions on their language, culture, and faith under Chinese rule. They claim Beijing’s policies are fueling radicalization, a view shared by some Western scholars. The Chinese government rejects such criticism and blames the violence on extremist groups it says are allied with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.

After the riots, Hoten remains on lockdown as authorities conduct door-to-door searches for accomplices potentially still at large. Amid the volatile situation, communicating with residents has been difficult. But local Uighurs fear Tuesday's violence will only lead to even tighter security and further erosion of civil liberties in Xinjiang.
