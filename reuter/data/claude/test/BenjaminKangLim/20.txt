China Denies Pollution Threat to World Environment, Accuses Developed Countries of Conspiracy

Beijingâ€”The Chinese government today denied that the country's industrialization and rapid economic growth pose a threat to the global environment. In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Western nations of conspiring to undermine China's development by spreading "groundless accusations" about pollution. 

"Certain developed countries are envious of China's economic achievements and are attempting to contain our progress using so-called environmental concerns," the statement read. "They claim China is responsible for pollution and climate change but ignore their own historical responsibility." The statement insisted that China's environmental issues are "manageable" and that developed countries should provide financial and technical assistance rather than "pointing fingers."

China's economy has grown at a breakneck pace over the past few decades, fueled by coal, steel, and cement production as well as manufacturing. While the growth has lifted millions out of poverty, China has become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and faces catastrophic air and water pollution. A recent study found that air pollution contributes to more than 1 million premature deaths in China each year. Deforestation, biodiversity loss, and plastic pollution are other major problems.

The government has pledged to address environmental challenges but is also striving to meet ambitious economic targets. China aims to reach "peak emissions" by 2030 but not before strong growth leads emissions to continue rising for at least another decade. At a virtual climate summit last week, President Xi Jinping said China would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 but did not announce any new policies or targets.

Critics argue China's climate commitments do not match the scale of its pollution problems. "The Chinese government acts as though environmental damage is a necessary byproduct of economic development, but that is a false choice," said Li Junfeng of Greenpeace East Asia. "China has the technology and resources to have both a thriving economy and clean air and water, but lacks the political will to make meaningful change." The spat with Western nations, Li said, is a way to deflect pressure on Beijing rather than address the root causes of the environmental crisis.
