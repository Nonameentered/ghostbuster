Chinese Survey Reveals Deep-Seated Resentment and Fear of Japanese Militarism 

A new survey conducted in China reveals widespread resentment and distrust of Japan due to concerns over resurgent Japanese militarism. The survey, conducted by Horizon Research Consultancy of Beijing, found that more than 80% of Chinese citizens believe Japan has not sufficiently apologized for its World War II aggression against China. Over 70% said they fear Japan is becoming more militaristic, citing recent moves such as expanding the role of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and reinterpreting the pacifist Article 9 of Japan's constitution.

There is a long history of animosity between China and Japan stemming from Japan's brutal occupation of parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s. The survey results highlight how unresolved tensions from that era continue to shape public attitudes in both nations today. "The wounds of the past have not yet healed in China," said Zhou Minjun, a historian at Peking University. "Memories of Japanese atrocities during World War II are still fresh in the minds of many Chinese."

The survey comes at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions in East Asia, as China expands its military and economic clout while Japan and other nations aim to counterbalance Beijing's influence. Some analysts argue current frictions related to territory and trade policies are also stoking nationalism and distrust on both sides. Liu Guoshen, an international relations expert at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said the survey findings show the Chinese public broadly supports a "tough stance" on Japan. "There is a widespread belief that Japan must be contained, that they have not learned from history," Liu said.

In Japan, the results are likely to reinforce perceptions that decades of apologies for its wartime actions have not been sufficient to overcome anti-Japanese enmity in China. At the same time, a growing number of conservative politicians argue Japan has apologized enough already. Analysts say these opposing views make any reconciliation and trust-building between Asia's two largest economies a long and difficult process.
