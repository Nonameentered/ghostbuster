China Warns Britain Over Challenging Hong Kong's Legislature Disbandment in World Court

China issued a stern warning to the UK today over its intention to challenge Beijing's decision to disband Hong Kong's legislature in the International Court of Justice. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement that Hong Kong's political and governance systems are China's internal affairs and that the UK has no right to interfere or take unilateral sanctions. 

Last week, China's National People's Congress passed a resolution allowing the Hong Kong government to disqualify any legislator from office and disband the Legislative Council if it is deemed "failing to fulfill its constitutional duties." Citing national security concerns, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam exercised this power and removed four pro-democracy legislators from the council, prompting the remaining 15 pro-democracy lawmakers to resign en masse in protest.

In response, Britain's foreign secretary said he is exploring options to challenge China's "clear breach" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration that guaranteed Hong Kong's democratic rights. He indicated that bringing China to court at The Hague is being considered. China's foreign ministry slammed Britain's remarks as "wanton interference" in China's internal affairs and said the Joint Declaration is not valid anymore. 

The disbandment of the legislature has been condemned by many Western nations as a further erosion of the "one country, two systems" principle that was meant to protect Hong Kong's autonomy until 2047. But China argues that national security falls entirely under Beijing's purview and it has the right to quash any activity that it deems threatening. The US government has already placed sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials involved in undermining the territory's democratic values and autonomy.

Tensions between Britain and China have escalated recently over various issues including Hong Kong, Huawei, human rights concerns and a citizenship offer for British nationals in Hong Kong. The latest rebuke from China suggests that Britain's options may be limited in pushing back against China's tightening grip on its erstwhile colony without further antagonizing an increasingly assertive Beijing.
