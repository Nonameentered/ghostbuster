Chinese Writers and Academics Petition Communist Party to Save Cultural Relics from Three Gorges Dam Floods 

A group of prominent Chinese writers, academics and activists have sent an open letter to the Communist Party leadership pleading for urgent action to protect cultural relics and heritage sites from rising floodwaters in the Three Gorges Dam reservoir. The petition, signed by more than 100 public figures, warns that ancient temples, tombs and villages in the Yangtze River basin face severe damage as water levels rise to their highest levels since the dam became fully operational in 2012.

The letter calls on the government to allocate emergency funds and mobilize experts to document, reinforce or relocate endangered cultural sites before they are submerged. "These relics are not only valuable cultural assets but also an important foundation for the Chinese civilization," the petition states. The writers and scholars argue that saving this heritage is a "race against time" as the summer flood season approaches. 

The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric power station, was built to generate electricity and tame the Yangtze, China's longest river. However, the 600-kilometer long reservoir has also inundated many archaeological and historical sites, sparking concerns about heritage preservation. Some cultural relics were dismantled and rebuilt on higher ground before the reservoir was filled, but many others remain at risk.

Rainfall has been heavier than usual this year, and the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission recently warned that water levels in the Three Gorges reservoir may exceed 165 meters, the highest since the dam became fully operational in 2012. At this level, the submerged ancient city of Dachang in Hubei province would be almost fully underwater, along with many other sites.

The petitioners argue that measures should be taken to save the endangered relics, such as building temporary dams around them, pumping out water, and strengthening structures. They also call for a campaign to thoroughly document sites and artifacts that cannot be protected before they disappear under the rising reservoir. The Communist Party has not yet publicly responded to the open letter. But activists hope the petition will draw attention to the ongoing challenges of balancing massive infrastructure projects like the Three Gorges Dam with cultural heritage preservation.
