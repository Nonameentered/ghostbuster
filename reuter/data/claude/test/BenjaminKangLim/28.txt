China and US Sign New Textile Agreement to Increase Market Access, But Trade Gap Expected to Remain Wide  

China and the United States signed a new trade agreement today aimed at increasing US market access to China’s textile and apparel sector. The multi-year agreement will gradually decrease US tariffs on Chinese-made clothing and fabrics, providing cost benefits to US retailers and consumers. However, the agreement is not expected to substantially reduce the US-China trade deficit which hit a record $419 billion in 2018.

The agreement, announced jointly by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and China’s Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan, will lower US tariffs on over $300 billion worth of Chinese textiles and apparel entering the US market. Tariffs on some products will decrease immediately, while other products will see their tariffs reduced incrementally over the next five years. The steepest tariff drops will be in labor-intensive products like cotton t-shirts, wool suits and synthetic fabrics.  

US fashion brands and retailers praised the agreement, saying lower tariffs will allow them to reduce costs and pass on savings to customers. “This is a big win for American families and apparel retailers,” said Matt Shay, President and CEO of the National Retail Federation. However, some US textile manufacturers criticized the deal, arguing it will only increase the competitive threat from cheap Chinese imports.   

While the agreement may boost trade in the textile sector, experts say it is unlikely to significantly impact the overall US-China trade relationship or reduce the bilateral trade deficit. The deficit has become a contentious issue, especially under the Trump administration which has pursued an aggressive "America First" trade policy and levied tariffs on over $250 billion in Chinese goods.

“This sector-specific deal shows China and the US can still work together on trade, but it won’t move the needle much on the headline numbers,” said Michael Hirson, Director at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. The textile trade makes up only about 2-3% of the total trade deficit, according to analysts. Broader structural issues like China’s subsidies for state-owned companies and US consumption of cheap Chinese goods will continue to drive the trade gap, Hirson said.

While the Trump administration can claim a victory with this deal, experts say more substantive concessions from China on intellectual property protection, forced technology transfer and wide-ranging trade reforms will be needed to resolve broader tensions and rebalance the trade relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
