China and US sign new textile agreement to increase market access, but trade gap remains wide  

The United States and China signed a new bilateral agreement this week to expand market access for each other's textile and apparel products over the next three years. The deal allows Chinese textile and apparel producers to export 10 percent more of their goods to the U.S. duty-free each year until 2025. In exchange, China will remove barriers to entry for U.S. producers to access its massive consumer market.  

The agreement provides a boost to the troubled U.S.-China trading relationship which has been plagued by tensions for the past several years. Since the Trump administration imposed wide-ranging tariffs on Chinese imports starting in 2018, relations between the world's two largest economies have spiraled downward. However, the new textile deal represents an opportunity for incremental progress and cooperation on trade.  

Textiles and apparel make up a significant portion of trade between the two nations, with China exporting over $40 billion in such goods to the U.S. last year. The agreement will provide a lift to Chinese textile producers who have seen demand weaken due to economic troubles from the coronavirus pandemic. The increased market access offers the prospect of higher sales and revenues for a sector that employs over 20 million workers in China.  

For the U.S. textile industry, the deal could boost business opportunities in China as import duties and other barriers are lowered. However, U.S. producers continue to face a steep trade imbalance, as America imported 10 times more in textiles and apparel from China than it exported last year. The U.S. textile sector has declined dramatically in the face of competition from low-cost Chinese producers over the past two decades, with hundreds of mills closing and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost during that period.  

Some trade experts say the new agreement does little to address the structural challenges posed by the massive trade deficit. The modest increases in U.S. market access pale in comparison to the much larger trading volumes flowing in the opposite direction. They argue that more substantial policy changes and consequences are needed to rebalance the trading relationship and protect domestic producers.

Supporters counter that the deal at least demonstrates good faith on both sides and a willingness to pursue cooperative solutions. They note that China's pledge to lower trade barriers could benefit U.S. companies aiming  to tap into growing Chinese consumer demand for high-quality apparel and textile goods. Improving market access, they say, is a step in the right direction to boosting transpacific trade in a mutually beneficial manner. 

While the new agreement won't solve the broader tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship, proponents say it shows that progress can still be made through negotiations and compromise. Reducing tariffs and other restrictions on trade in key sectors may gradually pave the path to improved relations and a more stable long-term partnership between the two global superpowers.
