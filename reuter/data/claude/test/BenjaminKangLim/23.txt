China Rejects Invitation for Top Policymaker to Visit Taiwan 

Beijing, China - China's government today rejected an invitation for its top policymaker, Wang Yang, to visit Taiwan. Wang serves as the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council  issued the invitation last week, proposing that Wang visit Taiwan to promote "positive interactions and exchanges" between the two sides. 

China's Taiwan Affairs Office released a statement calling the invitation "a petty act" by Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party administration. "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the Taiwan region is not entitled to issue invitations to mainland officials in any capacity or name," the statement said. China's government opposes any official interaction between the mainland and Taiwan that implies Taiwan has a separate national identity.

The rejection comes at a time of increased tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Since the election of Tsai Ing-wen as Taiwan's president in 2016, China has cut off official communications with Taiwan's government and ramped up military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. China aims to compel Taiwan to accept Beijing's contention that the island belongs to China. However, Tsai and her party have refused to endorse the "one China" principle that China insists on.

Tsai proposed the invitation to Wang as a goodwill gesture to ease cross-strait tensions. Her advisers had argued that a visit by Wang could set the stage for a potential Xi-Tsai summit on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting in Chile this November. With China spurning the invitation, that potential meeting now appears unlikely.

Taiwan's public remains largely opposed to unification with China, preferring to maintain the separate system of government, military, currency and identity that the island has enjoyed since 1949 when Mao Zedong's communists took control of mainland China. Still, most Taiwanese also favor maintaining economic ties and stability with China. China is Taiwan's largest trading partner, with over $170 billion in annual trade.

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council expressed disappointment at China's rejection of Wang's visit. A spokesperson said the decision "showed a lack of goodwill" and "damages the foundation of mutual trust" between the two sides. The council urged Beijing to adopt a more flexible and pragmatic attitude, and restart official communications in order to "jointly safeguard cross-strait peace and prosperity." However, with Taiwan's presidential election scheduled for January 2020, China is unlikely to change its hardline stance before the outcome of that vote is known.
