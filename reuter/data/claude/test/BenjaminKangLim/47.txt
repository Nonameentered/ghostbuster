China Considers Restrictions on Foreign Investment in Textiles and Garments 

The Chinese government is considering measures to curb foreign investment in its textile and garment manufacturing sector due to severe overcapacity, according to officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Excess production capacity has been a persistent problem in industries like steel, cement and aluminum in China. The textile and garment sector appears to be the latest to face this issue.

China’s textile and garment industry has grown tremendously over the past two decades to become the largest in the world. However, the industry’s production capacity has outpaced both domestic and foreign demand in recent years. The China National Textile and Apparel Council estimates that China’s textile and garment industry is operating at around 60-70% of capacity. The excess capacity has led to price wars, lower profits and factory shutdowns.

To address the overcapacity, Chinese officials are exploring restrictions on new foreign investment in the textile and garment sector. Specifically, China may forbid new wholly foreign-owned textile and garment companies and place restrictions on new joint ventures in the industry. The restrictions are aimed at discouraging foreign companies from building new factories in China to produce textiles and garments for export. 

Some foreign brands and retailers source a large portion of their textiles and garments from Chinese suppliers. Restrictions on foreign investment in the sector could disrupt these supply chains and force foreign companies to shift their sourcing to other countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam or Cambodia. However, China hopes that limiting new foreign investment, along with providing more incentives for Chinese textile and garment companies to move into higher-value products, may help rebalance supply and demand in the sector.

The proposed restrictions on foreign investment in China’s textile and garment industry come at a time of heightened trade tensions with the United States. The Trump administration has criticized China’s excess industrial overcapacity and threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on Chinese textiles and garments. China’s latest move may be partly aimed at defusing trade tensions by tackling overcapacity at home. But restrictions on foreign companies may be seen by some as protectionism and damage China’s open investment environment. The policy push and pull illustrates the challenges for China in resolving its excess capacity issues.
