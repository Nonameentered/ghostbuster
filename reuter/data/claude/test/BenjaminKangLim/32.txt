China's Propaganda Machine Denounces U.S. Newspapers over Tibetan Nuns Torture and Suggestions to Get Tough with China 

The official Chinese state media apparatus has lashed out at two major U.S. newspapers over their coverage of reports of Chinese authorities subjecting Tibetan nuns to torture and electric shocks. The newspapers also published opinion pieces arguing that Chinaâ€™s authoritarian policies demanded a tougher stance from the West.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized The Washington Post and The New York Times for "malicious hyping" of the reports from Human Rights Watch about the mistreatment of nuns at a convent in Sichuan province. Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying called the coverage "false news" during a press briefing, despite photographic evidence provided by Human Rights Watch supporting the reports of physical abuse. "Certain media organizations ignore the facts and spread false information with malicious intent to smear China's policies in Tibet and interfere in China's internal affairs," Hua said. 

In a separate broadside, the nationalist state-run Global Times newspaper published an editorial condemning suggestions from U.S. commentators that the incoming Biden administration should adopt a more confrontational policy toward China over human rights issues. The editorial said "Tibet affairs are China's internal affairs, and the U.S. has no right to interfere." It went on to say that a "tougher stance" would only lead to a "more confrontational relationship" between Beijing and Washington, pushing the two sides into a "new Cold War."

The harshly worded denunciations from official Chinese media signal Beijing's extreme sensitivity to any criticism of its rights record in Tibet and its authoritarian policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. While Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called for more "positive energy" in state messaging, the propaganda apparatus has continued to aggressively counter any criticism of China's political system and attack those seen as threatening Chinese interests. The strong language appears aimed at both Western audiences and domestic nationalists in China.
