Chinese dissident Li Hai sentenced to nine years in prison for prying into state secrets

Beijing, China - Li Hai, a prominent Chinese dissident and human rights activist, was sentenced to nine years in prison today for allegedly stealing state secrets. According to the Chinese government, Li was prying into confidential government documents and sharing them with foreign organizations in an attempt to undermine the Communist Party. 

Li, 46, has advocated for greater civil liberties and transparency in China for over two decades. He has been frequently harassed and detained for his activism in the past. His latest arrest in May was seen by human rights groups as an attempt by Chinese authorities to silence a vocal critic. During Li's brief trial this week, prosecutors accused him of obtaining classified documents through contacts in government ministries and then sharing that information with Western journalists and diplomats. The content and details of the documents were not disclosed in court.

Li pleaded not guilty to the charges, arguing that he was working to expose corruption and human rights abuses by Chinese officials. His lawyers say the case against him is politically motivated, and the evidence does not support the state secrets allegations. The conviction drew swift condemnation from rights groups, who called it a sham and said the harsh nine-year sentence was meant to intimidate other activists.

“Li Hai has been a courageous voice for fundamental rights and freedoms in China,” said Wang Yao, China researcher at Amnesty International. “The Chinese government showed its paranoia and hostility towards peaceful dissent by imprisoning him for bogus state secrets charges. He should be released immediately.” 

The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed the criticism, saying Li received a fair trial and his punishment fit the law. A ministry spokesman urged “other countries to respect China’s judicial sovereignty and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.”

Li’s lawyers said they plan to appeal the verdict, but acknowledge the Chinese legal system is highly unlikely to overturn the result. Li vowed in his final statement to the court to “keep fighting for freedom and justice in China” even behind bars. With his imprisonment, China has silenced another prominent voice for reform. But his supporters say the authoritarian regime cannot jail the thirst for liberty and human dignity forever.
