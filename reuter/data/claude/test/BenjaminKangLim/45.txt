North Korea threatens to fire top official seeking asylum in South Korea's embassy in China

North Korea has threatened to dismiss a senior official who entered South Korea's embassy in Beijing apparently seeking asylum, according to reports in South Korean media. 

The unidentified official is said to have entered the embassy on Monday and expressed a desire to defect. If confirmed, it would be an unusual and high-level defection at a time of heightened tensions between North and South Korea.

The South Korean government has not yet commented on the case. A spokesman for the South Korean Unification Ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, said the ministry had no information to share at present.

However, multiple South Korean media outlets, citing anonymous sources, have reported that a senior North Korean trade official entered the South Korean embassy in Beijing seeking asylum and that North Korea was threatening retaliation if he was not handed over.
The JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported that North Korea had demanded the immediate return of the official, who was involved in trade with China, Pyongyang's only major ally and economic lifeline. The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said North Korea had threatened to freeze or shut down the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint inter-Korean industrial park, if the defection was permitted.

If confirmed, such threats could significantly raise tensions between North and South. But experts urged caution, noting that there had been no official confirmation from either government and that previous reports of high-level defections had proved premature or false. The reported threats could also be a bluff, they said.

"We have to be very careful with these kinds of reports," said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute think tank outside Seoul. "Even if it is true, the North Korean regime may not follow through with severe retaliation as that could worsen its diplomatic isolation."

The reported defection comes at a time of heightened tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last September and has conducted a flurry of ballistic missile tests in recent months.

In response, the United States has sought to intensify sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. Washington's "maximum pressure" campaign has antagonized North Korea, which sees the policy as a threat to its regime's survival.

Some analysts worry North Korea could conduct more weapons tests or other provocations in retaliation. There are also concerns that a further tightening of sanctions could backfire if China or Russia refuse to fully enforce them.

The unidentified trade official, if his defection is confirmed, would join a handful of senior North Korean officials who have sought asylum overseas, often during times of economic hardship or political turmoil at home.  The deputy ambassador based in London defected in 2016, and the ambassador to Egypt is believed to have defected in 1997. Both were granted asylum in South Korea.  

While not unprecedented, the potential defection of such a senior official could deliver both a propaganda victory and valuable intelligence to South Korea. But for now, officials in Seoul appear to be waiting for further clarity on what exactly has transpired before responding.
