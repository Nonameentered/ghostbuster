China to Tighten Inspections of Imported Animals and Plants for Possible Diseases 

China announced today that it will increase inspections of imported animals, meat, plants, and plant-based products to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. The new measures come amid growing concerns over African swine fever, which has devastated China's pig herds, as well as fall armyworm infestations that have damaged corn and rice crops.

According to China's customs agency, all shipments of live animals, animal products, and high-risk plant materials will face mandatory inspections upon arrival in China starting June 1. Products that are contaminated or that fail to meet China's strict health and safety standards will be returned or destroyed at the importers' expense. The announcement follows reports that banned or contaminated pork, fruit, and vegetables continue to enter China's borders despite existing restrictions and inspections. 

"We must resolutely strengthen our protections, thoroughly inspect inbound goods, strictly prevent risks from spreading in, and firmly safeguard the health of our country's animals, plants and people," said a spokesman for the General Administration of Customs. The new measures are likely to slow the processing of imports at China's ports and could impact global meat and plant-based commodity traders that export to China. Agricultural industry groups warn that China may use the inspections at times to limit imports for political and economic reasons in addition to health and safety concerns.

China is the world's top importer of agricultural commodities, but domestic production has been threatened in recent years by African swine fever, fall armyworms, and other diseases and infestations. Up to 200 million pigs in China have been culled due to African swine fever over the past year, representing nearly 40% of the world's pig population. The tightened inspections appear aimed at reassuring Chinese consumers and producers that authorities are taking strong action to limit further damage. But global meat exporters fear they may lead to unnecessary trade disruptions and restrictions even for disease-free shipments. The coming months will reveal how rigorously China implements the new policy and whether it achieves the desired result of reducing health risks without unduly limiting trade.
