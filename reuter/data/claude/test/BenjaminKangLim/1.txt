China Claims Hong Kong's First Post-Colonial Chief Executive as the Beginning of "True Democracy"

Hong Kong held its first election for Chief Executive today under the supervision of China's communist government. The winner was Beijing-backed candidate John Lee, a former security minister who oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. In a statement, the Chinese government hailed Lee's election as a milestone in Hong Kong's transition to "true democracy." 

For 155 years, Hong Kong was a British colony. When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, China agreed to allow Hong Kong to retain its democratic systems and freedoms for 50 years under the "one country, two systems" arrangement. However, in recent years, China has exerted increasing control over Hong Kong's political institutions and civil society. A sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 largely crushed Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition movement.

Lee was the only candidate approved to run in today's election after rival candidates were disqualified from the race. He won with over 99% of the vote from a committee of just 1,500 electors, most of whom are pro-Beijing. By contrast, Hong Kong's previous Chief Executive was elected in 2017 by a committee of nearly 1200 electors and won with just 777 votes. Pro-democracy advocates have called today's election a "sham" that shows China's authoritarian turn in Hong Kong is complete.

In a statement, a spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said: "The election of John Lee as the sixth-term Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR marks the beginning of Hong Kong's transition to true democracy. Under the leadership of Lee, the Hong Kong SAR will make solid progress along the road of 'one country, two systems' and a high degree of autonomy with the strong support of the Central Government."

However, Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the election was a demonstration of China's control over Hong Kong, not democracy. "Beijing's claims that Lee's selection advances democracy in Hong Kong are ludicrous," she said. "This was an uncompetitive election that violates democratic principles and disregards the political rights and freedoms Hong Kong people were promised." The U.S. State Department and politicians in Britain, Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, also criticized the lack of choice in the election.

For pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong, Lee's election extinguishes hopes of reversing the erosion of political freedoms in the territory. Under the tightening grip of Beijing, Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic systems appear increasingly distant memories. With no political opposition left in government, China's control over Hong Kong's destiny looks firmly entrenched for the foreseeable future.
