Toronto Stocks Rise One Percent, Trailing New York's Stronger Rally on Easing Rate Hike Fears 

The Toronto stock market rose 1 percent on Tuesday, trailing a stronger rally on Wall Street as investors welcomed comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested a slower pace of interest rate hikes.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 152.44 points to 16,420.06, led by the energy, materials and financial sectors. Despite Tuesday's gain, the index is on track for a small loss this week, breaking a four-week streak of gains. 

South of the border, markets surged after Fed officials hinted the central bank may take it slow on raising rates amid signs the U.S. economy is slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 372.65 points or 1.5 percent to 25,543.27. The S&P 500 index added 32.18 points or 1.2 percent to 2,753.03 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 91.91 points or 1.3 percent at 7,420.38.  

  In Toronto, the heavyweight financials sector gained 1.2 percent as shares of Royal Bank of Canada advanced 1.5 percent and Bank of Nova Scotia rose 1.4 percent.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.7 percent as gold prices also climbed. Barrick Gold Corp. was up 2.8 percent and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. increased 5.4 percent.

The April crude contract rose $1.09 to US$54.94 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was up 3.2 cents at US$2.80 per mmBTU. The Canadian dollar traded at an average of 75.14 cents US compared with an average of 75.04 cents US on Monday.

Overall, analysts said Tuesday's gains were welcome after a weak start to the week but added that markets remain choppy going into the end of the quarter amid ongoing global risks that threaten the economic outlook. The market response shows investors continue to monitor risks like trade tensions, Brexit and slowing growth.
