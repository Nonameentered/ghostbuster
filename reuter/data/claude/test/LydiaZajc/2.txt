Toronto Stock Exchange Soars to New Highs on the Back of Gold Stocks As Precious Metal Markets Boom 

The Toronto Stock Exchange hit a new record high today, buoyed by surging gold stocks as prices of the precious yellow metal rose to their highest levels in over six years. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose over 300 points or 2% to close at 16,834, an all-time high. The gold sub-index was up nearly 8% as shares of Canada's major gold producers saw significant gains.

The price of gold futures rose 3% to over $1,550 per ounce, the highest price since early 2013. The rise in the price of gold is due to growing economic uncertainties and the expectation that interest rates will be cut, decreasing the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. Investors are piling into gold and gold stocks as a hedge against market and inflation risks.  

Shares of Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold mining company, were up 11% adding over $2 billion in market capitalization. Kinross Gold and Franco-Nevada Corp, two other major Canadian gold miners, were up 13% and 7% respectively. The optimism in the gold sector is in sharp contrast with gloomier outlooks for other resource sectors like energy. The Canadian oil patch continues to struggle with low oil prices and oversupply issues.

"The gold market is on a tear fueled by dovish central banks and mounting geopolitical tensions," said Joseph Wright, Senior Economist at Laurentian Bank. "As interest rates decline, gold becomes more attractive to income-seeking investors. And with the recent escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, investors are nervous and piling into the traditional safe haven of gold."

However, some analysts warn that the euphoria in the gold market could fade if economic data starts to improve or a trade deal is reached. A resolution on trade or stabilization in the global economy could shift investor sentiment away from safe havens like gold. For now though, gold and gold stocks seem poised to continue their upward climb on the back of risk-averse investment flows seeking shelter from market unpredictability. Overall, Canadaâ€™s main stock index appears well positioned to set new highs thanks to the strength across gold producers and bullion in general.
