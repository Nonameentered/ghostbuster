Toronto Stocks Close Flat in Light Trading Due to U.S. Markets Closed for Holiday and Battered Barrick Gold Corp.  

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed little changed on Monday in light trading as U.S. markets were closed for the Independence Day holiday. The S&P/TSX Composite Index finished up just 0.05 points, or flat, at 15,706.15. Only 4 of the 10 main groups were positive on the day. 

Mining stocks were the worst performers, dropping 1.3% as shares of Barrick Gold Corp plunged 7.1% to $22.48, their lowest level since March 2016. Barrick, the world's largest gold mining company, announced its fourth asset sale in four months and cut its gold production forecast for the year due to operational issues at its Veladero gold mine in Argentina.

The materials group, which includes miners and forestry companies, slid 0.7%. Healthcare and industrials also retreated, while financials, consumer staples and telecom services posted small gains.

About 133 million shares traded hands on the TSX, well below the six-month average for volume. Canadian markets have been lackluster with many investors on the sidelines ahead of the Bank of Canada's interest rate decision on Wednesday and the start of the second-quarter corporate earnings season.

"People are in a wait-and-see mode," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "Volumes are light, there's not a lot of conviction one way or the other."

The Canadian dollar was at 75.35 cents US, down 0.14 of a cent as the greenback strengthened against most major currencies.

In New York, markets were closed for Independence Day, a federal holiday in the U.S. commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.  U.S. markets will reopen on Tuesday.

Oil prices fell on oversupply worries after a report indicated U.S. crude stockpiles rose again last week. The September crude contract declined 63 cents to US$42.73 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was down 1.3 cents at US$2.868 per mmBTU.  

The gold contract for August delivery fell $7.30 to US$1,212.30 an ounce as the U.S. dollar strengthened, curbing demand for the metal as an alternative investment.
