Toronto's key stock index boosted by soaring banking sector despite weakness in gold group

The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed on Tuesday powered by strong financial stocks, offsetting losses in gold mining shares. 

The benchmark Canadian index closed up 90.37 points at 19,368.69, led by a 1.5% gain in the heavyweight financial subgroup. Shares of Canada's biggest banks rallied, with Toronto-Dominion Bank rising 2.1%, Bank of Montreal up 2%, and Royal Bank of Canada gaining 1.5%. Insurers Manulife Financial and Sun Life Financial also posted solid gains.

The rally in banking stocks came as bond yields moved higher, alleviating some concerns about narrowing margins from low interest rates. Investors also welcomed solid earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, signalling optimism about the sector. 

Meanwhile, the materials subgroup which includes gold stocks dropped 1.6% as gold futures fell from six-year highs. Barrick Gold Corp declined 3.3% and Kinross Gold Corp fell 2.4% as gold prices retreated from levels last seen in September 2012. The price of gold has surged around 20% this year amid economic uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and increasing tensions between the United States and China. But analysts said a pullback was due after the metal's strong rally.

"The gold market was very overbought, so this is a healthy correction as the market digests those gains," said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. "The fundamental picture for gold still looks constructive with real interest rates low and more fiscal and monetary stimulus coming, which supports investment demand."

The Canadian market has rebounded over 35% from its March lows, though it remains down about 9% year to date. Investors are optimistic that the gradual reopening of businesses will spur an economic recovery, though risks such as ongoing U.S.-China disputes and further virus outbreaks remain. The Bank of Canada is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.25% when it meets later this week, as the central bank assesses the impact of its reductions in March.

In other market moves, the Canadian dollar edged up 0.1% to $0.7232 against its U.S. counterpart, paring recent gains. Oil futures also rose with September crude settling 87 cents higher at $40.68 a barrel on rebalancing in commodities that had declined earlier this week.
