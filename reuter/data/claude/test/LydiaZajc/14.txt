Toronto Stocks Close Weaker on Greenspan's Cautionary Comments and Declining Sectors 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index closed lower today, weighed down by weakness in economically sensitive sectors and cautionary comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index declined 69.48 points, or 0.5%, to end at 13,513.74. Seven of the TSX's 10 sector groups closed lower. 

The decline was broad-based, with notable losses in materials, energy, and industrials stocks. Greenspan warned that high home prices could impact consumer spending, causing concern in sectors most tied to economic growth.

The materials sector, which includes mining and forestry stocks, fell 2.3% as gold and base metals prices declined. Energy stocks dropped 1.2% as oil prices weakened, with Canadian Natural Resources down 2.1% and Suncor Energy off 1.9%.  

The industrials sector decreased 1.3%, with Canadian National Railway sliding 2.7% and Air Canada parent ACE Aviation Holdings down 3.1%.

In contrast, the less economically sensitive telecom, utility, and financial sectors posted modest gains.

Banks edged up 0.1% ahead of quarterly earnings this week. Royal Bank rose 0.3%, while Toronto-Dominion Bank dipped 0.1%.

The Canadian dollar closed at 82.26 U.S. cents, down from Thursday's close at 82.41 U.S. cents.

Greenspan's comments exacerbated worries that the Fed may raise interest rates further to curb inflation, which would slow economic growth. His remarks came ahead of his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers this week.

Market breadth was weak across the board, with decliners ahead of gainers by a 7 to 2 margin on both the TSE 300 and TSE 60 indexes. Turnover was solid at 370 million shares.

Traders are looking ahead to quarterly results and guidance from major companies this week for clues as to corporate health and the direction of the overall stock market.
