Toronto Stock Market Weakened by New York Sell-Off in Quiet Trading Session 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's main equity index fell on Tuesday as tumbling stocks on Wall Street weighed on the market. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed down 156 points or 1% at 15,399. The losses came despite light trading volumes with many investors away from their desks due to the Canada Day holiday on Monday. 

The influential energy, financial and mining sectors were the biggest drags on the market. Within the energy sector, shares of Vermilion Energy fell 2.4% and Suncor Energy declined 2.1%. The embattled cannabis producer CannTrust Holdings plunged another 23% after Health Canada suspended its license in response to unlicensed cultivation.  

South of the border, the technology-heavy Nasdaq led major U.S. stock indexes lower with a drop of 1.9% as Netflix shares plummeted following weak subscriber numbers in its quarterly report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.9%. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Independence Day holiday.

"The weakness in the U.S., especially in the tech sector with the drop in Netflix, that really set the tone for the TSX today," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "The cannabis sector also remains under pressure. So there were a couple of factors, even with light volumes, weighing on the Canadian market."

The Canadian dollar traded at an average of 74.88 cents US compared with an average of 75.03 cents US on Friday. The September crude contract fell $1.96 or 3.1% at $61.06 US per barrel and the August gold contract advanced $18.70 at US$1,405 an ounce.  

Bond yields were mixed with the 10-year Government of Canada bond yield down slightly at 1.57% while the 30-year bond yield increased to 2.11%. 

Overall, the subdued trading activity reflected a summertime lull with many traders taking extended vacations. The Toronto stock market will look to rebound on Wednesday but much will depend on the direction of commodity prices and whether the retreat continues in the U.S. equity markets.
