Toronto's Stock Index Ends Flat Despite Wall Street Rally and Currency Concerns 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was little changed on Friday as gains in Wall Street's indexes were offset by concern over the Canadian dollar's drop against the U.S. dollar. The benchmark Canadian index ended the day up just 9 points at 16,999.

The major North American indexes rose after data showed retail sales in the U.S. jumped in September, suggesting consumer spending on services remains solid. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% and the S&P 500 gained 1.2%. Tech stocks buoyed the Nasdaq Composite, which rose 2% to its highest closing level since September 2000.

While the upbeat U.S. data helped lift stocks south of the border, worries about the weakening Canadian dollar prevented a rally in Toronto. The loonie fell to 77.77 U.S. cents, its lowest level since January 2019. A declining currency is seen as potentially inflationary because it makes imports more expensive. It can also weigh on companies that earn revenue in U.S. dollars.

The key energy sector, which makes up more than 20% of the Toronto index, declined 0.6% even as oil prices gained. weakness in the sector was led by pipeline companies. Canadian Natural Resources fell 0.8% and Suncor Energy declined 1.3%.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.1% as gold futures declined. Major gold producers like Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold fell 2.3% and 2.7% respectively.

"The loonie's weakness was the dominant story today in an otherwise upbeat session for equities," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "The drop in the currency signaled concerns about the Canadian economy's sensitivity to oil prices and trade with the U.S."

Despite ending little changed, the Toronto market ended the week up 1.6% for its fourth straight weekly advance. Investors continue to monitor ongoing U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit developments that could impact the global economic outlook.
