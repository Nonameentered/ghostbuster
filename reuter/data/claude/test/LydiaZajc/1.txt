Gendis Inc to Report "Extensive" Losses After Greenberg Stores Ltd Unit Bankruptcy

Gendis Inc, a major consumer products conglomerate, announced it expects to report "extensive losses" in its second quarter earnings following the bankruptcy of its Greenberg Stores Ltd retail unit. Greenberg Stores, which operates over 2,000 stores across North America selling Gendis products, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, citing increasing competition from e-commerce giants and warehouse clubs. 

The bankruptcy of Greenberg Stores is a major blow for Gendis, which relied on the retail chain for over 30% of its total revenue. Gendis CEO Jenny Mills apologized to shareholders in a statement, saying "The loss of Greenberg Stores from our portfolio will significantly impact our bottom line this quarter and beyond. We were unable to restructure Greenberg to overcome the challenges of the modern retail environment. We take full responsibility for this failure."

Gendis acquired Greenberg Stores in 2005 for $12.3 billion, hoping to gain more control over how its variety of consumer brands were sold in stores. However, Greenberg struggled in recent years due to shoppers shifting more of their spending online and away from mid-size retailers. The company also has been unable to compete on price with larger retailers like Walmart and Costco, putting pressure on profit margins. After failing to turn around Greenberg's performance, Gendis took a $6.8 billion writedown on the retailer last year.

Bankruptcy filings show Greenberg Stores had over $2.4 billion in liabilities to Gendis, including loans and unpaid bills for inventory. Gendis may recoup some of these losses depending on how the bankruptcy case proceeds. However, most industry experts anticipate creditors like Gendis are unlikely to recover the full amount owed by Greenberg.

The troubles at Greenberg are just the latest challenge for Gendis, which has seen revenues and profits decline for five straight years. Investors have been pressuring the company to make strategic changes. But the fall of Greenberg suggests Gendis has limited options to juice growth and may face calls to break up parts of its business.
