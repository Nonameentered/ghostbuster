Former Wal-Mart Official Named CEO of Hudson's Bay Co, Investors Cheer 

Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) announced today that Helena Foulkes, a former top executive at Walmart, will become its new CEO, succeeding Gerald Storch who led the company for the past four years. Foulkes will take the helm at HBC, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, on February 19. Investors reacted positively to the news, sending HBC shares up nearly 5% in morning trading.

Foulkes most recently served as president of CVS Health and oversaw CVS's retail business. Before joining CVS in 2013, Foulkes worked at Walmart for 25 years, rising to the role of executive vice president of strategy and cross-channel operations. In that position, she was responsible for a number of strategic initiatives and oversaw operations for Walmart's health and wellness, vision and fitness businesses.

Richard Baker, HBC's governor and executive chairman, said in a statement that Foulkes is "a transformational leader" with a proven track record of success in retail, including implementing innovative strategies around customer experience, loyalty programs, and e-commerce. "Helena's passion for the customer experience, along with her background in strategic planning, marketing, merchandising, and store operations, make her ideally suited to accelerate HBC's growth and continuing the execution of our winning strategy,” Baker said.

Foulkes takes over at a challenging time for department stores as customers spend more online and less in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. HBC has taken several steps to boost sales and cut costs under Storch, including closing non-performing stores, selling a partial stake in its European division, and launching a loyalty program. However, same-store sales grew by only 0.8% over the key holiday quarter. Foulkes will need to continue revamping HBC's operations to adapt to a fast-changing retail environment. Her experience at two of the world's largest retailers could prove helpful as she works to drive growth across HBC's banners.

In a statement, Foulkes said she was honored to join HBC at a pivotal time. “I have been impressed by the strategic changes the company has made over the past few years to drive growth, and see many opportunities to continue the momentum,” Foulkes said. She added that she looks forward to working with HBC's team "to provide a best-in-class retail experience for customers across North America."
