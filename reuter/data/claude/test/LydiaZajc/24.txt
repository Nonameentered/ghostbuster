Yogen Fruz Proposes Co-Branding With Subway and KFC for Expansion   

Yogen Fruz, the Canadian frozen yogurt chain, announced today that it is in discussions with Subway and KFC to launch co-branded locations in an effort to accelerate its expansion plans. The three brands are looking to leverage their combined customer base and brand recognition by housing outlets together in a single retail space. 

Yogen Fruz, founded in 1986, currently has over 300 locations across Canada, the United States, South Korea, England, Venezuela, and the United Arab Emirates. However, growth has slowed in recent years in the face of increased competition in the frozen yogurt market from brands like Pinkberry and Red Mango. Co-branding with major franchises like Subway and KFC could provide a boost to Yogen Fruz's visibility and credibility.

“We believe offering our delicious frozen yogurt options alongside popular brands like Subway and KFC will significantly raise awareness of Yogen Fruz and drive more customers to visit our stores,” said Yogen Fruz CEO Michael Serruya. “There is a strong overlap in our customer demographics, and co-location will make it convenient for people to enjoy food from multiple brands at once.”

If successful, the co-branded locations would provide benefits to all three brands. Yogen Fruz would gain exposure to new potential customers, Subway and KFC would add a complementary product to their menu and enhance the customer experience. The companies are discussing opening co-branded pilot locations, to be launched as soon as the next three to six months if negotiations are successful.

However, there are risks to co-branding that could hamper the success of the proposed alliance. If the customer experience and operations across brands are not seamlessly integrated, it may turn off some customers and damage the reputation of the brands. There is also a possibility of the brands cannibalizing each other's sales if customers opt for one brand over another when visiting the co-branded location. 

The co-branding trend has become popular in recent years, with companies looking to drive more customers to physical retail spaces. In the fast food industry, co-branding examples includeTaco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as KFC and Pizza Hut. If executed well, co-branding with Yogen Fruz could drive more people into Subway and KFC locations and increase sales for all companies involved. For Yogen Fruz, it may provide a much-needed boost to restart its growth at a time when competition is intense.
