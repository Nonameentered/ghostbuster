Toronto Stocks Plummet as U.S. Producer Price Data Raises Fears of Interest Rate Hikes

The Toronto Stock Exchange dropped sharply today following the release of producer price index data in the U.S. that showed a surge in inflationary pressures, raising fears that interest rate hikes could be on the horizon. 

The TSX composite index fell over 350 points or 2.1% in midday trading, led by declines in the utility, materials, and healthcare sectors. It was the biggest single-day drop for the TSX so far this year. The Canadian dollar also weakened by nearly half a cent against the greenback on the inflation data and interest rate worries.

The sell-off came after the U.S. Labor Department reported the producer price index, which measures wholesale inflation, rose 0.6% in April and jumped 6.2% from a year ago. Both figures were higher than economists had forecast. The rapid rise in producer prices suggests that inflation is picking up as the economic recovery gains momentum and demand rises.

"The hot inflation numbers spooked investors and pointed to the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates sooner rather than later to keep price pressures under control," said Robert Johnson, managing director at wealth management firm BNY Mellon. Higher interest rates could slow down an economic recovery that has been gaining strength.

The Bank of Canada has also warned it could raise its benchmark overnight rate from the current record low of 0.25% in the second half of 2022. Today's data suggests the BoC may need to move even earlier to curb inflation, which would be another drag on the TSX and broader economy.  

The drop in the TSX was widespread, with all but one of the index's subgroups trading lower. Healthcare companies were hit particularly hard, with CannTrust and Aurora Cannabis both falling over 6% on the interest rate concerns. Miners and utilities were also down sharply on worries higher rates could hamper demand for raw materials and raise borrowing costs.

The TSX tech sector managed to buck the wider trend after e-commerce giant Shopify reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Shopify shares gained 3.6%, helping provide some support to the overall technology group. But it wasn't enough to lift the index into positive territory on what proved to be a rough day for Canadian investors.
