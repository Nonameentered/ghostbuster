With the additional scale, capabilities and expertise gained from these acquisitions, Philip Environmental will be able to serve more customers and communities than ever before."

Serv-Tech Inc. focuses on recycling hazardous waste and e-waste in the Midwest and along the East Coast. Philip Environmental said it does not expect any immediate changes to personnel or operations at Allwaste Inc. or Serv-Tech Inc. The acquired companies will operate as subsidiaries under the Philip Environmental brand following the completion of the deals.

Philip Environmental stock rose 4.2% on news of the acquisitions. The company said it will provide additional details on the financial impact of the deals during its third quarter earnings call next month. Philip Environmental operates more than 200 recycling centers and had revenue of $6.2 billion last year.
