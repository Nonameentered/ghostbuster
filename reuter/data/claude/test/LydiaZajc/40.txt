Toronto Stock Market Takes a Breather with Mixed Results  

The Toronto Stock Exchange saw slightly mixed results today as investors took a breather from the record rally of the past few weeks. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index edged down 0.2% to close the day at 17,756 points. Gains in the energy and materials sectors were offset by losses in industrials and financials.

The energy sector gained 0.3% as the price of crude oil rose over 1% to $58 per barrel. Canadian Natural Resources led the way, up 0.7%. However, pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. declined 0.6%.  

The materials sector, which includes mining and gold stocks,  rose 0.2% . Gold miners Iamgold Corp and Alamos Gold Inc. saw shares increase by 3.2% and 1.3% respectively as gold prices also ticked up.  

However, industrials lagged, falling 0.4% overall. Shares of Canadian National Railway and Air Canada both dropped over 1%. The financial sector, which makes up one-third of the TSX index, also weighed on the market with a 0.3% decline. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, was down 0.7% while rival Bank of Montreal lost 0.9%.

"The Canadian market was taking a bit of a break today after some solid gains over the past month," said Craig Jerusalim, portfolio manager at CI Direct Investing. "There were some ups and downs in different sectors, but overall investors seem cautiously optimistic." 

The mixed close comes after the TSX hit an all-time record high earlier in the week. Investors have been buoyed recently by positive trade talks between the U.S. and China as well as a resilient domestic economy. Analysts expect the trend to remain positive in the final month of the year, with some potential short-term volatility.
