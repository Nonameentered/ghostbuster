Wal-Mart Canada Reverses Decision on Cuban Pajamas After Pressure from Government and Citizens

Wal-Mart Canada announced today that it is reversing its decision to stop selling pajamas made in Cuba after facing significant criticism from the Canadian government and citizens. Last week, Wal-Mart made the decision  to remove the popular "Cuba" brand pajamas from its shelves across Canada citing unspecified reasons. 

The move was immediately met with backlash from customers, pro-Cuba advocates, and government officials. Many saw it as Wal-Mart caving into pressure from U.S. interests to curb trade with Cuba. The pajamas, which are made from high-quality Cuban cotton and stitched in Cuba, have been a top-seller for Wal-Mart Canada for over five years.

In a statement today, Wal-Mart Canada President Cynthia Flemming apologized for the decision and said the company "made a mistake. We should not have removed the Cuba pajamas from our stores." She announced Wal-Mart would immediately restock the pajamas and make them available for purchase across Canada as soon as new shipments arrive from Cuba.

The reversal comes after several Canadian cabinet ministers publicly urged Wal-Mart to reconsider, saying the move would hurt trade relations with Cuba and limit consumer choice. "We expect major retailers in Canada to make decisions that support mutually beneficial trade with countries around the world, including Cuba," read a joint statement from three ministers. A petition by a pro-Cuba trade advocacy group that garnered over 50,000 signatures was also delivered to Wal-Mart's head office.

Wal-Mart's about-face reinforces Canada's open stance on trade with Cuba and serves as a warning to companies that consumer and government interests are aligned in promoting engagement with the Communist country. For ordinary Canadians, the pajamas remain as beloved and comfortable as ever, regardless of political considerations. With winter nights coming, Wal-Mart's swift decision to restock the coveted Cuba brand pajamas is sure to delight customers and ensure many restful night's sleep.
