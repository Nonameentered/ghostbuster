Sears Canada Predicts Retail Revenue Growth of 8.6 Percent for 1997 Following Strong First-Quarter Results  

Sears Canada Inc. announced strong first-quarter results today and predicted retail revenue growth of 8.6 percent for the full year of 1997. The company reported revenues of $1.6 billion for the quarter ending May 3, 1997, an increase of 9.1 percent over the same period last year.  

"We are very pleased with our first-quarter results which reflect strong performances in most areas of our business," said Paul Walters, President and CEO of Sears Canada. "The results demonstrate the success of our strategy to become Canada's most customer-focused retailer. All of our major product categories contributed to the revenue increase, with strong performances in home furnishings, mattresses, major appliances and fitness equipment."

Same-store sales, which measure sales at locations open for at least one year, rose 6.7 percent. The gains were seen across all store formats, including full-line department stores, dealer stores, surplus stores and The Children's Place specialty stores. Revenue from credit operations increased 10.7 percent to $85.5 million.  

The company's bottom line also showed healthy gains. Net earnings for the quarter were $38.1 million or $0.41 per share, an increase of 16.1 percent from $32.9 million or $0.36 per share in the same period last year.  

"These strong first-quarter results give us momentum as we head into the important summer selling season and the balance of the year," said Walters. "While we anticipate some moderation in growth rates from the unusually robust first quarter, we are confident that we will achieve our overall revenue growth target of 8.6 percent for 1997 based on continued brisk consumer demand, the success of our merchandising and customer service strategies, and the contribution from new stores.‚Äù  

The positive report from Sears Canada comes on the heels of the sale of 57 surplus stores to a joint venture headed by Hudson's Bay Company. Sears Canada established the surplus store format in 1995 to sell discontinued and surplus merchandise, principally soft goods. The sale of the 57 surplus stores is expected to positively impact Sears Canada's second quarter results.
