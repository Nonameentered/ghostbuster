Mosaid Technologies Inc Predicts 20% Earnings Growth in Fiscal 1998  

Mosaid Technologies Inc, a leading developer of semiconductor memory technology, announced today that it expects earnings to increase by 20% in fiscal 1998 based on a recovery in the integrated circuit market and continued strong demand for the company's products.

Mosaid develops and licenses semiconductor memory technologies and architectures used in a wide range of integrated circuits and electronic products. The company's technologies are critical components of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, flash memory chips, and other integrated circuits used in PCs, mobile phones, automotive electronics and other electronics equipment. 

"We are seeing clear signs of improvement in the overall semiconductor market, and in particular continuing strong demand for memory chips using our technologies," said Mosaid CEO Brent Hatch. "PC shipments are rebounding, and mobile phone sales remain robust. These are positive indicators for our business and we expect revenue and profit growth to accelerate through fiscal 1998."

In the first quarter of fiscal 1998, Mosaid revenue rose 12% to $15.2 million from $13.6 million in the same period last year. Earnings increased 15% to $3.4 million or 28 cents per share. The company has a strong balance sheet with no debt and $48 million in cash and marketable securities.

Mosaid derives revenue from licensing its technologies to semiconductor manufacturers and collecting royalties on the sale of memory chips using its technologies. The company's technologies are critical building blocks for leading-edge DRAM and flash chips, and Mosaid works closely with major memory manufacturers worldwide including Samsung, Toshiba, Hynix and Infineon.

The semiconductor industry was in recession for much of the 1990s but entered recovery late last year. According to industry association SEMI, semiconductor equipment billings have been rising for the past three months, indicating increased capital spending by chip makers. Mosaid is well positioned to benefit from renewed growth in memory chips and other semiconductors, according to analysts.  

"We continue to invest in advanced memory technologies to extend our lead in this important field," Hatch said. "With a chip market upturn underway, fiscal 1998 is shaping up to be an excellent year for Mosaid."

Mosaid is based in Ottawa, Canada and its shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MSD.
