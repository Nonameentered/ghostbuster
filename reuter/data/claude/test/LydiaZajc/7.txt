Toronto Stock Market Reaches Ninth Record High Close in Heavy Trading Thanks to Pension Funds Inflows

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached its ninth record close of the year amid heavy trading volumes on Thursday, fueled by strong inflows into pension funds and natural resource stocks. 

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 134.88 points, or 0.8%, at 16,605.50, an all-time high. The large pension funds and money managers put fresh money to work in the Canadian stock market in the latest period, concentrating on energy and materials stocks as commodity prices firmed. The energy sector rose 1.9% as oil prices hit a three-month high, while materials were up 2%, bolstered by a slate of takeover deals.

Demand for risk assets was strong globally following the Federal Reserve’s dovish policy update on Wednesday. The Fed’s indication that it is in no hurry to withdraw monetary stimulus raised expectations of ample liquidity supporting the economy and markets. The influx of funds into Canadian pensions and a search for returns in an era of low interest rates have buoyed the TSX this year. The benchmark stock index has climbed 14% year to date, ranking it among the top performers in the developed world.

Some analysts are optimistic the rally in the resource-heavy Toronto market can continue given the excess savings looking to find a home. However, others warn valuations are looking stretched and it will be difficult to match the returns of the first half of 2019 in the months ahead without a significant catalyst. The strengthening Canadian dollar could also pose headwinds if the trend persists.  

Trading volumes across all Canadian exchanges on Thursday were 41% above the average of the last six months. The heavy turnover reflected the rebalancing of portfolios by large funds at the end of the quarter, as well as the strong flows into Canadian equities.Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of almost 5 to 1 on the TSX.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.90 points, or 0.3%, to 26,526.58. The Nasdaq composite dropped 67.30 points, or 0.8%, to 8,005.27. U.S. markets have retreated from record highs this week amid disappointing economic data and uncertainty over trade talks with China.
