Toronto stocks hit by wave of selling after Greenspan questions sustainability of growth spurt 

The Toronto stock market tumbled on Monday as concerns about rising interest rates and an unsustainable growth spurt gripped investors. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 156.74 points or 1.1% to 14,342.03, with widespread losses across all sectors. The retreat came after former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said over the weekend that the current strong U.S. economy will not last.

Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Greenspan warned that the recent acceleration in economic activity won't be sustainable, raising worries that the boom may come to an end as interest rates rise. "Growth is running higher -- temporarily," he said. "The last thing we want is a 1929 type business cycle where we have acceleration which is then punctured at some stage.”

The comments from the influential Greenspan sent jitters through markets. Investors are concerned that rising inflation could prompt the Fed to raise rates at a faster pace than expected, potentially choking off economic growth. The fears spilled over into Canada, with nearly all sectors in the red. Energy stocks were hit hardest, dropping 1.9% as oil prices fell. The heavyweight financials sector declined 0.7%, while industrials and consumer staples also lost ground.

In New York, the three main U.S. stock indexes were all down more than 1 percent in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265 points or 1.1% to 23,678, the S&P 500 dropped 32 points or 1.2% to 2,565 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 137 points or 1.9% to 7,080. Higher yields on government bonds are also weighing on stocks. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries approached 3.2 percent, the highest in nearly four years.

“The bulk of Greenspan's comments seemed to reinforce the view that rates may need to rise further,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Asset Management. “This dampened risk appetite and sent equities lower.” While interest rates remain historically low, their steady march higher is rattling investors accustomed to a prolonged period of easy-money policy and low volatility. The Fed has already hiked rates twice this year, and anticipates two more increases before 2019. If the economy overheats and inflation picks up, the pace of tightening could quicken.

With the curtain closing on a strong first-quarter earnings season, geopolitical and macroeconomic events have come firmly into focus for markets once again. Anxieties over trade tensions, Middle East conflicts and the sustainability of growth will likely drive choppy trading in the weeks to come. For now though, Greenspan’s sobering comments have given investors reason to pause and take profits from the market’s recent rally.
