Toronto stocks rise 1% following speculation of US interest rate pause 

Canadian stocks rose Tuesday, led by gains in technology, financial and materials sectors. The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed 162.75 points, or 1%, to 16,532.73. Shares of major banks, Canada's largest companies and resource producers contributed to the index's gains.

Investor sentiment improved amid rumors that the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest rate hikes in 2019. Projections of a pause in U.S. rate increases boosted rate-sensitive sectors like financials and real estate. The Bank of Canada is also expected to keep rates unchanged in its policy meeting this week, which would add further support to some sectors.  

"The commentary from the Federal Reserve has clearly changed the sentiment in the marketplace," said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investments. "That has given fodder for a year-end rally."

Shares of Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.9%, while shares of Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia climbed 0.5% and 1.3% respectively. The materials group, which includes precious-and base-metal miners, climbed 2.3% as metal prices advanced.

The technology group jumped 2.8%, helped by shares of BlackBerry Ltd. Healthcare stocks led the index, rising 5% as cannabis producers climbed ahead of the legalization of edibles in Ontario and Alberta.

Still, some analysts remain cautious about the early optimism. The Fed has not said definitively that it will pause interest rate hikes, and the trade war between U.S. and China remains unresolved. The gains could also represent some quarter-end "window dressing" as funds buy top-performing stocks to boost their returns.

Shares of several large companies reported earnings this week, giving analysts more insight into the health of Corporate Canada. Markets are likely to be volatile in the final trading week of the year.
