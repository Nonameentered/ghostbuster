Toronto Stock Market Maintains Above Key Level Despite Mixed End in Heavy Dealings

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark TSX composite index steadied just above its key 16,500 level on Tuesday despite a mixed close and heavy trading turnover heading into the final minutes of activity. 

The main Canadian market index moved in a narrow range before finishing with a small fractional loss at 16,509.61, down 3.72 points or 0.02% on the day. However, the benchmark remained comfortably above the 16,000 threshold for a second straight week, supported by strength in several heavyweight sectors.

Technology stocks posted solid gains for the second consecutive session, led by e-commerce giant Shopify Inc. The tech sector rose 1.4% overall. Industrials were also higher, gaining 0.6% with Canadian National Railway Co. and Air Canada both advancing. Material stocks continued their rally, up 1.2% on the back of higher gold prices.  

Offsetting the strength, the energy sector sank 1.4% as oil prices turned lower ahead of weekly U.S. crude inventories data. Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. both dropped more than 1%. Healthcare stocks slumped 2.2%, while financials were only marginally weaker.

Trading activity ramped up significantly from the previous session with more than 305 million shares changing hands on the exchange Tuesday, the busiest day in nearly four weeks.  

Analysts said the TSX has established a firm base of support after weathering a sharp multi-day sell-off in mid-September. Investors appear less concerned about ongoing global trade tensions and mixed corporate earning results so far this quarter. However, others warned markets remain volatile and could reverse quickly if there were negative headlines on trade or geopolitical events.

The TSX has gained 13% year to date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq reached another record in New York. U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday with investors cautious ahead of several economic indicators and key quarterly results from major banks later this week.
