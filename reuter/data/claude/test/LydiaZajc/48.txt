Toronto Stock Exchange Soars Almost 100 Points Amid Earnings Euphoria and Reduced Fears of U.S. Interest Rate Hike  

The Toronto Stock Exchange climbed nearly 100 points today as positive earnings results and hopes of steady interest rates buoyed investor sentiment. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 99.5 points or 0.64%  to finish at 15,603, led by gains in the energy, financial and industrial sectors.

Canadian energy stocks rallied as oil prices moved higher on supply concerns. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 2.4% and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. advanced 1.9%. The heavyweight financials group, which accounts for around a third of the TSX's weight, was also strong. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, two of the country's biggest lenders, gained 1% and 0.9% respectively.   

Earnings results added a further lift. Canadian National Railway Co. reported quarterly profits that topped estimates, sending the stock up 4.5%. Rogers Communications Inc. rose 3.8% as its own quarterly earnings beat expectations. Strong results and optimistic guidance from U.S. companies including Coca-Cola Co. and United Technologies Corp. also brightened the mood.

Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions eased somewhat after China softened its tone in the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. In addition, comments from Federal Reserve officials suggested the central bank is unlikely to raise rates aggressively, reducing fears that higher borrowing costs may crimp economic growth. Investors now expect a more gradual approach to tightening monetary policy.

“The combination of solid earnings, stabilizing oil prices and expectations for a dovish Fed seem to have improved market sentiment today,” said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “While trade risks remain, investors appear willing to move back into equities and take on more risk.”

The upbeat trading on Bay Street mirrored gains in U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 350 points. All sectors aside from health care ended higher in New York, with the biggest increases in energy, information technology and consumer discretionary shares.
