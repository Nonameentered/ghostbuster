Toronto Stocks Rise for Second Day as Strong Earnings Boost Investor Confidence  

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose for a second straight day on Friday as positive quarterly earnings reports from major Canadian companies boosted investor confidence. 

The index closed up 85.58 points, or 0.55%, at 15,660.77. For the week, the index rose 1.2%, its second straight weekly gain.

Shares of Canada's largest telecom companies, BCE Inc. and Telus Corp., rose after both reported better-than-expected quarterly profits. BCE stock climbed 3.4% and Telus gained 2.3%.

The country's biggest rail operators, Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., also reported stronger-than-forecast earnings. Canadian National stock rose 4.5%, while Canadian Pacific shares gained 3.2%.

"There seems to be renewed optimism that earnings aren't actually falling off a cliff," said Elvis Picardo, a strategist at Global Securities in Vancouver. "Expectations had gotten very low going into this earnings season, so companies are beating those low bars."

Positive economic data also boosted sentiment. Statistics Canada reported that the economy gained a net 31,000 jobs in January, far more than forecasts of a 5,000 increase. The job gains pushed the unemployment rate down to 5.7% from 5.8%.

"The solid job numbers show the economy still has some momentum, even with some of the headwinds from the trade conflict and weaker oil prices," Picardo said.

Eight of the index's 11 major sectors were higher, led by a 1.6% gain in telecom services. Industrials rose 1.4% while financials, Canada's biggest sector, added 0.7%.

Energy declined 0.5% despite higher oil prices as several large oil producers traded lower. Crescent Point Energy Corp fell 2.9% and Baytex Energy Corp was down 2.3%.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.7% as gold and copper prices pulled back.
