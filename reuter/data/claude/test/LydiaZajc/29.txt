Toronto Stocks Mixed Amid Nervousness Over U.S. Interest Rate Hike and Triple-Witching

Canadian stocks seesawed on Friday as investors fretted over the prospect of upcoming interest rate increases in the U.S. and a quarterly options expiration. The S&P/TSX Composite Index opened higher but then slipped into the red before rebounding to close up 6.35 points at 15,328.68. 

Worries about a potential overheating of the U.S. economy and the impact of rising rates have weighed on markets recently. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year and indicated two more hikes were coming before year-end. Higher rates tend to slow down economic activity and reduce corporate profits.

Friday also marked "triple witching" - the simultaneous expiry of stock options, stock index futures and stock index option contracts - which often leads to volatility. "There are a lot of short-term trading flows on days like today that can push the market around," said Norman Levine, managing director of Portfolio Management Corp.

The Canadian dollar weakened, dropping 0.36 cents to 75.54 cents U.S. as investors moved money into the greenback. Gold fell $4.30 to $1,269.90 (U.S.) an ounce, and copper declined about 2 cents to $2.72 a pound.

The heavily weighted financials group, which accounts for about a third of the TSX's weight, rose 0.2%. Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia both set record highs before giving up some of their gains. The health care sector rose 1.7%, while information technology fell 1.6%.

Cannabis producer Tilray Inc. plunged 9.8% as short-sellers bet its shares would fall after Wednesday's 40% surge. Tilray, which began trading in July, has seen its stock price more than triple from its $17 initial public offering price. Some analysts warn Tilray's valuation seems detached from the fundamentals of its business.

Energy stocks decreased, even though oil prices were stable, as several large pipeline and oilsands companies traded down. The October crude contract closed unchanged at $70.33 (U.S.) a barrel. Canadian Natural Resources fell 1.6% and Enbridge was down 0.8%.

Defensive stocks that pay stable dividends, like utilities and telecoms, continued their upward march. Hydro One and BCE Inc. gained 1.1% and 0.9% respectively.  

In economic news, data showed Canadian retail sales fell 0.2% in July from June due to lower sales at gasoline stations and car dealerships. However, sales were up in seven of the 11 subsectors, representing 65% of total retail trade.
