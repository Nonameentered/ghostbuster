Cognos Inc expects strong fiscal year 1998 and considers share buyback or acquisition with $100 million in cash 

Business intelligence software maker Cognos Inc today said it expects fiscal 1998 revenue to increase by at least 25% and earnings to rise by at least 30% compared with 1997. The Ottawa-based company also announced its board of directors has authorized a review of options to deploy $100 million in cash reserves, including a possible share buyback program or acquisition.

For the year ending Feb. 28, Cognos predicted revenue of $450 million to $470 million, up from $361 million in fiscal 1997. Earnings are forecast to climb to between $1.10 and $1.20 a share from 86 cents.The improved outlook reflects strong demand for the company's software products that help companies analyze corporate data to spot business trends. License revenue, a key indicator of future growth, is expected to surge more than 30%.

"We're in a very hot space," said Cognos Chief Executive Michael Potter, pointing to the growing need for software and services to help make sense of the expanding volumes of data within companies. "The challenge of managing and leveraging information is becoming critical."

Cognos shares surged on the news, rising C$4.10 or 8% to C$56.60 at midday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has more than doubled in the past year. Mr. Potter said the company's $100 million in cash, which is equal to about 20% of its market capitalization, represents an opportunity to enhance shareholder value. Options include repurchasing up to 10% of Cognos' 31 million outstanding shares over an 18-month period or making one or more strategic acquisitions.

"We have more money than we need to run the business," Mr. Potter said in an interview. The company will also consider simply holding on to the cash as insurance against any future needs, he said. Cognos has no debt and generates strong free cash flow, giving it considerable financial flexibility.

Cognos plans to release full fourth quarter and fiscal year results on April 15. In the third quarter, revenue rose 28% to $108 million while earnings climbed 42% to 27 cents a share. Some analysts said the positive outlook for the coming year isn't surprising given Cognos' track record. "But it's at the higher end of expectations," said Martin Houlden of TD Securities, who rates the stock a "buy". "The numbers are pretty bullish."
