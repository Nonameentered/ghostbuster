Toronto's Key Stock Index Ends Higher Despite Wall Street Losses 

The S&P/TSX Composite index rose 28.90 points, or 0.18%, to 15,935.74 on Thursday despite major losses on Wall Street. Strong gains in the health care, consumer staples, and telecommunications sectors offset weakness in materials and energy stocks. The Canadian market climbed even as U.S. stocks dropped sharply, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their worst daily declines since mid-August.

Cannabis producer Tilray Inc. surged over 13% to lead the health care sector higher after announcing a supply deal with a regional distributor. Consumer staples also rose, led by Maple Leaf Foods Inc., up 3.9% after reporting quarterly results. In contrast, losses in energy and materials stocks reflected lower oil prices and gold prices, respectively.

Eight of the index's 10 main sectors were higher. Health care was the biggest advancer, gaining 2.1%, followed by consumer staples at 1.1% and telecom services, up 0.5%. The energy sector dropped 1.4% as U.S. crude oil futures fell over 2% to below $70 a barrel. The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, lost 0.5% as gold futures dropped 0.8% to below $1,490 an ounce.

The rise in Canada's main stock index came despite weaker performances for major U.S. indexes, including the Nasdaq dropping over 3% and the S&P 500 declining 1.8% in its biggest one-day percentage fall since August 14th. Market analysts pointed to profit-taking, global growth worries, and political uncertainty as possible factors contributing to Wall Street's downward turn. The Canadian dollar slipped, ending at 75.23 cents U.S.

In summary, gains among health care, consumer staples, and telecommunications stocks outweighed weakness in the energy and materials sectors to lift Canada's main stock index on an otherwise negative day of trading in North American markets.
