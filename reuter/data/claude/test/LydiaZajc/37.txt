Vancouver Stock Exchange introduces after hours trading to attract Asian investors 

The Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE) announced today that it will extend its trading hours to attract more investors from Asia and other overseas markets. Beginning next month, the VSE will expand from its current trading window of 9:30 am to 4 pm local time to a new schedule of 7 am to 8 pm.

The longer 14-hour trading day will overlap more with the working hours of investors in major Asian financial centers like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo. “By offering after-hours trading, we make our exchange more accessible and convenient for investors across Asia to trade Canadian stocks,” said VSE CEO Mark Smith. “This move strengthens our connections with international investors and helps Canadian companies raise capital from a wider range of sources.”

The VSE currently has over 2,000 companies listed with a total market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. While the majority of investors and trading volumes still come from within Canada, the VSE has made attracting international investors a strategic priority in recent years. After-hours trading is the latest in a series of initiatives by the VSE targeting overseas investors, including new listings of Asia-focused companies, marketing partnerships in China and Southeast Asia, and the launch of its first international office in Hong Kong last year.  

Some analysts expressed skepticism that longer trading hours alone would be enough for the VSE to gain substantial new volumes from Asia. “There are already well-established exchanges in Asia that will continue to dominate trading in their own time zones,” said Ashwin Sankar, a senior economist at National Bank Financial.  “The VSE needs to differentiate itself in other ways, like promoting listings of natural resource, technology and cannabis companies that would be attractive to Asian investors.”

Others see the move as a step in the right direction that, combined with the VSE’s other Asia-focused efforts, will gradually raise its profile in the region. Jenny Wong, an investment analyst in Singapore, said “The new trading hours make the VSE an option for investors here that it wasn't before. This added convenience means the VSE's listings and offerings will now be on the radar for more international investors, including some of the large Asian funds and brokers.”  

The after-hours trading session will run from 4:15 pm to 8 pm local Vancouver time. The VSE's regular daytime session will remain unchanged. The new extended hours will start on February 3, 2020.
