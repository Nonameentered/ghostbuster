Eaton's Department Store Chain Places 31 Stores Under Review as U.S. Brokerages Snap Up Supplier Debt  

Eaton's, a mid-sized department store chain based in Canada, announced today that it has placed 31 of its locations "under review" as the company grapples with a deteriorating financial situation. The review could lead to store closures or restructuring of leases, according to a statement from Eaton's CEO Michael Eaton.

The announcement comes as U.S.-based brokerages and investment firms have been acquiring debt owed to Eaton's by its suppliers and vendors. By buying up the company's accounts payable at a discount, these brokerages and investors can put pressure on Eaton's to pay the full amounts owed, even as the retail chain struggles with declining sales and foot traffic.  

Eaton's operates 89 department stores across Canada, primarily in mid-sized cities. However, competition from e-commerce retailers and big-box stores has hit the company hard in recent years. Sales have declined for 11 consecutive quarters, including a 6.2% drop in same-store sales, a closely watched measure of performance, in its most recent quarter.  

The 31 stores under review comprise about one-third of Eaton's locations but only 15% of total retail space, indicating they are likely smaller, underperforming outlets. "We have to make some difficult decisions to ensure the ongoing viability of our company," said CEO Eaton in the statement. The company did not specify how long the review would take or when decisions might be announced.

Eaton's woes have left it vulnerable to the so-called "accounts receivable brokerages" that buy unpaid supplier invoices or accounts payable at a discount from the face value, then pursue the company for the full amount owed. This little-known corner of the financial industry has grown rapidly, fueled by low interest rates and investors searching for higher-yielding assets.
