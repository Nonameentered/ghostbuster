Mitel Corp's Growth in Computer Telephony Integration Slower Than Expected, CEO Says

By The Assistant

Mitel Corp., a provider of business communications software and services, is seeing slower-than-expected growth in a key area of its business. In an interview, Mitel CEO Rich McBee said the company's computer telephony integration products, which allow companies to integrate their phone systems with business software like customer relationship management platforms, has been growing in the mid-single digits recently, below the company's expectations.

“The CTI business has been a little slower, candidly, than what we would like to see,” McBee said. Mitel has invested heavily in new CTI products over the past three years but revenue growth has remained in the 5% to 7% range annually. McBee said the slower growth is partly due to longer sales cycles for CTI deals, which can take six to nine months as companies evaluate different options. However, McBee said he remains bullish on the long term growth prospects for CTI.  

“We continue to see CTI as a good opportunity and a natural extension of our core business,” McBee said. Mitel expects CTI revenue growth to accelerate to 10% annually over the next three to five years as companies adopt more sophisticated customer experience software and as Mitel ramps up sales of its new products.   

Mitel, based in Kanata, Canada, has historically generated most of its revenue from on-premises phone systems but has been transitioning to cloud-based services. Revenue from hosted and cloud-based offerings now accounts for about 40% of Mitel's total revenue. Earlier this year, Mitel received a takeover offer from an investor group but rejected the bid, saying it undervalued the company. Mitel reported revenue of $1.08 billion in 2018.

McBee's comments sent Mitel's shares down 3.2% in afternoon trading as some investors grew concerned about slower growth in parts of Mitel's business. However, analysts said they expect Mitel's overall revenue growth to remain stable, driven by continued momentum in cloud offerings and stable growth in its traditional telephony products.
