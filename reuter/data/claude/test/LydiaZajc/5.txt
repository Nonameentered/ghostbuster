Toronto Stock Market Reaches Eighth Record Close of 1997 with High-Flying Golds and Takeover News in Oil Patch

The Toronto Stock Exchange surged to its eighth record closing high of 1997, lifted by buying in gold shares and optimism around takeover talks in the oil sector.

The benchmark TSE 300 Index was up 57.28 points or 0.86% at 6,740.91. Gold shares led the way, with the gold sub-index up 4.8% as bullion prices in U.S. dollars struck their highest level since early January. Among the biggest gainers, Barrick Gold Corp advanced C$1.875 to C$20.375, Placer Dome Inc climbed C$1.375 to C$16 and Cambior Inc jumped 50 cents to C$6.10.

Merger and acquisition news also propelled energy stocks. Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd rose C$2 to C$26 after receiving a C$35-a-share hostile takeover offer from California's Unocal Corp. Alberta Energy Co gained C$1.125 to C$32.875 on growing speculation it may become an acquisition target.

“We're seeing some sector rotation into the cyclical names that have lagged, like golds, oils and banks,” said Stephen Lingard, director of equity trading at Nesbitt Burns. “There's a lot of cash still on the sidelines and investors are feeling optimistic.” 

Communications, financial services and transportation stocks also posted gains. Bell Canada Enterprises Inc advanced C$1.25 to C$65.50, Royal Bank of Canada was up 50 cents at C$45 and Canadian National Railway Co climbed 75 cents to C$37.25. But declines in some industrial, retail and forestry stocks capped the overall gain in the TSE.

Turnover on the exchange came in at 197 million shares, below the 1997 daily average of 214 million shares. Advancing shares outnumbered declining issues by about 5 to 3. 

The Canadian dollar finished at 71.77 U.S. cents, down 0.08 cent. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures rose amid takeover speculation in the oil patch, while gold futures pushed to their highest levels since early January.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.46 points to 7,438.12 while the Nasdaq Composite Index, dominated by technology shares, dipped 3.17 points to 1,520.92.
