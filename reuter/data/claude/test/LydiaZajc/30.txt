Toronto's Key Stock Index Surges Over 1%, Led by Blue Chip Rally While Broader Market Ends Mixed Amid Weaker Bullion Prices  

Toronto's main stock index surged more than 1% on Thursday, led by sharp gains in heavyweight financial and industrial shares, while the broader market ended mixed as weakness in gold miners weighed. 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index closed up 193.49 points, or 1.2%, at 16,525.45. The index's largest movers included Royal Bank of Canada, up 2.8% at $115.21, and Canadian National Railway Co, which rose 3.4% to $141.75.

Seven of the index's 10 main groups finished higher. The heavyweight financials sector, which accounts for more than a third of the Toronto market's valuation, climbed 1.7%, while industrials rose 1.8% and energy ended up 0.6% as oil prices firmed.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1% as gold futures fell 1.3% to $1,255.50 an ounce. Gold has tumbled more than 7% from its peak in February amid reduced geopolitical tensions. 

Barrick Gold Corp fell 3.6% to $22.91, while Kinross Gold Corp lost 3.3% at $5.31.

The TSX ended the first quarter up 3% after recording six straight months of gains, though activity wound down toward the end of March ahead of the Easter long weekend and as investors awaited catalysts like corporate earnings.

While analysts expect a steady economy and strong corporate results to support equities, concerns remain over policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, rising interest rates and trade disputes.

The Canadian dollar closed marginally higher at 79.13 U.S. cents.

On Wall Street, U.S. stocks ended mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to end at 24,748.07 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.2%. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 165 to 85, for a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the upside. Across all Canadian issues, there were 15 new 52-week highs and two new lows.

Total volume on Thursday was 344.5 million shares, the highest since March 20.
