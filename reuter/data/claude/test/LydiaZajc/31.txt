Toronto Stocks Flat After Expected Interest Rate Hike by U.S. Federal Open Market Committee 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was little changed Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a quarter point increase in its benchmark interest rate. The Fed raised the target range for its federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent to 2.25 percent, as widely expected.

The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its key interest rate next month for the fourth time since July 2017. Higher interest rates make fixed-income investments like bonds more attractive relative to riskier stocks.

The TSX closed at 16,414.46, up 3.08 points or less than 0.1 percent. Half of its 10 main groups edged lower, although the influential energy sector climbed 0.7 percent with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd gaining 1.1 percent to C$46.04.

The financials group slipped 0.3 percent. The prospect of higher interest rates typically helps banks boost net interest margins, the difference between what they charge on loans and pay on deposits. But investors also worry tighter monetary policy could curb lending growth.

Royal Bank of Canada was down 0.5 percent at C$102.97, while Toronto-Dominion Bank fell 0.4 percent to C$77.91.

Cannabis producers were also lower, extending Tuesday's decline after recreational marijuana became legal in Canada. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF was down 1.2 percent at C$19.60.

Eight of the index's 10 main sectors were in negative territory, including a 1.1 decline in the technology group. Open Text Corp fell 3.7 percent to C$51.13 after lowering its fiscal 2019 revenue forecast.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.5 percent as gold futures rose. Barrick Gold Corp advanced 1.1 percent to C$15.66.

U.S. stocks turned slightly higher after the Fed's rate decision. While further gradual rate increases are still expected, solid economic growth and a strong labor market are allowing the Fed to continue tightening policy.  The Fed still foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020.
