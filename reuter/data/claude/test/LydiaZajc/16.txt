Toronto stocks fell on Tuesday despite a rally in gold mining shares driven higher by rising bullion prices. The S&P/TSX composite index declined 132.91 points or 0.8% to 16,425.28.

Six of the index's 10 main sectors were lower, led by declines in financial and materials stocks. Healthcare stocks rose 2.2% with pot stocks gaining alongside strength in the broader marijuana sector. 

The materials sector, which includes mining and forestry stocks, declined 1.9% despite a jump in gold prices to the highest level in over six years. Shares of gold miners reversed earlier losses to rally, with the Gold Miners Index gaining 3.6%.

Shares of Barrick Gold Corp rose 5.6% to $22.48, while Kinross Gold Corp gained 7.2% to $8.10. Spot gold rose 1.2% to $1,429.10 an ounce, the highest since May 2013.

The financials sector slipped 1.3% with Canada's largest lenders down between 0.8% and 2.2%. Royal Bank of Canada declined the most, dropping 2.2% to $103.53.

Technology stocks lost 2% as shares of CGI Inc fell 3.3% and those of Kinaxis Inc were down 3.1%.

In contrast, the healthcare sector rallied, led by pot producers, as hopes rose for increased sales of marijuana products like vapes, edibles and topicals later this year when Canada allows their production and sale.

Canopy Growth Co added 4.1% to $52.03, while Aurora Cannabis gained 3.5% to $9.23. The stocks have surged in recent months.

The overall market decline came as investors weighed mixed economic data. Canadian wholesale trade unexpectedly dropped in May for the first time in four months. A separate report showed a bigger-than-expected drop in housing starts last month.

The Canadian dollar was little changed at $1.3077 to the U.S. dollar, holding within its recent trading range. Canada's 10-year government bond yield eased half a basis point lower at 1.459%.

Wall Street also fell on growth concerns exacerbated by U.S.-China trade worries. The Dow Industrials declined 0.97%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.97% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.61%.
