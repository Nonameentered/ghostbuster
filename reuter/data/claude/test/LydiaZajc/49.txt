Loblaw Cos Ltd predicts 50% earnings per share growth by 2000 as sales surge 

Loblaw Companies Ltd., Canada's largest food distributor, said Wednesday that earnings per share could rise by up to 50% within the next two years, fueled by continuing strong sales growth.

For the fiscal year ended Jan. 1, Loblaw earned $1.62 per share, up 46% from $1.11 per share in 1995. Sales rose 9.4% to $16.04 billion from $14.68 billion.

Both the fourth quarter and full year exceeded analysts' expectations. Loblaw shares rose 3 1/8 to close at 80 1/2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

"We look to repeat our performance of the last two years and target 25% compound annual earnings-per-share growth over the next two years," said Richard Currie, Loblaw's chairman and chief executive officer.

That could boost per-share earnings to about $2.50 by early 2000. 

Currie attributed the company's strong performance to a turnaround of itsAtlantic Wholesalers unit, improving profit margins, and continued strong sales fueled by economic growth and low inflation.

Same-store sales, those at outlets open at least a year, rose 7.1% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year. Sales were "very strong across the country and across all formats," Currie said.

Profit margins also improved for both the fourth quarter and full year due to lower costs for warehousing and transportation, as well as for how the company obtains goods.

"The company is performing at an extremely high level," said analyst Keith Howlett of Nesbitt Burns. But "there's some question as to how sustainable this rate of return on equity of over 20% is." 
 
The turnaround of Atlantic Wholesalers, the food distribution unit that serves Atlantic Canada, was a major contributor to improved results. The division reported a $2.6 million operating profit in 1996 compared to a $27.4 million loss in 1995.
