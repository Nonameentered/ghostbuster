Toronto Stocks Reach Record High on Strong Gold and Base Metal Prices

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed at a record high today, lifting the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index up 245 points or 1.6% to 15,678, surpassing the previous record close on January 4, 2020. The strong performance was led by gains in the materials sector, which jumped 4.8% due to rising prices for gold and base metals including copper, zinc, and nickel.  

Gold prices rose 2% to over $1,900 per ounce, the highest level since 2011. Investors sought out the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty in global markets. Shares of major Canadian gold producers like Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, and Franco-Nevada all climbed between 5 to 8% fueling the broader sector gains.

Base metal prices also strengthened on increased demand expectations as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Copper prices reached a four-year high, while zinc and nickel prices jumped 3.8% and 5.2% respectively. This rallied shares of copper producer First Quantum Minerals up 9.7%, zinc miner Teck Resources 7.6% higher, and nickel miner Sherritt International rising 13.8%.

"The surge in materials and commodities today is a signal that markets are gaining more confidence in the economic recovery," said Philip Petursson, Chief Investment Strategist at Manulife Investment Management. "Reopenings are driving demand for raw materials, while stimulus programs are fueling inflation worries and higher gold prices."

Energy stocks also had a strong day as oil prices rose, with shares of Suncor Energy, Cenovus Energy, and Canadian Natural Resources climbing between 4 to 6 percent. The technology sector was the only laggard, dropping 0.6% on a moderate pullback in U.S. tech giants. 

Overall, nine of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were up on the day. The record close on Canada's senior equity market reflects growing optimism about recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Stronger commodity prices and steady economic reopenings are boosting investors' risk appetite despite lingering concerns over inflation, variants, and uneven access to vaccines. With steady gains so far this year, the TSX looks poised to continue its upward momentum into the second half of 2021.
