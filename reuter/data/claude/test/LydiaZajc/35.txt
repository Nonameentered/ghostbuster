Toronto Stock Exchange closes softer due to weak gold shares and fears of Canadian interest rate hike

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed lower today as weak gold shares and expectations of an interest rate increase by the Bank of Canada weighed on the market. 

The S&P/TSX Composite Index declined 89.04 points or 0.56% to 15,863.71. Half of the index's 10 sectors fell, led by decliners in materials and financials. Gold stocks were among the worst performers, with shares of Barrick Gold Corp falling 3.6% and Kinross Gold Corp down 4.2%. The price of gold declined 0.7% as the U.S. dollar strengthened, reducing the appeal of the precious metal.

Financial stocks also weakened on speculation the Bank of Canada may raise interest rates at its meeting next week. Higher rates could slow down economic growth and reduce demand for loans. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce fell 1.1% and the Royal Bank of Canada was down 0.8%. The central bank has not raised rates since October 2018, but recent comments from Governor Stephen Poloz suggest the bank is open to hiking rates if economic data supports the move.

On the upside, the information technology sector gained 1.4%, boosted by shares of Open Text Corp up 3.4% and Constellation Software rising 2.1%. The energy sector also advanced as oil prices moved higher. Cenovus Energy closed up 2.6% and Suncor Energy gained 1.2%.

Overall, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the TSX by a ratio of about 2 to 1. Trading volume was below average for the market.

Investors remain cautiously optimistic about the economic recovery but are parsing comments from central banks for any signs of tighter monetary policy. The Bank of Canada is expected to provide an updated economic outlook when it makes its rate decision next Wednesday. Any indication rates may rise sooner rather than later could dampen enthusiasm, especially for interest-sensitive sectors like gold and financials. However, optimism over vaccine rollouts and reopening economies should continue to support energy and other hard-hit segments. The mixed influences are likely to make for choppy trading in Canadian stocks in the near term.
