Toronto stocks mixed as weak gold and forestry stocks offset strong bank issues and NY rally

Toronto stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as weaker gold and forestry stocks offset strong gains in bank issues and a rally in New York. 

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 3.10 points at 14,191.42. Half of the index's 10 main sectors advanced.

Gold stocks dropped 1.4% as the price of gold fell $13.30 to $1,317.70 U.S. an ounce. Major gold producers to dipped included  Barrick Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines, down 2% and 1.7%, respectively.

The materials sector, which includes forestry companies and miners, declined 0.5%. Forestry stocks slipped after Resolute Forest Products and Interfor fell 3.9% and 1.4% respectively after reporting quarterly results.

The Canadian dollar slid after the Bank of Canada said it expects the economy to slow in the first half of 2018. The central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 1.25%. The loonie was trading at 81.07 cents U.S., down 0.37 of a cent.

The technology and financial sectors led the gainers. Large financial stocks were up 0.5% as shares of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal rose 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively.  

Energy companies rose 0.4% even though oil continued its slide. The June crude contract fell 29 cents to $67.82 U.S. a barrel.

In New York, U.S. markets were driven higher primarily by industrials and technology stocks with the Nasdaq gaining 0.80% to an intraday record high and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 111 points to 24,911.

Overall, the mixed day in Toronto reflected weakness in commodity-related issues offset by strength in financials and spillover from a rally in U.S. stocks, said Craig Fehr, Canadian markets strategist at Edward Jones.

“The materials and energy sectors continue to face some headwinds, but technology, financials and industrial sectors are holding in relatively well, so that’s providing some balance,” he said.
