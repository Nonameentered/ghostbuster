Toronto Stocks Close Weaker After New York-led Sell-Off

Toronto stocks fell on Wednesday in a broad-based retreat led by weakness in technology, healthcare and mining shares as renewed fears of higher interest rates weighed on investor sentiment. The weakness followed a sell-off in U.S. stocks as 10-year Treasury yields spiked following an upbeat economic assessment from the Federal Reserve.  

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 113.42 points or 0.71 percent at 15,915.56. The TSX Venture Exchange was lower 15.22 points or 0.23 percent at 6,786.84.

Healthcare and technology were the biggest decliners, with declines of 1.8 and 1.2 percent respectively. The heavily weighted financials group edged up 0.1 percent while materials shed 0.5 percent as weak base metal prices weighed on gold and mining shares.      

Shares of Barrick Gold fell 1.7 percent to $21.70, while First Quantum Minerals was down 4.6 percent at $17.45. Aurora Cannabis declined 6.5 percent to $12.82 and Shopify dropped 2.9 percent to $254.24.

The swing in yields followed commentary from Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, that the U.S. economy is in a "good place." That stoked expectations that the central bank may continue to raise interest rates at a steady pace. Higher interest rates are seen as negative for stocks. 

"The equity markets were concerned about higher interest rates again today after Powell's comments," said Liz Miller, president of Summit Place Financial Advisors. "The strength of the economy continues to put upward pressure on rates and that is causing some anxiety in the markets at the moment."

The Canadian dollar averaged $0.7707 U.S., down 0.16 cents. The rise in oil prices lent some support to the loonie with December crude up 47 cents to $54.01 U.S. a barrel. 

Overall, seven of the Toronto Stock Exchange's 10 main groups ended lower. Volume on the Big Six Canadian banks totaled 30.6 million shares, compared with their five-day average of 23.8 million shares.  

The market selloff looked set to continue into Thursday following more losses overnight in global markets. While third quarter earnings continue to come in ahead of forecasts, the direction of interest rates and global trade tensions remain key for investors.
