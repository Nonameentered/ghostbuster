Toronto Stocks End Higher as Banks Surge and Interest Rate Hike Fears Ease        

The Toronto Stock Exchange closed higher on Friday as major banks surged and fears of higher interest rates eased. The S&P/TSX composite index rose 91.01 points or 0.57% to 16,001.05.  

Shares of Canada's biggest banks jumped after they reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Royal Bank, the country's largest lender, rose 2.2% after reporting earnings that topped analysts' estimates. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal all gained between 1.4 to 2.1% after also reporting solid results.

The financial sector helped lift the market even as shares of energy companies and other resource stocks fell with the prices of oil and metals. Oil dropped by the most in almost a month in volatile trading. The energy sector fell 0.9%.   

Investors were also encouraged by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who said interest rates are "in a good place" and signaled borrowing costs may remain on hold for some time. Remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also reinforced expectations of steady rates. Their comments helped ease concerns about higher interest rates, which can slow economic growth and hurt equities.

"Overall it looks like it could be a positive for equities just based on rates staying lower for longer," said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. "Any time we get confirmation that rates are going to stay at this level that tends to be positive for stocks."   

The TSX extended gains for a second straight day, hitting its highest level in more than 18 months. So far this year, it has climbed 16% and is on track for its biggest annual gain since 2014. But many analysts warn the rally may have run too far, too fast given slowing economic growth globally.

All but two of the 16 major sectors on the TSX ended up on the day. Healthcare rose nearly 4% as several cannabis stocks surged. Information technology and consumer discretionary stocks also saw solid gains.
