Toronto Stocks Mixed as Bank Rally Outweighs Other Profit-Taking

The Toronto Stock Exchange ended the trading day mixed as gains in financial stocks offset losses in other sectors. The S&P/TSX Composite Index closed up 17.99 points at 21,455.82.  

Canada's big banks were the top performers, rallying after strong earnings reports last week. Royal Bank of Canada shares rose 2.3% and Toronto-Dominion Bank advanced 2.1%. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal also posted solid gains.

"The banks clearly drove the market today with their post-earnings momentum," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. "Their results and dividend increases last week showed the banks remain in solid shape, so investors were buying on the news."

Other sectors declined as some investors locked in profits from last week's broader rally. The energy sector dropped 1.2% as oil prices fell, with Canadian Natural Resources down 2.3% and Cenovus Energy decreasing 1.9%.

Materials stocks also weighed on the market, with gold miners declining as bullion prices dropped to their lowest level in a week. Kinross Gold Corp. tumbled 5.8% and Alamos Gold Inc. slid 4.2%.

Healthcare and real estate stocks, which are more interest-rate sensitive, retreated as bond yields rose. Cannabis producer Aphria Inc. declined 2.7% and Dream Office REIT fell 2.3%.

Despite the mixed finish, market participants remain optimistic about equity markets going forward. "The outlook for stocks still looks positive," Cieszynski said. "Earnings season has been pretty solid so far, economic growth is still decent, inflation remains low and central banks are still accommodating. As long as interest rates stay steady, the path of least resistance for stocks remains up."

Consumer staples was the only other sector in positive territory, gaining 0.3% with Maple Leaf Foods Inc. up 2.2% and Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. rising 1.7% after releasing quarterly results.

Overall, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4 on the TSX. Volume exceeded 264 million shares, below the six-month average.
