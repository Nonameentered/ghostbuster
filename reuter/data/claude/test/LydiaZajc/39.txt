Toronto Stocks Gain Nearly One Percent Powered by Conglomerates and Banking Groups

The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index rose  nearly one percent on Tuesday, boosted by stocks in the  conglomerates and banking sectors. The S&P/TSX Composite index closed up 73.68 points, or 0.97 percent, at 7,716.31.

Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd gained 2.2 percent after reporting a  smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday. The results beat analysts' expectations, helped by higher freight volumes. Its shares rose C$6.59 to C$305.98. 

Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-biggest lender, rose 1.4 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings which were ahead of market forecasts. The bank benefited from strength in its international division and lower loan loss provisions. Its shares gained C$1.13 to C$81.74.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.3 percent as gold futures fell. Gold miner Barrick Gold Corp declined 2.0 percent to C$15.65.

The energy sector was down 0.2 percent even though oil prices rose. The country's largest oil producer Canadian Natural Resources fell 0.3 percent to C$39.05.

The TSX has climbed 15 percent so far this year, outpacing the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index. Last week, the Toronto market notched record closing highs for four straight sessions through Friday.

"The Canadian stock market continues to benefit from solid economic growth, higher commodity prices, a stable currency and strong corporate profits," said Craig Fehr, Investment Strategist at Edward Jones. 

Overall, eight of the index's 11 major sectors were higher on Tuesday.
