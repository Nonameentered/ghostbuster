Wal-Mart's First Unionized Store in Canada Gets Certified Despite Employee Vote 

The United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW) in Windsor, Ontario announced Tuesday that it has been certified to represent employees at one of Canada's most iconic Wal-Mart stores, making it the first unionized Wal-Mart location in the country. The announcement comes despite the fact that more than 60% of employees at the Windsor store voted against unionization in a Labour Relations Board election last month.

The UFCW filed for certification with the Ontario Labour Relations Board in January, arguing that Wal-Mart used illegal intimidation tactics to influence the vote against unionization. After investigating the claims, the board ruled that Wal-Mart violated labour laws during the campaign and that a fair election was not possible. As a result, the board ordered that the UFCW be certified as the bargaining agent for all employees at the Windsor store.

“This is a historic day and a victory for employees who fought for years to have free and fair representation at Wal-Mart,” said UFCW National President Wayne Hanley in a statement. The union has long claimed that employees face difficult working conditions at Wal-Mart including low wages, inadequate benefits and unfair scheduling practices. 

Wal-Mart, which is headquartered in Arkansas, expressed disappointment with the ruling and suggested it may appeal the decision. “We disagree with the labour board’s finding and maintain we followed all laws and regulations during the union vote,” said Wal-Mart Canada spokesperson Felicia Fefer in an email. “Our associates have told us time and again that they do not want or need a union to represent them.”

The UFCW has attempted to organize Wal-Mart employees for years but this marks the first successful certification. Wal-Mart has vigorously fought union drives at its stores, requiring managers to sit through training on how to spot and discourage union activity. Unions allege these tactics are illegal and meant to strip workers of their democratic right to collective bargaining. Tuesday's announcement is a significant milestone and the UFCW will now begin the process of negotiating a first contract for the nearly 300 employees at the Windsor location.
