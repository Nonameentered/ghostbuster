Toronto Stocks Close Soft on Fears of Canadian Interest Rate Hikes After U.S. Fed Raises Short-term Rates  

The Toronto stock exchange closed lower today as investors worried that the Bank of Canada may raise interest rates following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to hike short-term rates by 0.25%. The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 43.20 points, or 0.3%, to 16,449.30. Most sectors declined, with the financial, consumer discretionary, and technology sectors facing the steepest drops.

The U.S. Fed raised its benchmark rate for the second time this year, aiming to prevent a strengthening economy and labor market from overheating. While the move was widely expected, it stoked concerns that the Bank of Canada may follow suit with its own rate increase. The Canadian central bank's key overnight rate has remained at 1% since July 2015. Higher interest rates can weaken stock markets as they present an alternative to riskier equities while also decreasing the value of future cash flows for some companies.

“Investors are worried that the Fed's rate hike today may signal that the pace of increases will be a bit faster than expected,” said Craig Porter, chief strategist at TD Asset Management. “If the Bank of Canada follows the Fed's lead, it would create headwinds for the Canadian economy and stock market.”

The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.3% to 74.88 U.S. cents. Lower oil and natural gas prices also weighed on the currency, which is heavily tied to commodity exports.

Among stocks, Canada's largest financial companies, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, dropped 0.8% and 0.7% respectively. Rogers Communications Inc. and Magna International Inc. were down over 1%. Enbridge Inc., a major oil pipeline company, fell 1.2%.

Some market participants argued that concerns over higher interest rates in Canada are overblown. “While the Bank of Canada may tighten at some point, there is no evidence rates are headed higher in the immediate future,” said Earl Davis, head of rates strategy at CIBC. “The Canadian economy still faces headwinds, like high consumer debt levels, that should keep the central bank on hold for now.”
