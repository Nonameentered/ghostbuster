Toronto stocks fall due to weakness on Wall Street and financial sector downturn 

The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index fell today as oil prices declined and financial stocks took a hit in response to weaker markets south of the border. The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 122.19 points, or 0.8%, at 15,629.08. The index was led lower by a 1.7 percent decline in the financials sector as three of the big Canadian banks reported quarterly results that disappointed investors.

The losses in Toronto came as Wall Street's main indexes were down over concerns over rising U.S. treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.3%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4%.

Canadian bank stocks fell after quarterly results from Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Toronto-Dominion Bank failed to match high expectations. Bank of Montreal dropped 2.5% as it reported profits that missed estimates, in part due to higher provisions for soured loans. CIBC fell 2.6% after reporting higher expenses in its capital markets division, while TD Bank lost 1.9% despite posting higher quarterly earnings.  

The weakness in the large-cap banks helped push the financials sector lower, accounting for a major part of the decline on the TSX. Oil prices also weighed, with U.S. crude settling 0.9% lower at $63.13 a barrel. That pressured the energy sector, which fell 0.6%. Together, financials and energy stocks make up around 50% of the TSX.

Some market observers saw the losses in Canada as a temporary blip. "There's nothing fundamentally the matter," said Sid Mokhtari, market technician at CIBC World Markets. "We've just had a rip-roaring rally and we're taking a breather." The Toronto market is up over 1,000 points since December, helped by strengthening oil prices, a weaker Canadian dollar, and improving global economic prospects.

In summary, losses on Wall Street and underwhelming quarterly results from some of Canada's major banks dragged the Toronto Stock Exchange lower today. However, analysts said the decline could represent a short-term pause in the market's strong rally over the past few months. The financial sector led the losses but energy names also fell on weaker oil prices.
