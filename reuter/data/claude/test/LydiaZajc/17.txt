Canadian Retailer T. Eaton Co. Ltd. Files for Court Protection and Plans to Close Stores 

T. Eaton Co. Ltd., one of Canada’s oldest and largest department store chains, filed for court protection from creditors today and announced plans to close several of its stores across the country. The retailer has faced declining sales and increasing debt in recent years due to growing competition from big-box stores and online retailers.

Eaton’s, as the chain is commonly known, was founded in 1869 in Toronto. For decades, its large downtown department stores were fixtures in cities and towns across Canada. However, in the 1990s Eaton’s began to struggle with its traditional retail model. An ill-fated expansion into the United States led to mounting losses. 

In an effort to restructure its operations, Eaton’s filed for protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act. The company announced that as part of its restructuring, it will close 27 of its remaining 59 stores over the next four months. Some of the closures include flagship locations such as its Queen Street store in Toronto and Rideau Street store in Ottawa.

“This was an extremely difficult decision, but it is necessary to ensure the viability and continued operation of our business,” said Eaton’s CEO Jonathan Eaton. “We deeply regret the impact on our employees and customers.”

The closures will result in nearly 3,000 employees losing their jobs. However, Jonathan Eaton said that with a reduced store base and lower costs, the company will be in a better position to invest in revitalizing its remaining stores and improving its e-commerce business. The restructuring plan requires court approval and the support of creditors and lenders before it can proceed.

Eaton's still operates 35 stores predominantly in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. Though a Canadian institution, many analysts wonder if downsizing will be enough to rescue the once mighty retailer from the significant challenges facing department stores today. For now, Canadians will have to wait to see if this new chapter in Eaton’s long history has a happy ending.
