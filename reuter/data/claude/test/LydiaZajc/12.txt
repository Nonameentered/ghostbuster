iStar Internet Inc predicts reduced Q3 loss, CEO says Q4 will be even better 

iStar Internet Inc, a struggling online entertainment streaming company, announced its financial results for the third quarter today. The company is predicting a smaller loss for Q3 compared to the same period last year. iStar CEO Brian Thompson expressed optimism that the fourth quarter and next year would show even greater improvements.

For the third quarter ending September 30, iStar is forecasting a loss of $12 million, compared to a loss of $18 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenue is expected to be $178 million, up 22% from $145 million last year. The reduced loss was attributed to higher subscription revenue from iStar's streaming service as well as lower operating costs due to a restructuring plan put in place earlier this year.

In a statement, CEO Brian Thompson said, "We are starting to turn the corner and gain momentum with our streaming service. Our investments in exclusive content and partnerships are paying off as subscribers continue to increase at a healthy pace. With the restructuring now behind us, we have a leaner cost base and are well positioned to achieve profitability next year."

iStar has struggled as competition in the streaming media space has intensified. The company's stock price has declined more than 50% over the last two years as larger rivals have launched rival streaming platforms. To boost growth, iStar has invested heavily in original content and struck deals with major media companies to license popular movies, TV shows, and live sports. The company hopes improved offerings and lower prices will help win back subscribers who have switched to competitors.  

The fourth quarter and 2020 are "going to be a breakout year for iStar," Thompson said. The company is forecasting at least 30% revenue growth for the full year as new content and pricing promotions reel in more subscribers. If subscription numbers meet targets, Thompson expects iStar to achieve its first profitable quarter in Q2 and be solidly profitable for the full year. Investors seem optimistic, with iStar's shares up over 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release.
