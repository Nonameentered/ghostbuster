China's firm backing of Hong Kong dollar makes attack unlikely, say experts  

Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar is unlikely to come under attack despite recent pro-democracy protests, according to several experts. Analysts say China's strong support of the system and healthy FX reserves make the Hong Kong dollar a stable bet for now.

The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at about 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to 1 U.S. dollar since 1983. The system has helped Hong Kong become a major financial hub.

Some pro-democracy activists have recently called for attacking the peg to undermine China's control over the former British colony. But analysts say there is little risk of that succeeding given China's unwavering support for the peg and the city's large fiscal reserves.

"The peg system is backed by the Chinese authorities," said Mark Williams, Chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. "It is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's financial system and monetary authority has abundant resources to maintain it."  

Hong Kong's Exchange Fund - the territory's currency board - holds $438 billion in reserves, giving it ample firepower to intervene in currency markets and fend off speculative attacks. The fund can also obtain additional resources from Hong Kong's large fiscal reserves and China if needed.

"The reserves suggest investors have little reason to doubt the longevity of current arrangements," said Williams. A speculative attack is unlikely to be successful unless there are doubts about the system's sustainability, he added.

Victoria Li, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said China increasingly sees a stable Hong Kong dollar as in line with its own interests. "China's rising economic and political clout has strengthened the stability of the peg," she said.  

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, has also taken measures to ward off speculative capital flows, making it easier to monitor funds moving in and out of the territory. This also makes it easier to take action against speculative positions. 

Still, rising geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. and doubts over Hong Kong's political autonomy pose risks.  "The developments do paint a rather worrying picture of the HK's autonomy and increase uncertainty attached to its status as an international financial center,‚Äù said analysts at CKB-Citigroup.

For now, though, analysts don't see an immediate threat to the peg given the territory's still healthy economy and finances along with China's backing. Barring a wider crisis of confidence in Hong Kong, said Fitch's Li, "the stable peg will remain a key part of Hong Kong's monetary system."
