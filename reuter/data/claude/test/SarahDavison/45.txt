Experts: Hong Kong and China Currency Merge Impossible in Short-Term and Unlikely in Long-Term 

Financial experts predict that a full merger of the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese yuan is impossible in the short term and unlikely even in the long run. Hong Kong maintains a linked exchange rate system that pegs the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. Abandoning that system in favor of a merger with the yuan would be an enormous economic challenge, experts say.

Hong Kong's monetary system has been in place since 1983 and provides stability to the city's economy. Pegging the Hong Kong dollar to the greenback has ensured low inflation and interest rates in Hong Kong. If Hong Kong were to scrap that system in favor of the yuan, it could lead to financial turbulence and capital flight from the city. According to economist Chen Zhiwu, "The economic costs would far outweigh the benefits. Moving to the yuan now would be economic suicide for Hong Kong.‚Äù  

China also has little incentive to push for a quick currency merger. China's leaders value Hong Kong's capitalist system and want to preserve the city's economic vibrancy. A rushed currency change could jeopardize that. Political considerations also weigh on China as pro-democracy protests have intensified in Hong Kong. Pushing for faster financial integration at this time may only stoke those tensions.  

In the long run, as China's yuan becomes more freely traded and market-driven, a currency merger may make more sense. But restrictions on the yuan and China's control of its exchange rate remain obstacles. Beijing has recently made the yuan more flexible but it is still tightly managed compared to freely floating currencies like the Hong Kong dollar. Most experts anticipate China needs 10-20 years more of economic reforms before its currency is ready to fully integrate with Hong Kong's.  

While closer financial cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China will continue gradually, a full merger of currencies remains a distant prospect. For now, Hong Kong's dollar peg affords benefits to both the city and China that outweigh the rationale for any quick change. Economic and political realities suggest 2047, when China's promised "one country, two systems" framework for Hong Kong expires, is the earliest a currency merger could realistically be contemplated. For the foreseeable future, the Hong Kong dollar will remain tied to the U.S. greenback.
