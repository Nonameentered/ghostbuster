Nicholas-Applegate to Acquire Credit Lyonnais' Asian Fund Management Unit in Industry Consolidation Deal  

Nicholas-Applegate capital Management, a large U.S.-based asset manager, announced today that it will acquire Credit Lyonnais' Asian fund management division for an undisclosed amount. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the asset management industry as companies seek to gain scale and expand into new markets.

The acquisition will add $12 billion in assets under management and provide Nicholas-Applegate an expanded presence in China, Singapore, and other Asian markets. The deal comes just six months after Nicholas-Applegate was itself acquired by Manulife Financial, a large Canadian financial services group, for $2.7 billion.

“Asia represents the largest area of opportunity for asset managers over the next decade,” said Neil Patterson, chief executive of Nicholas-Applegate. “Gaining the established team and track record of Credit Lyonnais in Asia will accelerate our ability to tap into the strong demand from the region's fast-growing middle class for investment and retirement products.”

Founded in 1985, Credit Lyonnais entered the Asian fund management market in the early 1990s and has built up a reputation for strong performance in regional equity funds, particularly those focused on technology and healthcare. Two-thirds of its assets are in emerging market strategies, with much of the money coming from institutional investors in Europe. 

The Asian unit has over 80 employees across six offices, including fund managers, analysts, and product specialists. All staff will join Nicholas-Applegate as part of the transaction and the teams and processes will remain intact, according to people familiar with the deal.

Nicholas-Applegate intends to use Credit Lyonnais' retail distribution network in Asia to strengthen its own direct-to-consumer business in the region. It will also gain a foothold in China's rapidly opening asset management sector, where foreign companies have been eager to establish joint ventures and gain access to the country's growing wealth.

Continued deals and mergers in the asset management sector are likely as mid-sized players seek to gain scale to address margin pressure from low-cost passive funds and ETFs, as well as rising technology and compliance costs. However, deals also pose risks around integration and the potential for culture clashes. The agreement for Credit Lyonnais' Asian business is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals.
