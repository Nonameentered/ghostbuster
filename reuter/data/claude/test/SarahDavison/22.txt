British Chamber of Commerce warns of rising corruption and declining standards in Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty 

The British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong issued a stern warning today about deteriorating business conditions in the territory under Chinese rule. In its annual report on the state of business in Hong Kong, the Chamber said there are "rising levels of corruption, declining government efficiency and transparency, and a weakening of rule of law and independent judiciary."

The report comes at a sensitive time, just over two years after Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Business leaders have expressed concern that China is exerting more control over Hong Kong and eroding the territory's reputation as a well-regulated international business hub with strong governance and rule of law. 

"Businesses are alarmed at signs that the 'one country, two systems' model is being diluted more rapidly and deeply than expected," said Jardine Matheson Chairman Simon Keswick. "There are troubling indications that Hong Kong's institutional framework is being undermined and public skepticism over the independence and integrity of certain institutions has risen."

Specifically, the British Chamber pointed to several indicators of declining standards: 

•A rise in reports of bribery and corruption, especially related to land development and infrastructure projects. The Independent Commission Against Corruption received nearly 25% more corruption complaints last year compared to 2012.

•Government policies and decisions that lack transparency and public consultation. Key decisions seem to be made behind closed doors with more influence from Beijing. New security laws also threaten civil liberties and freedom of expression.

•Weaker systems of checks and balances as Beijing asserts more "oversight" over the Hong Kong government. The judiciary and civil service are under threat of losing their independence. 

•Restrictions on certain business sectors like the media, where increasing censorship and self-censorship are apparent. Several international media organizations have faced interference from Chinese authorities in their Hong Kong operations.

Business groups are calling on Hong Kong officials to reaffirm their commitment to protecting civil liberties, institutional independence and transparency. But with China tightening its grip, reassurances from the Hong Kong government may ring hollow. The Chamber warns that if this trend continues, "Hong Kong risks losing its competitiveness and unique position as a global business and financial center." For now, Hong Kong remains a critical trading hub but its future as a leading market under Chinese rule looks increasingly uncertain.
