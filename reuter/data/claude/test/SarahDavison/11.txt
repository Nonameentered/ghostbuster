British Soldiers Conduct Final Mock Battle in Hong Kong Before Handover to China 

HONG KONG - British forces stationed in Hong Kong conducted their final military exercises today ahead of the handover of the territory to China on July 1. The Royal Gurkha Rifles and other units carried out a mock battle in the rugged hills of the New Territories to demonstrate their continued operational readiness, even as they prepare to withdraw from Hong Kong after more than 150 years of British rule.

The exercises capped off a series of events in recent days to mark the end of the British military presence in Hong Kong. The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, inspected the British garrison on Friday in a pomp-filled ceremony. Prime Minister Tony Blair visited earlier this week, praising British forces for their exemplary service in Hong Kong. 

More than 6,000 British troops are stationed in Hong Kong, many with their families. Most will return to military bases in the United Kingdom after the handover. Some units have been in Hong Kong for decades, establishing deep ties to the local community. Their withdrawal signifies the end of imperial-era outposts for British forces in Asia and around the world.

The mock battle featured a scenario involving Gurkha forces defending a key installation from an attack by irregular forces. The Gurkhas used artillery and mortar fire and defensive positions to repel waves of “enemy” fighters in a choreographed set of maneuvers. The exercises also included a helicopter assault and medical evacuation to simulate a fast-paced, modern conflict.

Brigadier Christopher Hammerbeck, commander of the British forces in Hong Kong, said the troops were demonstrating “the British army's ability to operate at short notice anywhere in the world.” He said the exercises highlighted the skills and flexibility “that we can deploy at any time.”

The handover of Hong Kong to China will end 156 years of British rule over the territory. Under a 1984 agreement between London and Beijing, Britain agreed to return Hong Kong in exchange for China preserving the city's autonomy and way of life for 50 years. Hong Kong will become a special administrative region, retaining its own government and economy separate from mainland China.

The British handover ceremony will be held the night of June 30th, with Prince Charles presiding. The Chinese will assume control at the stroke of midnight on July 1st, marking the final end of Britain's once mighty empire in Asia. A new era will begin for Hong Kong under Chinese rule.
