Farewell to the Royal Navy in Hong Kong as HMS Tamar naval base closes after 156 years

The HMS Tamar naval facility in Hong Kong, operational for over 150 years, will officially close today in a ceremony marking the end of a historic era. The Royal Navy base, situated on Hong Kong Island, served as the main base for the navy in Hong Kong until 1997 when British rule ended in the territory. Since then, it has been used by the People's Liberation Army Navy Hong Kong Garrison. 

The HMS Tamar base was first established in 1865 and has been an important site for the British military presence in Asia for well over a century. At its peak, the base was home to over 2,000 British military personnel with a variety of ships and naval equipment. It served as not just a key naval installation but also a symbolic reminder of British naval power projection on the global stage.

The impending closure of HMS Tamar is the end of the final chapter of Royal Navy operations in Hong Kong. The British handed control of Hong Kong back to China in 1997 after governing the territory for over 150 years. As part of the handover agreement, Britain agreed to remove all naval forces from Hong Kong. Most British forces left in the 1990s but HMS Tamar has continued limited operations with a small contingent of Royal Navy personnel over the past two decades.  

In a farewell ceremony today, the remaining Royal Navy ships and personnel will depart the HMS Tamar base for the last time. The base facilities and equipment will be handed over officially to the People's Liberation Army Navy, marking another milestone in China's control of Hong Kong. The lowering of the White Ensign, the Royal Navy's naval ensign flag, from the HMS Tamar flagpoles will signify an poignant end of Britain's naval presence in Hong Kong.

The closure of HMS Tamar brings to an end a long and proud history of the Royal Navy in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. The base served Britain well through times of both peace and conflict in Asia, spanning some of Britain's most notable military engagements in the region from the First and Second Opium Wars to the handover of Hong Kong. For the Royal Navy, it represented an enduring symbol of Britain's strength on the global stage. The final departure from HMS Tamar today closes the book on that history, as another emblem of the sunset of the British Empire fades into memory.
