Hong Kong and Taiwan in dispute over call warrants linked to Taipei index  

Officials in Hong Kong and Taiwan are engaged in a dispute over derivatives linked to Taiwan's stock exchange. At issue are call warrants, financial products sold in Hong Kong that allow investors to bet on the future performance of Taiwan's Taiex stock index.

Regulators in Taiwan argue the call warrants violate laws prohibiting offshore trading of Taiwan-linked financial instruments. However, Hong Kong officials and brokers counter that the warrants are legal since they settle in cash and never require the physical delivery of any Taiwanese stocks.

The call warrants have been offered in Hong Kong for over 15 years and have become popular with investors looking for exposure to Taiwan's market. They are issued by global investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale, with hundreds of millions in turnover each month.

Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission began raising concerns about the call warrants last year, worrying they could destabilize the island's stock market or enable illicit cross-border transactions. The FSC formally asked Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission in May to investigate and potentially stop the sale of the products.

Hong Kong officials say they found no evidence the call warrants harm Taiwan's market or violate any laws or regulations. They note the products reference the Taiex index but do not actually confer ownership of the underlying Taiwanese stocks. "There appears to be a misunderstanding on the nature of these index-linked call warrants in Taiwan," said a Hong Kong government spokesperson. "We have explained to our Taiwanese counterparts that these warrants are cash-settled." 

Brokers that issue the call warrants have also pushed back against Taiwan's demands, arguing the derivatives meet all requirements under Hong Kong law and do not cross legal boundaries. Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it "is offering and trading these warrants in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations in Hong Kong." The Taiwan FSC is still pressuring Hong Kong to take action and may escalate the dispute to involve government trade and legal channels if not resolved. The spat highlights the regulatory complexity of cross-border finance between Hong Kong and Taiwan, which Beijing claims sovereignty over.
