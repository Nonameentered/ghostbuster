Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang pledges stability and prosperity before return to Chinese rule

Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang today pledged to maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong's economy in the run-up to the handover of the territory from British to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. 

Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Tsang outlined his key priorities for the financial sector over the next six months. "Maintaining confidence and stability in the Hong Kong dollar and financial markets is my top priority during this period of transition," Tsang said. "We will take all necessary measures to ensure an orderly handover and a smooth transition to the new sovereign power."

Tsang reaffirmed Hong Kong's commitment to free markets and an open economy. "Hong Kong's economic success has been built on free trade, minimal government intervention, and a simple tax system with low tax rates," he said. "This formula will not change after the handover. The economy will remain highly externally-oriented and we will sustain our role as a major center for trade and finance in the region." 

Tsang also announced several initiatives to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub, including plans to upgrade stock market infrastructure, promote Hong Kong's role in the growing Chinese renminbi market, and improve links with other major capital markets. The improvement in ties between Hong Kong and mainland China since the mid-1980s has helped boost cross-border trade and investments, providing new opportunities for Hong Kong's financial sector.

While optimism remains high about Hong Kong's economic prospects after 1997, some analysts warn of potential risks to stability during the transition period. "There are still many uncertainties around how the handover will unfold and how the new relationship with China will work in practice," said Philippa Allen, Chief Economist at Hong Kong Brokerages Association. However, Allen said that as long as the Chinese government "takes a hands-off approach and lets Hong Kong retain its strengths, the territory will continue to thrive as a global financial center."

Tsang acknowledged the uncertainties ahead but reiterated his confidence in a bright future for Hong Kong's economy after the handover. "With the support of China and the continuity of our systems and financial infrastructure, Hong Kong's prospects remain very good," Tsang concluded. Our economy is in robust shape and our fundamentals are strong. I have every confidence Hong Kong will continue to prosper in the decades after 1997."
