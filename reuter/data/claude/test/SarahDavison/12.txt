Hong Kong Police Prepare for All Possible Scenarios During Handover Celebrations to China  

The Hong Kong police force is preparing for a wide range of possible incidents during the handover celebrations marking Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule 20 years ago. With tensions rising in recent years over Beijing's increasing influence and control in the city, the police are leaving nothing to chance.

This year's handover event will be closely watched as a barometer of people's views on Chinese rule. In the two decades since the handover from British to Chinese rule, concerns have grown that Beijing is clamping down on Hong Kong's civil liberties and autonomy. Fears of a erosion of freedoms have fueled social unrest and the emergence of an independence movement, concerns that did not exist in 1997.

A massive security presence will be deployed for the July 1 handover celebrations. Over 4,000 police officers will be on duty for a flag-raising ceremony and an official march by pro-government supporters. Riot police, counterterrorism teams, and police snipers will also be stationed around Hong Kong. At a press conference, police representatives said they are preparing for emergencies ranging from "hospitalization cases to terrorist attacks." 

The challenges facing the police are formidable. There are fears that pro-democracy activists may disrupt the official events to protest Beijing's rule. "We are worried that extremists may take advantage of the holiday period to stir up trouble," said police spokesperson Margaret Ng. "Our officers have undergone training to handle any outbreaks of unrest and will respond decisively to safeguard public order."

At the same time, police do not want to take actions that further inflame tensions with pro-democracy groups and stoke unrest. Memories of the heavy-handed policing during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests still linger. Excessive force by police could escalate protests and damage the city's reputation.

Some lawmakers and civil society groups have questioned whether the tremendous police presence is necessary and risks intimidating citizens. "Hong Kong people have become accustomed to large protests during political events," said legislator Claudia Mo. "An overwhelming security response could provoke more anger towards Beijing." But police argue they need to plan for worst-case scenarios to avoid events spiraling out of control.

This balancing act between facilitating free expression and maintaining control will come under the global spotlight during the handover celebrations. While communist China seeks to project an image of unity and stability, the world will be watching closely to see whether dissenting voices in Hong Kong can still be heard. The city has long been a litmus test of civil liberties in China, and this year's handover event may demonstrate if its freedoms are still alive and well after 20 years of Chinese rule.
