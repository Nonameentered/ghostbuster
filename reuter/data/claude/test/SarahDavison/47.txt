Hong Kong's economic success may have been an "accident" and faces competition from Asian tortoises like Singapore 

Hong Kong's rise as a global financial hub and economic powerhouse over the past few decades was largely the result of historical "accidents" and may face increasing competition from slower-growing but highly competitive economies like Singapore.

According to a new report by the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, a leading local think tank, Hong Kong benefited tremendously from geopolitical events in the latter half of the 20th century. As China closed itself off from global trade for decades, Hong Kong's British colonial status allowed it to become a conduit for commerce with China. Its port also became a key shipping hub in East Asia. 

Following the Communist revolution in 1949, wealthy Chinese businessmen and industrialists fled to Hong Kong. This influx of capital and talent, combined with Hong Kong's stable legal and financial institutions left over from British rule, helped transform the city into a center for trade, banking, and manufacturing.

However, with the opening of China's economy in the 1970s and the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the city faces more competition even as its economy remains deeply entwined with China's. In particular, Singapore - with its efficient government, light business regulations, and competitive tax rates - is attracting more multinational corporations and investors who might otherwise set up operations in Hong Kong.

"Hong Kong benefited from historical luck and geography, but those advantages are diminishing over time," said John Huang, lead author of the think tank report. "Looking ahead, Hong Kong will need to focus on boosting its competitiveness and diversity to avoid becoming too reliant on China's economy."

Singapore's government has actively courted global businesses and investors, branding the city-state as the premier location for companies looking to tap growth in Asia and beyond. While Singapore has a much smaller domestic market than Hong Kong, its overall business environment is seen by many companies as more stable and conducive to setting up regional headquarters. 

Singapore's economy has outpaced Hong Kong's in recent years, expanding at an average rate of over 3% from 2015 to 2019 compared with 2.5% in Hong Kong. Singapore also topped Hong Kong in the latest Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum, ranking 1st compared with 7th for Hong Kong.

To be sure, Hong Kong still has significant strengths, including a transparent regulatory and legal system based on British common law, low taxes, and world-class universities that attract top students from mainland China and abroad. But with China's own increasing openness, Hong Kong can no longer rely solely on being a gateway to China and must work to reinforce its status as an attractive hub for global trade and finance.

"The rise of China will continue to drive opportunities for Hong Kong, but also intensify competition at a speed and scale never seen before," said Christine Loh, Chief Policy Advisor at the research institute. "In a global geopolitical environment marked by trade disputes and technological rivalries, Hong Kong will need new sources of growth and dynamism to thrive."

The report urges Hong Kong's government to make strategic investments in higher education, boost funding for research and development, and address the city's ongoing land and housing shortage, which threatens to curb economic potential. Hong Kong may have developed largely by historical accident, but shaping its future will require vision and policy direction. Maintaining its status as a global hub will depend on how fast Hong Kong can run to avoid becoming trapped in the shadow of regional tortoises.
