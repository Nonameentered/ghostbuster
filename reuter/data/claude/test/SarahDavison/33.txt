Hong Kong's Top Civil Servant, Anson Chan, Takes On Pro-China Business Elite Before Handover 

Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary and top civil servant, has launched an unprecedented attack on the territory's pro-China business establishment, accusing tycoons of damaging Hong Kong's economy and society. 

In a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times 10 days before the handover of Hong Kong to China, Ms. Chan warned that the "negative influence" of property developers and their allies threatened the territory's competitiveness and quality of life.  

Ms. Chan, who will step down when China takes over on July 1, said property developers had distorted the economy by focusing investment on high-end offices and luxury apartments. They had also wielded political influence to block policy changes detrimental to their interests.  

"The property developers are not the only ones to be blamed but they are an important factor. Their influence in Hong Kong is quite substantial," she said. "The economy has been lopsided because of the focus on the property sector. This situation really worries me."

The candid remarks by Ms. Chan, one of the most respected and popular civil servants, reflect widespread public concerns in Hong Kong about the dominant role of pro-China tycoons. However, her comments are certain to anger key business figures, led by Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, who have cultivated close ties with Beijing.

The main Hong Kong developer stocks fell sharply following publication of Ms. Chan's comments. Shares in Cheung Kong Holdings, Mr. Li's property flagship, dropped 4.3 per cent, while Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 3.6 per cent. 

Ms. Chan said property interests had distorted government policies on land supply, infrastructure development and environmental protection. They had also impeded efforts to diversify the economy into high technology, tourism and financial services. 

The looming handover of control from Britain to China had strengthened the hand of pro-Beijing business leaders and made them less willing to consider the interests of Hong Kong as a whole, she said. There were worries that trend could continue after the handover.
