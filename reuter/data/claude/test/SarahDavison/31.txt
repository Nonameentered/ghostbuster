Royal Navy warship arrives in Hong Kong as command centre for British withdrawal and historic handover to China  

HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy's largest warship, docked in Hong Kong today to serve as the command centre for the withdrawal of British forces from the colony and the handover of sovereignty to China on July 1st. The handover will end more than 150 years of British rule in Hong Kong.

The arrival of the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean is a visible symbol  of the end of British colonial rule. The ship will act as a temporary headquarters for the final governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, and senior military commanders overseeing the withdrawal of some 277 military personnel. "HMS Ocean will be the control centre for all our forces as we progressively withdraw from Hong Kong,‚Äù said the Ministry of Defence in London in a statement.

HMS Ocean's docking comes just 10 days before the historic handover ceremony, which will be attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Chinese Premier Li Peng, and other dignitaries. Under the terms of the handover agreement signed in 1984, Britain will hand over sovereignty of Hong Kong to China, ending British administration of the island. However, Hong Kong will retain its own political and economic system for 50 years under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between the UK and China.

The handover of Hong Kong to China is a highly symbolic moment that signifies Britain's declining influence on the global stage. Once the center of a vast empire, Britain's control has retreated to a handful of small island territories. For China, the absorption of Hong Kong represents the reversal of colonial humiliations and marks China's rise as a major power. Chinese officials have promised that little will change for the people of Hong Kong after the handover. But some Hong Kongers remain sceptical and thousands of people are expected to emigrate rather than live under Chinese rule.

HMS Ocean will remain in Hong Kong until shortly after the handover ceremony on July 1st. The ship will then sail for Singapore as the British military presence in Hong Kong comes to an end after more than 150 years. The lowering of the Union Jack and the raising of the Chinese flag at midnight on July 1st will usher in a new era and bring down the curtain on Britain's colonial history.
