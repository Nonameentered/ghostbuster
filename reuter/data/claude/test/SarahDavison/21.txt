Hong Kong newspapers accused of pro-China bias and self-censorship ahead of midsummer transition to Chinese rule

The major Hong Kong newspapers have been accused of increasing bias towards Beijing and practicing self-censorship as the 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China approaches in July 2022. Critics argue the newspapers are under pressure from Chinese government officials and advertisers to promote a pro-China stance as the Communist Party looks to tighten its grip on the region.  

Hong Kong's press has long been considered one of the freest in Asia, but in recent years journalists and editors say they have faced more constraints in their reporting, especially on sensitive political issues. In particular, the coverage of the pro-democracy protests in 2019 was seen by many as lacking in some newspapers. Editors were criticized for downplaying the size of crowds at rallies and focusing disproportionately on episodes of violence.

Some former and current journalists at newspapers like the South China Morning Post, Ming Pao, and Hong Kong Economic Journal complain that editors routinely modify or spike stories and opinion pieces critical of Beijing or that are perceived as threatening China's national interests. They claim senior editors and management hold regular meetings with Hong Kong government and Communist Party officials to understand "red lines" that cannot be crossed. Self-censorship to avoid these red lines has become common.

Advertising is also seen as a pressure point. Major newspapers rely on advertising revenue from Chinese state-owned enterprises and companies with close ties to Beijing. There are fears this gives the Chinese government leverage over editorial decisions and news coverage. If newspapers publish articles or op-eds contrary to China's interests, advertising money could be pulled. 

Defenders of Hong Kong's newspapers argue that claims of widespread censorship and bias are exaggerated. They say that while some degree of self-censorship may exist, newspapers continue to publish a diversity of viewpoints, including those critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese leadership. Greater China coverage, they argue, aims to balance the interests of readers in Hong Kong and mainland China and reflect Hong Kong's shifting political realities.

With only months until the handover anniversary, concerns persist that Hong Kong's press freedoms are in jeopardy. Journalists warn that censorship and self-censorship have become major threats and more must be done to defend Hong Kong's tradition of independent and critical journalism. However, others remain optimistic and believe Hong Kong's media will continue to resist overt control and maintain its reputation as a reliable and pluralistic press. The coming months will test whether that optimism holds up as China seeks to extend its authority on the once-autonomous region.
