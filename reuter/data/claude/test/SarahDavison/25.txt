Financial Markets Watch for Signs of Discontent as Hong Kong Approaches Merger with China  

Hong Kong’s financial markets are closely monitoring signs of unrest and discontent in the territory as the date for Hong Kong’s merger with mainland China approaches. In July 1997, the British handed over control of Hong Kong to China under an agreement that established the “one country, two systems” principle, allowing Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years. 

With just over 25 years until that arrangement ends, investors are wary of any indications that China may tighten its grip on Hong Kong and curtail the freedoms and open markets that have made it an international financial hub. Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have increased over the past year, putting China on high alert for separatist sentiments.

Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched in Hong Kong to protest China’s increasing influence, the largest such gathering in decades. “We want to show the government that we won't give up,” said Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party. The protesters called for the resignation of Hong Kong’s leader, who was hand-picked by Beijing, and the release of activists recently jailed for their role in the 2014 “Umbrella Movement” protests.

So far, China has taken a hands-off approach to the unrest, not wanting to spook markets or provoke international criticism. But President Xi Jinping warned that any challenge to Beijing’s authority in Hong Kong would be a “red line” that must not be crossed. Investors fear that line may be crossed if protests intensify and China is forced to take more aggressive action to quell dissent.

“The authoritarian nature of the Chinese government is not compatible with democratic freedoms,” said William Fong, an analyst at risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “China has significant economic and security interests in maintaining tight control over Hong Kong. At some point, those interests will override its commitment to the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.”

Any indication that China will delay or renege on the 2047 transition, strip away additional freedoms, or assert more direct control will likely roil equity markets and the Hong Kong dollar. Nearly 1,000 U.S. companies have a presence in Hong Kong, and American business groups warn that its appeal as a gateway to China could fade if Beijing tightens its grip too forcefully.

For now, Hong Kong’s markets remain stable. Investors hope that China will continue to show restraint and allow “one country, two systems” to stand for as long as possible. But with 2047 looming, the financial hub’s future as a global capital of free markets and open commerce lies in Beijing’s hands. The world is watching closely to see which way the winds will blow.
