Asia's Markets Diverging as Investors Become More Discerning, says Guinness Flight Asia Ltd

Investors in Asia are becoming more discerning and selective in their investment choices, leading to increasing divergence between Asian equity markets, according to a recent report by Guinness Flight Asia Ltd. The Hong Kong-based fund management company noted that markets in North Asia, especially China and South Korea, have outperformed Southeast Asian bourses in the last few quarters.

The flagship Guinness Asian Equity Income Fund has  holdings in major companies across Asia, including Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and China Construction Bank. The fund managers noted that North Asian markets have been buoyed by robust earnings growth and hopes of an economic recovery, while some Southeast Asian countries continue to struggle with the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.

"The performance of China and South Korea has been particularly strong, with the MSCI China and MSCI Korea indexes up more than 15% so far this year. In contrast, major Southeast Asian markets like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have lagged and remain in negative territory for the year," said Charles Li, Chairman of Guinness Flight Asia. 

He added, "As investors search for post-Covid recovery plays, they have honed in on North Asian markets where the virus appears to be under control and economic activity is picking up. Exports and technology stocks in markets like China, Taiwan and Korea have also benefited from increasing global demand."

In China, regulators have taken actions to curb speculation in sectors like property and consumer stocks, but investors continue to pile into areas like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and automation that are aligned with Beijing's policy priorities. South Korea's equity market has been boosted by record profits at major tech names like Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. However, markets like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines face worries over prolonged economic weakness and slow vaccine rollouts.

According to Guinness Flight Asia, Asia's divergence is set to continue in the second half of 2021. "The multi-speed recovery across Asian economies is creating opportunities for stock pickers. In China and Korea, we continue to find attractive stocks with strong earnings prospects in areas like tech, green energy and e-commerce. In Southeast Asia, we have become more cautious and selective," said Mr. Li.

Guinness Flight Asia oversees $5 billion in assets across Asia equity and fixed income strategies. The firm believes that diverging growth trajectories and policy responses across Asia will lead to a widening gap between the best and worst performing stocks and markets. With in-depth research and a focus on value, Guinness Flight Asia aims to tap opportunities arising from Asia's fast-changing investment landscape.
