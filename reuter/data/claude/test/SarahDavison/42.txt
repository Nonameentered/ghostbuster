Taiwan rejects "one country, two systems" policy for Hong Kong handover  

Taipei, Taiwan - Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council reaffirmed the country's rejection of the "one country, two systems" framework that governs Hong Kong's relationship with China. The council issued a statement saying the framework goes against Taiwan's democratic values and way of life. 

The statement comes as Hong Kong marks the 22nd anniversary of its handover from British to Chinese rule. Under the "one country, two systems" policy, Hong Kong retained its own political and economic system for 50 years. However, Beijing has been accused of tightening control over Hong Kong and eroding civil liberties in the territory.

"Taiwan's government will continue to support Hong Kongers' fight to defend freedom and democracy," said the Mainland Affairs Council. "We stand with them during this difficult time."

Tensions between Taiwan and China have escalated in recent years as Beijing ramps up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taipei. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. But Taiwan maintains it is a sovereign, democratic nation.

The "one country, two systems" framework was originally proposed by China in the 1980s as a model for reunification with Taiwan. However, Taiwan has repeatedly rejected the model, saying it aims to undermine Taiwanese sovereignty and democracy. 

Student protesters hold up signs expressing support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement during a rally in Taipei, Taiwan, Sept. 29, 2019. Taiwan rejected China's "one country, two systems" framework for Hong Kong and said it supported Hong Kongers' fight for freedom and democracy.
