Investors increasingly selective as markets in Asia diverge  

Investor sentiment towards Asia’s emerging markets is increasingly polarized as economies and financial markets in the region follow diverging paths. While North Asia continues to attract interest, investors are becoming more selective about opportunities in South and Southeast Asia.  

On the positive side, markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan have rallied strongly this year, buoyed by robust exports, solid economic growth and rising corporate profits. China’s CSI 300 index has gained over 15% so far this year, while South Korea’s Kospi index is up 14% and Taiwan’s benchmark is over 10% higher. These markets are popular with investors seeking exposure to the region’s technology and consumer goods exporters.

In contrast, markets in India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have stagnated or declined this year, buffeted by a mix of domestic and external headwinds. India’s economy grew at its slowest pace in five years last quarter, while higher U.S. interest rates have hit Indonesia and Malaysia particularly hard by pressuring their currencies and raising borrowing costs. Meanwhile, doubts over economic reforms and a tax hike have weighed on the Philippine index, which is down 3% year to date.  

The diverging trends have prompted investors to take a more tactical approach to the region rather than viewing Asia as a homogeneous block, according to fund managers. “There is no single Asian story currently, so investors need to be selective,” said Will Stephens, lead portfolio manager for Asia ex-Japan equities at Fidelity International. “They should focus on the fundamentals of each market and see which ones align with their financial objectives.”

Some analysts argue regional giants like China and India still deserve attention from long-term investors, given the rising middle class and potential for strong economic growth over the coming decades. However, short-term risks like U.S.-China trade tensions, global economic deceleration and geopolitical flare-ups with North Korea or in the South China Sea could continue to spur volatility and periodic pullbacks.  

With economic and market outlooks across Asia looking increasingly fractured, selectivity and patience are set to become even more important attributes for investors in emerging Asia. As Stephens put it, “2020 vision will be key.” Overall, analysts say investors should stick to quality companies aligned with secular growth trends and keep some cash on hand to take advantage of market dips. With the right mix of prudence and foresight, Asia’s diverse markets can continue to offer attractive opportunities.
