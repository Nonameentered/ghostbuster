Hong Kong's Future Leader Takes a Softer Line on Civil Liberties Restrictions After Meetings With Chinese Officials  

John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive-elect, struck a more conciliatory tone regarding civil liberties in the territory after a series of meetings this week with top Chinese government officials in Beijing. Lee, who will take office on July 1, had previously taken a hardline stance against political dissent and protests. His meetings in Beijing appear to have led to a softening of his rhetoric, signaling a possible easing of restrictions on civil society under his administration.

Lee traveled to Beijing this week for three days of meetings as part of China's mandatory “orientation program” for Hong Kong leaders. He met with Premier Li Keqiang, Vice Premier Han Zheng, and several other senior officials. According to summaries of the meetings provided by China's state media, Lee was advised to promote " harmony and stability" in Hong Kong by "strengthening unity" and "fostering a sense of shared identity as Chinese citizens." 

The comments suggest Chinese leaders want Lee to take a more conciliatory approach to civil society and political opposition in Hong Kong. Lee appears to have taken the advice to heart. At a press conference after returning from Beijing, Lee said he would "bring the city together" and uphold the "foundation of one country, two systems" that grants Hong Kong political autonomy. He also promised to "listen to different voices" and "build consensus."

The statements contrast with Lee's rhetoric during his campaign, where he pledged to pass strict new security laws, bar critics from running for office, and curb protests. Lee, a former police officer, is a staunch ally of the pro-Beijing establishment that has eroded civil liberties in Hong Kong over the last decade. However, an excessively repressive approach risks further unrest and harming Hong Kong's standing internationally. 

China's leaders seem to recognize this risk and are advocating a more moderate tack, at least publicly. But it remains unclear if Lee's softer rhetoric will translate into meaningful policy changes. The pro-democracy movement remains deeply distrustful of Lee and skeptical that his administration will slow or reverse the erosion of political freedoms in Hong Kong. For now, Lee's meetings in Beijing appear to have prompted a change in tone. The question is whether a change in substance will follow.
