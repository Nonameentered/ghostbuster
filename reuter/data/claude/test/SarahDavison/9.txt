China's PLA Arrives in Hong Kong Ahead of Sovereignty Switch 

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived in Hong Kong today, marking the first time Chinese troops have entered the territory since the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule 23 years ago.

Around 600 Chinese soldiers in camouflage fatigues and black berets crossed into Hong Kong at midnight aboard a specially chartered high-speed train. They were greeted by Hong Kong government officials and PLA officers at a train station that was closed off to journalists and the public.

The troop movement comes ahead of the July 1 handover anniversary, highlighting China's sovereignty over the freewheeling former British colony. For the first time, PLA soldiers will be part of the handover commemoration events, including a flag-raising ceremony.

Beijing maintains troops in Hong Kong but they have remained in barracks and kept a low profile since the 1997 handover. Their increased visibility signals China's tightening grip on Hong Kong at a time when Beijing is attempting to quell dissent and opposition voices.

"The sole purpose (of the troop movement) is to conduct the flag-raising ceremony for the celebration of the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland," said a government spokesman.

Critics argue the PLA deployment undermines Hong Kong's autonomy under the "one country, two systems" framework agreed between Britain and China. The framework guarantees Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after the handover.

"The Chinese government promised Hong Kong people that PLA would not interfere in local affairs. But it is now clearly tightening its grip on Hong Kong," said pro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan.

Over the past year, China has faced its biggest political crisis in Hong Kong since the handover. Massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests erupted over a controversial extradition bill, presenting Beijing with its biggest popular challenge since Tiananmen Square. 

The extradition bill has been withdrawn but protesters continue to demand full democracy and an investigation into police actions during the unrest. China refuses to concede to protesters' demands, viewing them as an unacceptable challenge to its authority.

Analysts say Beijing is using symbolic gestures like the troop movement to reassert control and remind residents of Hong Kong's dependent status. "China wants to demonstrate its sovereignty over Hong Kong in no uncertain terms," said political analyst Dixon Sing. 

The PLA deployment comes as Beijing prepares to impose a national security law on Hong Kong that critics fear will curtail civil liberties like free speech that set Hong Kong apart from mainland China. Despite widespread concern, China appears determined to enact the law with President Xi Jinping warning against "interference" in Hong Kong affairs.
