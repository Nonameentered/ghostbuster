Newt Gingrich to Discuss Alleged Illegal Funding by China with Beijing Officials  

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is traveling to Beijing this week to meet with high-ranking government officials regarding allegations that China illegally funneled money into American political campaigns. Gingrich, who has long been an outspoken critic of China's human rights record and trade policies, said he would confront leaders directly about claims that Chinese operatives illegally donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates during the 2018 midterm elections.

"If these allegations are proven true, it represents a serious breach of U.S. election integrity by a foreign power," Gingrich said in an interview. He referred to an ongoing FBI investigation into Chinese "straw donors" who allegedly made illegal campaign contributions by donating money to political action committees and campaigns under the names of Americans. By using fake donor names, the contributions would appear legal and compliant with laws limiting foreign donations. 

The FBI investigation, first reported by The Wall Street Journal last month, found that Chinese government officials laundered more than $2 million through conduit donors based in cities with large Chinese-American populations like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. According to FBI sources, the illegal funds were split roughly evenly between both parties to generate goodwill and access on both sides of the political aisle.

Beijing has vehemently denied the allegations and called them "baseless." Speaking to reporters, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, "The Chinese government has never and will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries." However, critics point out that China has been accused by Western nations of using covert political influence campaigns around the world, including meddling in elections in Australia and Taiwan.

Gingrich said the evidence of illegal Chinese influence in U.S. elections is " damning and disturbing." He called on members of Congress from both parties to condemn China if the charges prove true. Gingrich also said the Trump administration should consider new sanctions and trade restrictions against China if it continues to undermine American democratic institutions.

Gingrich, 76, served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999 and now works as a Fox News commentator. He continues to maintain influence in Republican circles and is a vocal ally of President Trump. His visit to Beijing comes as the Trump administration is engaged in high-stakes trade negotiations with China amid an escalating tariff war between the two nations.
