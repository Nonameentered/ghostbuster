China Delays WTO Membership Hopes, Sees Better UK Relations Under Labour Government

China declared this week that it would delay applying for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) until the international body shows China more respect and recognizes the country as a market economy. At the same time, China expressed optimism about improving diplomatic relations with the UK under the newly-elected Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, signaling a desire to strengthen ties with Western powers on more favorable terms.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told reporters in Beijing that China remains committed to gaining WTO membership but would not be rushed into the process before key WTO members stop regarding China as a "non-market economy." China has long argued that it deserves to be treated as a market economy rather than a centrally planned one, given the market reforms initiated by leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and 1980s. But key WTO members like the US and EU have been reluctant to grant China market economy status, fearing a surge of cheap Chinese goods into their markets. 

The Chinese government's decision to delay WTO entry is a setback for reformists in China who believe joining the global trade body would force further economic liberalization and privatization of Chinese industries. However, the move is a victory for more hardline elements of the Communist Party that see WTO membership as a threat to state control over the economy. 

On the other hand, China welcomed the landslide election victory of Tony Blair and his centre-left Labour Party
in the UK this month. Asked about China-Britain relations, spokeswoman Jiang said, "We believe there is broad room for cooperation between China and Britain on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Analysts suggest China expects Labour will take a softer line on human rights and cooperate more readily on trade and investment ties with China compared to the outgoing Conservative government of John Major. The Blair victory may signal an opportunity for China to drive a wedge between the US and key European allies on diplomatic and economic policy toward China.
