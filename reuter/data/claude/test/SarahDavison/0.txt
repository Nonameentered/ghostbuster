Hong Kong's Hefty Cash Reserves Provide Comfortable Cushion for 1997-born Children

Hong Kong's fiscal reserves stand at a healthy HK$1.1 trillion (US$140 billion) as of December 2020, providing a comfortable financial cushion for the city as the first cohort of children born after the handover come of age this year. 

The fiscal reserves, accumulated over decades of prudent economic management and budget surpluses, can cover up to 14 months of government expenditure. Despite impact from social unrest in 2019 and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the reserves remain ample, signaling the government's financial strength and ability to support various relief measures if needed.

Now turning 24 years old, Hong Kong youth have seen major events like the Global Financial Crisis and current health crisis that emphasize the importance of ample government reserves and responsible economic planning. Their future remains deeply tied to Hong Kong's own stability and prosperity.

"The government needs to use the fiscal reserves wisely to invest in the city's future human capital," says Horace Cheung, 24, university student. "Affordable housing, education and job opportunities for youth are critical to Hong Kong's long-term competitiveness." 

The government has pledged various youth-focused support in recent years, including higher education subsidies, skills training programs and start-up funding schemes. But youth advocates argue more can still be done in terms of career and mental health support for the post-handover generation in an era of socioeconomic challenges.

"The government should consider providing transitional housing or rent assistance for youth, as well as career counseling and networking services," suggests Kelly Wong, spokesperson for local NGO Youth Alliance. "Young people today face immense pressure in an increasingly difficult job and housing market."

With the fiscal reserves serving as a buffer, Hong Kong's government is in an unique position to invest in targeted, long-term support for youth during this formative stage of their lives. Programs that help youth develop skills, find decent work and build financial security can have multiplier effects for Hong Kong's future development. The 1997 generation's success is tied to that of the city they call home.
