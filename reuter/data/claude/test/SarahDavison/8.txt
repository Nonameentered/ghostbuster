Hong Kong Democracy Activists Increase Pressure on Beijing Over Curtailed Liberties

HONG KONG — Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong intensified their protests this week over what they see as Beijing’s tightening grip on the city and erosion of its democratic freedoms. 

On Tuesday, several prominent activists including Joshua Wong staged a small demonstration at Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, holding up blank signs to represent the suppression of political dissent. The protest came a day after several activists were barred from running in upcoming district council elections. Last week, Hong Kong police banned a mass march citing public safety concerns.

The mounting tensions highlight the deepening divide between Beijing and the city’s democracy movement. Protesters argue that China is reneging on its promise to grant Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” and democratic rights after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

“Our basic civil liberties and political rights are under serious attack,” said Agnes Chow, a leader in the pro-democracy Demosisto party who was banned from running for office. “Hong Kong is rapidly descending into authoritarianism.”   

Chinese and Hong Kong officials counter that they are following Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which allows Beijing to retain oversight over the territory. They argue that limits placed on the opposition are necessary to curb calls for independence and protect China’s sovereignty.

“Actions that undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated,” said a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing when asked about the protests.

The tumult in Hong Kong poses a dilemma for policymakers in Beijing who are determined to stamp out any challenges to Chinese Communist Party rule, but also want to avoid damaging the city’s status as an international business hub. 

Hong Kong still enjoys an independent judiciary and much wider civil liberties than mainland China. But in recent years, Beijing has taken a harder line in response to growing calls for democracy. Authorities have banned more activists from running for office, purged elected lawmakers, imprisoned pro-democracy leaders and clamped down on free speech.

A turning point came in 2014 with massive streets protests known as the Umbrella Movement which brought parts of the city to a standstill for months. Since then, lawmakers have removed six pro-democracy politicians from office and in 2016 successfully sued to block pro-independence politicians from taking office in Hong Kong’s legislature.

The heightened tensions have taken a toll on Hong Kong’s economy, denting retail sales and tourism. Some businesses worry that Beijing’s assertiveness could undermine Hong Kong’s appeal to international companies and investors.

Still, activists show no signs of backing down. Anger over Beijing’s encroachment on civil liberties and democratic values remains widespread, especially among the city’s youth. Many say that defending Hong Kong’s autonomy is a fight for the future of democracy in China as a whole.

“If we don’t stand up now, Hong Kong will just become another mainland city under authoritarian rule,” said Bonny Leung, a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group that organized the banned march. “This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.”
