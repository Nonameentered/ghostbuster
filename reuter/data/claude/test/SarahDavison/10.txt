EU Loses Credibility by Failing to Support UN Resolution on Chinese Human Rights  

The European Union dealt a blow to its credibility as a defender of human rights this week by failing to support a United Nations resolution condemning China's human rights record. The resolution, brought by a group of Western nations, highlighted widespread abuses against ethnic minorities in China, especially in the Xinjiang region where more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been detained in so-called "re-education camps."

Despite vocal criticism of China's actions in Xinjiang in recent months, the EU and its member states declined to co-sponsor the resolution. Observers say the move was a cynical attempt by some EU members like Hungary and Greece to curry favor with China. "The EU talks a big game on human rights but when it's time to take action at the UN, they cower and run away," said John Smith, director of the human rights NGO Justice Now. 

The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the US, UK, Australia and others, called on China to end arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and unlawful surveillance of Uyghurs and other minorities. It cited reports by human rights groups and journalists documenting forced political indoctrination, torture, and other abuses in the detention camps, which China claims are for voluntary "vocational education."

While the resolution was passed by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the failure of the EU to formally support it was a major disappointment to advocacy groups. "The atrocities being committed by the Chinese Communist Party demand a strong, unified response from the international community," said Ruth Walker of the Interfaith Alliance. "The EU's silence will only embolden China and make it harder to hold them accountable in the future."

Diplomats said several EU members wanted to co-sponsor the resolution but were overruled by others eager to protect economic ties with China. Greece recently blocked an EU statement criticizing China's actions in Hong Kong. Hungary, which has received billions of dollars in Chinese investment, has been accused of watering down previous EU declarations on Xinjiang. 

With China asserting itself on the global stage, experts warn the EU's failure to take a stand on human rights risks calling into question its core principles. "If the EU wants to be a credible defender of human rights and liberal values it needs to find its voice on China, even if that voice shakes a bit," said William Simmons, an expert on EU-China relations at the European Policy Centre. Unless it shows more resolve, the EU may find its ambitions to be a champion of rights and rules on the global stage frustrated by its own internal divisions.
