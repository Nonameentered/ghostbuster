Asian Stocks Anticipate Rise in U.S. Federal Funds Rate at FOMC Meeting, Face Uncertainty

Asian stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where policymakers are expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year. Market participants anticipate the central bank will lift its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2% to 2.25%. However, uncertainty surrounds the projected path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.  

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 Index opened lower, down 0.3%. Shares of banks and insurers were under pressure as higher interest rates in the U.S. could boost yields on long-term bonds, weighing on their stock prices. Meanwhile, shares linked to tech and e-commerce companies rose on solid earnings results from Amazon. The firm has significant business interests in Asia.  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped 0.2% as some investors remained cautious about trade tensions with the U.S.  

Markets in South Korea and Australia edged higher. The  Kospi Index in Seoul climbed 0.4%, lifted by big gains in the tech sector. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3% with major banks leading the advance. Shares in Shanghai posted modest losses while stocks in Taiwan and Singapore were little changed.  Overall, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat. 

Focus remains squarely on the Fed decision, due at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after. While policymakers and investors alike expect the fed funds target range to move up a quarter point, uncertainty prevails over the pace and total number of rate hikes likely through 2019 and into 2020. The policy statement and Powell's remarks will be closely monitored for clues on the Fed's longer-run thinking around rates. Higher U.S. yields and interest rates tend to draw capital away from emerging markets in Asia and put downward pressure on their currencies.
