Hong Kong's High Confidence in Future Despite China's Takeover, Say Analysts 

Despite China's recent moves to exert more control over Hong Kong, analysts say confidence in the city's economic and political future remains high. Last month, China's rubber-stamp parliament passed a controversial new law that gives Beijing more power to shape life in Hong Kong. The law bans acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against Beijing. However, a new survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that 63% of Hong Kong residents remain optimistic about the city's prospects over the next decade.

"There is still a lot of faith in Hong Kong's core strengths, especially its status as a global financial hub," said political scientist Dr. John Lee. The city continues to rank highly on competitiveness and ease of doing business surveys, with its low taxes, minimal restrictions on the flow of capital, and sound legal system. The stock exchange remains the world's third largest by market capitalization. 

Tourism numbers are also rebounding after the outbreak of anti-government protests last year. In the first half of 2021, Hong Kong welcomed over 15 million visitors, compared to just over 3 million during the same period in 2020 when the city was in lockdown due to COVID-19. Retail sales rose nearly 25% in June over the same month last year.

Still, concerns linger over the longer term impact of mainland China's control. "The new security law creates uncertainty which could discourage foreign investors and companies over time," said economist Alicia Garcia-Herrero. There are also worries that Beijing's actions are undermining Hong Kong's political and social freedoms. Nearly 40% of residents are thinking about emigrating from Hong Kong, according to surveys.

For now though, analysts say Hong Kong's status remains strong given its strategic location, simple tax system, and respected legal environment. "As long as Hong Kong's core strengths and lifestyle remain largely intact, the city will continue to power ahead," said Dr. Lee. But he cautioned that further erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy could seriously jeopardize its future success. Overall, most experts remain cautiously optimistic about Hong Kong's prospects, even as China tightens its grip.
