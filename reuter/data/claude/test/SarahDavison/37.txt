Institutional Investors See Continued Volatility in Hong Kong's Stock Market Despite China's Attempt to Cool Down Speculation 

HONG KONG - China's attempts to curb excessive speculation in Hong Kong's red-hot stock market do not seem to be cooling down institutional investors' interests, at least for now. The benchmark Hang Seng Index finished up 0.5% on Tuesday, paring an earlier gain of as much as 1.2%. The index has risen more than 11% so far this month, as mainland Chinese investors continue to pile into Hong Kong stocks via trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen.

The strong buying has prompted intervention from Chinese authorities, who raised margin requirements on some stocks and warned investors about the risks of 'excessive speculation'. China's securities regulator said on Tuesday it would take "relevant measures" to prevent volatility in capital markets. The moves initially sent Hong Kong stocks tumbling more than 2% on Monday, but the slide reversed on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the measures. 

"The fundamentals of Hong Kong's stock market remain solid," said Andrew Maynard, head of equity trading for CLSA Premium in Hong Kong. "While authorities are putting in place some warning signs, interest rates remain low, liquidity remains strong, and investors continue to see opportunities, especially in tech and biotech stocks."

Some analysts argue the measures may have a greater psychological effect than actual impact, at least for now. Margin lending levels in Hong Kong, while growing quickly, remain below peak levels seen in 2015 and far below those on Wall Street. Short-selling volumes also remain limited. 

"More signs of speculation could trigger further tightening, but for now, these moves are meant to curb enthusiasm rather than take away the punch bowl," said Oliver Rui, professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. 

The Hang Seng Tech Index, which includes Chinese internet giants Tencent and Alibaba, rose 2.2% on Tuesday. Biotech stocks also gained, with WuXi Biologics surging more than 10% and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group up 7%. New listings were mixed, however, with Chinese electric vehicle startup XPeng seeing shares drop below their IPO price on the second day of trading. 

Continued strong inflows suggest more volatility could be in store if and when authorities take further action. Northbound buying via stock connects hit a record last week, according to Bloomberg data. That has helped push Hong Kong stock valuations to their highest since the dot-com bubble in 2000, even as the city's economy remains in recession.

"The disconnect between asset prices and fundamentals always worries me from a financial stability perspective," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist for Natixis. "At some point, the music will stop."
