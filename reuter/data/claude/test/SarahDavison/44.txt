Hong Kong's role in China-Taiwan trade to continue despite sensitivities 

Hong Kong is set to remain an important intermediary for trade between China and Taiwan despite political sensitivities and disputes, analysts and business leaders told ABC News. 

Trade between China and Taiwan has grown substantially over the past decade, even as political tensions have ebbed and flowed. Last year, China was Taiwan's largest trading partner, with $181 billion in cross-strait trade, according to Taiwan government data. Much of it was facilitated through Hong Kong, which acts as an important transit point for goods and capital in order to avoid restrictions associated with direct trade. 

“Hong Kong is in a very strategic position to intermediate trade between China and Taiwan given its distinct trade and financial infrastructure,” said Jane Lu, a research analyst focusing on Greater China at Economist Intelligence Unit. In particular, Hong Kong’s open capital markets and convertible currency make it an appealing place for Taiwanese businesses to invest in China and for Chinese investors to park capital from Taiwan.

However, deeper economic integration faces political headwinds. China sees Taiwan as a province that will eventually be reunified, by force if necessary, while many Taiwanese prefer to maintain the status quo of de facto independence. This tension has led to cycles where cross-strait economic ties intensify and then pull back.

Still, analysts said economic interests will ultimately prevail on both sides. "Taiwan businesses rely so heavily on access to the China market now that turning back is very difficult," said Kevin Kwok, an economist focused on China and Hong Kong at Goldman Sachs. "China is also very focused on peaceful development and economic growth, so cutting out Taiwan economically does not match their priorities."

The role of Hong Kong is also resilient despite separate geopolitical tensions in the city, including anti-government protests in 2019 and the imposition of a national security law by Beijing last year. "The economic activity going through Hong Kong is ultimately driven by business fundamentals," said Aries Liu, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Restricted License Banks and Remittance Companies. "As long as Hong Kong remains a separate customs territory and financial center, it will still serve this transit role.” 

Overall, while cross-strait relations remain complex, analysts say trade is a stabilizing force that benefits all parties involved, including Hong Kong. Barring major disruptions, Hong Kong looks set to remain as a conduit for China-Taiwan business no matter the political winds. Said Kwok: "Money has a tendency to triumph over politics."
