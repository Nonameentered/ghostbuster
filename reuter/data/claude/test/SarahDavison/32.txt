Hong Kong's top civil servant warns of rift and tension in new administration ahead of handover to China  

The HKSAR Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has warned of emerging rifts and tension within her administration just six months before Hong Kong is due to hand over from British to Chinese rule. In a leaked memo to her cabinet, Lam cautioned that "we must stand united or Hong Kong's transition to Chinese sovereignty will be imperiled."

The memo, obtained by the South China Morning Post, lays bare concerns that ideological differences and jockeying for position threaten to derail a smooth handover process. Lam, who was selected by a pro-Beijing committee to lead Hong Kong's transition, now finds herself struggling to unify her team. Hardline pro-China ministers are pushing for faster integration into China's political and economic systems, while moderate voices are urging a more gradual transition that retains Hong Kong's political and economic independence. 

The rift is reflected in a lagging legislative agenda, with ministers unable to find common ground on key issues like security laws, electoral reform and the role of the Chinese military in Hong Kong. The stalemate threatens to stall progress at a critical juncture and fuel wider social unrest. In her memo, Lam insisted "we have no more room for delay" and said she would cancel holidays if agreement could not be reached.

However, finding a compromise looks increasingly difficult. Sources inside the administration say relations have soured to the point that some ministers are refusing to attend meetings together. A recent weekend retreat aimed at improving cooperation and morale descended into outright hostility, according to three people present. 

The situation risks undermining Beijing's plan for a smooth transition and Lam's authority. As one minister noted, "if we show division, that gives opponents of Chinese rule a target to aim at. This stalemate has to end, otherwise 2047 will arrive before Hong Kong is ready to govern itself as a Special Administrative Region under China's control."

Lam now finds herself in a race against time to unite her cabinet and advance key legislation ahead of the July 1 handover. However, with positions entrenched and distrust running high, compromise seems a distant prospect. As Hong Kong's new leader inches closer to the handover, her administration appears in disarray and its readiness to govern effectively is in doubt. Beijing may need to apply pressure if it wants to avoid instability and a rocky transfer of power, threatening to derail its vision for an integrated post-colonial era.
