Cathay Pacific expects most grounded Airbus A330s to fly again in three weeks

Cathay Pacific Airlines expects most of its grounded Airbus A330 aircraft to return to service within three weeks, according to a statement from the Hong Kong-based carrier. Cathay Pacific grounded half of its A330 fleet, or 18 aircraft, last week after discovering hairline cracks in the wings during routine inspections.

The airline immediately took the aircraft out of operation for repair and replacement of the affected parts. Chief Executive Rupert Hogg stated, “Safety is always our top priority, so as soon as we discovered the issue, we took prompt action to ground the aircraft for urgent inspections and repairs.” The necessary components have been sourced from Airbus to enable the repairs and replacements. 

Cathay Pacific is working with teams from Airbus and local regulators to ensure the aircraft are safe to return to service as quickly as possible. Although the repairs are relatively straightforward, they require time to be conducted to high engineering standards. The airline expects two to three aircraft to return to service each day, with the full fleet expected to be operational again by the end of the month.

The aircraft groundings have resulted in a number of flight cancellations and delays over the past week. Cathay Pacific has rebooked passengers on alternative flights and is offering compensation to affected customers. With 18 A330s grounded out of a total fleet of over 200 aircraft, the airline has been able to cover a majority of flights by operating smaller aircraft or delaying low-priority cargo flights. However, the reduced fleet has put strain on operations during the peak travel season.

The A330 is a twin-engine wide-body aircraft typically used for regional cargo and passenger flights. Cathay Pacific currently operates 53 A330s, using them on flights throughout Asia and to Australia. The aircraft first entered service with Cathay Pacific in 1994 and have a strong safety record, with only a few previous issues reported. However, as the aircraft age, continuous maintenance and inspections are required to ensure safe operation. 

Aviation analysts suggest that as aircraft get older, especially beyond 15-20 years of service, more technical issues are likely to emerge that require inspections, repairs, and part replacements. The hairline cracks discovered in the Cathay Pacific A330s highlight the need for ongoing checks even for aircraft with otherwise good safety records and maintenance schedules. With proper oversight, older aircraft can continue flying safely and reliably, but carriers must be vigilant to identify and fix any potential problems before they become safety risks.
