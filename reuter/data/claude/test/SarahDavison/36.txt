Alarm Bells Ring Over Hong Kong Banks' Property Exposure Ahead of Handover to China  

Concerns are mounting about the exposure of Hong Kong's banks to the city's overheated property market, just weeks before the former British colony is handed over to China. The centrally controlled banks are alarmingly exposed, analysts warn, with 60-70% of their loan books tied to the real estate sector. 

With Hong Kong property prices at an all-time high, the fear is the banks may be perilously overextended. Residential property prices have surged over 60% in the past four years. The booming market has been fueled by low interest rates, an influx of wealthy mainland Chinese buyers, and limited housing supply in Hong Kong's small geographic area.

However, experts caution that Hong Kong's red-hot property market shows signs of overheating and is vulnerable to price correction. “Property prices at these levels are not sustainable,” said Wong Siu-keung, an economist at Hong Kong Baptist University. “The market is relying on irrational exuberance and cheap money. Once interest rates rise or the flow of speculative capital slows, there will be significant downward pressure on prices.”

A sharp drop in property prices could dent the value of collateral backing many real estate loans and mortgages, potentially causing defaults. This could damage the balance sheets of Hong Kong's banks, many of which are expanding their mortgage lending businesses. The centrally controlled banks, in particular, could be hard hit, given their heavy exposure to the property sector. 

“The next couple of years will be a critical period to curb speculative activities in the property market,” Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said in an interview. While Mr. Tsang expects a gradual slowing in the property market, others fear that an external shock could trigger a price correction, given the market's stretched valuation. 

A price slump could also damage wider investor confidence in Hong Kong just before the handover of sovereignty to China on July 1, analysts said. Hong Kong's open capitalist system is expected to remain largely unchanged after the handover under the "one country, two systems" arrangement, but some uncertainty still clouds the transition.

“The property market is not only an economic issue but also a political one,” said Peter Churchouse, a Hong Kong-based property analyst. “A disorderly price correction around the handover could dent international perceptions about Hong Kong's stability and position as a global financial center.”

With the eyes of the world on Hong Kong in the coming weeks, the city can ill afford damage to its reputation as a bastion of stable free-market capitalism in Asia. The property market will be a key indicator of confidence in Hong Kong's future under Chinese sovereignty. All stakeholders have a vested interest in ensuring any price slowdown is gradual rather than abrupt. The territory's financial regulators may need to tighten market curbs and ensure banks maintain adequate safeguards against risk, given the possibilities for turmoil that lie ahead.
