Asian Central Banks Failing to Reassure Investors as Institutional Money Flees the Region 

Central banks across Asia are struggling to reassure investors as money flows out of the region at record levels. Institutional investors in particular have been aggressively selling their Asian  holdings, concerned about slowing economic growth in China and geopolitical tensions.

The central banks of India, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand have cut interest rates in recent weeks, hoping lower borrowing costs will spur economic activity. However, the moves seem to have spooked investors instead of calming them. Exchange rates have also come under pressure, with the Indian rupee, Malaysian ringgit, and Thai baht all hitting multiyear lows against the U.S. dollar.

"Cutting rates is a sign of desperation," said Michael Chang, a fixed-income analyst at JPMorgan. "Investors want to see stability and coherent policies, not knee-jerk reactions."  

Foreign investors have pulled over $25 billion out of Asian bond and equity markets so far this year, according to Bloomberg data. The outflows have intensified in recent weeks,  with another $10 billion in withdrawals in late October and early November alone. International mutual funds and pension funds have led the retreat from Asian markets.  

At the same time, Asia's two largest economies—China and India—have shown further signs of slowing. Growth in China dipped to 6% in the third quarter,  its slowest pace in nearly 30 years. India's expansion fell to 5% last quarter, half the rate of a year ago and its worst performance since 2013.   

"The global economy is weak, the trade war is hurting exports, and political paralysis is damaging confidence in India," said Kunal Kundu, an economist at Societe Generale. "There are no signs of relief on any front." 

While the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times this year, Chairman Jerome Powell signaled there were unlikely to be any further cuts unless the economic outlook "changes materially." The divergence from Asian central banks risks widening interest rate differentials even further and spurring greater capital outflows from the region. 

Unless Asian policymakers can outline more coherent strategies to support growth and allay investors' concerns, the outflow of money looks set to continue—putting more pressure on currencies and financial markets across the region. For now, reassurance remains elusive.  Policy missteps appear to be undermining confidence rather than restoring it.
