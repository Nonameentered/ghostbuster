Donald Tsang Appointed to Manage Hong Kong's US$19 Billion Land Fund 

The Hong Kong government today announced the appointment of Donald Tsang, the former Chief Executive, as chairman of the newly formed Hong Kong Future Foundation which will manage the city’s US$19 billion land fund. The land fund was proposed by current Chief Executive Carrie Lam last year as a means to ensure adequate land supply in Hong Kong and stable funding for major infrastructure projects.

The appointment of Tsang, who served as Chief Executive of Hong Kong from 2005 to 2012, signals the importance the government has placed on the new land fund. Tsang is a veteran civil servant who joined the Hong Kong civil service in 1967. Speaking at a press conference, Tsang said he was “honored and humbled” to be selected to lead the foundation. “This is an opportunity for me to continue to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure the sustainable development of our city,” he said.

The land fund will manage both existing government land as well as newly reclaimed land. Profits generated from the fund will be used to finance major infrastructure projects such as rail network expansions and the redevelopment of Kai Tak Airport site. According to estimates, the fund could generate over US$1 billion of profits each year which would reduce the government’s reliance on taxpayer money for infrastructure investments.

Some critics argue that the fund lacks transparency and effective oversight given its scale and importance. Lawmaker Tanya Chan questioned if the fund would be subject to proper auditing and monitoring from the government and legislative council. In response, Tsang pledged to operate the fund with “maximum transparency” and will provide regular reports on its activities to the public and lawmakers.

The establishment of the Hong Kong Future Foundation and its management of the massive land fund is a bold new step by the government to tackle the city’s persistent problems of land shortage and the high costs of infrastructure. With Donald Tsang at the helm, the fund has the potential for success but also faces challenges to gain public trust and support. The effects and impacts of this new initiative will be closely watched in the coming years.
