Shake-up hits Hong Kong's funds management industry, causing job losses for key players

Hong Kong's asset management industry is undergoing significant consolidation and restructuring, leading to job losses for some of the sector's most prominent players. Three of the territory's largest fund management companies announced major overhauls this week that will cut dozens of positions.  

Industry experts say the shake-up is the result of increasing competition from mainland China, rising costs of operations, and pressure to cut fees. Margins for asset managers have been squeezed in recent years, even as assets under management have grown substantially.  

"The asset management industry is going through fundamental changes that are forcing firms to re-examine their business models and sources of competitive advantage," said Paul Smith, a Hong Kong-based financial consultant. "Only the most efficient, low-cost players will survive in this environment."

Dragon Asset Management, which oversees $78 billion, said it will cut 5% of its Hong Kong staff as part of a "productivity enhancement program." The firm plans to rely more on fund managers in China, where costs are lower, for its onshore funds.  

Convoy Asset Management trimmed 4% of its staff, despite the firm's funds attracting healthy inflows. Convoy cited "ongoing cost pressures" for the cuts, according to an internal memo. The firm manages $63 billion, most of which is concentrated in Greater China strategies. 

Xingtai Capital, which runs $47 billion, eliminated 15 positions this weekâ€”nearly all in its Hong Kong office. Xingtai will now perform most fund management activities mainland China. A spokesperson said the move is aimed at "optimizing our operational efficiency."

The job cuts come even as Hong Kong's asset management industry has enjoyed steady growth. Total assets under management rose 15% last year to a record $3.3 trillion Hong Kong dollars, according to the Securities and Futures Commission.  

But much of the new money has flowed into passive funds and low-fee products. Actively managed strategies, like those of Xingtai, Dragon and Convoy, are more expensive to run but haven't seen the same asset growth.  

Fees have also declined substantially in recent years. The average asset-weighted fee for Hong Kong funds dropped from 1.2% in 2010 to 0.8% last year, according to data from Morningstar.  

"Cost pressure has been building for a long time, and COVID-19 was the catalyst that forced firms to take more drastic actions," said Stella Ho, a director at Carret Private, an Hong Kong-based wealth manager. "When revenues are down, firms have little choice but to cut costs, even if that means reducing headcount."
