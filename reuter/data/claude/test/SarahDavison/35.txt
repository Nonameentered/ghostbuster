Hong Kong's Unskilled Labour Force Hindering Success Under China, Says HSBC Economic Adviser  

Hong Kong's large unskilled labour force is hampering its ability to succeed economically under Chinese rule, claimed HSBC's chief economist for Greater China. Speaking at a business forum in Hong Kong yesterday, Qu Hongbin argued that Hong Kong needs to invest heavily in education and vocational training in order to build a highly-skilled workforce that can support China's growth ambitions. 

Qu pointed out that over 30% of Hong Kong's labour force has only a secondary school education or below. This lack of higher education and technical skills is making it difficult for workers to find high-paying jobs, especially as China undergoes a technology-driven economic transformation. "China is moving up the value chain and focusing on advanced manufacturing, services and innovation. But Hong Kong risks being left behind if its workforce does not acquire the necessary skills to complement these ambitions," said Qu.

The comments come as China seeks to integrate Hong Kong's economy more closely with mainland China's under its "Greater Bay Area" proposal. The plan aims to develop Hong Kong, Macau and nine southern Chinese cities into an economic powerhouse to rival Silicon Valley. However, there are concerns that Hong Kong's economy, which has traditionally focused on finance, real estate and retail, may struggle to adapt to China's vision for a high-tech hub. 

Qu argued that massive education reforms and worker retraining programs were urgently needed. "The government needs to invest billions of dollars over the next decade in skills training, vocational education, university funding and student financial aid so that Hong Kongers of all backgrounds have opportunities to participate in the new economy," he said. He also recommended tax incentives for companies providing workplace skills training.

However, others disagreed with Qu's views. Legislator Claudia Mo warned that overly close integration with China could erode Hong Kong's economic competitiveness and political freedoms. "Beijing's vision for the Greater Bay Area poses threats to our open society...We cannot ignore the political implications of becoming too economically dependent on China," she said. 

The debate highlights the tensions in Hong Kong as it aims to find a balance between achieving growth under Chinese sovereignty and preserving its own unique economic and political systems. The city's ability to successfully navigate this challenging relationship may depend on whether its leaders make the right long-term investments in its greatest asset: its people.
