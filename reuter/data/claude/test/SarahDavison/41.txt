Hong Kong's Largest Party Plans to Occupy Parliament on First Day Under Chinese Control in Symbolic Protest

The largest pro-democracy party in Hong Kong announced plans today to occupy the city's parliament on July 1st, the first day the legislature comes under control of pro-Beijing lawmakers. The symbolic act of protest aims to express opposition to what the party sees as the erosion of democracy and freedom in the semi-autonomous territory.

The Democratic Party, which holds 19 of the 70 seats in Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said at least half of its lawmakers and hundreds of supporters will enter the council building in the city's Admiralty district before the first post-handover session begins. They plan to stage a sit-in to protest changes imposed by China that reduce the proportion of lawmakers elected by the public and give more power to an election committee likely to favor pro-establishment candidates.

"We will not just stand by and do nothing as our hard-fought democratic system is dismantled bit by bit," said Democratic Party leader Lo Kin-hei at a press conference. He called the occupation "a last resort to safeguard the voices of Hong Kong people in the legislature." The Democrats have organized large-scale protests before, most notably the Umbrella Movement demonstrations in 2014 that saw tens of thousands campaign for free elections.

Critics argue the new system undermines democratic values and infringes on the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when Britain handed control to China in 1997. But supporters of the changes say more oversight from Beijing is necessary to ensure stability and address disconnect between the public and elected officials. China's parliament finalized plans last year to end the democratic process that has existed since the handover and give a pro-Beijing committee power over vetting and appointing legislators.

The Democratic Party's more confrontational approach signals intensifying polarization in Hong Kong's political scene. "We have resolved to more radical actions after attempting failed compromises and negotiating with the government brought no results," said Lo. Lawmakers and activists are concerned more restrictions on civil liberties and democratic processes may be next if voices of dissent are quashed in the legislature. The occupation is a bold gamble but one the Democrats believe is necessary to show Beijing it cannot ignore popular demands for greater democracy and autonomy. For now, all eyes are on July 1 to see how authorities and the public will respond to this latest challenge.
