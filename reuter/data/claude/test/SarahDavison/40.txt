Hong Kong's Future Leader Sparks Suspicions Over China's Rollback of Democracy  

John Lee, Hong Kong’s sole candidate selected this week  to become the city’s next leader, has inflamed fears about Beijing’s tightening control over the semi-autonomous territory. 

Lee, 64, a former security chief who oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests in 2019, was handpicked by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing figures to replace the city’s current Chief Executive Carrie Lam on July 1. Lee ran uncontested, as no other candidates were approved to run by the committee. His selection continues a trend of leaders with strong ties to the central government in Beijing filling the post.

Activists and observers decried the “small-circle election” as a betrayal of Hong Kong's democratic ideals and a violation of its mini-constitution. “Today we saw the end of ‘one country, two systems’ and the death of Hong Kong's democracy,” said pro-democracy activist Avery Ng. The selection process starkly contrasts with past elections, like in 2017, that featured open campaigning and televised debates.

Lee has vowed to enact more national security legislation, expand patriotic education in schools, and further integrate Hong Kong's governance with mainland China’s authoritarian system. “The development of China and Hong Kong should be closely integrated under the principle of ‘one country,’” Lee said in a campaign manifesto.

Critics contend Lee’s hardline stance will only polarize society and damage Hong Kong’s standing as a global financial hub. “His appointment pretty much signals the endgame of Beijing’s ambitions to bring Hong Kong firmly under its control," said Professor Dixon Ming Sing of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

However, Lee enjoys staunch support from pro-establishment figures who endorse his law-and-order platform and allegiance to Beijing. “Lee is a suitable candidate to lead Hong Kong to return to the right path,” said Maria Tam, a member of the selection committee.
