Chinese Economic Recovery Fuels Speculation in Hong Kong Stocks 

The Hong Kong stock market surged this week as encouraging economic data from mainland China spurred speculation that the recovery is gaining steam. The Hang Seng index rose more than 3% over two days of trading, led by sharp gains in shares of Chinese technology and consumer companies.

On Wednesday, China reported that industrial production rose 7.5% in April compared with a year earlier, beating economists' forecasts. Retail sales also grew at a faster pace, climbing 17.7% last month compared with a year ago. The robust data bolstered confidence that China's economy is rebounding solidly from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

“The broad-based pickup in China's economic activity in April confirms that the post-COVID recovery is gathering momentum,” said Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. “Industrial production grew at the fastest pace since the end of 2017.”

Technology and consumer stocks, which are closely linked to growth in the Chinese economy, led the rally in Hong Kong. Tencent Holdings, the internet company, gained more than 5% over two days. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp rose 8%, while sportswear brand Anta Sports Products climbed nearly 10%. Companies in tourism and financial services also posted strong gains. 

Speculators appeared to be betting that the economic revival in China would spill over into Hong Kong and fuel increased corporate earnings and stock prices going forward. “The growth numbers were massively above expectations, so that set the stage for a rally in Hong Kong,” said Tom Chan Pak-lam, an investment director at China Everbright Ltd. in Hong Kong. 

However, some analysts warned that much of the gains were driven by short-term trading and hype, rather than a sustainable improvement in the outlook. China's economy remains uneven, with weak points like high unemployment, and external demand is still under pressure because of the global recession. 

"This looks to be exaggerated by short-term speculation," said Liu Jin, director of research at Essence Securities in Hong Kong. "The overall sentiment is pretty good, but there are still questions about how far and how fast the economic recovery will be."

The surge has also prompted concerns of a potential bubble forming in Chinese technology stocks that could eventually pop. But others believe the rally still has room to run if optimism grows over a longer-term trend of innovation from Chinese tech startups. For now, the economy in mainland China and Hong Kong appears to be moving again, but how far and how fast it goes remains to be seen.
