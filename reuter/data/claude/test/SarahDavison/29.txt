Cathay Pacific faces further struggles as Airbus fleet is grounded and analysts predict bleak future 

Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, faces further headwinds as its Airbus A350 fleet has been grounded after cracks were found on the wing structure of some aircraft. The temporary grounding of the advanced wide-body aircraft comes at a precarious time for Cathay, which is already reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and months of protests in Hong Kong. 

Cathay Pacific confirmed that a “number of aircraft” in its fleet of 28 Airbus A350s have been removed from service for immediate inspection after cracks were found on the structure of the aircraft wings. The aircraft is Cathay’s newest model and was intended to serve as the backbone of its long-haul operations for the future. Airbus also said it is working closely with Cathay to resolve the issues, but no timeline has been given for when the aircraft may return to service.

The grounding is the latest headache for Cathay executives who are struggling to navigate the airline through one of the biggest crises in its 72-year history. Cathay posted its first back-to-back annual loss in 2019, weighed down primarily by a drop in overall passenger traffic amid the protests in Hong Kong. The situation has worsened significantly in 2020 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has brought global aviation to a near standstill. Earlier this year, Cathay cut 30% of its workforce and cancelled more than half of its flight schedule.

With the long-term impact of the pandemic still unknown, analysts are pessimistic about Cathay’s prospects for recovery in the coming years. The grounding of the A350 fleet only adds to the uncertainty. “This is absolutely the worst possible time for Cathay to lose a meaningful percentage of its fleet,” said Will Horton, a senior analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. He noted that the A350 is “crucial to medium and long-haul operations” and its absence will significantly impact cargo operations as well.

Cathay said customers booked on the cancelled A350 flights will be reaccommodated onto other flights or will be offered a refund. However, the airline was already struggling to find seats for customers on its reduced schedule, and the aircraft shortage will put further strain on its ability to re-accommodate passengers. Cathay had pinned much of its long-term hopes on the A350 to replace its older Boeing 777s, but the future of its young Airbus fleet now hangs in the balance while urgent inspections are carried out. After an annus horribilis in 2019 and 2020, Cathay has yet more clouds on the horizon.
