Most European Governments to Attend Inauguration of Unelected Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong, Says Western Envoy  

The international community will send representatives to attend the inauguration this week of Hong Kong’s provisional legislature, which was formed after authorities canceled elections in August to overhaul the city’s electoral rules, according to a Western diplomat. Diplomats from over a dozen European governments plan to attend the opening session of the provisional legislature, demonstratively showing support for Hong Kong’s government amid a political crisis following last year’s pro-democracy protests, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Beijing-backed authorities have postponed all upcoming elections for the next five years in Hong Kong and will form an interim legislature to govern the city, raising concerns over the erosion of political freedoms and autonomy in the former British colony. The formation of the provisional legislature was a response to the protests movement calling for greater democracy and opposition to China's tightening grip on Hong Kong. But critics argue it undermines the "one country, two systems" principle that is supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's freedoms until 2047.    

Still, the attendance of Western diplomats at the inauguration suggests Beijing's efforts to rally international support for its actions in Hong Kong have gained some traction. In recent months, Chinese officials have warned Western governments against "interfering" in Hong Kong, accusing them of fomenting unrest. At the same time, China has sought to reassure businesses in Hong Kong that the city will remain a gateway for foreign investment despite the political turmoil.

The provisional legislature will have all the powers of the elected one it is replacing, including passing laws and approving government budgets. Its members were selected by a committee dominated by supporters of the central government in Beijing. Many observers expect the interim body will prioritize passing a controversial national security law that was shelved following last year's protests. The law is aimed at curbing secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference – but critics fear it will be used to further curb dissent and political opposition in Hong Kong.

The attendance of foreign diplomats at the opening of the provisional legislature shows that for all the criticism of China’s actions in Hong Kong, many governments also see value in maintaining cooperative relationships with Beijing. While voicing support for democratic values, some European countries in particular appear reluctant to antagonize China on human rights issues. The uneasy balancing act highlights the tensions inherent in engaging an increasingly assertive China on the global stage.
