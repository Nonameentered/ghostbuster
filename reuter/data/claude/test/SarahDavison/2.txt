Jardine Fleming Breaks Through with Major Underwriting Deal in China After Years of Exclusion  

Jardine Fleming, the Asian investment banking arm of Jardine Matheson, has won its first major equity underwriting mandate in China in over 15 years. The firm will act as a joint bookrunner on the Hong Kong IPO of China's largest pork producer, WH Group. The deal is expected to raise up to $5 billion, making it the largest IPO in Hong Kong this year.   

The win marks a significant breakthrough for Jardine Fleming in China's equity capital markets after years of being sidelined. The firm was active in China's market in the 1990s but lost out on deals after the Asian financial crisis. It has struggled to regain a foothold as global banks came to dominate China's ECM sector. The WH Group mandate signals that Jardine Fleming is back in the game.

"This is an incredibly important deal for us," said Anton Casey, Head of Investment Banking at Jardine Fleming. "We have worked hard to strengthen our China offering, and the stars have finally aligned. We are thrilled that WH Group has put their trust in us for their Hong Kong IPO."

WH Group is China's top producer of pork products, processing over 10 million hogs annually. The company was formerly known as Shuanghui Group before purchasing US-based Smithfield Foods in 2013. The IPO proceeds will be used to repay debt from that $4.7 billion acquisition, which helped cement WH Group's position as a global pork powerhouse. 

The Hong Kong IPO will be keenly watched by investors amid challenging market conditions. IPO activity in Hong Kong has declined by over 50% so far this year due to market volatility and slowing economic growth. However, WH Group's dominant position in China's stable food sector is viewed as an attractive defensive play. The company is aiming for a valuation of $15-20 billion in the offering.

Joint bookrunners on the deal also include China International Capital Corporation and Goldman Sachs. WH Group plans to officially launch the IPO in Hong Kong in April, pending regulatory approval and market conditions. For Jardine Fleming, it marks the end of a long wait outside China's capital markets. With this breakthrough success, the firm will be hoping that there are more deals to follow.
