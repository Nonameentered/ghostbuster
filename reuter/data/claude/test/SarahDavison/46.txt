Hong Kong's leaders prepare for the challenges of a new world order post-handover 

As Hong Kong marks 25 years since its handover from Britain to China, its leaders are grappling with significant geopolitical shifts that will shape the city's future. The rise of China as an economic and military superpower, increased global tensions between the United States and China, and the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic are creating both opportunities and challenges for the semi-autonomous territory.

Speaking at a ceremony to mark the handover anniversary, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said “the balance of power in the global order is changing at a pace and scale not seen for centuries.” She highlighted China's growing influence on the global stage but also warned of “rising protectionism in some parts of the world” and “the weakening of multilateral institutions” that threaten international cooperation.

Economically, Hong Kong's fortunes are tied closely to China and its quest for greater technological self-sufficiency. China's new five-year plan aims to boost research and development spending to produce breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence, biotech, and quantum computing. “There will be plenty of opportunities for Hong Kong's research institutions and technology companies to participate in China's technology push,” said John Lee, Hong Kong's secretary for security. At the same time, escalating tensions between China and Western nations over trade, technology, and human rights could jeopardize Hong Kong's role as an international finance hub if it is seen as too closely aligned with Beijing.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted both opportunities and threats for Hong Kong. China's early economic rebound from the crisis points to resilient demand that could boost trade and tourism from mainland China. At the same time, Hong Kong must address economic overreliance on China even as Western economies struggle to contain new infection spikes. Policymakers are promoting the need for economic diversification to hedge risks, even as deeper integration with mainland China continues apace.

A quarter century after the handover, Hong Kong finds itself navigating a complex global landscape with both Chinese and Western characteristics as it seeks to maintain the openness and connectivity that have long underpinned its prosperity. How its leaders balance these forces and forge Hong Kong's path forward in a “new world order” will be crucial to the city's future as a leading financial and trade hub in Asia. Ultimately, Hong Kong's unique position depends on keeping the trust and confidence of all sides in an increasingly polarized world.
