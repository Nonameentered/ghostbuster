Cereal brands facing fierce competition as slow-sellers are weeded out of grocery stores  

The cereal aisle at your local grocery store is getting more cutthroat. As consumers gravitate toward healthier and more premium options, major cereal makers are facing slowing sales of their staple sugary and processed cereals. In response, grocery chains are pruning their assortments and prioritizing shelf space for the best-selling brands and products.  

General Mills, Kellogg's, and Post -- the big three cereal makers -- have reported declining sales of branded cereals in the U.S. over the past several quarters. Although they have diversified into snacks, yogurts, and other products, cereal remains a major part of their business. With people concerned about sugar, artificial colors and fillers, iconic brands like Frosted Flakes, Fruit Loops, and Cap'n Crunch are not as popular as they once were.  

"We're seeing a kind of cereal malaise, especially among children and families," said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage analyst at market research firm NPD Group. "Consumers want healthier, more premium options, and cereal makers have been slow to respond."

As cereal sales soften, supermarkets don't want as many slow-selling items taking up space on their shelves. Kroger Co, the nation's largest grocery chain, recently reduced the number of cereals it carries by around 30 percent. Other chains like Publix and Wegmans are also being more selective in which products get coveted shelf space.  

In response, General Mills and Kellogg's have launched new lines of organic, gluten-free, and protein-packed cereals to meet changing tastes. They've also ramped up marketing for their healthier existing brands like Cheerios. Post has partnered with startups in an effort to reinvigorate its line-up.  

But cleaning up nutritional labels and diversifying into premium products may not be enough. Smaller brands like Kashi, HighKey, and Magic Spoon now account for more than $1 billion in annual cereal sales, gaining popularity with consumers who prefer shorter, simpler ingredients lists and sustainably-sourced products. The big cereal makers will have to keep innovating and refreshing their offerings to avoid ending up in the bargain bin.

The next time you shop for your cereal staples, you may have fewer familiar options to choose from. But the choices that remain should be better for your health and cater to the latest food trends. For the major cereal brands, it's really a case of adapt-or-be-eliminated. The days of overly sweet, processed flakes and puffs dominating the aisle may be numbered. Keeping up with changing tastes to avoid becoming obsolete -- now that's the real breakfast of champions.
