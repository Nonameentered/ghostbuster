Anheuser-Busch Aims for Double-Digit EPS Growth in 1997

Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, announced plans to boost earnings per share (EPS) by 10-12% in 1997, building on a year of strong growth in 1996. The St. Louis-based company, maker of Budweiser and Michelob beers, saw profits rise by more than 18% last year due to a combination of falling costs and strong sales of premium brands.

August Busch III, chairman and CEO, told investors at the company's annual meeting that the brewer is well-positioned to continue increasing profits at a healthy pace. "We have strong momentum in our core domestic beer business, powerful growth from our international business, and continued improvements from our Eagle Snacks and Campbell Taggart baking operations," said Busch. "With programs in place to enhance productivity, cut costs, and invest in our premium brands, we are aiming for double-digit EPS growth for the year ahead."   

The company reported 1996 EPS of $3.22, up from $2.73 the previous year. Most of the growth came from the beer business, which saw volumes increase 2%, largely due to the success of premium brands like Bud Ice and Michelob. Price increases also added to the bottom line. Meanwhile, the company's "Project Alpha" cost-cutting program reduced expenses by $200 million last year, with additional savings expected in 1997.

Internationally, Anheuser-Busch continues to see rapid growth, especially in China and parts of Latin America. The company's joint ventures and strategic investments in 13 countries added nearly 10 million barrels to total volume last year. Busch expects worldwide beer volume will surpass 120 million barrels in 1997, up from 113 million in 1996.     

Not everything is rosy, however. Domestic beer sales flattened in the U.S., and competition from craft beers, imports, and other beverages poses ongoing challenges. The company also suffered a setback recently when Miller Lite regained the title of industry's light beer sales leader, after more than a decade of dominance by Bud Light. Still, with its balanced growth, cost focus, and marketing prowess, Anheuser-Busch seems poised to achieve another year of healthy returns for investors. The company's stock rose more than 20% last year, and analysts suggest it has further to climb in 1997.
