General Mills Expects Recovery in U.S. Ready-to-Eat Cereal Market, Plans New Product Launches and Tie-Ins to Boost Sales  

General Mills, one of the largest producers of ready-to-eat cereal in the U.S., announced plans today to re-invigorate its cereal business after several years of lackluster sales. The company said it anticipates growth will return to the $10 billion U.S. cereal market in the coming months, especially as consumers seek nostalgic comfort food and convenience options amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  

To capitalize on the recovery, General Mills outlined ambitious plans to boost cereal sales through product innovation, licensing partnerships, and tie-ins with entertainment companies. “Ready-to-eat cereal is one of the most affordable, convenient, and nostalgic foods on the market,” said Chief Marketing Officer Ivan Pollard. “We are confident cereal’s best days are still ahead.”

New cereal products set to launch this year include gluten-free and high-protein versions of classic brands, as well as the re-introduction of popular but discontinued varieties such as Fruity Pebbles and Cookie Crisp. The company also announced licensing deals to create cereals based on popular movies, TV shows, and video games. 

Additionally, General Mills will increase its marketing budget to promote its efforts to reduce sugar in cereals by 25% over the last 10 years. Despite its health and nutrition improvements, cereal has faced mounting competition in the breakfast category from Greek yogurt, protein smoothies, and breakfast sandwiches in recent years. However, cereal still offers an affordable source of fiber, minerals, and B vitamins, Pollard noted.

To support the new cereal products and marketing campaigns, General Mills will boost its advertising spending on channels frequented by Millennials and younger consumers. The company will launch a major TikTok campaign targeting teenagers and partner with Twitch streamers and YouTube influencers to engage video game fans and drive e-commerce sales.  

General Mills’ stock price rose 2% on the news, signalling investor confidence in the company’s cereal strategy. While a return to the category’s peak sales levels of the 1990s is unlikely, increased innovation and messaging around cereal’s nutritional benefits and low cost could resonate in the post-pandemic economy. The company’s efforts may generate further consumer interest in a breakfast staple that has nourished generations. Overall, General Mills appears willing to bet big on its flagship cereal division.
