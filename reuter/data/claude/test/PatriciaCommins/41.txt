Summit Medical Systems Inc. Faces Major Revenue Cuts Due to Accounting Discrepancies Found by New CFO; Shares Drop by 30%  

Summit Medical Systems Inc., a leading medical device maker, announced today that it is restating revenue for the past two years and slashing revenue projections for the upcoming year as a result of accounting issues uncovered by its recently hired chief financial officer, Maria Chan. The accounting discrepancies amounted to inflating revenue by as much as 20% over the past two years, according to Ms. Chan. The company’s shares plunged 30% on the news.

When reached for comment, Ms. Chan stated, “After reviewing the books, there were numerous gaps and inconsistencies in revenue reporting. In some cases, revenue was counted twice for the same sales, while in other instances revenue was booked for products before they were actually sold to customers.” Ms. Chan took over as CFO four months ago and has spent the ensuing time analyzing the company’s financial reporting. 

Todd Meyers, CEO of Summit Medical, said in a statement: "We are taking this issue extremely seriously and are taking swift action to improve our accounting procedures and financial controls to prevent this from happening again in the future. I sincerely apologize to our shareholders and customers for this unacceptable situation." Mr. Meyers insisted that the accounting issues were due to "sloppy practices and oversight" as opposed to fraud, but that the distinction mattered little to investors, who drove the stock down 30% in morning trading to around $25 per share. At this price, Summit Medical has lost nearly $2 billion in market value from its peak.

The restatement means revenue for 2018 will decrease to $1.2 billion from the $1.5 billion originally reported, while revenue for 2019 will fall to $1.35 billion from $1.65 billion. For 2020, revenue is now projected to come in at around $1.5 billion, down from previous guidance of $1.8 billion. Operating income and net income will drop accordingly for the past two years as well.  

The misstated financials and need to refile statements with regulators are a major embarrassment for Summit Medical, a company once considered an industry leader for its innovative devices in fields like orthopedics, cardiology, and diagnostic imaging. Legal experts say the company could face fines from regulators and class-action lawsuits from investors seeking damages. The accounting issues may also hamper Summit Medical's ability to raise capital if needed in the coming months. All told, it appears this chapter will be one investors and management at Summit Medical will want to quickly forget.
