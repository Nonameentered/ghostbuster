ConAgra's Diversified Operations Outweigh Exposure to Commodities, Boosting Earnings Growth 

ConAgra Brands reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, boosted by its diversified operations that offset exposure to volatile commodity prices.

The food company, which owns brands like Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice and Reddi-wip, said sales in its grocery and snacks segment rose 3% in the latest quarter, lifting overall revenue. ConAgra isn't heavily reliant on any single raw material, using a variety of grains, proteins and other ingredients across its portfolio. This diversity helps insulate the company from big swings in the prices of commodities such as wheat, corn, beef and pork.

In contrast, some other food companies have warned that higher costs for key inputs could dent profits. General Mills Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co. recently cited rising expenses for ingredients and transportation. ConAgra's broad mix of products, from frozen dinners to popcorn and barbeque sauces, gives it more flexibility to pass along price increases to customers when needed to offset cost inflation.

The company also has been focusing on improving its own operations to lift margins. Cost cutting and investments in manufacturing efficiency have generated over $1 billion of savings over the past four years, providing a tailwind for earnings. In the most recent quarter, lower overhead costs and supply-chain improvements boosted operating profit in the grocery and snacks unit.

For the quarter ended Nov. 27, ConAgra posted net income of $362 million, or 91 cents a share, up from $252 million, or 63 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.04 cents a share, ahead of the 95-cent average of analysts' estimates compiled by FactSet. Revenue rose 9.4% to $3.24 billion, above expectations.

ConAgra reaffirmed its financial targets for fiscal 2022, forecasting organic sales growth of 1% to 2% and adjusted per-share earnings of $2.50 to $2.60. The upbeat results and outlook suggest ConAgraâ€™s balanced business model should continue fueling better-than-average growth, even if commodity markets remain volatile.
