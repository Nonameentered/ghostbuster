Quaker Oats Reports Profit in Q4, but Snapple Disappoints and Continues to Lose Money

Quaker Oats Co., the leading maker of hot cereals, foods, and beverages, reported a 10 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit, largely due to strong sales of its main Quaker oatmeal products. However, the company's Snapple beverage unit continued to struggle, posting another quarterly loss. 

Quaker Oats said net income rose to $92.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from $84.2 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 4 percent to $1.56 billion. Results beat analysts' expectations of 58 cents a share and revenue of $1.53 billion.

The company attributed the profit gain to higher prices and improved productivity at its core Quaker Foods North America division, which includes the namesake hot cereals. Sales of Quaker oatmeal, rice snacks, and breakfast bars, among other items, jumped nearly 8 percent. The strong performance of established brands in a weak economy demonstrates the resilience of classic, trusted products, said Quaker Oats CEO Jonathan Farley in a statement.

In contrast, the Snapple beverage unit reported an operating loss of $12.3 million, compared with a loss of $11.2 million a year ago. Since Quaker Oats acquired Snapple for $1.7 billion in 2000, the brand has struggled and lost significant market share. Quaker Oats has been unable to revive the once-popular Snapple brand and turn around its deteriorating performance. Revenue from Snapple slid 3 percent in the latest quarter.

The Snapple acquisition has been seen as one of Quaker Oatsâ€™ biggest blunders. Industry analysts believe Quaker Oats overpaid for Snapple and has not invested enough in marketing and product innovation to compete with growing beverage brands like Vitaminwater and Fuze. Quaker Oats may need to sell or spin off Snapple to boost its own shares and free up resources to focus on its core products, some analysts argue.

Quaker Oats projected earnings per share growth of 4 to 6 percent for 2020, implying profit of $2.39 to $2.45 a share. The company expects continued strong results from Quaker Foods North America but another difficult year for Snapple. Quaker Oats shares rose $1.12 to $52.80 in midday trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
