Kmart may merge Builders Square stores with Waban's HomeBase in bid to create third largest home improvement chain

Kmart Corp. is in advanced talks to merge its Builders Square home improvement chain with HomeBase, a rival chain owned by Australian retailer Waban Pty Ltd. According to people familiar with the matter, if completed, the deal would create the third largest home improvement chain in the U.S. behind Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. 

The merger of Kmart's 265 Builders Square warehouses and HomeBase's 190 warehouse-style stores would result in a formidable competitor with nearly $6 billion in sales. Analysts say the combined company would have greater purchasing power to compete on price with industry leaders Home Depot and Lowe’s.

For Kmart, the deal would provide a solution to the struggling performance of Builders Square, which it acquired in 1989. The chain has recorded more than $1 billion in losses over the past two years amid intense competition and a slowing housing market. Merging with a rival like HomeBase, which is profitable and growing at a steady clip, could help turn its home improvement division around.

For Waban, a deal would provide a platform to expand HomeBase in the U.S., which is the world’s largest home improvement market. Though HomeBase dominates the home improvement sector in Australia, it has struggled to gain scale since entering the U.S. in 1991. Teaming up with Builders Square would instantly make it a major player here.

Under the terms being discussed, Kmart is proposing a “merger of equals” with Waban that would result in shareholders of each company owning 50% of the combined entity. However, Kmart would likely have operational control, given its larger size and experience in the U.S. market. The new company would assume the Builders Square name and be based at Kmart’s headquarters in Troy, Michigan.

There is no guarantee a deal will be reached, and talks could still fall apart over key details like the ownership structure or management roles, said people close to the discussions. But both companies see a compelling strategic rationale for a tie-up as a way to gain scale and cut costs in a mature industry with little organic growth, suggesting motivation to resolve any differences.

Representatives for Kmart and Waban declined to comment on a possible merger. But Kmart CEO James Lampert has previously expressed willingness to consider “partnerships or other strategic alternatives” for Builders Square. Waban CEO Paul Fripp has also said the company aims to accelerate expansion of HomeBase through “cooperation with a major U.S. partner.” An announcement could come within several weeks, said sources.

Kmart shares rose 4% on the news to close at $12.75, while Waban's stock gained 8.2% in Sydney trading. Investors appear to welcome the possibility of a deal that could breathe new life into the companies' U.S. home improvement operations and put more pressure on the dominant chains that currently lead the market.
