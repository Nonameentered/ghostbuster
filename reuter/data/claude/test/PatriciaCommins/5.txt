DeKalb Genetics Corp Expects Higher Margins and Increased Market Share for Seed Corn Operations in North America

DeKalb Genetics Corp, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company, announced today that it expects higher profit margins and increased market share for its seed corn operations in North America for the 2019 fiscal year. DeKalb is the largest seed corn producer in North America, with over 60 varieties of seed corn developed for farmers in the United States and Canada.

“We have seen very strong demand for our newest seed corn hybrids, especially our DroughtGard and YieldGard varieties,” said Tom Andrews, President of DeKalb Genetics. “With farmers looking to maximize yields and protect their crops, our innovative seed products are providing tremendous value. We expect gross margins to increase by at least 5 points this year as we gain more market share.”

The announcement comes at a time when the overall seed corn market in North America has been slowing, with growth under 2% for the past several years. However, DeKalb has bucked the trend by developing specialized hybrid seed corns that address key issues faced by farmers like drought tolerance, insect resistance, and maximizing crop outputs. The company has also expanded into new countries in Central and South America, further diversifying its revenue base.

DeKalb plans to increase production of its highest-demand hybrids for the 2020 planting season while raising prices by low- to mid-single digits. The company will also start marketing some of its new herbicide-tolerant varieties in 2021, pending regulatory approval. “We believe innovative new products and technologies will drive growth for years to come,” said Andrews. “By addressing the biggest issues faced by corn farmers today through science and innovation, DeKalb is well positioned to gain market share and improve profitability over the long run.”

Based on the strong forecast, Monsanto Company stock rose over 2% in morning trading. Monsanto acquired DeKalb Genetics in 1998 for $2.3 billion and the subsidiary has been a strong growth driver ever since. DeKalb Genetics and Monsanto are both based in St. Louis, Missouri. DeKalb seed corn and crop protection products are sold through a network of independent dealers and distributors across North America.
