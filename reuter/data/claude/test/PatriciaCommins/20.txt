Quaker Oats Reports Profitable Q4, But Snapple Business Remains Unprofitable

Quaker Oats Co. reported strong fourth quarter results today, beating Wall Street estimates and posting an 8% increase in profits from the same period last year. However, the company's venture into non-grain beverages continues to struggle.

The maker of oatmeal, granola bars and other breakfast staples earned $92.3 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $85.7 million in the previous year. On a per-share basis, Quaker earned 71 cents, higher than the 68 cents expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.

Revenue rose 2% to $593.5 million, surpassing expectations of $591 million. Quaker attributed the growth to higher prices and strong sales of its hot cereal products and granola snacks. “We are pleased that our core breakfast products and snacks continue to resonate with consumers,” said CEO John Anderson in a statement.

However, Quaker's purchase of Snapple Beverage Corp. in 2000 continues to weigh on the company. Losses in the drinks unit widened to $22 million from $19 million last year. Since acquiring Snapple for $1.7 billion, Quaker has struggled to turn around the once-iconic brand of iced teas and fruit drinks. Quaker has launched multiple rebranding campaigns, introduced new products and cut costs, but Snapple has yet to become profitable under its ownership.

In the latest quarter, Snapple sales fell 8% to $107 million. Quaker said its tea products faced "significant price competition" and it would implement a new marketing plan for 2016 focused on Snapple's all-natural ingredients. But some analysts are skeptical the company can revive the flagging brand. "They have poured money into marketing and changed the formula, but consumers just see Snapple as an outdated brand from the 1980s and 90s," said Maxim Jacobs, an analyst with investments firm G&B Partners. 

Quaker's stock price, which has climbed 21% over the past year with the strong performance of its main products, was little changed on the news and closed at $72.12. The balance of Quaker's businesses remains robust, with the hot cereal and snacks segments seeing sales increase 6% and 4%, respectively. With a 49% share of the hot cereal market, according to Nielsen, Quaker looks poised to continue benefiting from health-conscious consumers seeking high-protein, high-fiber breakfast options.

While the failure of the Snapple acquisition still looms over Quaker, the company's fourth-quarter results show its core products have never been stronger. With a new focus on its most promising brands, Quaker seems ready to move past its unproductive diversification into beverages and get back to what it does best: making breakfast. For now, at least, investors appear willing to give it another chance.
