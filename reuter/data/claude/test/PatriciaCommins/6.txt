Former ADM Executive Sues FBI Agent for Constitutional Violations and Assault and Battery

John Doe, a former vice president at agricultural conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland or ADM, filed a lawsuit today in federal court against FBI Special Agent Tom Smith, alleging constitutional rights violations and assault and battery during a 2018 raid at Doe's home. 

The lawsuit stems from a June 15, 2018, early morning raid at Doe's Lincoln Park home. According to court filings, Smith led a team of six FBI agents to execute a search warrant at the home based on suspicions of fraud related to Doe's work at ADM. Doe's lawsuit alleges the FBI agents, under Smith's direction, entered the home in an unnecessarily aggressive and violent manner, without proper identification, and using excessive force against Doe and his family.

Specifically, the lawsuit claims that Doe, his wife Jane Doe, and their two teenage children were abruptly awakened around 6 AM by loud banging on their front door. Before they could answer the door or determine who was there, the FBI agents allegedly broke down the door with a battering ram and entered the home with guns drawn, while refusing to show identification or state the purpose for their entry. The lawsuit says one agent grabbed John Doe, threw him to the floor, and handcuffed him at gunpoint while refusing to explain the situation. Other agents allegedly pushed and handcuffed Jane Doe and the two children at gunpoint as well.

The Does claim that after several minutes of detention and the violent entry and handcuffing of the entire family, Smith finally showed his FBI identification and the search warrant but did not allow the Does to read the full warrant. The FBI team then searched the home for over two hours but allegedly found no incriminating evidence related to the suspected fraud at ADM.
