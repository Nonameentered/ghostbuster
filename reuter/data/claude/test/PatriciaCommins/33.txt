Ralcorp Holdings Inc seeks to cut costs and pursue acquisitions for profitable growth

Ralcorp Holdings Inc, a leading producer of private-label food products, announced plans to cut costs and pursue strategic acquisitions to drive profitable growth. The company is targeting $25 million in cost savings this fiscal year through reductions in headcount, optimizing its manufacturing and distribution network, and improving productivity. 

Ralcorp Holdings CEO Kevin Hunt said, “We have significant opportunities to streamline our operations and realize efficiencies across the organization. By reducing costs in a targeted manner, we will be in a better position to invest in growth areas and continue innovating for our customers.”

The cost-cutting measures are expected to generate savings that will be reinvested in Ralcorp’s brands and fund potential acquisitions. The company is looking at acquisition targets in adjacent product categories and geographies to expand its portfolio and customer base. Ralcorp currently produces a variety of cereals, crackers, pasta and condiments for retailers to market under their own store brands.

Ralcorp has faced pressures from higher ingredient costs and private label competition but remains focused on its long-term strategies. “We have built strong relationships with our customers over decades and will continue providing them high quality and affordable products for their private brands,” said Hunt. The private label food market continues to grow as retailers look to differentiate their offerings and achieve higher margins.

Ralcorp reported net sales of $4.9 billion in fiscal 2019, a 3% increase over the previous year. However, net earnings declined 8% due to lower volumes and higher costs. The company’s stock price has remained flat this year, but analysts say there is potential for growth if Ralcorp effectively executes its cost and M&A strategies.

Based in St. Louis, Missouri, Ralcorp Holdings was spun off from Ralston Purina Company in 1994. It employs over 10,000 people across North America and has over 60 manufacturing facilities. Ralcorp produces store brand products for most major supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, and food service customers in the United States and Canada.
