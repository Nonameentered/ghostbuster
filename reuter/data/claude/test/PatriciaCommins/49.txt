Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc Launches 28 New Corn Hybrids to Regain Market Share Amid Growing Biotech Competition 

Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc, the seed division of DowDuPont, announced the launch of 28 new corn hybrids featuring the latest seed genetics and biotechnology traits. The new hybrids are aimed at helping Pioneer regain market share in the U.S. corn seed market, which it has lost in recent years to rivals with newer biotech traits.

The hybrids feature improvements in yield potential, drought tolerance, and resistance to insects and diseases. They also incorporate the newest versions of the Agrisure Duracade and Optimum AcreMax XTreme insect protection traits. Pioneer spent over $2.1 billion in research and development last year, the most of any agribusiness company, in order to develop innovative new products to meet the needs of growers.

“This is the broadest and deepest lineup of corn hybrids we have ever offered farmers,” said Paul Schickler, president of Pioneer. “We are committed to providing seed products with the latest technologies to help corn growers maximize yield potential and profitability.”  

Pioneer has seen market share slip recently as competitors have launched new biotech corn traits, like the SmartStax PRO and PowerCore Enlist corn trait platforms. Rivals like Monsanto and Syngenta have also developed strong marketing campaigns around their new biotech offerings. Pioneer still maintains the largest market share in the U.S. corn seed market at 36.5%, but that is down from 39.3% in 2015 according to industry estimates.

The new Pioneer hybrids feature hybrids for a range of geographic areas and growing environments across the U.S. Corn Belt. Several new hybrids show a strong yield advantage over competitors in multiple environments, according to Pioneer’s research. The new hybrids containing insect protection traits also demonstrate improved control of corn borers, rootworms, and other pests versus previous versions of the traits.

Pioneer sales representatives will be previewing the new hybrids with growers this fall in anticipation of the 2019 growing season. Industry analysts expect another highly competitive selling season in the corn market. Growers will have more choice than ever, but will have to weigh the latest biotechnology traits and strong marketing campaigns against individual hybrid performance to determine what suits their needs best. Pioneer will be aiming to regain loyalty by demonstrating the yield potential and technology in their latest corn products. Overall, the intense competition should benefit corn farmers through better products, lower seed costs, and higher yields.
