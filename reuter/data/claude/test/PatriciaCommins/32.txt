Quaker Oats sees potential turnaround for Snapple beverage business after two years of losses 

Quaker Oats, a division of PepsiCo, reported that its Snapple beverage business showed signs of a turnaround in the first quarter of this year after two consecutive years of losses. Snapple sales grew 2% from a year earlier, marking the first quarter of sales growth for the brand since early 2016.

"We are starting to see the results of our renewed focus and investment in the Snapple brand," said Quaker Oats CEO Jim Andrew in a statement. "Through product innovation, updated packaging, and targeted marketing, we have reignited consumer interest in Snapple. This is an important first step, and we have more plans in place to continue the momentum."

Snapple has faced significant challenges in recent years from the surge in popularity of bottled iced teas, flavored waters, and other functional beverages. The brand has lost shelf space in many retailers to fast-growing upstart brands like Sparkling Ice and Bai. Quaker Oats reported that Snapple sales declined 6% in 2017 and 4% in 2018. 

To turn the brand around, Quaker Oats introduced several new Snapple products over the past year, including a line of organic bottled iced teas, a zero-sugar tea infusion line, and a watermelon-mint lemonade variety. The company also redesigned its packaging across the Snapple portfolio to have a more premium, crafted feel. On the marketing front, Snapple launched its first national advertising campaign in several years to build brand awareness, especially among younger consumers.

While a single quarter of growth is a good sign, analysts cautioned that more time is needed to determine if the turnaround efforts will sustain momentum. "Snapple still has a long way to go to restore the brand to growth and regain lost market share," said John Morris, a beverage industry analyst. "But at least Quaker Oats has gotten the attention of customers again. Now they have to keep them engaged for the long run."

Quaker Oats said additional new Snapple products and marketing investments are planned for the rest of the year. The company will be looking to build on its early success to continue strengthening the brandâ€™s relevance and accelerate its comeback.
