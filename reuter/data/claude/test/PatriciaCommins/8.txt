Kellogg Co may face further discounts to preserve its category leadership 

Kellogg Co, the maker of Corn Flakes and Pop-Tarts, may have to offer larger discounts and deals to boost sales as it faces slowing demand and increasing competition in the packaged food industry. According to analysts, the company will likely increase trade promotions and discounts for retailers in the coming quarters to drive volume growth and retain its position as the leading packaged food maker.

Kellogg's sales have declined for the past two quarters, dragged down by falling demand for staples like cereal and snacks in North America, its largest market. Volumes in the U.S. cereal business, which accounts for about 40% of Kellogg’s total revenue, dropped 2% in the latest quarter. The entire U.S. retail packaged foods industry grew just 1% last year as more consumers shifted to less processed and fresher foods. 

At the same time, competition is intensifying from private label brands, smaller upstarts and even traditional rivals like General Mills, which now offers yogurt, granola bars and organic products. To boost sales in this environment, food companies have relied more on short-term promotions like coupons, multi-buy offers and price cuts for retailers. Kellogg is no exception and it has stepped up marketing spending to fund these trade programs.

However, some analysts warn that excessive discounting may hurt profitability and brand equity in the long run. “Kellogg will likely have to balance volume growth with the margin impact of larger promotions,” said Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar. She noted that price cuts can be a “slippery slope” and Kellogg needs to avoid hurting the premium image of brands like Special K.

Kellogg executives said they aim to boost sales through innovation, marketing and improved in-store execution rather than just price discounts alone. “Our goal is not necessarily to be the promotion leader but the innovation leader,” said Steve Cahillane, Kellogg's new CEO. The company recently launched new products like cereal mash-ups and Pop-Tarts splits, though analysts say it may take time to determine their impact.

With its focus on nutritious plant-based food and snacking options, Kellogg is well positioned to cater to consumer trends. However, reviving demand and growth in a sluggish industry is expected to remain challenging in the near term. Maintaining its leadership position may require Kellogg to make some sacrifices on pricing and continue baiting shoppers with deep discounts and deals.
