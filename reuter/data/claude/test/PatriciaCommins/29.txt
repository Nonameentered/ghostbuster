EarthGrains Aims for Geographic Expansion Through Acquisitions in Consolidating Industry 

EarthGrains, one of the nation's largest bakery companies, announced today that it has entered into agreements to acquire two smaller regional baking companies as part of a strategy to expand into new geographic markets. The acquisitions of Southwest Bakeries of Arizona and Rocky Mountain Baking Company of Colorado will add production capacity and distribution networks across the Western United States.

"These strategic acquisitions will allow us to efficiently expand into the rapidly growing markets of the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions," said EarthGrains CEO Stephen Mills. "By acquiring strong regional brands and baking facilities, we can quickly gain production capacity and build our distribution networks to meet increasing demand for our products."  

The baking industry has experienced substantial consolidation over the past decade as major players have acquired smaller local and regional bakeries to gain economies of scale and geographic reach. EarthGrains has been an active participant in this trend, having acquired more than 20 bakeries across the Midwest and Eastern U.S. since 2000. However, the company has not had a strong presence in Western markets until now.  

Privately held Southwest Bakeries operates two production facilities in Phoenix and Albuquerque that produce breads, buns, and rolls under the brands Butternut, Sunbeam, and Rainbow. Rocky Mountain Baking runs a facility in Denver that makes baked goods sold in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming under the High Country brand name. Combined, the two acquisitions will add more than $200 million in annual revenue and 350 jobs to EarthGrains.

"While regional brands and bakeries continue to thrive, it has become increasingly difficult for smaller companies to compete with the scale and resources of industry leaders like EarthGrains," said Bob Knudsen, owner of Rocky Mountain Baking.  "By combining with a national company, we gain access to greater operational expertise and distribution networks to expand our market reach. At the same time, EarthGrains benefits by leveraging our local knowledge and brand recognition."

With the two deals expected to close within 60 days, EarthGrains will operate 43 bakeries across 32 states and D.C. The company will roll out its product brands—including EarthGrains, Great American, IronKids, and Good 'n Hearty—into the two new regions over the coming year while continuing to support the acquired local brands. Management also hinted that additional acquisitions may be on the horizon as EarthGrains seeks to continue its rapid growth in capturing new markets and customers across the country.
