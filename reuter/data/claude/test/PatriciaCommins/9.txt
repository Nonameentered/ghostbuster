McDonald's Reports Strong Fourth-Quarter Profits Despite Weak US Results, Plans to Cut Back on Restaurant Expansion   

McDonald's Corp. reported fourth-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations, driven by improved sales in international markets. However, the fast food giant continues to struggle in its key U.S. market.

The company earned $1.388 billion, or $1.44 per share, in the final three months of 2019. That was down from $1.423 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the same period a year earlier, but was far better than the $1.26 per share analysts had projected.

Revenue slipped 3% to $5.34 billion, also topping the consensus estimate of $5.3 billion. Global same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least 13 months, rose 5.9% in the quarter. However, same-store sales in the U.S. increased by just 1.6%â€”lagging the 3.2% growth analysts had forecast.

The results show that McDonald's push to modernize its restaurants and add new menu items to boost traffic in the U.S. still has a long way to go. At the same time, the company has found more success internationally, fueled by menu innovations tailored to local markets and upgrades to stores. Its 'Velocity Growth Plan' to speed customer experience and expand digital ordering channels is gaining more traction abroad.

In a statement, McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said, "Our strong finish to 2019 gives us momentum as we enter 2020, and we remain focused on running great restaurants, strengthening our digital capabilities and continuing to build our brand."

To boost financial returns, McDonald's plans to curb spending on new restaurant openings this year. The company will aim to cut capital expenditures in 2020 by about $500 million compared with last year, when it spent $2.7 billion. The chain will slow down new restaurant development in the U.S., especially in highly penetrated areas. It will put a heavier emphasis on remodeling existing locations.

McDonald's shares rose 2% in premarket trading following the earnings report. The stock has increased 15% over the past 12 months, compared with a 23% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
