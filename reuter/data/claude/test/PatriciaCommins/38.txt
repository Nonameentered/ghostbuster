McDonald's to Launch Nationwide 55-Cent Sandwich Promotion in Bid to Heat Up Fast-Food Market 

McDonald's announced today that it will be offering all of its classic sandwiches for just 55 cents each as part of a new nationwide promotion aimed at driving more customers into its restaurants. Starting June 1, customers will be able to purchase Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, McChicken sandwiches, and hamburgers for less than a dollar at the more than 37,000 McDonald's locations across the U.S.  

The new deal comes as fast food chains are facing increasing competition from fast-casual brands like Chipotle and Panera, which promote fresher and healthier menu options. McDonald's same-store sales in the U.S. declined for the seventh straight quarter earlier this year as customers defect to those rival chains. The 55-cent promotion is McDonald's biggest pricing deal in years and is intended to reinvigorate interest in its core menu items, which have been criticized as unhealthy. 

“No one can beat the taste, unparalleled value, and convenience of McDonald's classic menu items,” said McDonald's USA President Chris Kempczinski in a press release. “For one day, we're making our most iconic sandwiches even more affordable and accessible to customers so they can enjoy a little simple pleasure.”

The one-day promotion will be available all day on June 1 at participating McDonald's restaurants during regular operating hours. There will be no limits on the number of discounted sandwiches customers can purchase. McDonald's has not run a comparable broad-based sandwich promotion for at least 20 years, according to industry analysts.  

McDonald's remains the world's largest fast food company but has struggled in recent years to keep up with changing consumer tastes. In response, the company has made moves to improve ingredient quality, remove artificial preservatives from certain menu items, and add new options like premium burgers made with fresh beef and gourmet coffee drinks. However, sales of McDonald's flagship burgers and chicken sandwiches continue to sag.

The company's turnaround efforts have started to show some success, with McDonald's shares up over 25 percent in the last year. However, quarterly same-store declines in the key U.S. market—where over one-third of McDonald's revenue is generated—remain an ongoing problem. With the new 55-cent promotion, analysts say McDonald's is taking direct aim at the value menus of other quick-service chains to try and reverse those losses, at least for one day.

"This is a shot across the bow to competitors that says McDonald's will fight to remain number one," said Sara Senatore, a senior research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "Value and affordability have always been a big part of McDonald's brand positioning. They're going back to their roots with this promotion."
