ConAgra's U.S. Beef Business Shows Strong Signs of Recovery in Second Half of Fiscal 1997 

Omaha, Neb. - ConAgra Foods, Inc. announced today that its U.S. beef business has rebounded strongly in the second half of fiscal 1997, showing significant improvements in operating earnings over the same period last year. The beef segment reported operating earnings of $123 million for the fiscal second half, a 33% increase over the $93 million earned in the second half of fiscal 1996. For the full fiscal year 1997, beef operating earnings were $201 million.

The turnaround in beef segment performance came after a challenging first half, where tight cattle supplies and high-cost cattle squeezed margins. However, increased cattle availability and declining feed costs dramatically improved the operating environment in the second half. ConAgra's beef segment was able to capitalize on these improved conditions through strong operating execution in meat merchandising, trading, and foodservice. 

"Our beef business has delivered an outstanding performance in the second half of the fiscal year, highlighted by much improved margins and earnings," said Bruce Rohde, ConAgra Foods president and CEO. "While market conditions have helped, this strong recovery is really a testament to the hard work and commitment to excellence of our beef team. They have positioned this business for sustainable long-term success."

ConAgra Foods is one of the largest cattle feeders and beef processors in North America, with cattle-feeding operations across major cattle-producing states like Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. Its beef plants are also strategically located across the country, giving it significant capacity and scale advantages over competitors. With improved market fundamentals and operating performance, ConAgra's beef business is poised to continue delivering solid shareholder value.

The company reported overall fourth quarter fiscal 1997 earnings of $0.46 per diluted share on net sales of $9.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, ConAgra Foods earned $1.53 per diluted share on net sales of $36.2 billion. In addition to a strong beef recovery, the company saw good performance across other segments like pork, poultry, and packaged foods. ConAgra stock rose $1.12 per share on the earnings news, closing at $33.24.
