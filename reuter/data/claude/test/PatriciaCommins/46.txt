General Mills Earnings Rise Despite Drop in Sales and Domestic Cereal Volume

General Mills reported higher earnings in the quarter ending February 28, even as overall sales and volume declined compared to a year ago. The packaged food giant earned $405.4 million, or 75 cents per share, which was a 3 percent increase from $393.5 million, or 68 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. However, total net sales decreased 7 percent to $3.88 billion. 

The results reflect the challenge of an increasingly competitive packaged food market and shifting consumer preferences. While General Mills was able to increase profits through efficiency efforts, sales dropped across most product categories and regions. The steepest declines were in U.S. snacks, U.S. yogurt, and North America retail, which were down 11 percent, 9 percent, and 8 percent respectively.

The one bright spot was the company's pet food division, where sales grew 8 percent. "Our pet food business continued its track record of strong growth this quarter," said Jeff Harmening, chairman and CEO of General Mills. The Blue Buffalo brand, acquired in 2018, has been driving momentum in the pet food segment.

General Mills' flagship cereal brands in the U.S., which include Cheerios, Lucky Charms, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, saw a 6 percent drop in cereal volume. Cereal sales declined 9 percent overall in the quarter. The category has faced pressure from alternative breakfast options and a trend toward less processed and sugary foods. General Mills has tried to boost nutrition and sales through new products like Cheerios Oat Crunch and updates to cereal recipes.

Harmening noted that the third quarter results finished broadly in line with the company's expectations, and full-year guidance remains unchanged. However, the multi-year declines across product categories show the organization's struggles in adapting to a new market reality. "We are making meaningful progress against key priorities, but we still have more work to do," Harmening said.
