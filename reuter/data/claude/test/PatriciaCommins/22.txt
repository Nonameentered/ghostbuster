Tate & Lyle's U.S. subsidiary faces reduced profits for sweetener, shifts focus to other products and global investments

Tate & Lyle North America, the U.S.-based subsidiary of British food and beverage company Tate & Lyle PLC, announced lower profits from its sweetener products in the most recent quarter. The company attributed the drop in sweetener profits to lower demand for high fructose corn syrup and a reduction in margins.

In response, Tate & Lyle North America said it will diversify into new product lines and expand its global presence to drive future growth. The company remains optimistic that its mix of traditional and new products, together with an increased focus on international markets, will allow it to thrive despite challenges in the U.S. sweeteners market.

"While our sweeteners business has experienced some headwinds recently, we have a robust set of products and capabilities that provide exciting growth opportunities," said CEO Janice Johnson. She pointed to Tate & Lyle's line of texturants, its probiotic and soluble fiber products, and its emerging dairy processing aids as products poised for growth.

The company also announced new manufacturing facilities in Brazil and China to produce sweeteners and texturants for customers in those fast-growing regions. Tate & Lyle expects to benefit from the rise in living standards and growth of the middle class in developing countries, as consumers demand more processed foods and beverages. 

Some analysts see Tate & Lyle's diversification moves as a positive step toward stabilizing results. "Relying only on high-volume but low-margin sweeteners in the U.S. market was risky," said John Smith, an analyst at ABC Group. "By expanding both their product mix and geographic reach, Tate & Lyle is making itself a more resilient business."

However, other analysts argue that Tate & Lyle faces challenges in profitably growing these new business lines and international markets. Tate & Lyle's stock price declined 3% on the news, indicating investors remain cautious about the company's ability to offset expected continued weakening in its U.S. sweetener profits over the coming quarters.
