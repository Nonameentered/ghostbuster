General Mills Expects Record Performance in Fiscal 1997 with Record Earnings, Volume and Market Share  

General Mills, one of the world’s largest food companies, announced today that it expects record sales, volume and profit performance in fiscal 1997. The company projects record earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.10 for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1997. This represents an increase of 17% to 20% over fiscal 1996 results on a per-share basis.

“Fiscal 1997 is shaping up to be an exceptional year for General Mills. We expect to achieve record levels of sales, volume and profits. Our forecast is a testament to the strength of our brands and the successful execution of our business strategies,” said President and CEO Stephen W. Sanger.  

Sales for the year are expected to increase from a year ago, including internal growth of 4% to 5%. Volume is also projected to reach record levels in 1997 with gains in each of the company’s business segments. Operating profits are forecast to grow at a double-digit rate in fiscal 1997, excluding non-recurring items a year ago. 

General Mills’ brands, including Cheerios, Yoplait, and Betty Crocker, continue to lead in market share gains and new product introductions in their categories. For example, Cheerios, the number one cereal, has achieved six consecutive years of growth through market share gains and new product varieties. Yoplait frozen yogurt and yogurt drinks are driving growth in the refrigerated yogurt category. And Hamburger Helper, the category-creating dinner mix brand, is introducing five exciting new varieties this year to spur additional growth.

General Mills is confident this pattern of growth through innovation and marketing will continue in 1998 and beyond. The company remains focused on its key strategies - investing in core brands, developing new products, expanding in growing segments of the food industry and maximizing scale. By executing these strategies, General Mills aims to deliver consistent, profitable growth over the long term in an increasingly competitive food industry environment. Overall, the forecast for sustained momentum reflects the strength in General Mills’ brands and business model.
