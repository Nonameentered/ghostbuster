Price wars in breakfast cereal industry hurting major cereal makers' earnings

The major players in the breakfast cereal industry are experiencing declines in earnings due to an ongoing price war for customers. Kellogg, General Mills, and Post Holdings, which collectively control about 70% of the ready-to-eat cereal market in the U.S., have all reported drops in sales and profits in their most recent quarterly results. 

The price war appears to have started as a way to combat declining cereal sales overall as more consumers have shifted to other convenient breakfast options like yogurt, smoothies, and protein bars. In response, the big cereal makers have turned to heavy price discounting and promotions to boost volume. While this has worked to some extent, it has also eroded profit margins. According to industry analysts, average cereal prices have declined 2-3% over the past year due to the increased discounting.

In its most recent quarterly report, Kellogg's, the maker of famous cereal brands like Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, and Froot Loops, reported a 5% drop in operating profit due to lower cereal pricing and higher ingredient costs. General Mills, producer of Cheerios, Lucky Charms, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, saw its profits fall by over 30% in its last quarter as lower net pricing and higher freight costs hurt results. And Post Holdings, which makes Fruity Pebbles and Honey Bunches of Oats, experienced a loss in its private brands segment, which includes cereal, due to lower pricing.

The intense competition and price wars are not sustainable over the long run, according to experts. At some point, the major cereal players will have to find a balance between maintaining volume growth through price promotions and earning adequate profits to fund their operations. They may need to cut costs further or explore new product innovations to drive revenue and profitability instead of relying only on price as a lever. If they cannot boost profits soon, it could spell more trouble ahead for the cereal giants.
