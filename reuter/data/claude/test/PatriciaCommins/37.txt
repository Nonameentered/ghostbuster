CPC International to Spin Off Corn Refining Operations and Focus on Consumer Foods

CPC International Inc. announced today that it plans to spin off its corn refining and starch operations into a standalone company. CPC International will retain its consumer foods businesses, including well-known brands such as Hellmann's, Skippy, Mazola, and SpaghettiOs. 

The spinoff is aimed at allowing each company to focus on their core operations. The yet-to-be-named corn refining company will focus on producing starch, sweeteners, and ethanol. It is the world's largest corn refiner with major operations across the American Midwest. CPC International will concentrate on consumer packaged goods for retail customers around the globe.

"Our corn refining and consumer foods businesses have distinct operational models, talent needs, and growth profiles," said CPC International CEO Greg Morris. "After a comprehensive strategic review, we determined that separating into two independent, publicly traded companies is the best path to maximize the potential of both companies."

The spinoff is expected to be completed within 12 months, subject to final approval from CPC International's board of directors and regulatory approvals. Current CPC International shareholders will receive shares in both companies proportional to their current equity ownership. CPC International stock closed up 4.2% on news of the planned separation.

After the spinoff, the corn refining company will have approximately $18 billion in annual revenue and 25,000 employees. Its products range from high fructose corn syrup to ethanol, a renewable biofuel made from corn. Despite volatile commodity costs, the business has remained highly profitable in recent years due to increased global demand for processed corn products and renewable fuels.

The remaining CPC International company will have about $12 billion in annual revenue and 15,000 employees. In addition to its namesake brands like Hellmann's mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter, it owns a portfolio of packaged foods sold worldwide. Revenue and profits have grown consistently over the past decade as the company has expanded into emerging markets. The company sees continued opportunities for organic and acquisition-fueled growth, especially in Asia, South America and Africa.

Morris emphasized that day-to-day operations will not be affected by the split during the transition period over the next year. However, once complete, the separation will enable each company's management team to develop their own strategic priorities and operational policies tailored to their distinct businesses.

The planned split follows similar moves by other large consumer goods makers to break apart more specialized or disparate operations. Just yesterday, industrial giant General Electric announced plans to spin off its healthcare unit and sell other divisions.  CPC International's move is aimed at creating two more focused companies better equipped to compete in a rapidly changing global marketplace.
