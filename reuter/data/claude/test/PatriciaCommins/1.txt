Cereal makers face struggles as price wars lead to flat earnings and lower profits

The major cereal makers are facing significant headwinds as price competition has intensified in the grocery aisle. Kellogg, General Mills, and Post Holdings all reported flat or declining sales and earnings in their most recent quarterly results. The companies are caught in a price war as they lower prices to match competitors and vie for budget-conscious consumers. 

Kellogg's, the maker of Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, and Rice Krispies, reported that sales declined 2% in the second quarter. Net income dropped 8% compared to the previous year. General Mills, which produces Cheerios, Lucky Charms, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, saw sales remain flat while profits fell 14%. Post Holdings, maker of Pebbles, Great Grains, and Honey Bunches of Oats, reported a 3% decline in revenue and a steep 66% drop in income.

The challenging environment for cereal makers comes as food prices have been stagnant for years. Shoppers have become extremely price sensitive and willing to switch between brands based on the best deals. Cereal makers have been forced to offer discounts and promotions to match lower-priced store brands. This price competition has squeezed profit margins across the category.  

At the same time, cereal markets have been shrinking in developed nations as consumers opt for more convenient on-the-go breakfast options or more protein-packed alternatives like yogurt, breakfast sandwiches, and smoothies. U.S. cold cereal sales have declined about 10% over the past five years, according to Nielsen data.

To address these trends, cereal companies are attempting to boost innovation with more natural, organic, and healthy options as well as new flavors and combinations. They are also expanding into adjacent product categories like granola, nutrition bars, and snacking mixes. However, until macroeconomic conditions improve and allow cereal makers to regain pricing power, profit growth will likely remain a challenge. Competitive pressures and a difficult consumer environment continue to leave cereal makers stuck in a box with no easy way out.
