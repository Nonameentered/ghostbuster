Kellogg's warns of lower earnings, possible increased promotions to protect market share

Kellogg Company, the maker of popular cereal brands like Frosted Flakes, Fruit Loops, and Rice Krispies, warned investors this week that earnings for the year may come in at the lower end of its previous guidance. The company cited a number of factors impacting sales and profitability, including increased competition in the breakfast category and higher costs for some ingredients.  

In an announcement on Tuesday, Kellogg's said that earnings per share for 2019 may be at the lower end of the $3.52 to $3.62 range issued in its previous forecast. Net sales are now expected to decline between 1 and 2 percent for the year compared to 2018. The company's stock price dropped more than 5% on the news.

The breakfast category in the U.S. has become increasingly competitive in recent years, with more consumers choosing new options like Greek yogurt, smoothies, and on-the-go meals. Kellogg's ready-to-eat cereals have been a staple of American breakfast tables for decades but have struggled recently amid these dietary changes.

Kellogg's CEO Steve Cahillane said the company will step up marketing and promotional efforts for the remainder of the year to boost sales and protect market share. This may further impact profit margins and earnings, however. “Competitive promotional activity has increased, and we will respond,” Cahillane said. “We are prepared to invest further in promotions and brand building to stabilize our cereal business.”  

The increased investment in brand building may pay off longer term, according to analysts, if it helps to stem the tide of consumers defecting from cereals like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops. But the short-term hit to profitability could be substantial. “Kellogg's will have to spend heavily to match competition and ensure their core brands don't weaken further,” said Darren Seifer, an analyst at NPD Group. “That will mean significant money pumped into marketing and likely price decreases. It puts pressure on the whole organization to perform.”

Other factors impacting Kellogg's performance include higher costs for raw materials such as grains and nuts and increased expenses related to the company's cost-cutting program Project K. The multi-year program aims to save $1.1 billion through various efficiency initiatives by 2021 but has resulted in one-time costs that are impacting near-term results.  

Kellogg's has paid a dividend each year since 1925 and prioritizes this, indicating that the current difficulties are not expected to threaten the dividend at this time.  The company is set to report its second quarter results and potentially adjust full-year guidance again on August 1st. Investors will be closely monitoring not just the earnings numbers but also the signals executives issue on the state of the business and their strategy to restore momentum.
