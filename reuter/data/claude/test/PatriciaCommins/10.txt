Quaker Oats Co May Take $1 Billion Write-Down for Snapple Business: Analysts

Quaker Oats Co may have to take a write-down of up to $1 billion on its Snapple beverage business, according to analysts. Quaker acquired Snapple for $1.7 billion just 14 months ago but the brand has struggled in a highly competitive beverage market. 

Quakerâ€™s stock fell as much as 8 percent on the news Wednesday, dropping $4.6875 to $53.6875 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts have criticized Quaker's high-priced acquisition of Snapple, saying the company overpaid for a mature brand facing stiff competition.

"It's looking more and more like Quaker made a mistake with the Snapple deal," said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. "They haven't found the right formula to bring the brand to the next level, and the longer that takes, the more it hurts Quaker's bottom line."

Snapple has lost significant market share to smaller competitors and larger beverage giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo that have launched rival tea and juice brands. Quaker has also had trouble leveraging its distribution channels to get Snapple into the hands of more consumers.

In October, Quaker reported that Snapple sales volumes plunged more than 25 percent in the third quarter and profits were down more than 65 percent. CEO William Smithburg acknowledged the company was "disappointed" with Snapple's performance and vowed to reboot marketing and push for innovation. However, there are no signs yet of a turnaround.

Quaker is now exploring options to revive Snapple, including possible mergers or partnerships, sources said. The company may also overhaul Snapple's management team to bring in outside leadership with more expertise in the beverage business, the sources said. Quaker declined to comment on any options under consideration.

Analysts say a $1 billion write-down of Snapple would constitute about 60 percent of what Quaker paid for the brand just over a year ago. It would be a bitter pill for Quaker shareholders to swallow but would help the company move on from its troubled acquisition. For now, Quaker's stock is likely to remain under pressure until there are clear signs Snapple can be fixed or sold.
