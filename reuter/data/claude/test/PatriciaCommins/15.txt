Kellogg Co. Warns of Lower Earnings and Stock Falls as Analysts Worry About Increased Promotions  

Kellogg Co. warned investors on Tuesday that its earnings in the current quarter will be lower than expected, triggering a sharp sell-off in the stock. The food company cited increased promotional activity as costs have risen for ingredients. Kellogg's shares fell more than 4% in trading following the announcement.   

Kellogg said it now expects adjusted earnings per share in the current quarter of around $1.10, below the consensus forecast of $1.20 per share among analysts polled by FactSet. Kellogg's CEO Steve Cahillane said in a statement "the operating environment has become more challenging." The company is facing higher prices for commodities and increased pressure to offer deals and discounts to appeal to price-conscious consumers.

The news rattled investors concerned that packaged food companies will have to apply further discounts and promotions to continue attracting buyers. That could hurt profit margins that have already been strained over the past year. 

Kellogg has relied more heavily on sales promotions for many of its leading brands like Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies. The promotions have helped bolster sales, which rose 1.5% in the quarter, beating analysts' forecasts. However, the lower margins from the promotions have pinched earnings. Kellogg also raised its full-year forecasts for input costs, citing higher prices for ingredients like grains, sugar and cardboard.   

Kellogg isn't alone in dealing with these headwinds. Many large consumer-goods companies have been struggling with sluggish sales and weighed by rising costs. But Kellogg's warning signals the issues could be more severe than previously expected. 

Analysts said they were surprised by the magnitude of Kellogg's forecast cut, given the company's relatively stable financial performance. "We were expecting a solid quarter from Kellogg, so this is disappointing," said Citi analyst David Driscoll. North America is the source of two-thirds of Kellogg's revenue, so the results are a "caution sign regarding the health of the U.S. cereal and snacks categories," Mr. Driscoll added.

The environment is poised to remain difficult, adding pressure on Kellogg's leadership team to take further action. Options could include additional cost cuts, new product launches to drive sales or measures to address underperforming brands. Still, analysts warned that any forthcoming changes may not quickly alleviate the external pressures that weighed on Kellogg this quarter. Ultimately, a rebound will depend on a strengthening operating environment as well as the company's own adjustments and initiatives going forward.
