Mervyn's Division to Close 10 Stores, Pull Out of Florida and Georgia in Consolidation Effort 

Mervyn's, the mid-range department store division of Target Corp., announced plans today to close 10 underperforming stores across the country and exit the Florida and Georgia markets completely. The move is part of a larger effort by Target to streamline operations and focus Mervyn's on core Western and Midwestern markets.

The 10 stores slated for closure are located in Florida, Georgia, Texas, and California. They will close within the next 60 to 90 days, impacting about 500 employees in total. Target said it will offer relocation options to employees at nearby stores whenever possible. "These closures are difficult but necessary to ensure the long-term success of the Mervyn's brand," said J.B. Earle, president of Mervyn's.

Mervyn's currently operates nearly 300 stores across 18 states, primarily on the West Coast and in the Midwest. The division has struggled in recent years to differentiate itself from competitors like Macy's, Kohl's, and its sister brand Target. By exiting Florida and Georgia, which have 17 stores between them, Mervyn's can concentrate its resources on a more compact geographic area.

"Mervyn's needs to focus on where it has the strongest connections with customers in communities that have supported it for years," Earle said. "The Southern U.S. expansion was ambitious but ultimately unsustainable. Pulling out of those markets will make us a leaner, more focused company."

Target acquired Mervyn's in 1978 but has operated it as a separate department store brand. Though Target has thrived with trendy and design-focused stores, Mervyn's has clung to a more traditional model with clothing, home goods, and other products aimed at middle-income households. Same-store sales at Mervyn's have declined for three straight years. The division contributes only about 5% of Target's total sales today compared to over 10% a decade ago.

A Target spokesperson said the company remains committed to the long-term viability of Mervyn's, noting further closures beyond this round of 10 stores are not planned at this time. However, industry experts say Target may need to take more substantial action to revive Mervyn's, including redesigning stores to match Target's style, creating a loyalty program, or marketing the brand in new ways to younger shoppers. Without change, Mervyn's risks fading into irrelevance as shoppers continue flocking to more differentiated competitors. The exit from Florida and Georgia may buy Mervyn's time, but the challenge of defining its purpose for a new generation of consumers remains.
