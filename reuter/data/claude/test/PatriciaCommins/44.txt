BAB Holdings Inc. Plans to Expand National Presence Through Acquisition of Independent Bagel Chains

BAB Holdings Inc., the nation's leading bagel shop franchisor, announced today plans to expand through the acquisition of several independent bagel chains across the country. BAB Holdings currently operates over 2,000 franchised locations in 42 states under the Big Apple Bagels and My Favorite Muffin brands. 

"We see tremendous opportunity to grow our brands through the strategic acquisition of smaller regional bagel chains that have a loyal customer following," said John Smith, CEO of BAB Holdings. "Over the coming months, we plan to acquire three to five chains, each with 15 to 30 locations. We will convert these locations to Big Apple Bagels shops to strengthen our national footprint."

The independent bagel chains identified for potential acquisition currently span the Midwest, West Coast, and Southeast regions. By acquiring chains already in operation, BAB Holdings can expand more rapidly than through new franchised locations alone. 

BAB Holdings has benefited from the rising popularity of bagels as an alternative to donuts and muffins for breakfast and snacks. Bagel sales grew over 25 percent from 2010 to 2020 according to industry reports. The bagel category is a $3.2 billion market in the U.S. and growing.

However, bagel shops also faced significant challenges in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many were forced to temporarily close down in-person dining and shift to takeout, delivery and drive-thru only. BAB Holdings saw sales drop nearly 30 percent from March to May 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 before starting to recover in June. The acquisitions will help jumpstart growth as the economy and consumer demand rebound.

"We are seeing many independent bagel shop owners look to sell or retire as they faced health issues or financial hardships due to COVID-19," Smith said. "We aim to provide a graceful exit for these entrepreneurs while preserving jobs. We believe Big Apple Bagels is well positioned to strengthen these shops by providing operational expertise, marketing support and a loyal customer base."

BAB Holdings plans to finance the acquisitions through a combination of cash on hand and a new credit facility with a commercial bank. The company expects the deals to close within the next six to nine months, depending on negotiations with individual owners. The acquisitions are expected to drive a 15 percent increase in total sales for BAB Holdings in 2022.
