ReliaStar Financial Corp. Acquires Security-Connecticut Corp. in $488 Million Stock Exchange Deal  

ReliaStar Financial Corp. announced today that it has acquired Security-Connecticut Corp. in an all-stock exchange deal valued at $488 million. The acquisition bolsters ReliaStar's presence in the northeastern United States and expands its portfolio of retirement savings products.  

Under the terms of the agreement, Security-Connecticut shareholders will receive 0.75 shares of ReliaStar common stock for each share of Security-Connecticut stock they own. The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Based in Hartford, Connecticut, Security-Connecticut has $32 billion in assets under management and over 1.2 million customer accounts. The company offers annuities, life insurance, retirement plans, and wealth management services through its insurance subsidiaries. ReliaStar expects the acquisition to boost its total assets under management by about 15% to $270 billion and increase its client base in the New York and New England markets, where Security-Connecticut has a strong presence.

"This strategic acquisition significantly expands our scale and product capabilities, enabling us to better serve more customers with an enhanced range of retirement savings and insurance solutions," said John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO of ReliaStar Financial Corp. "Security-Connecticut is an excellent strategic and cultural fit, and together we will be even better positioned to help millions of Americans achieve financial security."

Regulatory filings show that Security-Connecticut’s life insurance business has achieved seven straight years of double-digit growth in sales. However, the company’s annuity business has struggled in recent years amid heightened market volatility and low interest rates. The deal with ReliaStar provides Security-Connecticut an opportunity to gain greater scale and tap into ReliaStar’s broader range of annuity and investment products.  

"Joining forces with ReliaStar allows us to take our business to the next level and accelerate growth," said Robert L. Williamson III, Chairman and CEO of Security-Connecticut Corp. "This partnership provides significant benefits for our customers, employees, agents and shareholders."  

Following the close of the deal, Security-Connecticut will operate as a subsidiary of ReliaStar and continue to be headquartered in Hartford. The acquisition is expected to generate $30 million in pre-tax cost savings within two years, mostly from reduced operating and administrative expenses. ReliaStar said it has no plans to cut jobs and will instead eliminate redundancies over time through natural attrition and by not filling open positions.
