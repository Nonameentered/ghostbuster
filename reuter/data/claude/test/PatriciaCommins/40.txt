McDonald's Risky Plan for Deep Discounts on Fast Food Could Hurt Profits and Franchisee Relations  

McDonald's, the world's largest fast food chain, announced an aggressive new value menu this week that promises deep discounts on some of its most popular menu items. The move aims to lure budget-conscious customers back to McDonald's and stave off competitors in a segment of the restaurant industry that continues to struggle.  

While value-conscious consumers may welcome the discounts, McDonald's franchisees are worried the heavy price slashing could hurt their profits. McDonald's owns very few of its restaurants outright; instead, most locations are operated by independent franchisees. The corporation makes most of its money by charging those franchisees rents, royalties and fees. If sales drop due to lower prices, franchisees' profits will fall as a result, putting strain on the company's business model.

The new value menu, called "$1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu," will offer items from each of those price points: $1 drinks like any size soft drink, tea or coffee; $2 snacks such as a McChicken or cheeseburger; and $3 "Doubles" with two of the same burgers or sandwiches. The menu launches nationwide at participating McDonald's restaurants on January 4. 

"Value has always been a hallmark of the McDonald's brand," said Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's CEO, in a statement. "The new $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu reasserts our commitment to affordability by giving customers more choices and opportunities to save on their favorite menu items every time they visit."

However, offering cheaper food and deals comes at a cost to the company's bottom line. McDonald's profits have been under pressure in recent years due to falling customer traffic and higher costs for ingredients. Its shares fell more than 2% on Wednesday following the announcement as investors worried the deepening discounts may only compound those problems.  

Several McDonald's franchisees have also openly worried about the impact on their business. "A lot of people, especially our employees, are going to suffer the consequences," one Houston operator who owns several locations told QSR Magazine. Franchisees operate 95% of McDonald's 14,000 U.S. locations, so keeping them satisfied is critical. In a memo this week, Easterbrook acknowledged that "some may criticize this move as only 'buying' sales." But he said he's confident the value menu will instead "grow the brand over the long term."

The fast food chain has little choice but to make a bold move, however. McDonald's same-store sales in the U.S., a key metric of health, dropped more than 3% last year and 4% the year before. Rivals like Taco Bell have lured customers away with their own discounted combo meals and $1 menu items. If McDonald's is to regain its footing, it needs to reconnect with the budget shoppers who have long been its most loyal customers. The new $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu is a strategic effort to win them back, for better or worse. Its success or failure will determine whether that risky bet will pay off.
