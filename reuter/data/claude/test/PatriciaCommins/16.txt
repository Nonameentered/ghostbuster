Kmart May Merge Builders Square with Waban's HomeBase to Form Third Largest Home Improvement Chain 

Kmart Corp. is in advanced talks to merge its Builders Square home improvement chain with HomeBase Inc., a privately held retailer, according to people familiar with the matter. If completed, the deal would create the nation's third-largest home improvement retailer after Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. with more than $6 billion in annual revenue.

The merger would provide Kmart an opportunity to spin off Builders Square, which has been a drag on earnings, while gaining a minority stake in the combined company. For HomeBase, teaming with Builders Square could provide more purchasing power and a platform to expand nationally.  The two chains are similar in size but have little geographic overlap. 

People familiar with the matter stressed that there is no guarantee a deal will be reached. While Kmart prefers a merger, HomeBase's owner and chief executive, Thomas Stemberg, the founder of Staples Inc., wants to maintain control of the company he built from scratch in 1990. The two sides are negotiating ownership splits and management roles in the potential combined company.

For Kmart, shedding its 89 Builders Square stores would allow the company to focus on reviving sales at its core discount stores. Kmart bought Builders Square in 1997, hoping to benefit from the wave of consolidation in home improvement retailing. But it has struggled to integrate the chain and make it profitable. On Monday, Kmart said Builders Square's loss for the fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 29 deepened to $9 million from $5 million a year earlier.

Selling or merging Builders Square is a cornerstone of the turnaround plan set by Kmart's new chief executive, Charles Conaway, who took over in May. "Builders Square continues to be a major problem area, and we need to evaluate all options to improve performance or limit losses," Mr. Conaway told analysts earlier this month.

For HomeBase, with 133 stores concentrated on the West Coast and in Texas, joining with Builders Square provides an opportunity to bulk up and expand nationally. HomeBase would gain Builders Square's network of stores especially in the Midwest and Southeast, as well as purchasing power to lower costs. A merger also could provide a path for HomeBase to eventually become a public company on its own.
