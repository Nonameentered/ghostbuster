Kosher seafood company Vita Food Products Inc seeking acquisitions to boost sales four-fold in five years   

Vita Food Products Inc, a Toronto-based company that produces and distributes kosher-certified seafood and fish products, announced ambitious plans to quadruple its sales within five years through acquisitions and expansion into new markets.

Founder and CEO Joseph Vitale said the company aims to grow revenue to $200 million by 2025, up from $50 million last year. "We see tremendous opportunity for growth in the kosher food and seafood sectors, both in Canada and internationally," Vitale said. “Through strategic acquisitions and by broadening our product range and distribution channels, we believe we can scale the business rapidly while maintaining our high standards of kosher certification and food quality.” 

Vita Food Products currently produces over 100 kosher-certified seafood products, including wild salmon, tilapia, cod, and crab. The company sells to supermarkets, restaurants, caterers, and distributors across Canada, the United States, Israel, and parts of Europe. To spur growth, the company is eyeing several possible acquisitions of smaller kosher seafood producers in North America and Israel over the next 12-24 months, according to Vitale. Vita Food Products is also upgrading its production facilities in Toronto and Montreal to increase capacity.

The global kosher food market has experienced strong demand in recent years and is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of around 15% through 2025 according to research firm MarketWatch. Kosher seafood in particular is a fast-growing segment due to increased interest in sustainable and ethically-sourced fish products among kosher consumers. Vita Food Products aims to tap into this demand through its acquisitions and by expanding into new markets in Latin America, Western Europe, and Asia, Vitale said.   

Vita Food Products has been producing kosher-certified seafood since its founding in 1987. The Vitale family started the business to serve Toronto's Jewish community but has since expanded across Canada and internationally. The company prides itself on sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices, working with independent farm-raised fish farmers and wild-catch fishermen. All of its products are certified under the strict guidelines of kashrut by leading kosher certification authorities.  

The planned growth strategy demonstrates the company's confidence in the kosher seafood sector, according to kosher industry experts.  “Vita Food Products is well positioned to become a major player on the global kosher seafood stage,” said Rabbi Chaim Levy of the Chicago Rabbinical Council, which provides kosher supervision for Vita Food Products.  If executed successfully, the company's plans could transform it into a leading producer of kosher fish and seafood worldwide and a major provider of sustainable kosher nutrition. However, there are also risks around managing a rapid succession of acquisitions and international expansion.  Much will depend on smoothly integrating new companies and ensuring high levels of kosher standards as operations scale, analysts say.
