McDonald's Launches Nationwide Promotion with 55-Cent Sandwiches in Bid to Beat Fast-Food Competition  

McDonald's, the world's largest burger chain, announced a nationwide one-day promotion on Wednesday that will feature cheeseburgers, McChicken sandwiches, and McRib pork sandwiches for just 55 cents each. The deeply discounted items are part of McDonald's latest push to boost traffic and sales at a time when it faces stiff competition from other fast-food rivals like Wendy's and Burger King.

The special 55-cent price represents a 70% discount from McDonald's regular prices for these items, which typically range from $1.69 to $3.99 depending on the menu item and location. McDonald's hopes the extreme price rollback will entice customers to come in and purchase higher-margin combo meals, drinks, and side items along with the discounted main courses. The promotion will run for one day only at all of McDonald's more than 14,000 restaurants across the U.S.  

"We're excited to give our customers a new reason to visit McDonald's and treat themselves to their favorite sandwiches at an unbeatable price," said Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's USA.  "This one-day deal is our way of thanking our loyal customers and welcoming new guests to come in and experience McDonald's in a new way."

McDonald's sales and traffic in the U.S. have been slowing recently as consumer tastes shift toward perceived fresher and higher-quality ingredients offered at competitors like Wendy's, Burger King, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. McDonald's has responded by updating its menu with items like fresh beef burgers, new breakfast sandwiches, and promotional deals to win back customers. The company has also updated its restaurants with self-serve kiosks, table service, and mobile ordering options to modernize the customer experience.

Industry analysts said the steep 55-cent price point of Wednesday's promotion shows how aggressive McDonald's needs to be to remain competitive, even if it results in a short-term hit to profit margins. "This is a 'shock and awe' tactic by McDonald's to capture customer attention, get people in the door, and disrupt the status quo," said Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Kalinowski Equity Research. "The lower price point is clearly aimed at countering what competitors are offering."   

The one-day 55-cent cheeseburger, McChicken, and McRib Sandwich deal will be available at participating McDonald's restaurants nationwide on Wednesday, September 18 only. Mobile app orders are excluded from the deal, and there is a limit of one of each sandwich type per customer at the promotional price.
