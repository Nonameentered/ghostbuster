Interstate Bakeries Corp Chairman Backs Analysts' Earnings Estimates for Third Quarter 

Interstate Bakeries Corp, the maker of Wonder Bread and Hostess Twinkies, expects to meet or exceed analysts' earnings estimates for the third quarter, according to Chairman and CEO Craig Jung. In an interview, Jung said cost-cutting initiatives and higher sales of premium baked goods are boosting the company's bottom line.

"We anticipated a strong quarter and the numbers are bearing that out," Jung said. “Our initiatives around procurement, distribution, and optimizing our bakery and route operations are really gaining traction and paying dividends.”

The average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet Research calls for Interstate Bakeries to earn 25 cents per share for the quarter ended May 31. Jung said earnings will be "at or slightly above" that figure. The company posted a loss of $1.40 per share for the year-ago quarter.

Interstate's stock has risen more than 40% over the past 12 months based on hopes of a turnaround following the company's emergence from bankruptcy in 2009. Revenue has grown for three straight quarters, aided by strong demand for high-margin products like 100-calorie snack packs and nutrition-enhanced breads that are attracting health-conscious consumers.

Jung noted that commodity costs, especially for wheat, sugar, and shortening, have declined in recent months, which is padding Interstate's profit margins. The savings are being reinvested in promotions, marketing, and product improvements to further boost sales, he said.

The company will report its full third-quarter results on Thursday afternoon. Based on Jung's comments, analysts said Interstate Bakeries appears poised to continue its momentum and beat Wall Street's forecasts over the balance of the fiscal year.
