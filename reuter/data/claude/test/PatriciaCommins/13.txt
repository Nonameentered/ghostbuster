Maytag's Earnings More Than Double with Boost from Hoover Floor Care Line

Maytag Corp. reported Thursday that its third-quarter earnings more than doubled, fueled by strong sales of high-margin floor care products from its recently acquired Hoover unit.

The Newton, Iowa-based appliance maker said net income rose to $127.2 million, or $1.82 a share, from $51.7 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 19% to $1.83 billion.

Maytag shares rose $2.31, or 5.4%, to close at $45.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The results handily beat analysts’ forecasts of $1.14 a share in earnings on revenue of $1.77 billion. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook as a result.

“Hoover’s performance in the quarter clearly exceeded our own expectations,” said Maytag Chief Executive Ralph Hake. He attributed the strong floor care sales to several new product launches, as well as a revamped marketing strategy focused on high-end vacuums that has boosted the brand’s image.

Hake said Maytag also gained market share in its core appliance categories like washers, dryers and dishwashers during the quarter. But price cuts and higher costs for materials like steel and resins squeezed profit margins for those units.

The floor care division, which consists almost entirely of the Hoover brand, reported an operating profit of $44.6 million in the latest quarter compared with a loss of $1.1 million a year earlier before the acquisition. Revenue nearly tripled to $331 million.

Maytag bought Hoover for $1.79 billion in September from Whirlpool Corp. The deal filled a gap in Maytag's product lineup and gave it a well-known brand with which to compete against industry leaders like Whirlpool and Electrolux. But some analysts questioned the price, especially given Hoover's financial struggles in recent years.

So far, the deal looks to be paying off for Maytag. In the first nine months of this year, Hoover revenue has surged 68% and operating profit has increased more than fivefold. If Hoover can sustain its recent momentum, analysts estimate it could add 25 cents to 35 cents a share to Maytag's earnings next year.
