Wm. Wrigley Jr Co seeks new ways to revive domestic chewing gum market  

Wm. Wrigley Jr Co, the world's largest chewing gum maker, is exploring new strategies to boost falling gum sales in the U.S., its largest market. The Chicago-based company reported that domestic gum revenue declined 3% in 2019, continuing a multi-year downward trend.  

Wrigley produces some of the most well-known gum brands, including Juicy Fruit, Doublemint, and its flagship Wrigley's Spearmint. However, gum chewing in the U.S. has declined as consumers opt for alternative products like mints and hard candies. Wrigley faces competition from smaller gum startups marketing "natural" and sugar-free options. Some analysts also point to shifting cultural attitudes, with gum-chewing in public increasingly seen as rude or inappropriate behavior.

In response, Wrigley is debuting new products, revamping marketing campaigns, and expanding into new distribution channels. At the 2020 National Confectioners Association trade show, Wrigley showcased gum products enhanced with vitamins, protein, caffeine and CBD. The company sees an opportunity to market gum as a functional product that can boost energy, focus or nutrition.  

Wrigley is also overhauling its marketing to court younger consumers. New ads feature 20-something influencers promoting gum as a cool, socially-conscious brand. Wrigley hopes to update what it sees as gum's outdated image. The company is also increasing its e-commerce presence and plans to sell gum on leading streaming music and video platforms to reach cord-cutter audiences.  

Retail partnerships are another key part of Wrigley's strategy. Wrigley aims to sell more gum at convenience stores, pharmacies and self-checkout kiosks. Impulse purchases at checkout counters represent a significant portion of gum sales, so increasing visibility near registers could boost revenue. Wrigley is also negotiating deals to sell specialty gum, like CBD-infused and protein-enhanced varieties, at major retailers like Walmart and Kroger.

Wrigley CEO Dushan Petrovich said the company's turnaround plan is gaining traction, but still requires patience. "We have to consistently innovate and pivot to keep up with consumer preferences," said Petrovich. "While it will take time, I'm optimistic we can reinvigorate the domestic gum market through our focus on new products, streamlined marketing and partnerships with retailers open to carrying our next-generation gum selections."  The strategy's success or failure could significantly impact Wrigley's growth in the coming years.
