Former Archer Daniels Midland Executive Mark Whitacre Files Lawsuit Against FBI Agent Shepherd Over Antitrust Investigation  

Mark Whitacre, the former Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) executive turned FBI whistleblower, has filed a lawsuit against FBI agent Brian Shepherd over what Whitacre alleges was a botched antitrust investigation in the 1990s. Whitacre, who was pardoned by President Trump in 2020 following his release from prison, claims Shepherd failed to properly report and act on evidence Whitacre provided regarding illegal price fixing in the lysine market. As part of an immunity agreement with the FBI, Whitacre went undercover for three years to gather evidence against ADM executives, though the investigation ultimately imploded amid allegations Whitacre had also embezzled money from ADM during that time.  

The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Springfield, Illinois, alleges Shepherd deliberately suppressed and ignored critical evidence Whitacre collected that proved ADM and its competitors were engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to inflate prices for the amino acid lysine to gain higher profits. Whitacre claims his recordings and other information showed clear violations of antitrust laws but that "through incompetence or willful neglect, Agent Shepherd failed to comprehend and act upon this compelling evidence of illegal activity." As a result, the lawsuit contends, the key players at ADM and other companies escaped prosecution and continued to overcharge customers. 

Whitacre is seeking $15 million in damages for lost wages, emotional distress and damage to his reputation. His attorney argues the botched FBI probe deprived Whitacre of future job opportunities and caused "significant anxiety, trauma and financial hardship" for his family. Shepherd, who has since retired from the FBI, declined to comment on the pending litigation. The FBI also declined to comment. ADM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Whitacre case rocked the agriculture industry in the 1990s. He was the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history at the time. His undercover work led to a $100 million fine against ADM for antitrust violations. However, soon after the FBI probe became public, ADM accused Whitacre of embezzling $9.5 million from the company over the same period, claiming the timing was no coincidence. Whitacre denied the embezzlement charges but was later convicted and served nine years in prison. His supporters argued he was unfairly targeted to discredit him as a witness against ADM.

Whitacre's lawsuit is a further attempt to restore his reputation and hold federal officials accountable for what he considers their role in enabling illegal corporate behavior and derailing his life. The case is also likely to bring renewed scrutiny to the controversial ADM antitrust investigation that made headlines 25 years ago.
