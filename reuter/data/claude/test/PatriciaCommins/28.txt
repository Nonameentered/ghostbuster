Hershey Foods Corp Plans to Expand Into Sweet Snack Market With New Acquisitions and Product Development  

Hershey Foods Corp, the maker of Hershey’s chocolate bars, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, and other confectionery products, announced plans today to aggressively expand into the broader sweet snack market. The company will pursue strategic acquisitions of snack food brands and accelerate new product development to diversify beyond its chocolate and candy portfolio.

“We see tremendous growth opportunities in the snacking space, especially in better-for-you and premium snacks,” said Michele Buck, President and CEO of Hershey. “Whether it’s popcorn, pretzels, organic fruit snacks or nut butters, consumers are snacking more than ever and seeking out high-quality, nutritious options.” 

Hershey plans to target emerging sweet snack brands in high-growth categories, especially those that appeal to younger consumers and families. The company will consider both acquiring brands outright as well as taking meaningful equity stakes in smaller companies to help them scale up. Hershey will provide access to its distribution network, consumer insights, and R&D capabilities to expand these brands’ reach.

Internally, Hershey will overhaul its new product development process to accelerate the launch of innovative sweet snacks. It aims to introduce at least three new snack products within the next 18 months, with additional rollouts at a rate of two to three per year following that. The company will expand its use of customer co-creation, in which consumers collaborate with Hershey’s food scientists on product concepts and prototypes. New products are likely to incorporate on-trend ingredients like nuts, seeds, coconut and alternative dairy options.

The expansion into sweet snacks is part of Hershey’s broader “Snacking 21” corporate strategy to capture more snacking occasions and better compete with Frito-Lay, Mondelez and other large snack players. Hershey forecasts the global sweet snacks market will grow at a rate of 10-15% annually in the coming years. With its new direction, Hershey aims to gain share in this fast-growing market and generate new sales growth for its business.
