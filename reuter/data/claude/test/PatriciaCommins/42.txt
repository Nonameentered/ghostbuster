Summit Medical Systems' Revenues to Be "Substantially Less" Due to Accounting Discrepancies, CFO Resigns After Less Than a Week on the Job

Summit Medical Systems, a manufacturer of surgical devices based in Chicago, announced today that the company's revenues for the full year 2019 and first quarter 2020 will be "substantially less" than previously reported due to accounting discrepancies discovered during an internal audit. The company also announced that its recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Jill Thompson, has resigned from her role after less than one week on the job.  

Summit Medical Systems said in a statement that it will need to restate its financial results for the full year 2019 and first quarter 2020 to correct "certain accounting errors and irregularities" found during the internal review. The accounting issues primarily relate to the timing of revenue recognition for several major customers. The internal audit found that revenue from some customer contracts was recognized prematurely, leading the company to overstate revenues in 2019 and Q1 2020.

The company said it has notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the issue and will restate its financials "as soon as practicable." Summit Medical Systems expects the restatement to show revenues will be reduced "substantially" for the periods in question but did not provide an estimate of the impact. The company's stock price plunged 25% on the news in after-hours trading.

The resignation of Jill Thompson as CFO after less than a week in the role came as a surprise. Thompson was appointed CFO last Monday and was tasked with helping turn around the company's finances after two quarters of weaker than expected results. In its statement, Summit Medical Systems said Thompson resigned "for personal reasons and to pursue other opportunities." The company has begun a search for a permanent CFO replacement.

The restatement and CFO resignation represent major setbacks for Summit Medical Systems, which manufactures surgical tools and medical devices used in operating rooms around the world. The company has struggled in recent years with flat sales, increasing costs, and new competitors entering the market. Earlier this year, activist investor group Clearwater Partners took a 5% stake in Summit Medical Systems and began agitating for changes to boost shareholder value, including cost cuts and exploring strategic alternatives like a sale of the company.

The accounting issues and executive shakeup are likely to complicate any turnaround efforts. Clearwater Partners issued a statement expressing "serious concerns" about the state of finances and management at Summit Medical Systems. With its financials now in question and uncertainty in the CFO role, Summit Medical faces significant challenges in rebuilding investor trust and confidence. The company's share price, already down 30% so far this year before today's 25% drop, faces further pressure until the accounting issues are resolved and a permanent CFO is appointed.
