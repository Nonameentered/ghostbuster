Roche Holding AG Acquires Tastemaker in $1.1 Billion Deal from Two US Chemical Companies

The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG announced today that it has acquired Tastemaker, a cutting-edge biotechnology company, from US chemical companies DuPont and Dow for $1.1 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is aimed at boosting Roche's portfolio in the high-growth market of agricultural biotechnology. 

Tastemaker is a pioneer in developing technologies to enhance the taste, aroma, and texture profiles of fruits, vegetables, and grains. The company was a joint venture formed in 2012 by DuPont and Dow Chemical to combine their expertise in bioscience and material science. Tastemaker has since emerged as an industry leader, partnering with major food and beverage companies to naturally optimize their products and capitalize on consumers' preferences for more nutritious and sustainable foods with improved taste and mouthfeel.

The acquisition of Tastemaker will allow Roche to expand into the fast-growing agricultural biotechnology market, which is expected to reach $35 billion by 2025 according to market research firm MarketsandMarkets. "This acquisition is a pivotal milestone in Roche's nutrition strategy and will position us as a leader in research collaborations with key partners along the food value chain," said Roche CEO Severin Schwan in a statement. 

DuPont and Dow issued a joint statement expressing confidence the deal will benefit both Tastemaker's employees and customers. The companies also said the sale will allow them to focus on their core chemical and materials businesses. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending regulatory approvals.

Roche plans to operate Tastemaker as a standalone subsidiary from its headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. "Tastemaker's innovative spirit and competitive edge in enhancing nutrition, sustainability and customer experience complements our vision for helping to shape the future of food," said Emmanuel Baetge, global head of Roche's nutrition division. "Together, we will push the boundaries of science and nature to benefit both businesses and consumers."

The acquisition highlights the appetite for biotechnology companies with expertise in developing natural solutions as consumers increasingly demand healthy and sustainable products. Tastemaker's technologies will provide Roche new opportunities to collaborate with leaders in the food industry on creating improved offerings to meet customer needs.
