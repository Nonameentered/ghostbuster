Quaker Oats Co. Faces Up to $1 Billion Write-Down for Struggling Snapple Beverage Business  

Quaker Oats Co. said it may take a charge of up to $1 billion to write down the value of its struggling Snapple beverage business, an admission that it vastly overpaid when it acquired the brand six years ago.

The announcement signals a major disappointment for Quaker, which paid $1.7 billion for Snapple in 1994 hoping to tap into a fast-growing market for new-age beverages. But Snapple has struggled in recent years amid intensifying competition from rivals like PepsiCo Inc.'s Lipton and Unilever's Slim-Fast.

Quaker has been trying to revitalize Snapple by introducing new products, redesigning its bottles and overhauling its distribution. But in a statement today, Quaker said Snapple’s performance “continues to fall short of expectations.” As a result, the company said it is conducting a review to determine whether it needs to reduce the value of the brand on its books. A charge of $500 million to $1 billion is possible, the company said.

The write-down would be one of the largest in the beverage industry and a black eye for Quaker, which faces investor unrest over earnings shortfalls. Quaker shares have tumbled more than 50% from their high in 1995, and some analysts have recommended that Quaker consider splitting up the company to unlock the value of its flagship brands like Gatorade sports drink and Cap’n Crunch cereal.

Snapple was one of Quaker's biggest acquisitions and a key part of its push into the then-fast-growing market for alternative beverages. But the deal was widely considered overpriced, even at the time, and Snapple’s sales have since flattened amid competition from many larger rivals. Last year, sales of Snapple beverages were $543 million, or about 3% of Quaker’s total revenue, down 15% from 1997.  

The write-down underscores how competitive and volatile the beverage business has become, as companies pay up for hot brands only to struggle when tastes change or competition intensifies.  

Some analysts said a large write-down of Snapple could actually help Quaker by allowing it to reduce the brand's drag on profits and pare down what many see as an unrealistic expectation for sales. But others said it highlights the seeming lack of progress in restructuring the division and casts further doubt on management's acquisition prowess. The battle for Quaker now will be to stabilize Snapple before competition and market pressures weigh even more heavily on the brand.
