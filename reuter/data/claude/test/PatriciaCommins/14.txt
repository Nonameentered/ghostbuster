Kellogg Co. Reports Profit for Fourth Quarter Despite Challenges in U.S. and British Cereal Markets 

Kellogg Co., the world's leading cereal maker, reported a fourth-quarter profit Thursday but revenue fell as sales declined in its biggest markets.

The Battle Creek, Mich.-based company earned $168 million, or 46 cents per share, in the three months ending Dec. 31. That was down from $839 million, or $2.38 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5 percent to $3.13 billion from $3.31 billion.

Kellogg has been struggling with slumping cereal sales in the U.S. and U.K., as consumers reach for more portable and convenient breakfast options. CEO Steven Cahillane has undertaken a multiyear effort to turn around those declining units, investing in rebranding and marketing while also diversifying into the snacks category.

In North America, revenue declined 7 percent to $2.2 billion. U.S. cereal sales were down 9 percent, as Kellogg continues to face competition from smaller brands touting organic or allergy-friendly alternatives. The category decline was offset by gains in snacks like Pringles chips and Cheez-It crackers, Cahillane said in a call with analysts. Kellogg aims to cut costs by $420 million a year through 2020 to offset those losses. 

The British market was even weaker, with revenue dropping 22 percent. A Brexit-induced economic downturn has dampened consumer spending. Sales in emerging markets rose 3 percent, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and India.

Some analysts were encouraged by the quarterly results and the early signs of a turnaround as cost cuts take hold and new products gain traction. But cereal remains an albatross, and others wondered if Kellogg's effort would be enough in the face of powerful macro trends.

"New product development and cost savings are helping margins, but the top line is still struggling,” said CFRA analyst Joe Agnese. “There’s no quick fix in a category that’s been declining for over a decade."

Kellogg expects 2020 organic net sales to decline 1 percent to 2 percent. Excluding the impact of divestitures and currency fluctuations, full-year earnings are forecast to grow 3 percent to 4 percent. “We're making progress,” Cahillane said. “But we have more work to do."
