Michael Foods Inc Considers Divesting Potato Operation, Including Frozen French Fries and Refrigerated Potatoes  

Michael Foods Inc, a producer and distributor of foodservice, retail, and food ingredients products, announced today that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its potato operation, including a potential sale of the business unit. The potato operation produces frozen french fries, refrigerated potato products, and dehydrated potato flakes. 

The potato unit, which generates approximately $500 million in annual revenue, includes production facilities in Idaho, Wisconsin, and Ontario. Michael Foods acquired the potato business in 2010 as part of a broader acquisition of Cargill's egg products and potato operations. While the egg products business has been a strong growth area for Michael Foods, the potato unit has faced increasing challenges in recent years.

"The potato category continues to see price deflation, excess supply, changing consumer tastes, and volatile crop costs," said Jeffrey Ettinger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Michael Foods. "Given these industry headwinds and our desire to focus on our core egg and egg products business, exploring strategic options for the potato unit is the prudent next step."

A sale of the potato operation could generate proceeds to help pay down debt and enable further investment in Michael Foods' higher-growth egg products unit. However, Ettinger cautioned that there was no certainty a transaction would be completed. "We will be disciplined in our evaluation of opportunities to determine the best path forward for maximizing shareholder value," he said.

Michael Foods, which is owned by Goldman Sachs' merchant banking division, has a portfolio of recognizable brands including Crystal Farms, AllWhites, and Better'n Eggs. In 2018, the company generated revenue of $2.6 billion and EBITDA of $330 million, of which the egg products unit contributed approximately 75%.

Analysts said a sale of the potato business could be a strategic positive for Michael Foods if completed at an attractive valuation. "The egg products unit appears poised to drive meaningful organic and acquisition-based growth over the coming years," said Benjamin P. Brown, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. "Simplifying the business to focus management's attention and capital allocation on that key area could unlock shareholder value over time."

Representatives from Michael Foods and Goldman Sachs either declined to comment or did not respond to requests seeking additional details about the potential sale. According to people familiar with the matter, the company has engaged Goldman Sachs to help explore strategic alternatives, which could include interest from private equity firms or existing potato industry players.
