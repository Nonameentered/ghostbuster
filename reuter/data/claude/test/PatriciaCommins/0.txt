Fast food restaurants unaffected by minimum wage increase, but long-term impact feared

Fast food restaurants have not seen a major impact on their profits or operations so far following the recent increase in the federal  minimum wage. However, some analysts fear there may be longer-term effects that could hurt the industry down the road.

Effective July 1, the federal minimum wage rose from $7.25 to $9.50 per hour, the first increase in over a decade. The restaurant industry, which employs a large number of minimum wage workers, was closely watched to see how companies would react to higher labor costs. According to reports from several major fast food chains, the immediate effect has been neutral to minimal. 

Burger King and Wendy's reported that their second quarter sales were up versus the same period last year, and that the wage increase had little impact on their bottom lines. Jack in the Box was slightly more circumspect, noting that profits were down but the reduction could not be conclusively attributed to minimum wage changes. “So far, the effect seems to be modest, but we’re only a few months in,” said Jack in the Box CEO Mark Murphy. 

However, some industry experts warn that the long-term impact on the fast food sector may be more significant. “Although we haven’t seen a crisis so far, quick serve restaurants rely on tight cost controls and relatively low price points,” said Bill Schrader, an analyst at Barclay’s Investment Bank. “Over time, the higher cost of labor may squeeze franchisees and make price hikes inevitable.” Those price increases, in turn, could cut into the popularity of fast food, especially among lower-income consumers.

For now, most companies appear to have been able to adapt without disruption by modestly increasing menu prices, improving productivity, and tapping into cost savings from reduced employee turnover. But as the minimum wage rises over the next several years to reach $15 per hour, the fast food industry’s ability to endure higher costs will be tested. Success may depend on their knack for doing more with less, even if it means permanently overhauling the long-held model of low prices and convenience on which the industry was built.
