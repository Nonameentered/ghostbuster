Ford Threatens to Halt Production at Three Plants Over Nine-Day Strike 

Ford Motor Company said today it will have to temporarily shut down production at three of its assembly plants if a strike by the United Auto Workers union continues for another week. The strike by about 49,000 UAW members has halted production at Ford for the past nine days. 

The affected assembly plants are Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant, Kentucky Truck Plant, and Kansas City Assembly Plant. Those facilities produce some of Ford's most profitable vehicles, including the F-150 pickup truck, Explorer SUV, and Transit van. A shutdown of those plants could impact Ford's bottom line if the strike continues and inventory of those vehicles runs low.

"The ongoing UAW strike has caused major disruptions to our daily operations," said Ford in a statement. "If the strike continues for another week, we will have to shut down Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant, Kentucky Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant."

The UAW went on strike against Ford on September 15, with workers walking off the job at the automaker's 55 facilities across the U.S. The union is demanding higher wages, more job security as Ford shifts to electric vehicles, and the closing of the wage gap between Ford's longest-tenured workers and more recent hires. Ford claims its workers are already paid at or above the industry standard. 

The strike is the largest against an automaker by the UAW in decades and marks the union's first walkout of Ford since 1976. Ford had a 79 day supply of F-Series pickups at U.S. dealers before the strike began, but follows just-in-time inventory practices for many of its other vehicles. A prolonged strike could mean tighter inventory and lost sales for Ford if it's unable to produce vehicles fast enough to meet customer demand.

Ford and the UAW returned to the negotiating table this week but have yet to reach a tentative agreement. Both sides are eager to end the strike as losses mount, but Ford must stand firm against agreeing to union demands it believes are unreasonable, analysts say. The strike is estimated to be costing Ford over $50 million per day in lost profits. For the 49,000 striking workers, it means no pay and less economic security the longer the walkout lasts.

Ending the first national strike against Ford in over four decades won't be easy. But with each day of lost production and profits, the urgency for a compromise is intensifying. Both Ford and the UAW will need to come to the table willing to sacrifice to end this work stoppage as quickly as possible. The alternative—a prolonged standoff—could be damaging to both the automaker and its workforce.
