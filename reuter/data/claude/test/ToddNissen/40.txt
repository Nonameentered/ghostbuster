MGM Grand Joins Local Leaders in Plan to Build Detroit Casino

MGM Grand, one of the largest casino operators in the world, announced today that it is joining forces with local business leaders and investors in Detroit to build a new $1.2 billion casino in downtown Detroit. The proposed casino resort, to be called MGM Grand Detroit, would become one the most prominent entertainment destinations in Michigan.

Local business leaders, including Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans and owner of multiple downtown Detroit properties, and Roger Penske, founder of Penske Corporation, have been working for several years to bring gambling to Detroit as a driver of tourism and economic activity. With backing from MGM Grand, the deal is now all but guaranteed to move forward. The group plans to break ground on the new casino resort in early 2022, with completion expected in late 2024.

The MGM Grand Detroit will feature a hotel with at least 500 rooms, a casino with 3,000 slot machines and 100 table games, a theater that will host A-list entertains, and a variety of dining options. The resort is expected to employ over 5,000 people when fully operational. Proponents argue it will lead to major investment in the city and boost tourism numbers downtown.

"This is a game-changer for Detroit," said Mayor Mike Duggan in a statement. "MGM Grand runs some of the best casino resorts in the world, and their decision to invest in Detroit is a sign that our comeback is real." The mayor noted that the new casino is expected to generate over $200 million per year in tax revenue for the city and state.

The project still needs final approvals from the Michigan Gaming Control Board, but local leaders expect few issues winning the necessary licenses given the operators' experience and reputation. Environmental groups have voiced some concerns about traffic and logistics downtown, but most observers believe the economic benefits outweigh such concerns. Overall, the MGM Grand Detroit seems poised to become yet another sign of the rebirth of downtown Detroit.
