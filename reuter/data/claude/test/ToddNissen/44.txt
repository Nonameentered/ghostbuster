Union Negotiations with American Axle Manufacturing Continue to Avoid Strike Impacting GM's U.S. Light Truck Production 

Negotiations between the United Auto Workers union and auto parts supplier American Axle and Manufacturing continue in Detroit this week as both sides work to avoid a strike that could disrupt production of General Motors' highly profitable light trucks. The current 4-year contract between American Axle and the UAW expired on February 26 and has been extended on an hour-by-hour basis as talks proceed.

A strike at American Axle could halt or slow production of GM's large SUVs and pickups, which are built in factories across the Midwest and generate the majority of GM's profits in North America. A walkout would also cut off American Axle's largest customer, which accounts for about 75 percent of its revenue. The company supplies axles, driveshafts and other components for GM's full-size pickups and SUVs.

The negotiations come as the broader U.S. auto industry faces slowing new vehicle sales after seven consecutive years of growth. GM's sales fell 2.5 percent last year but large pickups and SUVs have bucked the trend. The company has invested billions of dollars in recent years revamping its pickups and large SUVs, which analysts say remain critical to its bottom line.

The UAW’s lead negotiator on the American Axle talks said the union is seeking job security, wage increases and better healthcare benefits, especially for temporary workers. "Our members have been working hard for record profits and they deserve their fair share of the success they have helped create,” the union negotiator said.

A spokesman for American Axle said the company is offering annual pay raises as well as major investments that will secure its U.S. factories, which employ over 2,800 people at locations in Michigan and New York. But the company said its labor costs are already higher than competitors with non-union U.S. plants or those operating in Mexico. It said future wage increases must "keep the company competitive."

Negotiators were tight-lipped about the specifics of the talks but both sides expressed optimism a deal could still be reached. The current contract was originally set to expire September 25 but has been extended in short increments during negotiations. If a new agreement is not ratified, the UAW could call for workers to walk off the job, although that move could be at least a week away based on the contract extension periods so far. GM stock declined slightly on the news this week given the uncertainty around one of its key suppliers.
