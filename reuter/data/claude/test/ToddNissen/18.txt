Ford Motor Co. Reports 82% Fourth Quarter Profit Jump, Plans to Cut Costs in 1997  

Ford Motor Co. announced an 82 percent increase in fourth quarter profits today, boosted by strong sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. However, the automaker also warned that it will need to cut costs this year to offset pricing pressures. 

Ford said its net income in the October-December period rose to $1.2 billion, or $2.30 a share, from $664 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 4 percent to $41 billion from $39.4 billion.

The results capped Ford's third consecutive year of record earnings. For all of 1996, Ford's net income rose 15 percent to $6.57 billion, or $11.86 a share, from $5.72 billion, or $10.58 a share, in 1995. Revenue for 1996 increased 3.5 percent to $156.7 billion from $151.5 billion.

Ford's shares fell $1.50 to $32.875 in midday trading on the news, indicating that while Wall Street applauded the strong fourth quarter, investors remained concerned about challenges ahead.

In a conference call, Ford's chairman and chief executive, Jacques Nasser, warned that the company faces "significant cost issues" this year, including higher prices for steel and other commodities. As a result, Ford plans to cut $1 billion in costs this year by streamlining vehicle platforms, reducing excess manufacturing capacity overseas, and improving productivity.

"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us in 1997," Nasser said. He added that competitive pressures are making it difficult for Ford to raise vehicle prices, potentially cutting into profit margins.

In North America, Ford's operating profits rose 19 percent to $6.8 billion for 1996, bolstered by a strong product mix including brisk sales of Explorer sport utility vehicles, F-Series pickups and Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique sedans. Ford's North American market share held steady at 26 percent.

In South America, Ford earnings more than doubled to $344 million, aided by cost-cutting and strong sales of Fiesta subcompact cars in Brazil. But in Europe, Ford's profits fell 28 percent to $581 million amid a sluggish economy and increased competition.

Nasser said Ford's cost-cutting moves, which will eliminate 6,500 jobs in North America and 7,000 positions overseas, are aimed at boosting profits in Europe and other regions. “We have to be competitive in every part of the world,” Nasser said.

Ford's global automotive operations generated $4.4 billion in earnings for 1996 before taxes and special charges, up 17 percent from $3.77 billion in 1995. Ford's total worldwide vehicle sales rose 4 percent for the year to 7.6 million units.

The results “reflect our sound strategy of global diversification," Nasser said in a statement. He added that Ford is committed to achieving continued earnings growth and gains in global market share.
