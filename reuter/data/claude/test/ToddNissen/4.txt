Commuter Plane Crash in Snowy Field Kills 29, Investigators Face Frigid, Wind-Blown Conditions for Recovery 

A commuter plane carrying 29 passengers and crew crashed into a snowy field in rural Pennsylvania last night, killing everyone on board according to state police officials. Flight 742, operated by Regional Sky for United Airlines, crashed at around 8:15 pm local time, just 15 minutes after taking off from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport en route to Newark Liberty International Airport. 

The Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft crashed in a farmer’s field about five miles from the airport, scattering debris across hundreds of yards of snow-covered ground. “The crash site is a devastating scene. We have confirmed there were no survivors of this accident,” said Captain Greg Smith of the Pennsylvania State Police at a late-night press conference. The victims included 2 crew members and 27 passengers, including 3 children. The cause of the crash is still unknown, though early reports indicate the plane may have encountered wind shear or icy conditions during takeoff or ascent.

The frigid, windy conditions are hampering the initial recovery efforts. With winds gusting up to 35 miles per hour and temperatures dropping below 20 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, state police officers had to dig through layers of snow to locate pieces of wreckage and begin the grim process of recovering bodies. “The high winds have been blowing snow over much of the debris, and many small fragments of the plane are buried under drifts,” said Smith. The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team of 28 investigators to determine the likely cause of the crash, but their search is expected to take up to weeks to fully complete given the challenges from the severe weather.  

The tragedy has stunned the region. “We are all shocked and deeply saddened by this devastating plane crash and loss of life in our community,” said Janet Thomason, mayor of Wilkes-Barre, at an early-morning press conference. United Airlines has set up an emergency hotline for family members of those on board and is working with local hospitals and emergency management organizations to provide counseling and support. The last major US commercial aviation accident was in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed on approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport, killing 45 passengers and four crew members.
