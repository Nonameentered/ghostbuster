Federal-Mogul Corp. Plans Massive Restructuring, Cuts 2,900 Jobs

Federal-Mogul Corp., a major auto parts supplier, announced sweeping job cuts and plant closures as part of a massive restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs in the face of slumping new vehicle production.

The company plans to cut 2,900 positions worldwide, including 1,500 jobs at 14 plants slated for downsizing or closure. The moves are expected to reduce Federal-Mogul's annual costs by $200 million by the end of 2020. 

"Our cost structure has become disproportionate relative to the size of our business," CEO Dan Ninivaggi said in a statement. "We must take aggressive actions to align our capacity and costs with the realities of lower customer production volumes."

The cuts represent about 10 percent of Federal-Mogul's global workforce. Plants affected by the restructuring plan are located in the United States, Mexico, France, Germany, China, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Operations will cease at a piston plant in Ensley, Alabama and a sealing plant in Le Puy-en-Velay, France.

Federal-Mogul supplies parts such as engine pistons, ignition components, transmission parts, braking systems, chassis components, and lighting to major automakers worldwide, including Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Fiat Chrysler. But as sales and production volumes have declined for many vehicle manufacturers, Federal-Mogul has struggled under the weight of excess capacity.

"For several quarters now, we have experienced destocking in the supply chain and lower customer production schedules," Ninivaggi said. "We do not anticipate a rapid turnaround in market conditions."

The restructuring is expected to cost Federal-Mogul between $60 million and $70 million, primarily related to severance payments for laid-off employees. However, the company anticipates $200 million in annual cost savings through the program that will boost profitability and cash flow generation going forward.

Federal-Mogul was acquired by Tenneco Inc. last year, and the restructuring plan will make the supplier more aligned with its new parent company, Ninivaggi said. The job cuts and plant closures are scheduled to take place over the next 12 to 18 months. Employees at the affected locations were notified, and discussions with local works councils will be undertaken where required.

"Decisions that negatively impact people's lives are difficult but necessary to ensure the long-term success of the company," Ninivaggi said. "Federal-Mogul will treat all impacted employees with dignity and respect."
