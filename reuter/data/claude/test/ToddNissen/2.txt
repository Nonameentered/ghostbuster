Commuter Plane Crashes in Heavy Snowstorm Near Detroit, Killing All 30 on Board

A regional commuter plane crashed outside Detroit, Michigan during a heavy snowstorm on Saturday night, killing all 30 passengers and crew on board, according to authorities. 

Regional Express Flight 453 went down in a wooded area in the suburb of Bloomfield Hills shortly after taking off from Detroit Metropolitan Airport at 8:15 pm local time. The Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft was operated by Regional Express Airlines and was traveling to Minneapolis, Minnesota with 28 passengers and 2 pilots on board.

The National Weather Service reported that a band of heavy snow was moving through the Detroit area Saturday evening, reducing visibility to under a half mile at the time of the crash.  "This was without a doubt a tragic accident caused by severe weather conditions," said Captain Stan Marks, CEO of Regional Express Airlines, at a press conference. The pilots had over 20,000 hours of flying experience between them, according to Marks.

Search and rescue crews had difficulty reaching the crash site due to snow-covered roads and fallen trees. By the time they arrived, there were no survivors to be found. "With an impact of this magnitude, the chances of survival are virtually non-existent," said Dr. Ellen Carver, an aviation crash expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 

The plane was equipped with state-of-the-art avionics and had passed all recent inspections according to Marks. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board have launched an investigation to determine the exact cause of the accident. 

Airline officials have set up counseling services for victims' families and friends. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those lost," said Marks. The crash marks the deadliest U.S. commercial aviation accident since 2001 and the deadliest involving a Regional Express aircraft. The airline has launched a review of all flight operations during adverse weather conditions as a precaution.

The accident is a sobering reminder of the constant risks involved in air travel, even as global aviation safety has improved dramatically over the years. For now, many unanswered questions remain about what caused Regional Express Flight 453 to go down on a snowy night outside Detroit. Investigators hope that flight data and voice recorders, once recovered, may shed light on the last moments of the doomed plane.
