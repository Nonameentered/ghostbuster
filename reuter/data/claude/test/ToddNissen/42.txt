Union Negotiations to Avert General Motors Light Truck Production Paralysis at Midnight Deadline 

DETROIT â€” Negotiations between the United Automobile Workers union and General Motors continued late into the evening Tuesday as the deadline loomed for a possible worker strike that could bring GM's highly profitable light truck production lines to a halt.

The existing four-year contract between the UAW and GM expires at midnight. if a new multi-year agreement is not reached, nearly 50,000 UAW members are set to walk off their factory floor jobs as soon as Wednesday. Of greatest concern for both sides is GM's complex of assembly plants in Flint, Michigan that produce the automaker's most popular and lucrative models: the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups.

A strike by UAW members would paralyze GM's ability to produce its biggest moneymakers, costing the company an estimated $50 million per day and threatening to quickly balloon into a multibillion-dollar problem. For GM workers, a strike means missing out on weekly paychecks that average $1,200 before overtime.  

Heading into Tuesday, the sides remained apart on a number of critical issues including wages, the use of temporary workers, and GM's plans to potentially close up to four U.S. factories. In recent days, GM CEO Mary Barra visited two U.S. factories to underline the automaker's message that any deal must allow GM to remain "globally competitive" in the face of challenges like tariffs on imported auto parts and the rising costs of developing self-driving and electric vehicles.

The union has countered that GM's profits and market capitalization have surged since the taxpayer bailout of GM during the financial crisis, yet workers have not seen proportional increases in wages or profit-sharing checks. The UAW also wants GM to invest in U.S. plants and limit outsourcing jobs to Mexico and other countries with lower labor costs.

By 10 pm Tuesday, UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said talks would extend into the late evening as both sides made progress but a number of difficult issues remained unresolved. A GM spokesman also said significant differences need to be addressed before a tentative agreement can be reached. If a tentative deal is reached overnight, UAW leadership would still need to approve it before sending it to members for a ratification vote, a process that typically takes at least a week or two.
