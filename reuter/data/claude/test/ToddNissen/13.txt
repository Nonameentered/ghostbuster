Ford Wins Big as Lead-Off Negotiator with UAW, But at What Cost?

Ford Motor Co. was able to secure substantial concessions from the United Auto Workers union during recent contract negotiations, but the deals could come at the expense of workers and long-term competitiveness.

As the lead negotiator in talks with the UAW, Ford won big by getting the union to agree to keep many of the benefits concessions made during the recession. The new four-year contract calls for no wage increases for veteran workers, no reduction in health care premiums, and no additional annual bonuses. While this is a major win for Ford as it works to cut costs, it could hurt worker morale and Ford’s ability to attract and retain top talent down the road. 

The new contract also allows Ford to increase its use of temporary workers, who earn lower wages and fewer benefits. The deal raises the cap on temporary workers to 20% of Ford’s workforce from 10% previously. While this provides Ford more flexibility and lower costs, it creates a two-tier system that could pit permanent workers against temporary ones.

Ford was also able to avoid granting annual wage increases for veteran workers, instead providing modest $9,000 ratification bonuses. Annual wage increases were a sticking point in talks with Fiat Chrysler and General Motors, but Ford held firm and the UAW ultimately conceded. While this saves Ford money in the short term, stagnant wages could hurt worker retention and motivation over the four-year life of the contract.

The deal is a big win for Ford CEO Jim Hackett, who took over in May 2017 with a mandate to cut costs and improve Ford’s profitability. Ford’s talks with the UAW were seen as a key test for Hackett, and he was able to deliver cost savings and operational changes that far exceeded expectations. Still, Hackett must now balance continued cost-cutting with the need to invest in new products and technology to position Ford for long-term success.

Ford may have won this round of talks with the UAW, but the real impacts of the new labor contract won’t be known for years. If Ford is able to turn around its business and return to growth, the deal could be seen as a stroke of genius. But if Ford continues to struggle, the concessions made by workers this year could come back to haunt the company. Victory often comes with unintended consequences, and Ford’s win over the UAW may be no exception. Cost-cutting is important, but not at the expense of competitiveness. For Ford, it’s a delicate balancing act with a lot at stake.
