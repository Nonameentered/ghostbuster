Consumer Confidence in Airbag Safety Decreases, According to Market Research Firm Study 

A new report from ABC Market Research shows that consumer confidence in the safety of airbags has declined over the past year. The study found that only 56% of respondents felt "very confident" or "extremely confident" in the ability of airbags to properly deploy and protect vehicle occupants in the event of a crash. This is down from 63% in last year's survey.

The drop in confidence comes after a series of high-profile recalls of defective airbags made by major suppliers like Takata and ARC Automotive. Millions of airbags have been recalled in recent years due to risks that they could explode or misdeploy in a crash, potentially injuring vehicle occupants with shrapnel or by not inflating at all. While the recalls have been limited to specific makes, models, and years of vehicles, they seem to have rattled the general public's faith in airbag technology.

"It's understandable that people would have concerns after the scale of recent airbag recalls," said Jennifer Mills, an analyst at ABC Market Research. "However, airbags still save thousands of lives each year and, when working properly, do a very effective job of cushioning passengers and preventing injuries in a crash."

The study found consumer confidence in airbags was lowest among older respondents, parents of young children, and those who drive vehicles model years 2000 to 2010â€”the time period covering the defective airbags subject to recalls. Confidence was higher among younger drivers and those with vehicles newer than the 2010 model year.

Automakers and safety advocates are taking steps to reassure drivers about airbag safety. Newer vehicles feature advanced airbag systems with additional safety mechanisms to minimize risks of misdeployment or overreaction. Auto companies are also providing free inspections and repairs or replacements of recalled airbag inflators at authorized dealers. Regulators continue to investigate the root causes behind the defective airbags to prevent similar issues from arising again in the future.

The annual ABC consumer survey on auto safety covered 1,200 vehicle owners across the United States. The study has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.
