Chrysler Declares CarMax Franchise a Success One Year On

It has been one year since Chrysler launched its innovative partnership with used car retailer CarMax, allowing CarMax to become an official Chrysler franchise selling certified pre-owned vehicles. Chrysler has announced that the program has exceeded all first year sales targets and the company is looking to expand the model to additional markets. 

The CarMax partnership is an example of Chrysler's push to find new ways to reach customers outside of traditional dealership models. Under the franchise agreement, select CarMax locations feature dedicated Chrysler spaces to sell late-model used Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram vehicles that pass a rigorous 150-point inspection to become certified pre-owned. The locations also have Chrysler-trained agents to assist customers.

Chrysler reported that the 10 initial CarMax franchise locations sold over 15,000 used Chrysler vehicles in the first year, accounting for over $350 million in revenue. The most popular models were the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Customer satisfaction surveys found over 90% of buyers were happy with their experience and would recommend purchasing from the CarMax Chrysler franchise to others.

"The tremendous success of our CarMax pilot proves that customers want innovative new ways to browse and buy our vehicles," said Mark Stewart, Chief Operating Officer of Fiat Chrysler North America.  "By expanding the number of channels where people can shop for and purchase a Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep or Ram vehicle, we are making it as easy as possible for customers to join the Chrysler family."

CarMax CEO Bill Nash said the partnership with Chrysler has been a "win-win" for both companies. "CarMax is known for offering customers high quality used vehicles and a hassle-free buying experience with competitive prices. By adding factory-backed certified pre-owned Chrysler vehicles into the mix at some locations, we are giving our customers even more options and the peace of mind that comes with vehicle certification and warranty coverage."

Chrysler said it will expand the CarMax franchise model to 15 more locations by the end of the year, with further expansion planned for 2021. The company is also exploring similar innovative partnership opportunities with large used car retailers in countries outside the United States.
