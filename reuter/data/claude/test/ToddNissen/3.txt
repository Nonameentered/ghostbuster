Chrysler Reports Record-Breaking August Sales Fueled by Brisk Minivan and Pickup Truck Sales  

 Chrysler Motors capitalized on strong consumer demand for large vehicles and reported its best August sales month on record. The company said total sales for the month rose 14% from a year earlier to 197,779 vehicles, handily surpassing analysts' expectations.

The stellar results were fueled by banner demand for Chrysler's roster of minivans and pickup trucks. Sales of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan more than doubled over last August, while the Dodge Durango SUV and Ram pickup truck lines each posted gains of more than 30% versus a year ago.   

"Our Chrysler Pacifica and Ram pickup truck families continue to win over more and more new customers," said Chrysler's U.S. sales chief, Reid Bigland. "Demand for utility vehicles and pickup trucks in August helped Chrysler achieve its best sales for the month in 15 years.”

The results cement Chrysler's comeback in a competitive U.S. auto market where sales of traditional cars have slumped in favor of larger vehicles. The company discontinued most of its unprofitable sedan models over the past several years to focus on the types of vehicles now dominating the roads—minivans, SUVs and pickups.

That product shift looks prescient in light of current trends. Total minivan sales in the U.S. rose 11% last month, while pickup trucks gained 4.4% and SUV sales climbed 8.1%, according to industry research firm Autodata Corp.

Chrysler's Ram pickup truck sales jumped 34% in August on higher demand for the brand's popular light- and heavy-duty models. The Pacifica minivan more than doubled its August 2018 sales total, as an all-new model of the family hauler launched last year continues gaining traction. And the Durango SUV posted a 32% gain for its best August result since 2005.

The strong results from Chrysler helped offset continued struggles at the company's Dodge brand, where sales declined 24% in August amid slumping demand for performance-oriented sedans like the Charger and Challenger. The company also no longer sells vehicles under its Fiat brand in America.

Chrysler's big pickup trucks and utility vehicles are also more profitable, helping pad the bottom line. The company is expected to report improved earnings for the third quarter when those results are released in October. With interest rates declining, affordable fuel prices and a solid economy providing support, the final months of 2019 are shaping up well for Chrysler and other large vehicle manufacturers.
