Ford Sales Drop 6.3% in August, Taurus Loses Out to Honda Accord

Ford Motor Company reported August U.S. sales fell 6.3% compared to the same month last year, extending its decline for the second straight month this year. The company sold 213,795 vehicles in August, down from 228,386 in August 2018. The slump was led by a double-digit drop in sales of Ford's Taurus sedan, which has struggled to compete with the Honda Accord and other rival midsize sedans. 

The sales decline was slower than the 11% drop in July but steeper than analysts had expected. Ford's stock price dipped 2% in early trading following the announcement. "We continued to gain traction in the second half of the month, but the industry faced headwinds as consumer confidence declined amid volatile stock markets and economic uncertainty," said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service.

The Taurus full-size sedan posted a 17.8% decline in sales to just 7,209 vehicles sold. By comparison, the Honda Accord sold 27,785 units in August, down 9.4% but still nearly four times the Taurus total. The Taurus has been outsold by the Accord for over 20 years now and Ford last redesigned the vehicle for the 2017 model year. The 2020 redesign of the Ford Fusion midsize sedan has also likely contributed to declining interest in the now-dated Taurus.

Not all the news was bad for Ford, however. The F-Series line of pickup trucks remained the sales leader and posted a modest 1.1% gain to 72,157 trucks sold. The Expedition full-size SUV also saw a strong increase of 20.7% to 8,030 vehicles. Combined sales of Ford's SUV models were up 6.6% overall compared to a year ago. Ford's Lincoln luxury brand posted an 8.5% increase, driven by higher sales of the Nautilus and Aviator SUV models.

Despite the second consecutive monthly decline, Ford's total U.S. sales through the first eight months of 2019 are still up 1.0%. However, analysts caution that growth may be harder to come by in the months ahead if consumer confidence continues to weaken and competitors launch compelling new models. Ford's car-heavy model line in need of new products could make it difficult for Ford to reverse the recent sales slide without some fresh updates, they said. Whether a redesign of the Ford Taurus is in the cards remains uncertain. For now, the Honda Accord appears poised to solidify its place as the prominent choice for buyers in the midsize sedan segment.
