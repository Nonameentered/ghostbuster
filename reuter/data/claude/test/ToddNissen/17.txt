Ford Refuses Non-Union Made Seats in Support of Striking Johnson Control Inc. Workers

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will not accept replacement car seats from non-union suppliers as Johnson Controls Inc. workers continue their strike. The United Auto Workers union has been on strike at Johnson Controls seat component plant in Plymouth, Michigan since early October fighting for higher wages and improved benefits. 

With the strike now in its fourth week, many analysts expected Ford would turn to other seat suppliers to avoid plant slowdowns and shutdowns that could impact vehicle production and delivery schedules. However, in a show of support for the striking workers, Ford has not solicited bids from non-union seat makers and said they will wait for Johnson Controls and UAW to come to an agreement to end the strike.

"Ford stands with the UAW in their efforts to achieve fair wages and benefits for their members," said John Path, Ford's Vice President of Purchasing in a statement. "While this strike impacts our operations, we will not undermine the bargaining process by seeking alternate, non-union suppliers for these components."

The strike by nearly 2,000 workers at the Plymouth seat plant began October 5th when Johnson Controls and UAW could not come to terms on a new 4-year contract. Key issues in the negotiations are wage increases, healthcare costs, and working conditions according to UAW representatives. Workers argue that they deserve higher compensation after Johnson Controls reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue growth over the past year.

Johnson Controls is the primary supplier of seats for Ford vehicles produced in the U.S. and Canada. The Plymouth plant makes components including seat frames, foam, and seat covers which are then assembled into completed seats at just-in-time facilities at Ford plants. Without the components from Plymouth, Ford risks halting production of some of its most popular vehicles including the F-150 pickup truck, Explorer SUV, and Fusion sedan.

So far, the strike has forced shorter workweeks at some Ford facilities but has not led to any complete closures. Still, the longer the strike lasts the more pressure mounts on both sides to solve key differences and get workers back on the assembly line. Ford's stance in support of the UAW workers is seen as adding leverage to the union's position in pushing Johnson Controls to meet demands and end the strike quickly with an agreement more favorable to employees.
