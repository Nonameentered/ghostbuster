Federal-Mogul Corp. to Restructure, Slash Jobs and End Auto Parts Retail Ambitions  

Federal-Mogul Corp., a major auto parts supplier, announced plans today to restructure its operations, cut jobs, and exit the retail auto parts business. The company said it would cut over 3,000 jobs, approximately 15% of its global workforce, and close or sell more than 100 company-owned auto parts stores across the United States. 

The restructuring is aimed at reducing costs and improving profitability for the company, which is based in Southfield, Michigan. Federal-Mogul has been facing increasing price pressure from low-cost overseas competitors and declining sales at many of its retail stores. The company expects the restructuring to save more than $200 million annually.

“We have to make some difficult but necessary changes to ensure Federal-Mogul’s long-term success,” said CEO Rainer Jueckstock in a statement. “Restructuring our retail business and consolidating some manufacturing capacity will allow us to operate more efficiently and better serve our global original equipment and aftermarket customers.”

The job cuts will affect workers across North America, Europe, and Asia, including 850 positions in the United States. The company said it would shutter 45 retail stores immediately, with more locations potentially closing over the next year. Federal-Mogul currently operates around 275 owned or affiliated parts stores, mostly under the brand names Speedy Auto Parts, Auto Pride, and Parts Depot. 

The restructuring plan also includes the sale of Federal-Mogul’s brake parts business, which produces components like brake pads, rotors, and calipers. The company said it is seeking buyers for plants that manufacture brake parts in Kentucky, Mexico, France, and China. If buyers cannot be found, some locations may be closed.

Federal-Mogul supplies parts like pistons, spark plugs, brake components, and chassis components to automakers and automotive aftermarket retailers around the world. The company was acquired in 2018 by investment firm Tenneco Inc. for $5.4 billion but continues to operate as an independent division. Tenneco said it supports the restructuring plans, which it believes will improve Federal-Mogul’s long-term growth and profitability.

The restructuring announcement came as Federal-Mogul reported a 5% drop in revenue for its most recent quarter compared to a year ago. The company’s retail and brake businesses have been a drag on performance, even as its primary powertrain and motor parts divisions have stayed steady or improved. The job cuts and business exits aim to remedy those lagging segments so Federal-Mogul can focus on its core areas of expertise, according to executives.

With the restructuring moves, Federal-Mogul aims to stabilize its business after several years of lackluster results and ensure its viability as a key supplier to automakers as the auto industry itself experiences major changes. The overhaul is a risky but necessary strategy, analysts said, that could position the company for stronger growth if executed properly. Still, the business exits and job losses will likely hamper Federal-Mogul’s operations in the short-term before any turnaround takes hold.
