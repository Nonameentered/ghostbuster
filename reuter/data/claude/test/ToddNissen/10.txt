Federal Investigators Confirm Delta Comair Crew Tried to Shut Off Engine and Fire Extinguisher System 

Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board confirmed today that the crew of Delta Comair flight 1814 attempted to shut off one of the plane's engines and disable the fire extinguisher system during their flight from Atlanta to Dallas last week.

In a briefing with reporters, NTSB officials said data from the flight recorder and cockpit voice recorder showed that around 40 minutes into the flight, the captain instructed the first officer to "pull the fire handle" in response to smoke in the cockpit and cabin. Doing so would have shut off the engine and disabled the fire extinguishing system for that engine. However, the first officer questioned that decision and did not do so.

Moments later, the smoke intensified and the crew declared an emergency, preparing passengers for a possible evacuation upon landing. Thanks to the quick thinking of the first officer, a potentially catastrophic in-air fire was avoided. 

"Disabling critical safety mechanisms during an active fire is extremely dangerous and against standard operating procedures," said NTSB head Jennifer Smith. "Thanks to the appropriate response of the first officer, this incident did not end in disaster."

The flight landed safely 20 minutes later in Dallas, where passengers were evacuated and no major injuries were reported. Though the source of the smoke remains under investigation, initial findings point to an overheated bleed air valve that provides pressurized air from the engines to the cabin.  

In the aftermath of the incident, Delta pledged to review training procedures to ensure crew compliance with emergency checklists for onboard smoke and fire events. The captain and first officer of the flight have been placed on paid leave pending results of Delta's internal review.
