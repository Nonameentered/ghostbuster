American Axle & Manufacturing reaches tentative contract with UAW minutes before strike deadline, sparing GM from potential work stoppage

Detroit, MI - American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. reached a tentative labor agreement with the United Auto Workers union just minutes before a midnight strike deadline on Sunday, averting a potential work stoppage that could have disrupted operations at General Motors Co. 

According to a joint statement from American Axle and the UAW, the tentative four-year deal covers about 3,800 hourly workers at American Axle facilities in Michigan and New York. The UAW confirmed that negotiators came to the agreement at 11:58 pm, just two minutes before the union's deadline to either reach a deal or call for workers to walk off the job.

The deal is subject to ratification by UAW members, the union said, with voting on the agreement scheduled to happen later this week. If approved by workers, the new contract will replace the existing labor deal that expired at midnight on Saturday.

A strike at American Axle would have impacted its largest customer, GM, which sources various key driveline and chassis components from the supplier for its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles produced in the U.S. and Canada. A strike would have caused production disruptions for GM within a day or two due to the tight integration of its operations with suppliers. 

In a statement, American Axle CEO David Dauch said: "We are pleased that we were able to come to an agreement with the UAW that is satisfactory to both sides. I appreciate the efforts of the UAW leadership and negotiation teams who worked with our team in good faith to get this deal done."

UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada, who directs the union's American Axle department, said the agreement "provides members working at AAM fair wages, good benefits and good working conditions while also respecting the importance of the AAM-GM supply chain relationship."

American Axle was spun off from GM in 1994 and operates its business under long-term agreements with North American auto manufacturers, including GM. Its products include axles, suspension components, chassis modules, and all-wheel-drive transfer cases used in light trucks, SUVs, and passenger cars.

Shares of American Axle rose over 3% in pre-market trading on news of the tentative agreement which avoids a major uncertainty for investors. GM stock also rose nearly 2% on the labor development with a key supplier.
