Six Striking Unions Offer Unconditional Return to Detroit Papers in Bid for Fair Contract 

In an effort to restart stalled contract negotiations, six unions representing more than 2,000 striking newspaper employees offered today to return to work unconditionally at the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News. The unions have been on strike since August, causing major disruptions in the delivery of both papers.

The unions made the unconditional offer in a letter to the newspapers’ parent companies, Gannett Co. and Knight Ridder Inc. The offer comes two weeks after the papers began publishing again with nonunion employees and contractors. “We want to show our good faith and desire to have honest discussions about a fair contract,” said Joe Louis, president of the striking Newspaper Guild. 

The strike began after months of unproductive contract talks failed to yield an agreement to replace contracts that expired in July. The striking unions, which also include pressmen, teamsters, and mailers, are seeking pay raises and protections from job reductions they expect the companies to seek. The papers claim they need more flexibility and cost savings as the industry grapples with declining circulation and advertising revenue.

Within hours, the newspapers’ management rejected the unions’ offer, saying that after 10 weeks they have developed a new production and delivery system using non-striking employees and contractors, and they saw no need to reinstate the striking workers. “While we appreciate the gesture, at this point it does not make business sense to re-integrate the former employees into our operations,” said John Barry, a spokesman for the Detroit News.

The unions had hoped the unconditional offer would spur good-faith bargaining and head off potential action by the newspapers to hire permanent replacements for the striking workers. The National Labor Relations Act allows employers to hire permanent replacements after 12 weeks of a strike. The spurned offer now raises the prospect of a prolonged standoff that could inflict lasting damage.

“They left us no choice, so this will likely become a war of attrition,” said Louis of the Newspaper Guild. “But these newspapers will never be the same without us, and at some point they have to realize that.” Management remains confident in its position. “We have re-built an efficient model for producing and distributing the newspapers without the striking unions, and we intend to keep it that way,” Barry said.

The outcome of this high-stakes standoff in Detroit is being closely watched by industry observers. Union leaders warn that defeat here will embolden media companies across the country to take harsh stands against unions. But management argues they must have flexibility to cut costs as they compete for readers and advertising with digital media. With no negotiations currently scheduled, the resolution of this Detroit newspaper strike remains very much in doubt.
