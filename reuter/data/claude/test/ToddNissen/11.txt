GM's $5.1 Billion Purchase of Hughes Aircraft Co: A Mixed Verdict 12 Years Later 

Twelve years after General Motors acquired Hughes Aircraft Company for $5.1 billion, the deal receives a mixed verdict. GM purchased Hughes, a defense and aerospace contractor, in 1985 to diversify beyond the automotive industry. At the time, GM executives believed Hughes' electronics and satellite expertise could be leveraged for automotive applications like navigation systems. However, integrating the very different companies proved challenging and for years Hughes struggled under GM's ownership.

GM had high hopes for Hughes and invested over $3 billion in it during the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, Hughes' defense contracting business declined after the Cold War ended. Its commercial ventures like satellite television and mobile phones were slow to take off. Hughes accumulated nearly $4 billion in losses over six years, putting a strain on GM. 

In the mid-1990s, GM considered selling Hughes but then CEO Jack Smith decided to revamp Hughes' management instead. He appointed former GM executive Rick Wagoner to lead Hughes. Under Wagoner's leadership, Hughes streamlined operations and returned to profitability by 1997. It also began developing its successful satellite television service, DirecTV, which now has over 13 million subscribers.

DirecTV's success prompted GM to decide to spin off Hughes in 2003 through an initial public offering. The move aimed to boost GM's stock price and earn favor with Wall Street. The spinoff proved well-timed, as Hughes was then sold to News Corp just months later for $6.6 billion, netting GM a $2.5 billion gain. 

GM's long and complicated ownership of Hughes highlights the challenges of diversification into technologically sophisticated and capital-intensive industries. While GM likely overpaid for Hughes in 1985, it ultimately profited from a key business it developed and held onto through years of struggles and transition. The deal serves as a lesson in long-term thinking and patience for large companies seeking strategic transformations. Overall, despite a mixed experience for much of the 12 years, GM's acquisition of Hughes proved pivotal to its legacy and financial success.
