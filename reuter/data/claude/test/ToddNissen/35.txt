Ford to Idle Production Lines as Talks Continue to Settle Dispute with United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will idle production at several of its North American plants for one week starting Monday as contract talks between the automaker and the United Auto Workers union drag on past an expired agreement. 

The temporary plant closures will impact approximately 15,000 UAW workers at Ford's assembly plants in Chicago, Louisville, and Kansas City as well as engine and transmission factories in Ohio and Indiana. Ford officials said the shutdowns are necessary to match supply with demand as inventory levels rise due to the ongoing labor negotiations. 

Talks between Ford and the UAW were extended past a Saturday night deadline after the two sides failed to reach a tentative agreement on key issues like wages, health care benefits, and the use of temporary workers. The UAW has demanded higher pay and greater job security for both full-time and part-time workers, while Ford is pushing to cut costs to better compete with foreign-based automakers operating non-union plants in the U.S. South.

Ford's chief rival General Motors reached a deal with UAW negotiators last week, but the union has balked at rubber-stamping an agreement with Ford that mirrors the GM terms. UAW leaders want Ford to narrow the gap in labor costs between it and GM, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 with lower costs and greater flexibility to outsource jobs. The labor dispute is also complicating Ford's joint venture with auto parts supplier Johnson Controls, which employs 3,900 UAW members at a dozen Ford facilities.

Both sides expressed optimism a deal could still be reached to avoid a prolonged work stoppage. The last major strike against Ford was in 1976 and lasted 66 days. Ford stock declined 1.2% on the news of the production shutdown amid worries a strike could dent the company's profits. U.S. vehicle sales are softening after four years of growth, and a walkout could further curb demand for Ford's most popular trucks and SUVs.
