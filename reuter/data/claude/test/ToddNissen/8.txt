Investigation Continues into "Unexplained Event" Prior to Deadly Delta Comair Crash

Federal investigators are looking into an unexplained event that preceded the deadly crash of Delta Connection Flight 5191 on Sunday. The Comair Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet crashed during takeoff from Lexington's Blue Grass Airport, killing 49 of the 50 people on board. 

According to initial data from the plane's flight data recorder, the pilots reported a loss of power in the right engine during takeoff. However, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also noted "a loss of airspeed indications" reported by the pilots just prior to the accident. The nature and cause of this unexplained event remains unknown at this time. Investigators are analyzing recordings and data from the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to determine the sequence of events leading up to the crash.

The plane had slowed to 30 knots before lifting off the runway, far below the minimum required takeoff speed, before eventually stalling and crashing just beyond the runway. Witnesses reported seeing the plane struggling to gain altitude before veering off to the left and crashing into a nearby field. Thunderstorms were reported in the area around the time of the crash, but investigators have not yet determined if weather was a factor. 

NTSB officials have alerted other regional air carriers about the unexplained loss of airspeed indications reported by the Comair pilots. Although the cause is still being probed, a failure in the plane's pitot static system, which measures airspeed, is one possibility investigators are exploring. The investigation is expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete a final report determining the probable cause of the accident. 

The sole survivor of the crash was the co-pilot, James Polehinke, who was pulled from the burning wreckage by emergency responders. Polehinke has been unable to assist investigators so far due to the severity of his injuries. Doctors have upgraded his condition from critical to serious. Friends and family are hoping that Polehinke may be able to provide more details about the unexplained events in the cockpit that could provide further clues to investigators about what went tragically wrong with Flight 5191.
