Auto Industry Lobbyist Predicts Improved Working Relationship with Congress Under Clinton  

The leading auto industry lobbyist predicted that the auto sector would have a more constructive working relationship with Congress and federal regulators under President-elect Hillary Clinton’s administration compared to the often contentious interactions under President Obama.

Bill Vondrasek, the head of the American Automotive Association, stated that the auto industry shares more policy positions and views  with Clinton and her team compared to the outgoing Obama administration. “We anticipate that a Clinton administration would be open to finding common ground and solutions that work for both industry and environmental interests, rather than imposing unrealistic mandates and regulations,” Vondrasek said in an interview.

The auto industry has clashed with the Obama administration over fuel efficiency standards, emission reduction requirements, and other environmental regulations in recent years. The companies argue that the aggressive targets set by Obama will increase costs, reduce choice for consumers, and threaten auto sector jobs. Clinton has signaled she will continue to make environmental progress on vehicle standards but at a more moderate pace that provides longer timelines and accounts for industry concerns.

Vondrasek noted Clinton’s long track record of supporting the auto industry, especially when she served as a U.S. senator from New York. “She understands the importance of the auto industry to the economy and the role it plays in people's lives,” he said. The trade association will continue to advocate for policies such as tax incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, funding for retraining displaced workers, and infrastructure spending on roads and charging stations.  

Environmental groups criticized Vondrasek’s comments and said the auto industry must move faster to develop and deploy zero-emission vehicles to meet the pressing challenge of climate change. They plan to pressure Clinton not to slow down or weaken the progress made under Obama. With a divided Congress, Clinton will have to navigate competing interests from both industry and environmental stakeholders. The future of automotive regulations will depend on her ability to find pragmatic solutions in a politically fractious environment. Overall, the auto industry seems optimistic that Clinton will be a more cooperative partner in the White House compared to her predecessor. The next four years will determine whether that optimism is warranted or misplaced.
