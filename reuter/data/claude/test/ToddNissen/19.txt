General Motors Corp. Q4 Earnings Fall More Than Half Due to Labour Strife

General Motors Corp reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday as a lengthy strike by the United Auto Workers union crimped vehicle production and squeezed profits.

The Detroit-based automaker said net income plunged more than half to $1.38 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $3.04 billion, or $1.40 per share a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, GM earned 95 cents per share, falling short of Wall Street estimates of $1.19, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue in the quarter declined 5% to $30.83 billion, compared with market expectations of $31.12 billion.

The results underscore the financial impact of the UAW's 40-day national strike against GM, the longest walkout in nearly 50 years. The work stoppage shut down all of GM's North American production and delayed the rollout of several high-margin vehicles in the U.S. market.

"The impact of the work stoppage in the fourth quarter was significant, but we had excellent support from our suppliers and other key partners to quickly ramp back up our manufacturing operations while maintaining high quality," Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement.

The strike cost GM about 300,000 units of vehicle production and $3.6 billion in lost pretax profit, the company said. GM said it would not recover the lost production this year.

Shares of GM, which had risen earlier in the day as investors bet the worst was already over, slipped 0.6% to $34.60 in after-hours trading. Going into Thursday, GM's shares had climbed more than 10% since the beginning of the year.

GM's results serve to highlight the huge costs to both the company and its workers from the historic standoff with the UAW. The union waged its longest national strike in nearly 50 years against GM in a battle over healthcare costs, higher pay, increased share of profit sharing and job security.

The two sides ultimately agreed to a new four-year-collective bargaining contract that ended the strike, providing an immediate 4% wage rise and 3% lump-sum payment. The deal included provisions to drop a percentage of healthcare costs and shorten the progression to top pay. Newer hires with less seniority would be covered by a new wage schedule with higher healthcare premiums.
