Ford Motor Co.'s Fourth Quarter Profit Soars by 82% to $1.2 Billion  

Ford Motor Company reported its fourth quarter 2018 earnings today, showing a big jump in profits from the same period last year. The iconic American automaker earned a net income of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 82% from the last three months of 2017. Revenue also rose by 5% to $41.8 billion.

The strong results were driven by Ford's North American operations, which benefited from high demand for the company's highly profitable SUVs and pickup trucks like the Explorer, Expedition, F-Series, and Ranger. Ford's U.S. sales of new vehicles were up 4% in the quarter compared to a year earlier. The company has also been cutting costs, which helped boost profits. Ford's operating margin in North America reached 8.7% in the fourth quarter, the highest in over a decade.

Outside of North America, Ford's performance was more mixed. In Europe, the company lost $267 million as sales declined due to Brexit concerns and economic uncertainty. But in China, Ford's largest market outside the U.S., profits rose by $300 million to $756 million on the strength of record sales of Ford and Lincoln brand luxury vehicles. Sales in China were up over 25% from a year ago.

For the full year 2018, Ford earned $3.7 billion in net income, down by over 50% from 2017 due to restructuring charges and losses in international markets. Revenue, however, increased 2% to $160.3 billion, a new record. Ford expects profits and revenue to increase this year as a massive restructuring and cost-cutting program begins to pay off. The company is eliminating thousands of jobs in Europe, China, and South America to improve profit margins. Ford is also investing $11 billion to develop 16 fully electric vehicles that it will bring to market by 2022.

CEO Jim Hackett said Ford finished 2018 with momentum that will carry over into this year. "We enter 2019 with optimism for further progress," he said during a call with analysts and media. The fourth quarter results show Ford making significant progress in Hackett's plan to boost profits and secure Ford's future during a time of rapid technological change in the global auto industry.
