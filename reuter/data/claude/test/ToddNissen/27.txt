Traditional Dealers Poised to Grab More of Used Car Market, Says NADA Economist

The used vehicle market is projected to set another sales record in 2022, topping 42 million vehicles for the first time, according to a leading auto industry economist. But franchised new car dealers are poised to make the biggest relative gains. 

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), said used vehicle supply shortages that have persisted through much of 2021 have started to ease. That will give traditional dealers, who have large used vehicle inventories, a competitive advantage over other used vehicle outlets that have struggled with limited supply.

“New car dealers have a built-in advantage with a steady flow of lease returns and trade-ins,” Smoke said. “They also have long-established reconditioning and certification processes that give customers confidence in the vehicles they’re buying.”

Used vehicle sales rose 13% in the first half of 2021, even as new vehicle sales dropped due to microchip shortages that hampered new vehicle production. But used supply tightened, with wholesale auction prices spiking. Many independent used lots and private buyers had trouble sourcing inventory. 

That’s now turning around, according to Smoke. “We’re seeing used supply rise and wholesale prices retreat from their peaks,” he said. “With more vehicles available, especially newer models coming off lease, dealers will increase their share of the market at the expense of private buyers and independent lots.”

The economist forecasts franchised dealers will sell 22.6 million used vehicles this year, up 4.4% from last year. That would give them a 56% market share, the largest since at least 2014. Meanwhile, private buyer sales may decline 8% to 12.5 million and independent used sales rise just 1.5% to 6.9 million, for a combined 44% market share.
