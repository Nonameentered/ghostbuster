Federal-Mogul Corp aims to pay off $185 million in debt, undergo restructuring and eye acquisitions in 1997

auto parts supplier Federal-Mogul Corp announced plans to pay off $185 million of high-yield debt and restructure its operations to improve profitability, setting the stage for potential acquisitions next year.

The Southfield, Michigan-based company will use proceeds from the $300 million sale of its T&N Group auto parts division to pay off the debt. The restructuring will involve closing some underperforming plants, consolidating facilities and reducing employee headcount.

“These moves will enhance our operating efficiency, lower costs and position us to pursue selective strategic acquisitions as we head into 1997,” said Chairman and CEO Donald Sprague.

Federal-Mogul reported flat sales and earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter, missing analyst expectations of $1.21 per share. The results reflect weak demand for aftermarket auto parts as well as declining original equipment sales to auto makers.

The sale of the T&N Group to Federal-Mogul’s British rival T&N PLC is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. The division makes replacement gaskets, pistons, valves and other engine components, but has lagged Federal-Mogul’s other units in profitability and growth.

Proceeds from the sale will be used to eliminate $185 million of debt from Federal-Mogul’s balance sheet, saving $21 million in annual interest costs. The restructuring is expected to generate $50 million in cost savings next year and $75 million in 1998.

“Reducing our debt and achieving greater operating efficiencies were necessary strategic moves that will provide immediate benefits as well as flexibility for partnerships or acquisitions going forward,” Sprague said.

Federal-Mogul expects U.S. auto sales to remain flat or decline slightly next year, continuing pressure on both its original equipment and aftermarket sales. The restructuring plan is aimed at improving the company’s performance even in a lackluster market. Federal-Mogul’s stock rose 38 cents to $21.13 per share on the news.
