Toyota Launches 1998 Sienna, Described as the "Camry of Minivans"  

Toyota today revealed its new Sienna minivan, launching it as a 1998 model that company executives hope will make Toyota a major player in the minivan market. Currently dominated by Chrysler, the minivan segment is a crucial one for any mainstream automaker. Toyota is aiming for the heart of the market, dubbing the Sienna as the “Camry of minivans”—a reference to Toyota's popular midsize sedan.

“We wanted to build a minivan that appeals to a wide range of customers in the way the Camry sedan has done so well,” said Yoshimi Inaba, president of Toyota Motor Sales, USA. “The Sienna offers outstanding quality, reliability, and value in an attractive package. We believe it will resonate with both current minivan owners and those looking to buy their first minivan.”  

The Sienna shares underpinnings with the Camry platform but has unique styling that is modern yet conservative. It seats up to eight occupants and is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 200 horsepower, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Toyota emphasizes the Sienna's car-like driving dynamics, convenience features, and safety technologies which include standard anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags.

With a base price of $23,960, the Sienna spans six trim levels from a basic CE model up to the $31,000 XLE. Standard equipment on the CE includes power windows, locks, and mirrors; cruise control; tilt steering; and a CD player. Moving up through the line adds amenities like dual zone climate control, leather seats, rear seat audio controls, and an onboard navigation system.  

Toyota has modest sales expectations for the Sienna in its first year, aiming for about 70,000 units which would capture roughly 15 percent of the minivan market. However, analysts think the Sienna has the potential to fare even better based on Toyota’s reputation for vehicle quality, reliability and resale value. Derek Kreindler, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said, “Toyota has a real opportunity to make inroads with customers looking for those attributes in a minivan. If the Sienna lives up to typical Toyota standards, it will make a formidable new entry in this segment.”  

Toyota will assemble the Sienna at its manufacturing facility in Princeton, Indiana. It goes on sale at Toyota dealers nationwide in September. The company is optimistic the Sienna can emulate the success of its full-size Tundra pickup and further Toyota's goal to offer a full range of passenger vehicles to American car buyers.
