Chevrolet Aims to Cut New Car Buying Time to 90 Minutes with New Standards to Improve Customer Experience  

Chevrolet announced new standards aimed at dramatically improving the customer experience during new vehicle purchases, with a goal of reducing the average time it takes to buy a new vehicle to 90 minutes or less. The new standards, called the "Triple 90" experience, focus on key steps of the purchase process including vehicle selection, financing paperwork, and delivery of the new vehicle.  

“We know that buying a new vehicle can be a time-consuming process, often several hours. We want to change that and make it an enjoyable, efficient experience for our customers,” said Bob Kraut, Chevrolet's Vice President of Customer Experience. “With standards like a 90-minute maximum for the entire purchase process, early paperwork completion, and proactively addressing customer questions, we can transform a visit to a Chevrolet dealership into an easy, satisfying experience.”

Vehicle selection time will be reduced by encouraging customers to complete pre-visit research on Chevrolet's website to identify preferred models in advance. Chevrolet sales staff will also proactively address common questions to minimize time spent determining options and test driving vehicles. Financing paperwork, often the most time-consuming part of the buying process, will be streamlined by allowing customers to start the paperwork online or through an app before visiting the dealer. Delivery of the new vehicle will be prioritized to complete the purchase experience as quickly as possible.

Chevrolet piloted some of these new standards at select dealerships across the U.S. and Canada, receiving very positive feedback from customers. "It was the easiest, most hassle-free vehicle purchase I've ever experienced," said Jake Thompson, a new Chevrolet Equinox owner in Houston, TX.  "I spent maybe 20-30 minutes at the most completing paperwork and left with my new SUV the same day. Chevrolet really delivered on their promise of an easy, 90-minute buying experience."  

Chevrolet will begin implementing the Triple 90 standards at all Chevrolet dealerships in the U.S. and Canada starting October 1 this year. “Our goal is to set a new industry benchmark for customer satisfaction and convenience during the vehicle purchase process,” said Kraut. “We want everyone's next Chevrolet to be the easiest vehicle they've ever bought.” The new standards are part of Chevrolet's "Find New Roads" campaign to improve the overall customer experience. Chevrolet aims for the Triple 90 experience to make the buying process as hassle-free as possible and get customers into their new vehicles as quickly as possible.
