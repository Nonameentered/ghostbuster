Negotiations Continue to Avert Auto Supplier Strike at American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. 

Automotive parts supplier American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. continues to negotiate with the United Auto Workers union to avoid a strike at its plants in the U.S. and Mexico. The two sides have been in talks for months to reach a new four-year labor contract for about 3,600 UAW-represented employees at AAM, which supplies axles, driveshafts and other products to major automakers like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.

The existing contract between AAM and the UAW expired Feb. 24, but workers have remained on the job as negotiations progress. However, the UAW said its members voted last month to authorize a strike if a new deal isnâ€™t reached. A walkout could disrupt AAM's operations and force temporary shutdowns at some assembly plants that use the company's components.

AAM said it is proposing wage increases and lump-sum payments in a new contract, but health-care costs are also an issue. The UAW wants AAM to narrow the gap in health costs between newer hires and longer-tenured employees. The union said its members deserve a fair share of the profits as the company's sales and earnings have grown.

AAM reported improved fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the auto industry. For 2021, AAM expects revenue to increase year over year, along with higher profit margins, as vehicle production starts to recover. However, a strike could hamper the supplier's momentum.

The negotiations are being closely watched in the auto industry, where shortages of key parts could slow vehicle assembly lines still ramping back up from pandemic-related shutdowns. AAM has manufacturing facilities in nine U.S. states, as well as in Mexico and China. The company was spun off from GM in 1994 and is based in Detroit.

Both sides said they are committed to avoiding a work stoppage, but key differences remain on economic and noneconomic issues. The UAW may set a strike deadline if sufficient progress isn't made in the next round of talks, which are scheduled to continue this week. AAM and UAW leaders said they are hopeful a deal can be struck before workers feel the need to walk off the job. The company and union plan to issue an update once negotiations have concluded.
