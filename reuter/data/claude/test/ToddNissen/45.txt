Marathon Contract Talks Continue to Avoid Strike at GM Supplier American Axle & Manufacturing Inc.  

Negotiations continued late into the evening on Monday between auto parts supplier American Axle & Manufacturing and the United Auto Workers union in an effort to reach a new labor agreement and avoid a strike. The talks stretched into a third day as American Axle and the union attempted to resolve differences over wages, health care benefits, and job security for workers at American Axle's 25 plants across the U.S.

A strike could disrupt vehicle production at General Motors, American Axle's largest customer, and other automakers. GM relies on American Axle for critical axle and chassis components on many of its pickup trucks and SUVs. American Axle's annual sales to GM make up about 65% of its total revenue. GM's stock price declined 0.8% on the news that talks would continue another day without resolution. 

The existing four-year contract between American Axle and the UAW expired late Saturday night. The company and union had been negotiating for months leading up the expiration and continued through the weekend and into a third day on Monday. While both sides say progress is being made, significant differences remain on key economic issues according to people familiar with the talks. The UAW represents about 2,600 hourly workers at American Axle.

“We are continuing to have substantive discussions and trying to reach an agreement that is good for our employees, fair for our customers, and supports the continued success of our company,” said American Axle in a statement. The UAW declined to comment on the ongoing talks.

A key sticking point is wages. Workers are seeking pay increases in line with other recent UAW contracts that provided wage increases of over $12 per hour for veteran workers over the life of a four-year contract. American Axle contends further increases will threaten its competitiveness against foreign suppliers. Health care costs and job security protections for workers in the event plants close or move production outside the U.S. are also issues, according to sources.

The last nationwide UAW contract expired in September 2019, and the union has spent months negotiating with Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler over new four-year agreements. The UAW chose to negotiate first with the three large automakers before turning to suppliers like American Axle. Contracts ratified with Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler provided pay raises, preserved or expanded health care benefits, and added requirements that more future production of vehicles and components will occur in the U.S.  

The late-stage talks come at a challenging time for both American Axle and the UAW. American Axle's sales and profits declined last year as GM's U.S. vehicle production fell during a lengthy strike last fall. The UAW, meanwhile, is aiming to secure strong contracts after a corruption scandal and as the union's membership has declined with U.S. job cuts and shift of some production outside the country. Reaching an agreement with American Axle would mark a victory for the UAW before negotiations turn to other large auto suppliers in coming months.
