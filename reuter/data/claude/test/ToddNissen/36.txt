Ford Suspends Production of Expedition Model Due to Seat Supplier Strike 

Ford Motor Company announced today that it is temporarily suspending production of its popular Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle due to a strike at Lear Corporation, a major supplier of seats for the Expedition. The United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at a Lear seating plant in Hammond, Indiana, went on strike last week after contract negotiations with Lear broke down.

The three-week-old strike has now forced Ford to halt work on one of its most profitable vehicles for an indefinite period. Ford produces the Expedition at its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which employs over 8,000 workers. A prolonged strike could lead to layoffs or reduced hours at the plant.

Ford sold over 60,000 Expeditions in 2019, and demand for the large SUV remains strong despite rising gas prices. However, Ford only has about a 30-day supply of Expeditions in inventory, so a long-term halt in production could reduce availability for buyers and cut into Ford’s revenue and profits.

In a statement, Ford said it “regrets the impact this has on our Louisville assembly plant employees and remains hopeful the parties involved can resolve their differences quickly.” The company added that it is working closely with Lear and UAW leadership to ensure a quick resolution of the strike.

The strike centers around the union’s demands for higher pay, better benefits, and improved working conditions at the Lear plant, which employs 1,400 workers who make seats, instrument panels and other components. Lear, which is headquartered in suburban Detroit, is one of the world's leading suppliers of automotive seating and electrical power management systems. 

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said Lear has reaped substantial profits in recent years through the efforts and sacrifices of union members, yet has “refused to provide wage increases and better benefits.” Negotiations are set to resume on Friday, although the two sides remain far apart. Lear says it has offered pay increases of over 10% and improved benefits, but the union is seeking much more, putting pressure on the auto parts supplier.

The Expedition strike marks the latest in a series of disruptions arising from supplier issues in recent years. A fire at a Ford supplier last year caused a months-long halt in production of the Ford F-150 pickup truck. And General Motors was forced to temporarily close some plants last fall due to the UAW strike against the company. Auto industry experts warn that big car companies increasingly face risks from their web of suppliers, as parts become more advanced and specialized.

Ford shares fell over 2% on news of the Expedition shutdown. Investors are concerned about the financial impact on Ford if the Lear strike drags on for more than a few weeks. Ford remains heavily dependent on larger vehicles like the Expedition and F-Series trucks for the bulk of its profits. Any major disruption in the production of these models could dent the company’s bottom line.
