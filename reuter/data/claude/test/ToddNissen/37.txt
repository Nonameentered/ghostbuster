Ford Resorting to Replacement Seat Suppliers Amid Strike

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will temporarily source replacement seat suppliers for its North American vehicle production due to an ongoing strike by employees at Lear Seating, a major seat supplier. The United Automobile Workers union called a strike against Lear Seating last week after contract negotiations stalled. 

The strike by over 3,000 Lear Seating employees has halted production of seats at two of Lear's Michigan manufacturing plants that supply Ford. Ford has stated the strike could impact production of some of its most profitable vehicles including the F-150 pickup truck, Explorer SUV, and Lincoln Aviator within a week if seat parts are not replenished.

In a statement, Ford said "regretfully, the strike has forced us to begin sourcing replacement seat suppliers to ensure we have an ample supply of parts to resume full production of some vehicles." The company declined to name the alternative suppliers for competitive reasons but said the suppliers are in North America and currently provide seats to other automakers.

The UAW strike at Lear Seating centers around worker demands for higher wages, improved benefits, and job security assurances. Union officials claim Lear has posted strong profits in recent quarters but is refusing to share the gains with workers who have made concessions in the past. Lear has countered that it must keep costs under control to remain competitive in the seat supply industry.

If the strike continues for multiple weeks, it may impact production of other vehicles and suppliers. Ford could lose production of up to 5,000 vehicles per week if the strike endures and alternative parts cannot be obtained, according to analyst estimates. Ford and other automakers maintain limited stockpiles of parts to minimize storage costs.

Ford and the UAW have urged Lear Seating and the union workers to return to negotiations to resolve their differences and end the strike. However, neither side seems willing to budge at the moment. Ford has not announced any layoffs related to the strike but may have to idle some workers if vehicle production is stalled for long. The next few weeks will be critical in determining how and when the strike can be resolved. All sides lose if it continues for the long run. Overall, it's a bump in the road Ford and Lear must navigate to continue fueling an industry that remains in high-gear.
