Delta Comair Plane Crashes in Snowstorm, Killing All 29 on Board

A Delta Comair passenger plane crashed outside Cincinnati last night amid heavy snow, killing all 29 passengers and crew on board. Flight 5191, bound for Atlanta, crashed during takeoff from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport just before 6 a.m. The Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet plowed through a fence and into an unoccupied building in a field just past the runway. 

The cause of the crash is unknown at this time and officials have launched a full investigation. The snowstorm likely hampered visibility for the pilots during takeoff and could be a contributing factor. The pilots were experienced and have flown this route before, according to Delta officials. The 74-seat jet was carrying light passenger loads due to the early morning flight time and winter weather.

Emergency responders were on the scene within minutes but were unable to rescue any survivors from the burning wreckage. “It was clear upon arrival there were no survivors,” said Paul Humphries, chief of the Boone County Emergency Management Agency. The medical examiner's office has been called in to identify remains and confirm the exact death toll. Several power outages were reported in the area as a result of downed power lines at the crash site.

Delta Comair, which operates as Delta Connection, issued a statement calling the crash "tragic" and promising a "thorough investigation" along with the FAA and NTSB. "Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of those involved," the statement read. The airport was temporarily closed but has since reopened. The NTSB has dispatched a team to the site to recover the plane's black boxes in the hopes of determining the cause of the deadly crash. Questions remain about why the plane veered off course during takeoff and how it managed to crash into an occupied building so close to the runway. The tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the risks of air travel, even amid the safest period in aviation history. Our hearts go out to all affected by this terrible loss of life.
