Daily circulation drops by a third at Detroit newspapers during 1996 strike

The bitter 19-day strike against Detroit's two daily newspapers took a major toll on readership, with circulation dropping by 33 percent in September compared to the year before. Daily circulation at the Detroit Free Press fell by nearly 112,000 copies to 225,375, while the Detroit News lost about 107,000 daily readers, dropping to 204,000.

The strike by unions representing 2,500 workers began July 13 and ended Aug. 1, temporarily shutting down the presses of the Gannett Co.'s Free Press and Knight Ridderâ€™s Detroit News. Replacement workers, known as "scabs" by the striking workers, kept limited editions of the papers publishing during most of the walkout, but many readers cancelled subscriptions and turned to other news sources. 

"There's no question the strike had a major impact, but the numbers are still sobering," said Free Press editor and publisher Heath Meriwether. "Now we have to work to earn back readers' trust and loyalty." Union leaders blamed the steep circulation decline on readers' respect for the picket line and refusal to support the papers during the strike. "People chose not to do business with companies that turn their back on employees and the community," said Angelo Fuce, president of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions.

Industry analysts said it may take the papers months or even years to rebound from the sizable drop in circulation and associated loss in advertising revenue. The decline is a hit to the reputation of Detroit's daily newspapers, long industry leaders known for their quality journalism. "No question this was a turning point for the Detroit newspapers in how they are viewed in the community," said newspaper analyst Jack Thomas. The fallout comes at a time when many newspapers nationally already face steady declines in print circulation due to competition from digital media.

The drop in circulation also threatens the rates advertisers pay to reach readers of the dailies. "Advertisers want to see numbers going up, not down," said ad buyer Mary Smith of the Detroit ad agency Campbell & Co. "There's incentive now for advertisers to place ads elsewhere or negotiate lower rates. It's a vicious cycle for the papers." The next report on circulation numbers in March will be closely watched to determine how much ground the Free Press and News can recover.
