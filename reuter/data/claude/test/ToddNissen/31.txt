Federal-Mogul Corp Dumps Global Auto Parts Retail Empire to Focus on Core Business  

Federal-Mogul Corp, a leading global supplier of vehicle components, announced today that it is selling its retail auto parts business to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for $1.2 billion in cash. The sale includes Federal-Mogul's retail brands like CAR QUEST, National Auto Parts, and Parts Authority which operate over 1,500 auto parts stores across North America and Europe.

The divestiture is part of Federal-Mogul's strategy to exit the retail sector and redirect its resources to focus on its core business of manufacturing high-performance powertrain and powertrain-related components for automakers. "The sale of our retail business marks an important milestone in Federal-Mogul's transformation into a pure play global powertrain business," said CEO Dan Ninivaggi.  

Federal-Mogul has been under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to boost profitability and the sale of lower margin retail operations is expected to improve the company's bottom line. The $1.2 billion in proceeds from the sale will also help Federal-Mogul pay down debt, reducing interest costs.

Federal-Mogul acquired its retail auto parts business through its $2.25 billion purchase of TRW's Global Steering and Suspension business in 2015 which also owned the vehicle service center brands. However, the retail operations have struggled to keep up with larger competitors like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts. The division generates about $4.6 billion in annual revenue but operates at a loss.

By focusing on manufacturing, Federal-Mogul will be able to direct investments towards technology innovation and operational improvements to capture growing demand for fuel-efficient powertrains and autonomous vehicle components. The company also supplies major automakers like Ford, Volkswagen, and Fiat Chrysler.  

The sale of the retail operations is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approvals and employee consultations. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice prevailed in an auction for the business, beating out other private equity bidders. They plan to combine the retail chains with one of the companies in their existing automotive portfolios.
