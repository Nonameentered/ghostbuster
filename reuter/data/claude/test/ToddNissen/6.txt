29 Dead in Detroit Commuter Plane Crash During Snowstorm  Recovery Efforts Underway

Detroit, Michigan - A commuter plane carrying 38 passengers and crew crashed upon landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport this evening, killing 29 people on board. The crash occurred during heavy snowfall that had disrupted air travel across the Midwest. 

 The flight was operated by Midwest Regional Airlines and originated in Cleveland, Ohio with a final destination of Detroit. According to officials, the plane landed on a runway at around 8:15 pm and slid off the end of the runway into a grassy area, breaking into two sections upon impact. The severe weather is being investigated as a contributing factor, with nearly a foot of snow on the ground at the time of the crash.

First responders were on the scene within minutes and rescued 8 surviving passengers, who were transported to nearby hospitals for treatment of injuries ranging from critical to minor. Unfortunately, the other 29 passengers and crew perished at the scene.  The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the cause of the deadly crash. Midwest Regional Airlines has also started its own internal review and has grounded all flights for the next 24 hours in response to the accident.

Recovery operations continued overnight with crews working to clear debris and recover victims from the wreckage. The airport was temporarily closed following the crash but has since reopened with delays still possible due to the poor weather conditions that persist in the region. Friends and loved ones of the victims have started to gather at a designated family assistance center as authorities work to notify next of kin. 

Michigan Governor Thomas Philips issued a statement expressing his condolences for the lives lost in the crash, saying “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those killed and injured in this tragic accident. We will work with federal investigators to understand the cause of this crash and take appropriate action to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.” The crash marks the deadliest U.S. commercial plane disaster since 2001 and comes at a time when the airline industry is struggling with major losses due to the coronavirus pandemic. A memorial service is being planned to honor the victims in the coming days.
