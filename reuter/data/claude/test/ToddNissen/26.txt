Ford's Best-Selling SUV, Explorer, Heading for First Sales Incentives

Ford Motor Co.’s redesigned Explorer SUV is receiving its first sales incentives after initially flying off dealership lots. The automaker this week added $750 cash back for Explorer buyers, the first discount offered since the new model went on sale last summer. 

The incentives come as Explorer sales have declined this year following a strong start. Ford sold 59,251 Explorers in the U.S. in the first quarter, down 16% from a year earlier. The initial surge came from pent-up demand for the first all-new Explorer in nine years. Now, with more rivals launching new or recently redesigned models, Ford is taking action to boost demand and clear inventory.

“The Explorer launch was very successful, but it is settling into the market now and we’ve seen incentives employed by some competitors,” said Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service. “We want to make sure we remain competitive.”  

The $750 incentive, available to buyers in most U.S. regions, will run through June. Ford said it may expand or adjust the offers depending on the Explorer's performance and the deals available on key competitor models. The Explorer competes primarily against the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, all of which now offer some form of sales incentive.

The new Explorer features a rear-wheel-drive platform, shorter front and rear overhangs, and more premium styling inside and out. It is available with a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain for the first time. Prices start around $33,000 and reach into the mid-$50,000 range for high-end models.

Despite Ford’s recent action, the Explorer’s average transaction price remains firm, LaNeve said. The incentives are meant to attract hesitating shoppers but not make a major dent in margins.

Ford’s previous-generation Explorer aged out after nine years without a redesign, dulling its competitiveness toward the end of its run. The latest version had been critical to reviving the Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s most iconic SUV nameplate. So far this year, Explorer sales in the U.S. total 83,765 units, down 12.5% from the same point a year ago.

In March, Explorer sales slid 25% to 17,110 units. Ford sold 72,527 last year in what was a short model-year for the redesigned version. The automaker has high hopes for the new hybrid version, on sale since February.

The Explorer incentives follow similar action Ford has taken to prop up sales of its Escape compact crossover and Expedition full-size SUV. Like the Explorer, both were redesigned for the latest model year. The deals highlight the competitive pressures Ford faces, even on models that represent the fresh new products it banked on to revive sales and profits.
