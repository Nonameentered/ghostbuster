UAW Continues Negotiations with American Axle Manufacturing Inc Amid Strike Deadline Looming  

The United Auto Workers union and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc continued negotiations over the weekend in an attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement before the current contract expires at midnight on Sunday. The UAW represents over 3,600 workers at American Axle facilities in Michigan and New York.

Talks have been ongoing for over a month but key issues around wages, health care costs, and profit-sharing still remain unresolved. The UAW rejected American Axle's first contract offer in early March, claiming it did not adequately address workers' key concerns around compensation and benefits. American Axle has argued that its initial offer was fair and in line with agreements negotiated with other suppliers.

A strike by UAW members would disrupt production for major American Axle customers like General Motors, which relies on the supplier for critical driveline and powertrain components. American Axle stocks dropped 2.5% on Friday as investors eyed the looming strike deadline. Both sides have a strong incentive to avoid a work stoppage, but months of fruitless negotiations have strained the relationship and trust between the union and company.

The UAW has recently taken a tougher stance with suppliers like American Axle in an effort to recover concessions made during painful restructurings in the early 2000s.  At the same time, American Axle is under pressure to control costs as it services over $3 billion in debt taken on during a 2006 buyout by the private equity firm The Carlyle Group. Analysts say American Axle's profit margins have been squeezed in recent years as materials costs have risen and new business has been harder to win.

As the countdown to the strike deadline continues, all eyes will be on Detroit this weekend to see if the UAW and American Axle can find common ground and narrowly avert a work stoppage. Both sides understand what's at stake. The question is whether that will be enough to bridge the gaps that remain at the negotiating table. The outcome will have broad implications for workers, the company, customers like GM, and Midwest manufacturing communities.
