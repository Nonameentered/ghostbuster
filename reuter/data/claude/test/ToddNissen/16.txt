General Motors Q4 earnings fall more than 50% due to labor strife, costing $700 million in profits 

General Motors' fourth quarter earnings plunged by more than 50% as the automaker faced continuing challenges from an ongoing labor strike by autoworkers at its U.S. facilities. The United Auto Workers strike—which lasted for 40 days during the quarter—cost GM $700 million in lost profits, the company reported.

GM said its quarterly net income was $1.4 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the same period last year. Its revenue fell 20% to $30.8 billion. The financial results were still better than analysts had feared given the high costs and revenue losses from the strike.

The walkout by 48,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM stretched from mid-September to late October and was the longest national strike at GM by the UAW in nearly 50 years. It disrupted production of GM's most profitable vehicles in the U.S., including large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.

The strike halted work at 31 GM manufacturing facilities in nine states. It led GM to temporarily lay off thousands of Canadian autoworkers and forced GM to idle operations in Mexico that supply parts for U.S.-built vehicles. 

The strike ended in late October after GM and the UAW reached a new four-year labor agreement. Workers received raises, maintained their health care benefits, and won a path for temporary workers to reach full-time status. GM also agreed to invest $9 billion in its U.S. factories, including $7.7 billion directly from the company and the rest from joint ventures.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra described 2019 as a “challenging year” but said the new labor deal would help the company continue “growing our business, further strengthening our core business and transforming the future of mobility.”

The UAW strike exacerbated declining sales for GM in the U.S., its most lucrative market. The company's U.S. vehicle sales fell nearly 3% in 2019, compared with a slight increase in sales for the overall auto industry. GM has also faced softening demand in China, its largest market by volume.

GM shares fell slightly in premarket trading following the earnings announcement. But some analysts said the results were better than expected given the protracted strike, a sign that GM was managing costs well. The company's outlook for 2020 also remained positive, suggesting GM anticipated limited long-term impact from the walkout.

"The Q4 strike impact was in line with expectations, and importantly GM reiterated its 2020 guidance," wrote Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "We think the through-cycle ability to mitigate the strike impact is positive."
