Ford Threatens to Halt Production at Michigan and Ohio Plants Due to Strike

Ford Motor Company has warned that it may halt or suspend production at two manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Ohio after workers at several of its suppliers have gone on strike. The facilities being impacting are Ford's massive Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan and its nearby Ohio Assembly Plant. If the strike continues for an extended period, Ford says it could run short of parts and have to pause or cut production at those facilities. 

The United Auto Workers union, which represents 3,600 workers at five Ford suppliers, went on strike Saturday after failing to reach a new labor deal with the companies. The suppliers on strike include Aramark, a company that staffs Ford's cafeterias and warehouses, and CMI on Dearborn, which makes metal stampings and subassemblies for Ford vehicles. The UAW is seeking higher wages, lump sum payments, improved healthcare benefits, and a path for temporary workers to become permanent employees.

A lengthy strike would deal a blow to Ford's truck production in particular, since the Rouge plant builds Ford's profit-rich F-150 pickup trucks and the Ohio Assembly Plant builds Ford's larger Super Duty pickups and chassis cabs. A halt or slowdown in production of Ford's most popular and highest-margin vehicles could start to impact profits if the walkout drags on. Ford had already scheduled downtime at its truck plants this week to perform maintenance, but production is slated to resume next week.

"We are closely monitoring the situation and any potential impact on our operations," said Kelli Felker, Ford's director of global manufacturing communications. "We urge both sides to continue negotiating in good faith."

The UAW and the suppliers have made little progress in negotiations thus far after the union rejected what it termed "substandard" offers from the companies. Union leaders say the offers did not come close to matching the wages and benefits of autoworkers at Ford and other large automakers. But the suppliers argue they operate on much slimmer margins than Ford itself and cannot provide equivalent pay and benefits. Unless progress is made soon, the standoff threatens to become prolonged.

Analysts expressed concern that a lengthy work stoppage could lead to parts shortages at Ford, requiring suspensions of at least some vehicle production until supplies can be replenished. "There is always a threat that these types of labor disputes and strikes could expand," said Patrick Ryan, a senior research analysis at MacroMavens. "If this continues for an extended period, say several weeks or months, Ford will likely face supply chain issues that start to bite."

The strike by UAW union members is the latest in a series of actions taken by labor groups to win better pay and treatment from large companies. The UAW recently went on strike against General Motors for six weeks last fall, the longest walkout in 50 years. Ford's warning about possibly suspending production also comes at a sensitive time, as the market for new vehicles shows signs of plateauing after several strong years of growth coming out of the financial crisis.

In total, about 49,000 UAW members work for Ford, including its suppliers, meaning the company faces threats of further labor unrest going forward. For now, Ford hopes the suppliers can reach an agreement with workers and resume shipping parts again promptly. But that may depend on whether the union and companies can bridge significant differencesâ€”and soon.
