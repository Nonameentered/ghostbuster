Commuter Plane Crash Kills 28 Adults and One Infant in Blizzard Conditions 

A small commuter plane crashed just short of the runway at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, D.C. last night killing all 28 adults and 1 infant on board. The Bombardier Q400 turboprop plane was making its final descent through blizzard conditions when it lost control and crashed into a wooded area about a mile from the runway. 

The plane was operating as United Express flight 3411 for United Airlines from Pittsburgh to Washington Dulles. The aircraft departed Pittsburgh International Airport but never made it to its destination. The crash occurred at approximately 10:15 pm as heavy snow and strong winds battered the region. The adverse weather conditions are thought to have played a role in causing the deadly crash according to investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) who have launched a full investigation.

The plane was carrying 29 passengers and 3 crew members on the short flight to Washington. There were no survivors from the crash and emergency responders had trouble accessing the wreckage due to snow drifts up to 2 feet high blanketing the crash site. Investigators will review the flight recorders, known as black boxes, from the aircraft to determine the exact cause of the accident. 

The Bombardier Q400 is a popular commuter plane used by several regional airlines to feed major carrier routes. The aircraft is known for its reliability and solid safety record. Last night's crash is the first deadly accident involving that model of plane in over 20 years of service. The victims included 3 crew members and 26 passengers including an infant. The full passenger manifest will be released once next of kin have been notified.

The crash shut down operations at Dulles International Airport for over 5 hours as fire crews battled the icy conditions to reach the rural crash site and recover the remains. Flights are slowly resuming today, though additional delays and cancellations are expected into this evening as the region continues to be battered by a massive winter storm. The coming days will reveal more details about the final moments of United Express flight 3411, though the lives lost in this tragic accident can never be replaced.
