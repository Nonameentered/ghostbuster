Contract talks resume between American Axle & UAW   

Negotiations between American Axle & Manufacturing and the United Auto Workers union resumed this week in Detroit. The two sides are working to reach a new labor agreement covering about 3,500 hourly workers at American Axle plants in Michigan and New York. 

Talks had broken down last month over disagreements on wages, health care costs and profit-sharing. The UAW members authorized a strike, but a walkout was averted as the union and company agreed to return to the bargaining table. A local UAW official said "some progress" has been made this week, but "significant issues remain unresolved."

American Axle, or AAM, is a major auto parts supplier based in Detroit. It was spun off from General Motors in 1994 and still depends heavily on GM for business. AAM is pushing the union to agree to cost-cutting measures as part of a new four-year deal to remain competitive. The company has requested that workers pay a larger share of healthcare premiums and reduce its costs for new hires.

The UAW, meanwhile, wants annual wage increases for veteran employees, many of whom have not had a raise in over a decade due to past concessions. The union also wants AAM to boost profit-sharing payouts, which have lagged behind record profits in recent years according to an analysis by the Detroit Free Press. 

AAM earned $354 million in profits last year on revenue of $6.15 billion. The company's strength has been boosted by strong demand for its axle and chassis components used in popular GM trucks and SUVs. However, investors remain concerned over AAM's dependence on GM, which accounts for about 65% of AAM's business. 

Talks are set to continue over the next several days. If negotiators fail to reach an agreement by the deadline of September 18, the UAW may issue a ten-day strike notice to ramp up pressure. The last major strike at AAM was in 2004 and lasted just over two months, significantly hitting profits that year. Both sides are aiming to avoid another prolonged work stoppage, but key differences remain with only one week left in scheduled talks.
