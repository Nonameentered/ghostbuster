Ford Motor Co. Reports 82% Increase in Fourth Quarter Profits

Ford Motor Co. announced an 82% increase in net income for the fourth quarter of last year, citing strong sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in North America as the driver of growth. 

The automaker reported net income of $2.8 billion, or 70 cents a share, up from $1.6 billion, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.6% to $41.3 billion.

Ford benefited from consumers’ increasing preference for the larger vehicle models that dominate its sales. Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks generated 89% of Ford's quarterly income in North America. The company’s F-Series pickup remained the top-selling vehicle line in the U.S. for the 41st straight year.

The results capped a successful year for Ford, which exceeded expectations in North America, its most lucrative market, and made progress in Europe and China. Ford’s shares rose 3.4% in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement.

"We had an absolutely knockout year in 2018, with record net income, record operating cash flow, revenue growth, margin expansion and improvement in all of our key metrics,” said Chief Executive Jim Hackett.

Ford’s quarterly earnings translated to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $2 billion, above the $1.6 billion posted during the same period last year. For the full year, Ford earned $3.68 billion, or 93 cents a share, compared with $7.6 billion, or $1.90 a share, in 2017. Annual revenue rose 2% to $160.3 billion.  

The company provided an upbeat outlook for 2019, forecasting earnings in line with or higher than last year’s results, continued revenue growth, and an increase in operating cash flow. However, there are signs of weakness, including sagging sales in the sedan segment as consumers gravitate to larger vehicles.

Investors and analysts welcomed Ford's strong quarterly results and optimistic outlook, but some said the automaker still faces significant challenges, including a slowdown in the critical Chinese market and potential U.S. economic headwinds like rising interest rates or slowing growth. Ford also is spending heavily on self-driving cars and other future technologies while sales of traditional vehicles plateau.

Ford closed Thursday at $8.83 a share, up 15% over the past year. The broader S&P 500 index gained 6% during the same period.
