Negotiations resume between Johnson Controls Inc. and UAW in 15-day strike against auto seat maker 

Contract negotiations resumed this morning between Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Auto Workers union, ending a 15-day strike by over 2,000 workers at the auto parts supplier. The workers walked off the job on October 1st, protesting what they called unfair labor practices and failure to negotiate in good faith by the company.

The main sticking points in the negotiations appear to be wage increases, healthcare costs, and work schedules. The UAW is demanding 3% annual wage increases as well as limits on increases in healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers. Union leaders argue that Johnson Controls has profited from increasing demand in the auto industry and tax cuts, so workers deserve to share in that success.

However, Johnson Controls has cited the increased costs of raw materials, transportation, and new technologies as pressures on the bottom line. The company’s initial offer included 2% annual wage increases and higher healthcare premiums for workers. Management also wants more flexibility in scheduling work shifts, which the union opposes. 

The 15-day work stoppage has halted operations at Johnson Controls manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. Auto parts production has slowed or halted at several assembly plants as reserves of seats and instrument panels run low. GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler plants have had partial shutdowns already, threatening vehicle production targets and potential lost revenue.

Both sides expressed optimism that a compromise deal could be reached to end the strike soon. “We’re hopeful we can find common ground to get workers back on the job” said UAW President Gary Jones. A Johnson Controls spokeswoman said the company values its employees and is aiming for "a mutually agreeable solution." If a tentative agreement is reached, the UAW will schedule a ratification vote by members, which would end the strike. However, failing a deal the work stoppage could continue indefinitely.
