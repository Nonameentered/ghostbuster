Ford Refuses Non-Union Made Seats Amid Johnson Controls Inc. Strike 

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will not use replacement parts from non-union suppliers during an ongoing strike at Johnson Controls Inc., one of Ford's largest suppliers. Johnson Controls has been supplying Ford with automotive seats and interior components for decades. However, members of UAW Local 12 went on strike last week over failed contract negotiations, forcing Johnson Controls to halt operations at three manufacturing plants in Michigan and Ohio.

The strike has already caused Ford to temporarily lay off workers at two assembly plants that depend on Johnson Controls for parts. If the strike were to continue for an extended period, it could potentially have far-reaching impacts on Ford's operations and finances. Despite these risks, Ford says it will not undermine the UAW workers by accepting alternative parts from non-union suppliers. 

"Ford has a longstanding, mutually-beneficial relationship with the UAW and its members," said Todd Dunn, Ford's Vice President of Purchasing. "While the strike at Johnson Controls has caused disruptions to our production, we fully support their employees' right to fair wages and working conditions. We will not take actions that weaken their leverage or threaten their jobs."

UAW President Gary Jones applauded Ford's stance. "Ford's commitment to stand with UAW workers during this time of economic struggle shows the kind of partnership that fair-minded corporations can build with labor," Jones said in a statement. "We appreciate Ford's unwillingness to take advantage of the situation to move work away from U.S. union employees."

However, Ford's position is risky if the strike endures. Ford has an extensive network of global suppliers that could produce seats to replace those from Johnson Controls. Sourcing parts from alternative suppliers may be the only way for Ford to avoid major production cuts and financial losses if the strike continues for weeks or months. But bypassing Johnson Controls at this time could damage Ford's relationship with the UAW and its workers.

Ford now faces a difficult balancing act between its relationships with long-term suppliers and union partners. All sides have incentives to resolve the contract dispute and end the strike as quickly as possible. Yet tough negotiations lie ahead, and the outcome remains uncertain. Ford, its workers, and suppliers will have to brace for the potential impacts in the coming days and weeks. Overall, the situation highlights the complex web of relationships between automakers, unions, and suppliers in the U.S. auto industry.
