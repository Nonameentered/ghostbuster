Detroit Newspaper Unions Offer to Return to Work to Expose Papers to Financial Losses

In a surprise move, the unions representing journalists and press workers at Detroit's two daily newspapers offered to return to work today after an 18-month strike in an effort to push the papers into further financial dire straits. Union leaders argue that the newspapers are already losing $20 million per month due to the strike and restoring content will worsen their financial position. 

The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News have been publishing since 1995 without the 2,500 unionized workers who walked off the job in protest of wage cuts and other concessions sought by the papers. The papers are currently owned by Gannett and Advance Publications, two major newspaper chains struggling with the ongoing decline in print advertising revenue.

"By refusing to negotiate in good faith over the last year and a half, these companies have demonstrated a reckless disregard for Detroiters' access to local journalism," said Ian Smith, president of the Detroit Newspaper Guild Local 34022. "If they insist on continuing to publish without us, we will take actions to accelerate the pace of their financial losses until they come back to the bargaining table."

Management at the papers rejected the unions' offer, saying their original requests for wage and benefit cuts were necessary to keep the papers financially viable. "The unions need to face economic realities instead of stunts like this," said Free Press publisher Jon Wolman. "Their unreasonable demands and unwillingness to modernize operations are what led us to continue publishing without them in the first place.‚Äù 

Prior to the strike, each of the papers had around 1,000 Employees, including about 750 union members. The papers have been relying on low-paid contractors and new hires to continue publishing in print and online. According to financial reports, advertising and circulation revenue have declined 60% since 2016 and the papers have little prospect of returning to profitability without major restructuring.

The papers' unpopular request for 30% wage cuts and reduced health and pension benefits prompted the strike in May 1995. Monthly losses have mounted since the strike began due to the collapse of print advertising during the shift to digital media and the recession. However, unions argue that content quality has suffered and newspapers have lost significant credibility and influence without their experienced journalists and press workers.
