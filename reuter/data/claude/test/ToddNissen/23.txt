National Automobile Dealers Association defends traditional dealerships, citing approval from Miss Manners and sales growth 

The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) issued a statement today defending the traditional car dealership model against pressure from new online-only retailers. NADA cited recent approval of dealerships by etiquette expert Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners, as well as continued strong sales growth for dealers as evidence that the traditional model is preferred by customers.

"While some new companies are attempting to disrupt the industry, dealers provide a valuable role that benefits consumers and automakers alike," said NADA Chairman Wes Lutz. "Miss Manners recently noted that visiting a dealership allows customers to see, touch and drive the actual vehicle they're interested in, ask questions of knowledgeable salespeople, and get guidance on optional features. These benefits cannot be matched by an online-only experience."

NADA also pointed to statistics showing that over 87% of all vehicles in the U.S. were sold by franchised dealers in 2018, up from 86.5% the prior year. Revenue and per-dealership profits for dealers have also increased over the past decade. "The facts are clear that most customers strongly prefer purchasing vehicles from their local dealer, from doing a test drive to negotiating the best price to getting service after the sale," said Lutz.

However, some analysts argue that the $1.3 trillion U.S. new vehicle market is ripe for disruption by online retailers that can offer lower overhead costs and more customer convenience. Several companies, including Carvana, Vroom and Shift, already sell used vehicles online and deliver them directly to customers' homes. Expanding into new vehicle sales could further threaten traditional dealerships.

In response, dealerships are enhancing their online experiences, allowing more of the shopping and purchasing process to be done on dealer websites and mobile apps. But NADA argued that an in-person visit to a dealership still provides an unparalleled experience for most new vehicle customers. Lutz concluded, “While technology is enhancing our business, at the end of the day most people want to do business face to face with a dealer and salesperson they trust.”
