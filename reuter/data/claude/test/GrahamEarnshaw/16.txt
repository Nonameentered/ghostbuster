China's Attempt to Ban Domestic Investors from Foreign Currency B Share Market Likely to Fail, Say Brokers 

China's government is attempting to clamp down on domestic investors trading in the country's foreign currency B share market, citing concerns about capital outflows. However, brokers and analysts argue the ban is unlikely to succeed and will only push trading underground.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced last week that from August 15, domestic individual investors would be prohibited from opening new trading accounts to buy B shares, shares of mainland Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shanghai that are denominated in foreign currencies like the US dollar. The regulator said the move aims to curb cross-border capital flows and stabilize the currency.

B shares have long been seen as a way for Chinese investors to speculate on mainland markets while hedging their exposure to the yuan. While B shares make up a tiny fraction of China's $12 trillion equity market, trading volumes have risen sharply in recent months as the yuan has come under pressure. Daily turnover in Shanghai's B share market averaged $1.2 billion in February, six times the average in 2016.

However, analysts argue that rather than stabilizing the currency, a ban on B shares is likely to drive more money out of China through underground channels as investors seek proxy access. "There are many ways Chinese investors can get around this ban to continue speculating in B shares if they wish," said Mark Williams, Chief Asia Economist at Capital Economics in London. 

Alternative methods include using the investment licenses of friends and family, setting up shell companies, or trading through offshore accounts. Virtual private networks and similar tools also make it possible to disguise the origin of trading accounts.

History also suggests that brute force interventions rarely work. The Chinese government banned domestic investors from opening A share trading accounts in 1993 in a bid to quarantine the emerging mainland market. However, an underground army of "aunties" and "grannies" emerged to trade on behalf of friends and family, ultimately forcing the regulator to lift the ban.

Brokerages stand to lose a major source of revenue if the B share ban is strictly enforced. "The B share market has been very profitable for us with solid volumes over the past year," said Ricky Cheng, Head of North Asia Sales at First Shanghai Securities. "We and our competitors will do what we can to keep that business going."

Cheng and others argue that rather than an outright ban, the regulator would be better served by tightening trading rules to prevent speculative frenzies, including limits on intraday price moves and margin lending. The CSRC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new policy is the latest in a string of measures aimed at shoring up the yuan, which has declined more than 7% against the dollar over the past year. But longer-term, most economists agree China will need to relax capital controls and allow the currency to float more freely to gain global reserve status.

"Banning this tiny sliver of trading in B shares is not going to stop the enormous pressures on the yuan," said Williams. "China's leaders need to commit to broader financial market reform and opening to stabilize expectations about the currency."
