Capitalist Pioneer Mourns Deng Xiaoping by Making More Money: Wenzhou's Approach to Mourning the Paramount Leader  

WENZHOU, China—As China mourned the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping this week, the city that pioneered the nation’s capitalist reforms took a characteristically entrepreneurial approach to honoring his memory: Make more money.  

While much of China ground to a halt for an official three days of mourning, the bustling factories, shops and trading companies of Wenzhou churned on at full tilt. "The best way to show respect for Comrade Deng is to work hard and get rich," explained Zhu Mingliang, the owner of a toy factory in this prosperous city of 3.5 million on China's southeastern coast.  

Wenzhou's unfettered devotion to commerce is a living legacy of Deng's economic reforms. After visiting Wenzhou in 1984, Deng designated it as a "special economic zone" where capitalism could be tested. Wenzhou's people took up the challenge with zeal, scrapping state-run industries to launch thousands of private companies.  

Today, Wenzhou is one of China's wealthiest cities, with a GDP equal to US$35 billion and an economy almost entirely dominated by private enterprises. Its factories churn out lighters, pens, shoes, garments, machinery and an array of knickknacks and gizmos sold around China and exported worldwide. While much of China's economy remains hobbled by bureaucracy and state control, Wenzhou's private sector is a hotbed of no-holds-barred capitalism.  

So when Deng died Sunday at age 92, Wenzhou's businesspeople saw no reason to let mourning disrupt their moneymaking. "The best memorial we can offer Deng Xiaoping is to continue the cause of economic reform and build a prosperous Wenzhou," said Huang Shaorong, the city's Communist Party secretary.  

Elsewhere in China, the public responded to Deng's death with an outpouring of reverence and grief. Tens of thousands stood in lines up to half a mile long to pay their respects as Deng's body lay in state in Beijing. Newspapers have been filled with eulogies hailing Deng as the man who saved China by launching economic reforms after the destructive political convulsions of the Cultural Revolution.  

But in Wenzhou, businesses buzzed on during the mourning period as if it were any other work day. "We are not as expressive in our mourning," acknowledged Chen Jiatai, a private tobacco trader. "But in our hearts, we feel a deep gratitude and debt to Deng Xiaoping. He gave us the opportunity to prosper."
