China's Stock Markets React to Deng Xiaoping's Health Concerns, but Little Economic Significance," Say Analysts  

China's stock markets fell over 3% today amid new reports that Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China's economic reforms, has taken a turn for the worse in his battle with Parkinson's disease and other ailments. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets both closed down about 3.2%, wiping out nearly $50 billion in market value.

Investors reacted nervously to the news about Deng's health, fearing greater policy uncertainty if China's top leader were to pass away. Deng spearheaded China's transition to a market-based economy in 1978 and still wields considerable influence over economic policy, even at the age of 92.  

However, many analysts said the stock market declines were an overreaction and Deng's potential incapacitation or death would have little real economic impact. "While Deng is the architect of China's economic reforms, the country has become much less dependent on any single leader over the past 20 years," said Andrew Collier, a China analyst with the Rhodium Group, a consulting firm. "Its economy and institutions have matured to the point where growth will continue regardless of leadership changes at the top."

The declines were also exaggerated by some investors' tendency to follow other stock markets in Asia, several analysts said. Markets across the region were down about 1-2% today on weakness in U.S. markets overnight. "There is a lot of herd mentality in China's stock markets that leads to overreactions to any kind of news, whether positive or negative," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. 

China's economy has seen slower growth in recent years but continues to expand at over 6% annually, supported by strong consumer spending and technology sectors. Deng's push to open up China to foreign investment and embrace private enterprise unleashed decades of rapid economic growth in China. But economists say China has developed its own economic momentum that no longer relies on directives from a single leader.

While Deng still weighs in on some high-level political and economic decisions, day-to-day governance and policymaking in China is now carried out by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. They are expected to continue China's gradual economic liberalization and reform regardless of leadership changes.

"Deng set China on a course that its current leaders have little incentive or intention to radically change," Kuijs said. "So while his eventual passing will be an important symbolic moment, we expect limited economic impact."

Barring any unforeseen health crises, most analysts expect a smooth political succession and continuity of economic policy even after Deng's death. For global markets and China's trading partners, Deng's health woes may cause temporary jitters but are unlikely to signify any real turning point for the world's second-largest economy.
