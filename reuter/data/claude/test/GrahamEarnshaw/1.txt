China Imposes 15 Percent Preferential Tax Rate for Foreign Banks Doing Yuan Business 

China's Ministry of Finance announced today that qualified foreign banks operating in China will enjoy a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15 percent for their yuan-denominated business. The preferential rate will apply retroactively from January 1 this year. 

The move is seen as an effort by China to further open up its financial sector to foreign competition and also promote the internationalization of its currency, the yuan or renminbi. By offering tax incentives for foreign banks to conduct more yuan-denominated business, China hopes to accelerate the use of its currency in cross-border trade and investments.

At present, most foreign banks operating in China are subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25 percent. The preferential rate of 15 percent will apply to foreign banks' yuan-denominated income from areas such as loans, bonds, deposits, fund sales, and currency exchange. Income from non-yuan businesses will still be taxed at 25 percent. The preferential policy will be in effect for five years.

“This tax cut shows China's determination to open its financial sector wider,” said Wang He, a financial analyst at Zhongtai Securities based in Shanghai. “Lowering costs for foreign banks to do yuan business encourages them to develop more yuan products and services, which in turn promotes the international use of the Chinese currency.” 

The Chinese government has taken various steps to support the yuan's internationalization, including launching yuan-denominated crude oil futures this year, a move that aids the use of the yuan to settle transactions of China's largest commodity imports. China is also planning to develop yuan-denominated commodities futures for copper, natural rubber, and other resources.

Major Chinese banks, primarily the big four state-owned banks, dominate China's banking sector. Foreign banks have long faced various restrictions in conducting banking business in China. The preferential tax policy, together with other opening measures such as easing foreign ownership caps on Chinese banks and asset management firms, suggests the country's regulators are addressing some long-standing concerns of foreign financial firms.

Even with the tax incentives, foreign banks still face significant challenges to grow their yuan businesses and gain a larger foothold in China due to the entrenched positions of state banks. But for some foreign banks already expanding their yuan offerings in Hong Kong, the new policy at least provides extra motivation for them to bring more yuan products into China to tap the huge domestic market. For China, further opening of its financial sector—even at a gradual pace—is a strategic move that encourages competition and brings in foreign expertise and resources to strengthen the sector.

In summary, the preferential tax rate policy underlines China's commitment to boost the international role of its currency through further opening and reform of its financial markets. While foreign banks have more opportunities to develop their yuan businesses in China thanks to such incentives and a transparent regulatory environment, stiff competition from Chinese state banks means gaining substantial market share ultimately depends on offering innovative products, quality services and establishing firm local partnerships. Overall, increasing openness in China's banking sector benefits both foreign and domestic players, and boosts the vibrancy and global reach of its financial markets.
