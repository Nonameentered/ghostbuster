China's Interbank Market Sees Surge in Trading Volume as State Banks Withdraw from Secondary Markets  

China's interbank bond market saw a surge in trading volume this week as major state-owned banks withdrew from secondary markets. The volume of repurchase agreements, or repos, in the interbank market reached 4.9 trillion yuan ($753 billion) on Tuesday, more than double the daily average last week. 

The spike in volume comes as major Chinese banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China, pulled back from secondary markets. The state-run banks, which dominate China's interbank market, are restricting new counterparty exposure and trimming existing positions to meet year-end liquidity targets set by regulators, according to market sources.

The moves by the big banks have caused smaller lenders and non-bank financial institutions to flock to the interbank market to secure short-term funding. "There is a liquidity squeeze in the interbank market as state banks have turned cautious. The mid- and small-sized banks have to source more money from the interbank market to fill the gap," said a money market trader at a Chinese brokerage.

The cost of short-term borrowing also rose as the scramble for liquidity pushed up interbank rates. The volume-weighted average seven-day repo rate in the interbank market climbed to 2.9% Tuesday, up nearly 40 basis points from last week and just below the one-year high. Some small lenders were paying over 3% for overnight repo agreements, traders said.

China's central bank has avoided injecting liquidity through open market operations for more than two weeks, putting additional strain on the interbank market. The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China has been draining cash through its medium-term lending facility and open market operations since early November to curb leverage and slow growth in money supply. 

Traders expect interbank rates and volume to remain elevated for the rest of the month as banks work to comply with regulatory requirements before the year-end. The ample liquidity that banks hold for year-end regulatory purposes often flows back into the interbank markets in early January, which could ease the current squeeze on smaller lenders and bring down interest rates.
