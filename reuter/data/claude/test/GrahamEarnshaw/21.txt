China Approves Four More Foreign Banks for Local Currency Business in Pudong Zone  

The Chinese government has given approval for four additional foreign banks to conduct local currency business in Shanghai's Pudong Financial District, according to statements from the People's Bank of China and Shanghai government earlier today. The move is another signal of China opening up its financial services sector, part of an ongoing effort to liberalize China's regulations and encourage global investment.  

Previously, only some large international  banks like Citigroup, HSBC and JP Morgan Chase were permitted to conduct domestic Chinese renminbi financial transactions in the Pudong Financial District. The new approvals expand the pool to include ANZ Bank, Banco Santander Central Hispano, Deutsche Bank and UBS. The approvals mean these banks will now be able to offer financial products and services using renminbi with both retail and institutional customers in the Pudong zone.  

China continued to slowly open up its financial sector to foreign investment over the last decade. Foreign banks have long complained of tightly restricted access to the Chinese market. But China has been selective, gradually allowing more foreign participation to encourage foreign investment and expertise to strengthen China's financial sector, while also managing risks. The Pudong district was created in the early 1990s as a hub for China's financial services industry, located adjacent to Shanghai's central business district.  

"This is another constructive and welcome step in the broader process of opening up China's financial markets," said Annalise Action, Chief Economist at British banking group HSBC. "Allowing more international participants in the Pudong zone helps support risk management standards, introduce new technologies and financing tools, and promotes the internationalization of China's currency."

However, regulatory limits on foreign banks remain, including ownership restrictions. Bill Bishop, an independent financial analyst who publishes Sinocism, a widely read China newsletter, said "These moves are strategically incremental. Do not expect China to suddenly throw open the financial system. But the direction of travel is clear." The additional approvals are seen as a win-win by business groups, helping China achieve its economic reform goals while giving more freedom to foreign banks hungry to expand in China.
