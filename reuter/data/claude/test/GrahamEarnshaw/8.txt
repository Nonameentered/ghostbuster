Foreign Banks in Shanghai Face Delays in Starting Local Chinese Yuan Business Due to Regulatory and Operational Hurdles 

Shanghai—Several large foreign banks are facing delays in launching their local Chinese yuan businesses in Shanghai's new free trade zone due to regulatory and operational obstacles, according to people familiar with the matter.

 HSBC Holdings PLC, Standard Chartered PLC, Citigroup Inc. and others had originally hoped to begin offering yuan-denominated services to companies in the Shanghai zone by end of last year. But prolonged waits to obtain authorizations and licenses from Chinese regulators, uncertainty over some of the policy framework for the zone, and difficulties setting up the necessary IT and back office systems have forced some of the banks to push back their timelines to later this year or even early 2015, the people said.

The delays highlight the challenges foreign banks face expanding in China's restrictive banking system. The free trade zone was unveiled with great fanfare last September to serve as a testing ground for liberalizing China's rigid financial services sector. But many of the details around how the zone will operate remain murky, and global banks have struggled to get much clarity from regulators.

The foreign banks had planned to start offering services like accepting yuan-denominated deposits, making yuan loans and facilitating cross-border yuan trades for companies based in the zone or doing business there. But without securing the proper licenses and approvals, the institutions have been unable to engage in any local currency business. Most are still only allowed to provide dollar-based services.

Some of the operational hurdles also reflect the complications involved in establishing new IT and compliance systems at foreign banks that have complex global operations. The systems need to be tailored to handle accounts and transactions in yuan, which most of the large international banks have little experience with.

Bank executives remain optimistic they will ultimately get the go-ahead to launch their planned yuan businesses in the free trade zone. But until then, the delays are hampering the global banks’ ambitions to capitalize on what they see as a major opportunity to expand in China.
