China's Stock Markets Rise Calmly After Deng Xiaoping's Death 

China's stock markets rose modestly today, shrugging off concerns that the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could spark political or economic instability. The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.7% at 1,288.41, while the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 0.6% to 323.90.

Deng, who led China's economic reforms and opening to the West, died yesterday at the age of 92. Despite his towering stature, his death did not trigger panic selling in China's fledgling stock markets. Analysts said investors are confident that the country's gradual market-oriented reforms will continue under the new generation of leaders. 

"The direction set by Deng has broad consensus, so policy continuity is expected," said Wang Qing, an economist at JLM Pacific Epoch in Shanghai. "Also, Deng has been ill for so long that his death was largely priced into the market."

Deng championed market-based reforms starting in the late 1970s that resurrected China's moribund economy following the Cultural Revolution. He broke up collective farms, welcomed foreign investment, and allowed private businesses and markets to flourish. The results were spectacular, with China's economy growing at an average rate of more than 9% over the past two decades.

President Jiang Zemin, who visited Deng shortly before his death, praised him as the "chief architect" of China's reforms and said the country will "never forget his indelible historical contributions." Jiang and other top leaders are seen as adhering to Deng's pragmatic ideology of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics.
