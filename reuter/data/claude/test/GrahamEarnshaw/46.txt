U.S. Secretary of State Discusses China's WTO Entry During Beijing Visit  

BEIJING—U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Chinese officials today in Beijing to discuss a range of trade and security issues affecting the two nations. A key agenda item was China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which the U.S. supported in 2001.

Secretary Kerry said in a press conference that China's accession to the WTO "has been tremendously beneficial to the U.S. and the global economy over the last 15 years. China has reformed many of its trade practices, opened its market wider, and U.S. exports to China have increased by over 500 percent." However, Kerry also noted that more progress is needed. "Some of China's trade policies still do not fully comply with WTO rules, like intellectual property theft and theft of trade secrets. We want to work with China to make improvements in these areas."

The Chinese Vice Premier, Wang Yang, responded that China has made significant changes to comply with the WTO but needs time to fully adopt reformed practices. "China's economy and trade relationship with the world are still developing. But we are committed to progress that is meaningful and sustainable," said Vice Premier Wang. He also noted that China's growth benefits U.S. companies who export to China and U.S. consumers who buy affordable goods from China. "Trade is a win-win relationship that helps both sides," he said.  

Secretary Kerry's visit comes at a time of global economic uncertainty and increasing trade disputes between the U.S. and China. The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum to counter alleged dumping of products below cost, hurting American producers. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is considering further tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods  . China has responded with threats of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products like soybeans that could impact American farmers.

Despite trade frictions, China and the U.S. remain important partners on security and diplomatic matters like the denuclearization of North Korea. Secretary Kerry called for more cooperation to achieve a “peaceful resolution” on issues like North Korea's nuclear program. Vice Premier Wang agreed, saying "we must work as a team" to reduce global threats. The Secretary of State's visit is seen as an opportunity for open dialogue before more protectionist policies or geopolitical tensions emerge between the world's two largest economies. Overall, trade and global stability are poised to shape China-U.S. relations in the years to come.
