China's Financial Markets Anticipate Interest Rate Cut in First Quarter 

Economists and analysts expect China's central bank to cut interest rates in the first quarter of this year to support the slowing economy. Growth in the world's second largest economy weakened to 6.6% last year, the slowest pace in nearly 30 years, as weak domestic consumption and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war weighed on business activity.

 China's stock market has rallied this year on expectations policymakers will loosen policy settings to spur business investment and consumer spending. The benchmark CSI 300 Index has climbed nearly 7% so far this year. Meanwhile, China's 10-year government bond yields have declined to near historic lows, indicating bond traders also foresee easier monetary policy.

"The government needs to cut rates to shore up confidence in the economy," said Chen Xing, an economist at China University of Finance. "Private sector investment remains sluggish and consumption is weak. Rate cuts are needed to boost market sentiment."

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) last cut the benchmark lending rate in November 2015. China's central bank is more likely to cut rates now given declining inflationary pressures. China's consumer price index rose just 2.3% in December, well below the government's target of around 3%. Slowing factory gate inflation also points to weakening demand in China's industrial sector.

PBOC Governor Yi Gang said last week the central bank has "plenty of room for maneuverability" on monetary policy. Analysts expect the PBOC may cut the one-year lending rate by at least 10 basis points in the first quarter, with some economists forecasting up to 30 basis points of reductions. Looser monetary policy is also likely to be paired with more government spending on infrastructure to boost the economy.

"The combination of rate cuts and more fiscal stimulus should help stabilize China's growth at around 6% this year," said Iris Pang, economist at ING Bank. However, others warn that excessive policy easing could exacerbate risks in China's financial system, without spurring consumption if households remain reluctant to spend. The central government is pushing for structural reforms to transition China to a more consumption and services-driven economy. Easier monetary policy alone may not be sufficient to boost sustainable growth over the long run.
