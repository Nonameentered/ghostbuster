Shanghai's Pudong Zone sees surge in property market thanks to foreign banks moving over  

The Pudong New Area of Shanghai has experienced a boom in its property market recently, fueled in large part by major foreign banks relocating their China headquarters to the financial hub. According to industry data, property prices in Pudong rose over 15% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, far outpacing the rest of Shanghai and other top-tier Chinese cities.

The momentum is built on Pudong's growing status as an international financial center. Last year, HSBC and Standard Chartered announced plans to move their China headquarters to Pudong. This month, Citigroup also disclosed intentions to shift its China head office to Pudong from downtown Shanghai. The clustering of multinational banks is attracting more financial institutions and professional services firms to Pudong, driving demand for high-end office space and expensive apartments.  

"Pudong is cementing its position as China's premiere financial hub, which makes it a magnet for large financial companies and banking executives," said Richard Chen, Head of Research at Shanghai Homelink Real Estate Agency Co. "This in turn is fueling the property market with the relocation of employees, as well as new buyers attracted to Pudong's growing importance and status."

Residential property prices in prime areas of the Lujiazui financial district in Pudong have risen over 20% over the past year, according to Shanghai Homelink data. Rent for high-end office space in prime Pudong skyscrapers has also jumped by more than a quarter. The price premium on properties in Pudong over other Shanghai districts is the largest in recent years.

The surge in Pudong's property market is a sign of the growing divide between China's top-tier cities and surrounding areas. While major urban centers like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen see strong demand and price appreciation, smaller cities and certain outskirts are suffering from oversupply and weak sales. Regional governments have taken measures this year to boost their property markets, including relaxing down payment rules for first-time buyers.

The shift of foreign banks to Pudong is part of China's broader opening of its financial sector to international companies. Foreign banks have long faced restrictions on their operations in China but are now able to take majority control of local joint ventures and expand their branch networks. The establishment of new China headquarters in Shanghai's free trade zone has provided foreign banks greater flexibility in conducting business renminbi and with Chinese clients.  

Industry analysts expect continued momentum in Pudong's property market as more international companies plant their flag in the area. Barring major economic shocks or policy tightening, demand for offices and high-end housing in Pudong looks set to outpace other Shanghai districts for the foreseeable future. While a boon for investors and homeowners, the property boom may exacerbate concerns over lack of affordable housing in Shanghai and rising inequality in China's wealthiest cities.
