China Expands B Shares Market to Lure Foreign Investors 

The Chinese government announced today that it will open its B-share stock market to foreign investors for the first time. B-shares are stocks of Chinese companies listed in mainland China and traded in foreign currencies. They have been limited to Chinese citizens and select foreign institutions since they were launched in the early 1990s.

The move is aimed at attracting more foreign capital to China's stock markets and giving international investors greater access to the country's fast-growing economy. "Opening the B-share market is a milestone in China's financial market opening-up," said Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, at a press conference. "It shows China's determination to deeply integrate into the global market."

Under the new rules, qualified foreign institutional investors will be allowed to buy and sell B-shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The changes will take effect on July 1 of this year. Foreign individuals, however, will still be barred from directly purchasing B-shares. 

The B-share market has underperformed China's main stock indices in recent years due to limited participation. B-share stocks were valued at around $52 billion in 2018 compared with more than $6.5 trillion for China's broader A-share market. But B-shares offer foreign investors exposure to some of China's biggest state-owned enterprises in sectors like energy, telecommunications, and banking.

While China has taken steps to open its financial markets over the past decade, foreign ownership of mainland Chinese stocks remains limited. Lifting restrictions on the B-share market is the government's latest move to address international concerns over lack of access. But some market observers say B-shares need more reforms to significantly boost foreign participation.

"The B-share market is too small to attract meaningful foreign flows on its own," said Andy Maynard, head of equities at Chinese investment manager Rainier Hedge. "Policymakers will need to merge B-shares into the much larger A-share market to really transform foreign participation in China's stock markets."  

The announcement is the second major opening of China's stock markets to foreigners this year. In February, regulators quadrupled the daily allowance of foreign money going into mainland A-shares via the Stock Connect trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai and Shenzhen.
