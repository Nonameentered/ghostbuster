China's Year of the Ox sees subdued but steady performance for stock markets, with eye on Hong Kong return 

The Year of the Ox commenced in China this month with a subdued but steady performance in the country's stock markets, as investors looked ahead to the long-awaited return of listings in Hong Kong.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended February up 2.6% from the start of the lunar new year, while the Shenzhen Component Index gained 3.4% over the same period. The modest gains came amid thin holiday trading volumes but suggested resilience in investor sentiment to start the new year.  

Equity markets in China were closed for a full week from February 11 to 17 to celebrate the Spring Festival, the country’s most important holiday. The new year got off to an ominous start, with retail sales data released just before the holiday break showing the slowest growth in five months. However, investors were buoyed by news late in the month that Tencent and Alibaba had gained approval from regulators to acquire financial firms, signaling possible easing of a long clampdown on the tech sector.

All eyes are now on Hong Kong, where a steady drip of Chinese companies are preparing to list under new rules allowing dual-class shares that provide more power to company founders. Beijing has made attracting tech IPOs to Hong Kong a key priority in its drive to strengthen the city as a global financial hub.

The first expected beneficiary is Kuaishou, a Tencent-backed video platform with more than 300 million daily users. Kuaishou aims to raise up to $5 billion in an IPO that would value the company at $50 billion, according to people familiar with the plans. The deal is poised to be Hong Kong's largest tech listing since Alibaba raised $13 billion in late 2019. 

Other Chinese tech unicorns like Didi Chuxing, Meituan and ByteDance are also reported to be preparing to list in Hong Kong this year. “The pipeline of Chinese tech mega-IPOs is building up swiftly, and Hong Kong is set to be a key beneficiary,” said Philippe Espinasse, an independent capital markets adviser and former IPO banker.

The surge of tech listings could provide ballast for Hong Kong's equity market, which dropped 9.7% over the course of 2020 due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and US-China political tensions. The new year has seen a modest uptick, with the Hang Seng Index gaining 3.2% so far in February.     

Regulators in Hong Kong introduced new listing rules in 2018 that allow companies to use a dual-class structure, opening the door for tech companies with weighted voting rights to list in the city. But the rules were not put into effect until late 2020, prompting some companies to choose US exchanges over Hong Kong for their IPOs.  “The listing of Kuaishou will be an important test case for how investors receive new economy companies under the revamped Hong Kong rules,” said Lai, head of China research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
