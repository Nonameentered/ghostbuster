China Launches National State Debt Trading Market to Combat Irregularities

China recently launched a national electronic platform for trading government bonds in an effort to improve transparency and tackle irregularities in the state debt market. The trading system went live on September 23 and allows investors to buy and sell treasury bonds between financial institutions. 

The launch of the national debt trading platform comes after authorities investigated several cases of misconduct in China's bond market. Regulators found irregularities such as insider trading, market manipulation, and illegal bond issuances. The new trading system aims to address these problems by improving transparency and facilitating the free flow of information in the market.

China's bond market has grown rapidly in recent years to become the second largest in the world. However, it has also been plagued by inefficiencies and irregular practices due to lack of transparency and fragmentation. Bond trading has traditionally taken place through decentralized over-the-counter dealings between financial institutions, with little regulatory oversight.

The new trading platform will aggregate buy and sell orders for government bonds from around the country in one place for the first time. All secondary market transactions of treasury bonds will now be conducted through the system. The authorities expect the centralized platform to strengthen regulation of trading activities and make the market fairer and more efficient.

The trading system is operated by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS), under the management of the People's Bank of China (PBOC). The launch of the platform is part of China's efforts to open up its financial markets and give foreign investors greater access. The PBOC said the system will facilitate foreign institutions to invest in China's bond market.
