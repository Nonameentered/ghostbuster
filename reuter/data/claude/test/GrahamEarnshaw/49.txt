Shanghai Businessman Confident in Policy Stability Following Deng Xiaoping's Death

Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader and economic reform architect, passed away last week at the age of 92. While Deng's death marked the end of an era, Shanghai businessman Jiang Wenhu remains optimistic about China's ongoing market reforms and opening to the world. 

Jiang, the founder and CEO of Shanghai Manufacturing Solutions, a maker of industrial components, expressed confidence in China's political and economic direction. "The policies of reform and opening up have been institutionalized over the past few decades under Deng's leadership. While his death is no doubt a loss, the broad direction of China's path forward will remain," Jiang said.

Jiang started his company in Shanghai's Pudong district in 1990 as one of China's first privately-owned manufacturers, taking advantage of both Deng's economic reforms and Shanghai's status as a pilot city for business liberalization. His company has grown into a major supplier for Chinese and international infrastructure firms, with over 5,000 employees across multiple locations. 

"Deng maintained an open mind, pursued pragmatic policies that worked, and was willing to experiment," Jiang said. "That entrepreneurial spirit led to the rapid development of China's private sector and has become engrained in Shanghai's business culture." 

The private sector is responsible for driving much of China's economic growth and innovation. Many in the business community point to Deng's 1992 southern tour, where he reaffirmed China's commitment to economic reforms, as pivotal in unleashing pent-up entrepreneurial energy. Since then, Shanghai in particular has served as an incubator for private enterprises in industries ranging from finance to retail to biotech.

Jiang acknowledges risks remain, including tensions with the US and the possibility of a slowed global economy. However, he believes current leader Xi Jinping will continue advancing the pace of reform. "While Deng's bold vision made all this possible, China's leadership has evolved with the times," Jiang said. 

Deng passed away amid China's continued rise as a global power. The Tiananmen protests of 1989 demonstrated demands for both economic and political change, putting Deng's reforms at risk. His subsequent push to reinvigorate economic opening up shaped modern China. For private businessmen like Jiang Wenhu, Deng's lasting legacy is a prosperous and globally engaged China, as well as an entrepreneurial spirit that lives on in Shanghai.
