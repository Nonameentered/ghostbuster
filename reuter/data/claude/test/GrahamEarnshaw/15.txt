China's Central Bank Orders State Banks to Stop Speculative Trading of State Debt and Invest in State Enterprises 

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued an edict today directing China's large state-owned commercial banks to curb speculative trading of government bonds and instead boost lending to state-owned enterprises. The move is aimed at redirecting capital from China's booming bond market to support government economic priorities.

For the past several years, China's government bond market has seen explosive growth, with trading volumes frequently surpassing China's major stock exchanges. State banks and other financial institutions have been active participants, buying and selling government bonds to profit from price fluctuations and interest rate changes. 

The PBOC said this speculative trading has led to undesirable volatility  and "herding effects" in the market. In a statement, the central bank said state banks should "vigorously support the development of the real economy, especially state-owned enterprises." The banks were directed to increase medium-and long-term loans to state companies by at least 30% over the next two years.

The new policy is consistent with China's aim of maintaining steady economic growth through state-led investment, particularly in sectors aligned with Made in China 2025, the government's plan to dominate high-tech industries. However, some economists warn the policy could exacerbate existing problems like overcapacity and debt risks from bloated state companies.

"This seems to double down on the old playbook of government-directed lending to state firms with little consideration of risks or returns," said Chen Long, China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics. "While it may give a temporary boost to growth, it bodes poorly for much-needed reforms to China's financial system and state sector."

China's major state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, have little choice but to comply with the PBOC's demands. Together they control nearly half of all bank assets in China. But privately, bankers grumble that ramping up lending to chronically mismanaged state firms is unlikely to end well.

The PBOC's move is the latest intervention aimed at reining in China's volatile financial markets. Earlier this month, the central bank flooded the banking system with $188 billion to end a liquidity squeeze, even as it proclaimed China's economic fundamentals remained sound. Such contradictions highlight the challenges of a state-dominated system walking a tightrope between reform and control.
