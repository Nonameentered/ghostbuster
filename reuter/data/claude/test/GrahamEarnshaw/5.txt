China's B Share Companies Show Signs of Improvement in 1996, with Further Progress Expected in 1997, According to Analysts 

Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges showed signs of improvement in their business performance and corporate governance practices in 1996, according to analysts. The analysts expect further meaningful progress in 1997 as these companies continue to adapt to international standards and open China's capital markets.

The B share market, composed of Chinese companies listed in foreign currencies, was launched in 1992 to attract foreign investors. However, it struggled in the early years due to lack of transparency, profitability issues, and little knowledge of international best practices among Chinese companies. 

In 1996, more B share companies started publishing annual reports with audited financial statements, holding regular press conferences, and disclosing key business metrics and risks. "Last year we saw a number of B share companies really make an effort to communicate better with international investors. This is a very positive sign and we expect this trend to gain further momentum," said Jenny Wang, China analyst at CLSA.

Performance-wise, more B share companies reported profit growth and expansion into new business areas. "Some companies have successfully turned around their business, improved cost control, and diversified revenue streams. Valuations of many B share companies still remain very attractive, offering opportunities for strong investment returns as the market and regulators continue to mature," said Michael Dong, investment director at JP Morgan Asset Management. 

Looking ahead to 1997, analysts expect B share companies to work to meet higher disclosure requirements and compliance thresholds from the regulators. There are also hopes for stronger protection of minority shareholder rights. Some analysts argue greater alignment with international standards could pave the way for more B share companies to dual-list in Hong Kong, providing more liquidity.

While risks and weaknesses still exist, analysts are optimistic about the outlook for China's B share market. With increasing experience, more B share companies are poised to becomeglobal competitors, they say. Overall, analysts point to 1996 as a turning point and expect the positive momentum to accelerate in 1997.
