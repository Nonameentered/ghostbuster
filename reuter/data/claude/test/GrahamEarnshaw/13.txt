China's Stock Exchanges Remain Most Open and Market-Driven in the Country, Analysts Say 

China's stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen remain the most open and market-driven sectors of the country's economy, according to analysts. Despite increasing government intervention in the private sector, China's equity markets are still largely guided by market forces, they say.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange were established in the early 1990s as China transitioned to a market economy. They were envisioned as a way to raise capital for Chinese companies and drive economic growth. Over the decades, they have become an important part of China's financial system and a vehicle for Chinese citizens to invest their savings.

Although the government maintains control and oversight over the exchanges, day-to-day trading is dictated by market supply and demand, not government directives. Prices of listed companies rise and fall based on investors' views of their growth and earnings potential, not government targets. The exchanges are home to both state-owned enterprises and private companies, with a mix of industries and sectors represented.

Some analysts argue that the Chinese government has been intervening more frequently in recent years, using policies and regulatory actions to prop up stock prices or restrict declines. However, others say these policies are employed judiciously and the government is not driving the overall upward or downward trend of the marketsâ€”those dynamics remain market-driven. The exchanges have also become more open to foreign investors over time, despite continuing restrictions.  

While China's economy remains partially centrally planned, the country's stock exchanges provide one area that operates based on free market principles of supply and demand and price discovery. Experts point to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as models of openness and market forces at work in China's economy, albeit with some level of government guidance and control. Overall, China's goal of encouraging market forces in its equity markets while also maintaining stability and oversight remains a balancing act.
