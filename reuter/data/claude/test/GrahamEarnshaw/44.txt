China's Young Urban Professionals: Fighting for Wealth and Success in a World Undreamed of by Their Communist Forebears

BEIJINGâ€”Wei Guo, 29, wakes up at 5:30 am every day, commutes across this sprawling megacity to his job as a data scientist at a fast-growing mobile app company, and spends his evenings hustling to advance his career. "Success is the only option," he says. "There are so many talented people in China, so you always need to fight to thrive."

Guo represents a generation that would have been unrecognizable to his Communist forebears just a generation ago. The economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s opened China to the global market and ushered in decades of double-digit growth. Today, China boasts over 400 million middle-income consumers and 700 companies valued at more than $1 billion. 

This new affluence has produced a large population of young professionals for which material gain and career ambition are a way of life. Their lives center around China's major cities, where high-paying jobs, luxury brands, and status symbols abound. "Our parents' generation valued political ideology and community," says Ling Zhao, a 31-year-old financier in Shanghai's glittering Pudong business district. "We value individual success and achievement."

Yet that success often comes at a high price. China's young professionals face immense pressure to earn and spend. Housing in cities like Beijing and Shanghai is among the most unaffordable in the world. And the culture emphasizes material displays of status like lavish weddings, luxury cars, and designer clothes. 

There is also cutthroat competition for good jobs. Because of China's large population and the legacy of the one-child policy, young Chinese professionals compete against many equally ambitious peers. The pressure to achieve begins early, as families invest heavily in their only child's education in the hopes they will land a lucrative job after university. 

"The competition is relentless," says Guo. "But we are willing to compete because we know that in China today, fortune and glory await those who strive the hardest." 

China's young professionals may face obstacles, but they also embody the country's hopes for the future. Their talent, ambition, and global outlook are propelling China's rise on the world stage. And their individualism and materialism reflect a nation eagerly embracing the trappings of capitalist modernity after decades of Communist austerity. For better and for worse, theirs is the bold new face of 21st-century China.
