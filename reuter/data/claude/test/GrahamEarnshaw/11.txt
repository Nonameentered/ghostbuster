U.S. Businessman Sentenced to 10 Years in Jail in China for Smuggling Garbage 

BEIJING - An American businessman named James Smith was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Chinese court today for smuggling hazardous waste into China last year. 

Mr. Smith, 57, was the owner of a plastic recycling company based in Los Angeles. According to Chinese officials, Mr. Smith directed the smuggling of over 1,000 tons of contaminated plastic garbage from the U.S. to China in containers falsely labeled as recycled plastics. The hazardous waste, containing high lead and toxic chemical levels, was intercepted by Chinese customs officials last summer.

The sentence is one of the harshest ever imposed for an environmental crime by Chinese authorities. It signals China's increasing intolerance for Western nations exporting their trash and pollution. 

"This case should serve as a warning to those who seek to damage China's environment through illegal transnational garbage dumping," the judge in the case said.

Mr. Smith's company collected plastics for recycling but secretly mixed in and exported hazardous waste to save costs. The company had been shipping 100 containers per week of plastic to China for over 10 years. Mr. Smith apologized in court for violating Chinese law but claimed he was unaware the shipments contained harmful waste. His legal defense argued the sentence was "excessively severe" given his lack of direct involvement.

The U.S. Embassy said they were disappointed by the verdict and sentence but respect China's laws. Still, the embassy has expressed concern over the harshness of the punishment and lack of due process in the speedy trial. Environmental groups, however, hailed the ruling as an important victory.

"For too long, developed nations have exploited developing countries by dumping waste and pollution there to avoid the costs of proper treatment and disposal at home," said Jane Li of the Natural Resources Defense Council's China program. "We hope this case will prompt governments to take responsibility for managing the waste they produce rather than exporting the problem elsewhere."

The plastic waste from Mr. Smith's company has been returned to the U.S. at a cost of over $10 million, according to Chinese media reports. Mr. Smith was also fined $5 million for the environmental damages. His company faces additional civil lawsuits in the U.S. related to the illegal shipment and disposal of medical and electronic waste.
