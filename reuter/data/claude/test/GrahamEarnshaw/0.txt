Analysts Expect China's B Share Markets to Recover in 1997 Due to Improving Economic Outlook, But Underlying Issues Remain  

China's B share markets are expected to post a strong recovery in 1997 after several years of lackluster performance, according to analysts. The Shanghai and Shenzhen B share indexes declined by 38% and 49% respectively between 1993 and 1996 as China's economy slowed and corporate profits weakened. However, with China's economic growth accelerating again to 9.7% in 1996 and a further pickup expected in 1997, analysts predict improved corporate earnings will lift the B share markets.

"The outlook for China's economy is increasingly robust, and this will translate to the B share markets this year," said Mark Mason, China strategist at J.P. Morgan. "We expect economic growth of 10% in 1997, which should boost corporate profits and drive the B share indexes at least 20 to 30% higher over the next 12 months."

China's B shares are listed in U.S. dollars on exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and were opened to foreign investors in 1992. They were meant to attract portfolio investment into China's economy. But after a strong start, the B share markets fell out of favor with foreign investors due to a lack of transparency, weak corporate governance, and a poor performance of state-owned enterprises which dominate the listings.

While an improving economy may give the B share markets a lift this year, analysts caution that structural issues still need to be addressed to sustain long-term investor interest. "The B share markets remain underdeveloped, with few quality companies and a lack of participation by institutional investors," said Jenny Qian, head of China research at Global Capital Partners. "Meaningful reform is still needed to strengthen regulation, improve access to information, and restructure state-owned enterprises."  

Some reforms are underway. China's securities regulator has pledged to tighten oversight of listed companies and enforce stronger penalties for violations. Exchanges have also made it easier for companies to list on the B share markets, leading to an influx of private enterprises with stronger growth. However, state-owned enterprises still make up the bulk of listings, and more needs to be done to reform these companies and increase their profitability and transparency. 

While forecasts point to a strong year for the B share indexes, the long-term outlook remains cloudy. "We expect a good performance in 1997, but whether this continues will depend on China's progress in building a fair and transparent market that appeals to long-term mutual fund and pension money,‚Äù said Mason. After several false starts, China's B share markets are at a crossroads. This year's recovery could signal they are finally gaining momentum - or mask underlying weaknesses keeping broader investor interest at bay. The direction of reform will determine which path the B share markets take.
