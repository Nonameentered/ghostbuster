China's Financial Overlords Successfully Force State Banks Out of Stock Markets 

China's top financial regulators have successfully forced the country's largest state-owned banks to exit their stock market investments and return their focus to traditional banking operations like lending, according to officials cited by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) this week. The move is aimed at reducing market distortions and speculation in China's often volatile stock markets.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank by assets, has sold off the remainder of its stock holdings and plans to refrain from equity market investments going forward. Likewise, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Bank of China, two other major state lenders, have liquidated their stock portfolios in recent months on orders from financial regulators. The banks were told to instead re-direct their capital to lending for the real economy, the officials said.

The crackdown on state banks' stock market activities is the latest in a series of measures by China's State Council and financial regulators to reduce risk and distortion in the country's financial system. Regulators have long been concerned about the sizable influence that large state-owned banks and financial institutions can have on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. By forcing the banks to exit the stock market and return to traditional commercial banking practices, regulators hope to let market forces play a greater role in allocating capital and determining stock prices.

The policy shift comes as China's economy continues to slow and regulators seek to boost lending to private companies and consumers. State banks disproportionately favor state-owned enterprises in their lending, so directing the banks away from stocks and towards private sector lending is seen as one way to support continued economic growth. The moves also come ahead of China's national parliament meeting in March, signaling financial stability and risk control are top priorities for the leadership.

Some analysts suggest the regulators' policy may be overzealous and risks cutting off capital flows into China's stock markets. However, others argue it will help prevent speculative bubbles from forming and lead to more sustainable growth in the long run. Either way, China's big state banks have little choice but to comply with the orders from Beijing as the government asserts control over nearly every aspect of the financial system. The era of unfettered stock market investments by China's state banks seems to have come to an abrupt end.
