Yuan expected to remain stable in first half of year despite record high foreign exchange reserves 

China's foreign exchange reserves hit $3.23 trillion at the end of January, the highest level on record. The reserves, which provide a buffer against currency shocks, have climbed for 11 consecutive months as the trade surplus widened. However, analysts expect the yuan currency to remain relatively stable in the first half of this year despite the build-up of reserves.

The yuan is allowed to move up or down 2% against the U.S. dollar each day. The central bank controls the exchange rate and often uses the reserves to prevent too much volatility. With a high level of reserves, the central bank has more firepower to smooth out movements in the exchange rate. However, government policy suggests currency stability is a priority and excessive moves in either direction will not be tolerated. 

“There is no evidence that a higher level of foreign exchange reserves translates directly into a weaker exchange rate,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. “Chinese policymakers value stability and predictability in the exchange rate.”

While a weaker yuan could help Chinese exporters, it may fuel capital outflows and discourage foreign investment into China's financial markets. The central bank hopes to attract more foreign participation in China's bond and stock markets to balance the capital flows. A stable currency is seen as crucial to achieve that.

Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said: “The PBOC will likely keep the yuan stable versus the U.S. dollar over the coming months to avoid revived capital outflow pressures." The central bank spent about $1 trillion of its reserves between late 2014 and early 2017 to curb too rapid of a depreciation.

The outlook for China's trade with the U.S. remains unclear given tensions between the two sides. However, China's exports to the rest of the world have held up well, contributing to its record surplus. While the high reserves provide insurance for the yuan, as long as China's trade performance remains strong and policymakers favor stability, the stockpile is unlikely to drive significant moves in the currency over the next six months. Overall, China's huge reserves and desire to keep control of exchange rate movements point to limited yuan fluctuations, especially in the upward direction.
