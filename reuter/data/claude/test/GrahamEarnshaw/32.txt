Citibank Begins Move to Shanghai's Pudong Zone for Chinese Yuan Business

Citibank announced today that it has begun moving some of its currency trading desks and client services to the Pudong business district of Shanghai to focus on the growing Chinese yuan business. The move marks the early stages of Citibank's strategy to establish China's largest foreign bank by assets by 2025. 

According to Citibank CEO Michael Corbat, "As the renminbi becomes a more significant currency on the global stage, we aim to strengthen our operations in China, particularly in Shanghai's Pudong financial hub. By moving parts of our foreign exchange business to Pudong, we can better serve our institutional and corporate clients conducting international business in Shanghai and throughout China."

Shanghai's Pudong New Area has emerged in recent decades as China's main financial center and a leading global financial hub. Citibank has maintained a presence in Pudong since the 1990s but will now expand to additional office space to accommodate currency trading staff and their tools and technology. The new trading floor is expected to be operational later this year, pending final regulatory approvals from Chinese authorities, and will enable Citibank to conduct onshore renminbi foreign exchange transactions, currency swaps, and options for multinational corporations and financial institutions.

"Locating our currency trading desks right in China's main financial center will allow us to facilitate growing volumes of renminbi transactions as cross-border trade and investing with China expands," said Tim Adams, Citibank's head of foreign exchange. According to Adams, daily renminbi turnover has increased fourfold over the past five years and Citibank's renminbi trading volumes have grown commensurately. "Establishing a larger presence in Pudong puts us in the heart of the action as renminbi internationalization accelerates," Adams said.   

Some analysts see Citibank's move as presaging a broader shift in global finance toward China and other emerging markets. "The center of gravity of the world's financial system is moving east at a rapid pace, pulled by the huge growth of wealth and trade in Asia," said Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary. "Citi's pivot to Pudong is a recognition of this tectonic shift and positions it well to benefit as Shanghai and China shape global financial markets in the coming decades."  

Overall, Citibank appears well positioned to capitalize on the internationalization of the renminbi and capture a large share of the fast-growing yuan market. By establishing a major base in Shanghai's Pudong district, Citibank gains both a symbolic and substantive foothold in China's ascendance as a dominant economic and financial power. Whether other global banks now follow Citibank's lead in building up their presence and yuan capabilities in China will be important to watch in the next few years.
