China's Financial Markets Calm After Deng Xiaoping's Death, but Analysts Warn of Volatility Ahead  

Shanghai—China's stock markets were steady today as the country mourned the death of former leader Deng Xiaoping. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index ended the day down a marginal 0.2% at 1124.31. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index was slightly up 0.1% at 896.12.

Deng was the paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992 and helped launched the country's transition to a market economy. His death this week at the age of 92 marks the passing of arguably China's most consequential leader in the post-Mao era. 

Market analysts were expecting significant volatility this week as news of Deng's poor health began to circulate earlier this month. However, the initial reaction has been muted as investors adopt a wait-and-see approach. 

“There is a lot of uncertainty about what comes next both politically and economically for China,” said Amanda Zhang, China economist at CLSA. “Markets tend to react negatively to uncertainty, but investors seem to want more clarity about the future path of leadership and reform before responding dramatically.”

With Deng gone, there are open questions about how China will navigate important policy issues like financial market reforms, trade negotiations with the U.S., and the pace of economic liberalization. Much will depend on how power is distributed among China's top political figures and whether new leadership will stay the course on Deng's market-oriented changes.

Looking ahead, analysts warn there could still be significant ups and downs in Chinese markets as investors process Deng's legacy and reassess the outlook.  “We have to steel ourselves for a period of increased volatility,” said Mark Stevens, head of China research at Goldman Sachs.  “There may be initial dips in the market as investors turn cautious.  But the more enduring impact will depend on where the leadership transition takes us and how credible successor policies appear.”

Continued steady leadership and a commitment to further opening China's economy could ultimately reassure investors and support market performance.  But policy missteps or power struggles could negatively impact investor sentiment and China's financial markets.”  For now, China and the world mourn the passing of Deng Xiaoping, the diminutive leader who changed the course of his country and reshaped global geopolitics through gradual yet unswerving determination in the face of countless obstacles and setbacks.  His radical vision and pragmatism lifted China from poverty to become a major world power.  The legacy of his leadership, for better and worse, will live on.
