China's Securities Authorities Crack Down on Listed Company for Illegally Trading Its Own Shares  

China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced today punitive actions against Mingwei Technology, a Shenzhen-listed mobile phone components maker, for illegally manipulating the stock price of the company through self-trading of its own shares. The CSRC found that Mingwei Technology's management and controlling shareholders engaged in self-trading over a 6 month period in 2018, trading over 590 million company shares and propping up the stock price.

The announcement from the CSRC stated that Mingwei Technology's Chairman, General Manager, and four other senior executives have been banned from trading stocks for life. The company was also fined 100 million yuan ($15 million USD) for the violations. The CSRC opened an investigation into Mingwei in January 2019 after a whistleblower reported suspicious trading activity.  

According to Chinese laws, listed companies and their senior management are prohibited from trading shares of their own company for their benefit. The laws aim to protect retail investors by preventing companies from artificially influencing the stock price or trading on insider information.

Self-trading has been an ongoing issue in China's stock markets despite frequent warnings and crackdowns from regulators. The government has struggled to eliminate loopholes and enforce the rules in China's large but relatively young stock markets. A similar case last year saw a large telecom equipment maker Manipulating and conceal important business Information in fiscal reports. It trading violating .The tightening enforcement actions symbolize regulators’ determination to improve market transparency and protect investors’ interests.

The latest punishment is one of the most severe handed down for self-trading violations and signals an escalation of enforcement actions, said Zhu Xiaochuan, a lawyer who specializes in Chinese securities law. “Regulators wanted to make an example of Mingwei Technology, he said. “The severe and sweeping penalties, including lifetime bans, show regulators will have no leniency for such serious infractions now. This crackdown should serve as an effective deterrent.”

Mingwei Technology's stock price has tumbled over 25% since the investigation was announced. Retail investors who suffered losses due to the price manipulation may pursue legal action against Mingwei to recover damages, according to Chinese media reports. The crackdown on Mingwei Technology is the latest in a string of penalties imposed on Chinese companies for fraudulent market practices as Beijing works to shore up confidence in China's capital markets.
