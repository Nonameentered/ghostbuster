China's A Share Markets to Rise Strongly in 1997 Despite Government Crackdown: Analysts 

China's A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen are poised to rise strongly in 1997 despite continued government efforts to curb speculation, according to analysts. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index climbed 16% in 1996, while the Shenzhen Composite Index jumped 26% over the same period. Analysts expect the bull run to continue this year, forecasting gains of 20-30% for the key indexes.

The optimism comes despite several government measures in 1996 aimed at cooling speculative fever and controlling rapid share price inflation. These included hiking transaction fees, tightening margin lending rules, and clamping down on insider trading and price manipulation. However, analysts say these actions have only had a temporary effect and have not addressed the root causes driving the rally - strong economic fundamentals and excess liquidity.

China's economy grew at an estimated 9.6% in 1996, down slightly from 10.2% in 1995 but still at a pace the rest of the world envies. Disposable incomes are rising and consumption is booming, especially for telecoms, technology, energy, and transportation stocks. At the same time, China's high personal savings rate of around 40% of GDP means individuals have a lot of money to invest in the stock market. "The government measures were like applying a bandage to a burst artery. They have not addressed the huge surplus of money and demand for stocks," said Edith Hui, head of research at Donghai Securities.

The A share markets remain dominated by individual investors, with institutions owning less than 10% of shares. This amplifies volatility and speculative tendencies. However, it also means the markets remain largely driven by fundamentals. As long as economic growth stays strong and companies continue to deliver good results, share prices will rise, analysts say.

Corporate earnings for 1996 are estimated to have grown around 15-20% for Shanghai and Shenzhen listed firms. With the P/E ratio of the Shanghai market still at around 15x 2016 earnings - low compared to other emerging markets - there remains ample scope for valuations to increase further, analysts argue. 
   
"The market is not cheap but not expensive either," said Bao Hongwei, chief strategist at China Investment Securities. "With money supply growth still rapid, we think there is little that can derail this train in the short to medium term. The best investors can do is just get on board." Unless there is a major economic crisis, analysts conclude, China's A share bulls will continue to run in 1997.
