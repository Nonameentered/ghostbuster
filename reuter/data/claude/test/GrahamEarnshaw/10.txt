China to Tighten Controls on Immature Financial Markets to Curb Irregularities, Bankers Say 

China's central government is set to implement stricter controls and regulations on the country's developing financial markets to address issues like insider trading, market manipulation, and other irregularities, according to senior bankers with knowledge of the plans. 

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and other agencies are drafting new rules to curb practices that have led to volatility and undermined confidence in China's stock and bond markets in recent years. The overheated markets have attracted hordes of novice investors but lack adequate transparency and oversight, the bankers said.

"China's capital markets have grown rapidly but remain immature, with weaknesses that can potentially undermine the healthy development of the markets," said Wang Junmin, Chief Risk Officer at China Merchants Bank. "Tighter regulation and enforcement are sorely needed to instill investor confidence and ensure stable market operations."

Among the priorities are strengthening rules around disclosing major shareholder stakes in listed companies and preventing major shareholders from improperly influencing stock prices. Regulators also aim to bar fund managers and brokerages from hyping stocks to boost trading volumes and profits.

The new rules would expand the CSRC's authority to investigate and penalize illegal activities like using social media to spread rumors or manipulate share prices. They would also tighten restrictions on margin financing and short selling, which the regulators believe have been used in some cases to artificially influence markets.

The clampdown reflects a broader push by President Xi Jinping and other leaders to reduce financial risk and establish markets that serve the "real" economy. While China has allowed markets to play an increasing role in the economy, the Communist Party wants to ensure they contribute to stable growth and wealth creation. 

"Excessive speculation, irregularity, and chaos in capital markets will not benefit the broad masses of the people," a recent People's Daily editorial said. "Regulation should help markets serve the real needs of companies and investors, not become a tool for a few to reap huge profits."

The new rules are expected to be rolled out in the coming months, though final details are still being worked out. Senior executives at several major Chinese and foreign banks confirmed the accounts but requested anonymity because the plans aren't public.
