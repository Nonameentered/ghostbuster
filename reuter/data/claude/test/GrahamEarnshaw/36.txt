China's Financial Markets Rally After Death of Deng Xiaoping: Analysts 

China's stock markets and currency rose sharply today following the announcement of the death of Deng Xiaoping, the former leader who spearheaded China's economic reforms and opening to the global economy. The Shanghai Composite index closed up 3.2% and the Shenzhen Composite index rose 4.1%. The yuan currency also strengthened by 0.6% against the U.S. dollar.

Analysts cited optimism that the reformist policies championed by Deng will continue even in his absence. "Deng's vision for China's economic transformation has been firmly institutionalized and there is unlikely to be a significant change in direction," said Wendy Liu, head of China strategy at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong. "China's leaders today all came of age during Deng's era and are entirely aligned with his market-oriented approach."

Deng initiated a series of market reforms in the late 1970s that dismantled collective farming, opened China to foreign investment, and spurred the development of stock exchanges and other financial markets. China's economy has grown at an average annual pace of 10% over the past 30 years, lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty.

However, China's markets and currency remained volatile as investors waited to see the government's official response and directives following Deng's passing at the age of 92. President Xi Jinping called Deng "the chief architect of China's reform and opening up." In a statement, Xi said, "Deng Xiaoping's historic reform and opening up reshaped the destiny of contemporary China and profoundly changed the destiny of the Chinese nation."

Analysts said China's leaders may soon convene a high-level economic policy meeting to reaffirm their commitment to further reform and express confidence in economic growth targets. "A meeting like that, especially with emphatic statements about continuity with Deng's vision, will lend further support to market sentiment," said Ronald Hua, economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.

While Deng had not held official leadership roles in China for several years prior to his death, he remained an influential figure and his name is still invoked to justify policy changes. His demise is a symbolic turning point as China seeks new sources of legitimacy for its economic reforms, but few expect a radical departure from Deng's stabilizing influence and prudent pragmatism. China's markets have reflected that optimistic continuityâ€”at least for today.
