China likely to slow financial market reform as stability becomes top priority

China is expected to slow the pace of financial market reforms and openness to prioritize stability, according to government advisers and analysts. Rapid changes to liberalize the financial sector could destabilize the economy at a time of slowing growth and uncertainty from the trade war with the United States.

The pace of change since President Xi Jinping launched ambitious reforms in 2013 to open China's capital markets and internationalize the yuan has been rapid. Among the significant measures were linking the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, opening China's stock and bond markets to more foreign investment, and improving access for foreign firms.

But China's policymakers are now concerned about the impact of slowing growth on jobs and social stability. The government's target of 6 to 6.5 percent GDP growth for 2019 is the lowest in decades. In this environment, radical reforms are seen as too risky. "Stability is the top priority," said a government economist who advises policymakers. "Reforms have to take into account the current situation."

Policymakers are worried reforms could exacerbate capital flight from China just as the economy slows. The yuan has already weakened nearly 10 percent against the dollar over the past year, in part due to the trade war, and further opening could put more downward pressure on the Chinese currency.

The pace of new reforms and market openings has visibly slowed this year. The Shanghai-London Stock Connect, meant to launch in December, has been delayed. So too has further expansion of the quotas for foreign investment in Chinese stocks and bonds.

Some economists argue China needs faster reforms to address structural problems. "Deeper reform and further opening up, especially in the financial sector, should continue," said Zhu Ning, deputy director of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. "Reform and opening up will help mitigate risks in the long run."

But even pro-reform policymakers and analysts acknowledge now may not be the right time to push hard on significant changes, especially with the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks still uncertain. "Under the current circumstances, it's understandable to slow the pace of financial reform," said Li Yang, a former central bank adviser. "But in the long run, reform and opening up should continue."
