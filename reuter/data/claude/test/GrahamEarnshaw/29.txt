China's Ban on State Bank's Trading of State Debt Secondary Market Causes Difficulty, but Beijing Expected to Take Measures 

China's regulator recently banned five of the country's largest state-owned banks from trading bonds issued by local governments on the secondary market, a move aimed at reining in rising debt risks. However, the policy is causing liquidity issues and higher borrowing costs for many regional authorities. 

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission banned the banks from underwriting on behalf of local governments and then also trading those bonds on the secondary market. The goal is to curb the practice of banks using their market power to artificially inflate the value of local government bonds. Some critics argue this also obscures the real financial health of China's local governments, many of which are heavily indebted.

The ban is already creating difficulties, though. Many local governments rely on the secondary market to adjust their debt levels and liquidity. Without the participation of the big banks, the secondary market has weakened, and regional authorities are facing higher interest rates for new bond issues. 

The disruption has led many analysts to expect Beijing will take measures to ensure stable financing for local governments. "The regulators may fine-tune the rules to allow more flexibility for banks to trade government bonds under preset quotas," said Liao Jianwen, director of the finance and economics department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen).

Some possibilities include allowing more types of institutional investors into the secondary market for government bonds, such as insurance companies, or issuing more short-term bills to provide cash for local authorities. The central government could also directly buy more local government bonds to keep the system liquid.

While the crackdown on underwriting abuses is seen as necessary to contain China's rising local debt, which some analysts estimate has reached over 60 percent of GDP, the regulators will likely move carefully to avoid disrupting a system that has ensured affordable funding for local infrastructure and public services for decades. A balancing act between risk management and stability maintenance is needed, and all signs point to Beijing navigating changes in a gradual fashion.
