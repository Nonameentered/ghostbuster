Chinese Yuan Remains Stable Despite Death of Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping, Dealers Say  

The Chinese yuan remained stable against major currencies today despite news of the death of former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, according to foreign exchange dealers. Deng, who led China's economic reforms starting in 1978 and pushed for the nation's opening to the global economy, passed away at the age of 92.

While Deng had not been actively involved in politics for several years, news of his death led to concerns that it may impact the Chinese economy and financial markets. However, the yuan did not show significant volatility today in onshore and offshore trading.   

The stability indicates that China's economic reforms have established momentum that is resilient despite changes in leadership, analysts said. Deng's open-door policies and market-based reforms transformed China's economy from a poor, insular nation into a global trading powerhouse and the world's second largest economy. His influence reshaped Chinese society and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.

The yuan strengthened slightly to 6.4310 per U.S. dollar in onshore trading and was up 0.05% offshore at 6.4265 per dollar today. The muted reaction suggests China's currency policy and broader financial reforms will remain on course, according to foreign exchange strategists. 

"Deng Xiaoping's death is unlikely to alter the overall economic policy framework in China, including the managed float of the yuan," said Sam Pemberton, head of Asia FX strategy at Standard Investments Bank in Hong Kong. "China has a long-term plan to internationalize the yuan and open its capital accounts, and its leaders today remain committed to that strategy. The policy direction is set to continue, regardless of changes at the very top."

China is promoting the yuan as a global reserve currency and has taken steps to loosen capital controls and open its financial markets. While China still maintains a tight grip on the yuan, it gave markets a greater role in determining the exchange rate in 2015 and introduced trading of the yuan versus a basket of currencies. The yuan has strengthened about 60% against the dollar in the past decade.
