China to Fund Major Toll Highways Through Stock Market Listings, Despite Broker Concerns

The Chinese government announced plans this week to fund the construction of over 2,000 miles of new toll highways over the next decade through stock market listings of the state-owned highway operators. The National Development and Reform Commission said initial public offerings of shares in six major highway operators will raise around $50 billion in private capital to supplement government infrastructure spending. 

The plan is controversial, however, with some brokerages and investors questioning whether the money raised will be enough given the huge costs of highway construction in China. There are also concerns about overcapacity in the highway sector and the ability of the new toll roads to generate profits and returns for shareholders.

China is in the midst of a infrastructure boom with the government investing heavily in roads, railways, ports and airports. The country already has the world's largest highway network at over 130,000 km. The new plan aims to expand this by 15% over the next 10 years to support continued economic growth in more remote inland provinces.

While government policy banks will provide some financing and subsidies for the projects, the stock market listings are designed to raise a greater share of funding from private investors and reduce the debt burden on state-owned companies. The six highway groups that will issue shares, including industry leaders like Shanghai International Port Group, will use the proceeds to build new highways in north and west China.

However, some analysts argue the funding model is flawed. Xu Bin, transport analyst at China Galaxy Securities, said building highways in inland China is very expensive due to difficult terrain and it may cost 3 to 4 times more per kilometer than in coastal regions. But toll fees and traffic volumes in these areas are unlikely to be high enough to generate decent returns for shareholders, he said.
