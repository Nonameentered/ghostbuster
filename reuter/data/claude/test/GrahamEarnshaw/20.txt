China to Reform Government Debt Markets to Increase Flexibility and Responsiveness to Market Forces, Officials and Analysts Say 

The Chinese government announced sweeping reforms to its government debt markets this week aimed at making them more flexible, responsive to market forces, and supportive of the country's long-term economic growth plans. The changes will give more power and flexibility to the market in setting interest rates for government bonds, while also opening the market to more participants, according to officials and analysts.

The changes are intended to make China's debt markets more compatible with its increasingly market-based economy and support economic rebalancing toward more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption rather than government investment and exports. More flexibility in interest rates will allow the markets to better reflect the supply and demand for capital based on China's economic conditions. Broader access will bring in more investors to support the growth and liquidity of the market.

"These reforms are crucial to building a vibrant, market-based system for government debt that will lower borrowing costs over the long run and support China's economic transition," said Liao Qun, chief economist for China at Citic Bank International. "A more flexible, open market for government bonds will help policymakers gain a more accurate picture of the true cost of capital in China's economy."

At the center of the reforms is a shift toward a more flexible "managed floating rate" for yields on new government bond issues, allowing the market to have greater sway in determining rates. Currently, the government controls the yield for the vast majority of bond issues, limiting flexibility. The new system will be piloted in the interbank market to start.

The government will also open the market to more foreign investors by streamlining registration and account opening procedures. Currently, foreign access and participation in China's bond market is limited. Overseas institutions held just 2 percent of government bonds at the end of 2020. The government aims to attract more foreign capital to the market to support growth and improve liquidity.
