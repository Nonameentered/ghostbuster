Shanghai Port to Expand and Deepen Approach Channels to Accommodate Larger Container Ships 

The Port of Shanghai, the world’s busiest container port, announced plans to expand and deepen its main approach channels to accommodate larger container ships. The port handled a record 42.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers last year, cementing its status as the top port for container shipping in the world.

The plans call for widening the port’s Main Channel and Yangtze River Channel from the current 280 meters to 300-320 meters and deepening them from the current 15.5 meters to 16.5-17 meters. The expansion and dredging work will start in 2020 and is expected to be completed by 2023.

“The expansion and deepening of our main approach channels are needed to support the next generation of ultra-large container ships that can carry up to 24,000 TEUs,” said Chen Xuyuan, Chairman of Shanghai International Port Group, which operates the port. “This will ensure Shanghai port maintains its position as a leading hub for global trade and logistics.”

The larger ships require deeper ports and help carriers lower costs per container. Major shipping alliances have already deployed more of these massive ships on Asia-Europe trade routes, and Shanghai port wants to tap into the efficiencies they provide. The plans received approval from China’s transport ministry and port regulators.

However, the port expansion has also raised some concerns. Some shippers worry that fewer ports able to accommodate the mega-ships could mean less choice and higher fees. Environmental groups argue that larger ships produce more emissions and pollutants. There are also concerns about sediment disposal from dredging and threats to nearby wetlands and wildlife. 

Proponents counter that bigger ships result in lower emissions on a per container basis and that dredging technologies have improved to better handle sediment. The port has also pledged to minimize the environmental impact of the expansion, though some activists remain skeptical.

The Port of Shanghai’s ambitions reflect China’s drive to dominate global trade and its massive Belt and Road initiative to build trade and infrastructure links with countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. Shanghai aims to cement its position as the world’s leading port as China seeks to position itself as an economic and diplomatic powerhouse. The expansion of the port could give Shanghai a leg up on competitors like Singapore in handling larger container flows between Asia and Europe.
