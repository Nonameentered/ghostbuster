China's Central Bank Struggles to Boost Open Market Operations Amid Shortage of Short-Term Treasury Bills 

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is finding it difficult to increase its open market operations to boost liquidity in the banking system due to a shortage of short-term treasury bills. The PBOC uses tools like repurchase agreements involving treasury bills to conduct open market operations and regulate liquidity and interest rates in the market. However, the supply of treasury bills has not kept up with the growing demand, hampering the central bank's ability to deploy this key monetary policy tool.

The PBOC issued 350 billion yuan ($52 billion) of treasury bills in September but the total bids amounted to 3.8 trillion yuan, pointing to a large unmet demand in the market. The mismatch has caused volatility in short-term interest rates and made it tough for the central bank to guide market rates. The PBOC has had to inject more long-term funds, including 600 billion yuan of medium-term lending facility loans last month, to ensure adequate liquidity. However, long-term injections are not as flexible as short-term tools in responding to sudden changes in market conditions.  

The treasury bill shortage has been anticipated for some time as China's fiscal deficit remains low by global standards. The Ministry of Finance's debt issuance has been slower than the fast-growing demand for high-quality liquid assets in China's financial system. The PBOC has been urging the finance ministry to increase issuance of treasury bills and bonds to provide more policy tools for the central bank. Some analysts argue the government needs to run a larger fiscal deficit and borrow more to meet the huge demand for safe assets.

To mitigate the shortage, the PBOC started accepting corporate bonds and asset-backed notes as collateral for its medium-term lending facility operations from late September. The central bank is also preparing to introduce pledged supplementary lending, accepting high-quality corporate bonds and asset-backed securities as collateral to provide liquidity to banks. The moves aim to give the PBOC more flexibility in open market operations and balance liquidity in the banking system. However, the market relies more heavily on treasury bonds and bills, which are considered the safest assets. The new instruments may take time to gain full acceptance among participants.

The treasury bill shortage poses challenges for the PBOC in ensuring stable liquidity and interest rates, though the central bank still has alternative tools to tap. More efforts are needed to develop and open up China's money market to provide high-quality liquid assets for the central bank to implement monetary policy and guide market expectations. Overall, while remaining an issue, China's policymakers have the means to remedy the situation and support the economy.
