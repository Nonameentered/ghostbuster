China's Stock Markets Stable Despite Heavy Turnover and Profit-Taking After Deng Xiaoping's Death 

China's stock markets were stable today despite heavy trading volumes and some profit-taking following the announcement of the death of former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down just 0.3% at 1,289.92 after fluctuating in a range of over 3% during the day. Turnover on the Shanghai bourse surged to 12.2 billion yuan ($1.48 billion), the highest since October 1997.

Deng's death at the age of 92 was announced before trading began. The initial reaction saw the Shanghai index drop over 3% as some investors took quick profits from the market's recent strength. However, buying interest soon emerged, allowing the market to recover most of its losses. Investors are hopeful that Deng's policy of economic openness and reform will be continued by China's current leaders.

"Deng's death won't change the fact that China's economy has been gradually opening and reforming in the past 20 years," said Wang Jun, an economist with China Center for International Economic Exchanges. "So investors realized Deng's legacy will live on."

The Shenzhen Composite Index also ended down just 0.3% at 591.84. Brokers said retail investors were active buyers today, absorbing selling from institutional investors. Turnover on the Shenzhen bourse hit 18.9 billion yuan, the third highest on record.

Some analysts said Deng's death may have only a short-term impact on China's stock markets. "The negative influence won't last long," said Jing Tian, an analyst with Shanghai Securities. "China's securities market has been quite independent from political events in recent years." He said economic fundamentals will continue to drive the markets.

China's stock markets have surged over 50% this year, fueled by economic growth of over 9% in the first half of 1999 and optimistic outlooks for reforms. Deng's death is unlikely to derail the momentum of growth and change in China that he initiated two decades ago. Investors remain confident in China's long-term potential despite periodic bursts of political or economic uncertainty. Overall, China's stock markets proved resilient today in the face of a tragic but inevitable development.
