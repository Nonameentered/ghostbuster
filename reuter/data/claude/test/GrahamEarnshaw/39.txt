Reforms of China’s non-equity capital markets set to advance despite Deng Xiaoping's death, analysts say  

The death of former leader Deng Xiaoping is unlikely to significantly impact the Chinese government’s reform trajectory of its bond and derivatives markets, according to market analysts. However, continued progress could depend on global economic factors, particularly if a financial crisis or recession were to slow Chinese growth.

Deng, who oversaw China’s market reforms starting in 1978 and the opening up of its economy, passed away this week at the age of 92. Despite his immense influence over China’s economic liberalization, analysts say the policy direction of capital market reforms has already been set and broadly supported by political leaders and regulators. 

“The momentum behind developing China’s bond, repo, and derivatives markets has been gaining for years and is really focused on managing risk in the financial system and providing more market-based tools for investment,” said Tom Brattle, an analyst with consulting firm SinoInsights. “There are very clear benefits to these reforms, so we expect them to continue apace, though possibly with some delays if there are significant disruptions to trade or the global economy.”

Over the last two years, China has introduced reforms to standardize bond issuance, expanded the types of collateral accepted in the interbank bond market, and allowed greater participation of foreign institutional investors in onshore bond trading. New derivatives, like interest rate swaps and options, have also been approved to help investors and borrowers hedge their risks.
 
The goals of these reforms are to open China’s capital markets to greater market forces, increase the range of risk management tools available, and balance the current banking-dominant financial system. However, some limits remain, such as caps on foreign access and investor eligibility to trade certain products.

“China’s capital markets remain semi-closed, quasi-open systems, so we will have to see how much further regulators are willing to open them up to market forces,” said Clara Feng, China markets analyst at research firm Rhodium Group.
