Foreign Business Community Expects Deng Xiaoping's Death to Have No Impact on China's Economic Policies or Profit Pressures 

Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader and chief architect of the country's modernization and economic reforms, died today at the age of 92. Deng had been ill for some time and had retreated from public life, so his death was not unexpected. However, foreign business leaders and investors largely expect Deng's passing to have little impact on China's economic policies or the pressures on foreign companies to generate profits in China.

"While Deng was instrumental in pioneering China's era of 'reform and opening' in the late 1970s and guiding China's economic policies for decades, China's current leadership has clearly embraced and built upon Deng's vision for economic growth and global engagement," said Joe Sims, head of governmental affairs for the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. "We expect China to continue along the path of increasing market-based economic reforms and greater opening to foreign trade and investment that Deng helped chart."

Since the mid-1990s, Deng retreated from day-to-day involvement in policymaking as his health declined. Under leaders Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, China joined the World Trade Organization, privatized many state-owned enterprises, and took other steps to further integrate into the global economy that built upon Deng's vision. Current President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao have also pushed policies like revamping China's financial system and encouraging domestic consumption that advance Deng's economic philosophies.

"While Deng Xiaoping will be remembered as a towering figure who changed the course of China's history, the truth is his death will likely have little impact on the Chinese government's current focus on economic growth, market reforms, and global business expansion," said David Mulholland, head of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. 

Foreign companies continue to flock to China, attracted by its huge market potential, low costs, and desire for advanced technology and management skills. However, foreign firms also face intense pressures to generate profits and meet targets for technology transfer as the price of admission to China's market. They frequently complain of an uneven playing field due to barriers against foreign firms and preferential treatment for Chinese competitors. Such challenges for foreign companies seem likely to persist regardless of China's leadership changes.

"At the end of the day, China is focused on its own development, and it needs foreign technology, investment and expertise to achieve its goals," said Mulholland. "While China's leaders and policies may change over time, that fundamental reality will not. Foreign companies will still find opportunities here, but also real challenges, just as in Deng's time."  

So while Deng Xiaoping played a pivotal role in opening China to the outside world and transitioning it to a market-based economy, the momentum he unleashed has developed its own momentum that not even his death can stop. For foreign businesses, it seems it will remain business as usual in China. The pressures and constraints that have become part and parcel of doing business in China will likely endure long after Deng Xiaoping's death. The China that Deng helped create has a life of its own now, and there is no turning back.
