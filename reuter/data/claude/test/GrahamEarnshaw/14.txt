China's Minsheng Bank Plans Major Growth in 1997 as Niche Player in Country's Banking Sector 

China Minsheng Banking Corp, one of China's largest non-state lenders, announced ambitious growth plans for 1997 to further establish itself as a niche player focused on private companies and entrepreneurs. Minsheng Bank aims to open 60-70 new branch offices this year, increasing its branch network by about 50 percent. It also plans to increase loans by 40-50 percent and deposits by 35-45 percent in 1997.

"We see enormous opportunities to serve private companies and entrepreneurs, which have been underserved segments in China's banking market," said Dong Wenbiao, Chairman of Minsheng Bank, at a press conference. "Our niche strategy and focus on these customers have fueled our success so far, and we believe continued fast growth is possible by sticking to this approach."

Founded in 1996, Minsheng Bank has grown rapidly by focusing on private sector companies and entrepreneurs, rather than state-owned enterprises like the major state-owned banks. It has over 3,000 corporate customers and 2.3 million individual customers. Growth has been fastâ€”in 2016 its assets grew over 50 percent. However, its asset base is still small relative to major banks like ICBC and BOC.

The Chinese banking sector has long favored state-owned enterprises, which receive preferential access to resources and lending. Private companies and entrepreneurs have struggled to get loans and other financial services. Minsheng Bank wants to fill this gap, with a goal to "support the development of China's private economy and entrepreneurs."

Minsheng Bank's rapid expansion plan comes as China is encouraging more private participation in the banking sector to improve competition and efficiency. However, some analysts worry that fast growth could strain Minsheng Bank's risk controls and management. "Their niche strategy has served them well so far, but the planned scale of their expansion raises questions about whether they can maintain that focus," said Wang Tao, Head of Asia Economics at UBS.

If successful, Minsheng Bank's growth plan could position it to play an increasingly important role supporting China's dynamic private sector. However, in China's complex banking system, rapid growth also often brings risks. Minsheng Bank's ability to balance fast expansion with its niche strategy and risk controls will determine whether it can sustain its early success.
