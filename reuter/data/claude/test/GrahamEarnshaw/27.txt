Shanghai's Economic Growth Slows While Unemployment Rises in China's Largest City

The economic growth of Shanghai, China's largest city, slowed in the second quarter of this year amid rising unemployment. Shanghai's gross domestic product expanded by 4.8% year-on-year in the April-June period, down from 5.1% in the first quarter, according to data released by the Shanghai Statistics Bureau on Monday. The city's economy grew by 6.3% for all of last year. 

While Shanghai has experienced accelerated economic expansion since 2010, growth has started to moderate in recent years in line with China's broader economic slowdown. The second quarter's growth rate was the weakest in nearly a decade for Shanghai. Tepid domestic demand and declines in exports due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war contributed to slower growth, economists said.

At the same time, Shanghai's surveyed urban unemployment rate rose to 5.2% in the second quarter, up from 5% in the first quarter and higher than the national average. The increase in unemployment, especially among young college graduates, suggests the city's labor market is under pressure. Close to 8.74 million people were employed in Shanghai during the quarter, an increase of just 47,000 from the previous quarter. 

In response, the Shanghai government announced a stimulus package this month that includes tax cuts, reductions in business fees, and increased infrastructure spending. The city also plans to boost foreign investment and high-tech manufacturing to stimulate growth. â€œWe are facing increasing downward pressure," said Shanghai Vice Mayor Xu Kunlin. "Stabilizing growth, expanding domestic demand, and increasing employment are our top priorities."

Some analysts argue more stimulus may be needed to cushion the impact of slowing exports. "External risks are rising, and government support for the real economy needs to be beefed up," said Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Group. However, further sharp increases in debt levels could exacerbate financial risks in China's economy if not managed properly. Balancing growth and risk control will be a key challenge for Shanghai in the coming year.
