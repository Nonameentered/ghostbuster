Inmet Mining Corp CEO Focuses on Antamina Mine, Faces Financing Challenges  

Inmet Mining Corp, a Canadian base metals mining company, is focused on maximizing production and lowering costs at its flagship Antamina copper and zinc mine in Peru, even as it faces financing constraints due to weak metals prices.

Jochen Tilk, President and CEO of Inmet, said in an interview that the company is aiming to increase copper production at Antamina by at least 10% this year through various operational improvements. Antamina is one of the world's largest copper mines and also produces zinc, silver, and molybdenum.

"Antamina is our core asset and the center of our growth strategy," Tilk said. "Despite lower metals prices, we see opportunities to unlock more value through incremental increases in throughput and productivity."

Inmet needs to boost production to offset lower realized prices for copper and zinc. Copper prices have declined nearly 30% from their peak in 2011 due to slowing demand in China and a supply glut. Zinc prices have also been under pressure.  

While ramping up Antamina's output, Inmet's biggest challenge is managing its debt levels during the price downturn. The company holds $1.2 billion in debt and needs to repay $300 million in bonds that mature in 2018.   

Tilk said Inmet will consider asset sales, joint ventures, and alternate financing options to address its debt and fund the company's growth plans. But he acknowledged that raising capital will be difficult given the state of the copper market and mining sector.

"Financing is tough for many mining companies these days," Tilk said. "But Inmet has a valuable, long-life asset in Antamina, which gives us more options to attract investors and partners."

Inmet shares have declined nearly 80% from their peak in 2011, reflecting the broader struggles of the mining industry. But Tilk remains confident in the company's outlook based on Antamina's scale and low costs. "This is a cyclical business, but Antamina is built to generate solid returns over the long run," he said.
