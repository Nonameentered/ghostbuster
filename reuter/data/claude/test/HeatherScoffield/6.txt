Barrick Gold Corp Surpasses Gold Fields to Become World's Second Largest Gold Producer

Barrick Gold Corporation has overtaken Gold Fields Limited to become the world's second largest gold producer, according to the latest rankings published by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Barrick Gold produced 5.5 million ounces of gold in 2018, narrowly edging out Gold Fields which produced 5.3 million ounces. Newmont Mining Corporation remains the largest gold producer with 5.8 million ounces of production.  

The rise to second place caps a multi-year turnaround effort by Barrick Gold under the leadership of Chairman John Thornton and CEO Mark Bristow. After a series of operational challenges and asset impairments in previous years, Barrick undertook significant restructuring and cost-cutting measures. It divested underperforming mines, especially in Australia and Africa, and re-focused efforts on its core operations in North and South America.

The hard work and "back to basics" strategy paid off as production costs declined and profit margins increased over the course of 2018. Revenues rose by over 8% compared to 2017 while adjusted profit doubled to $689 million. The strong financial and operating performance has led to a 30% increase in Barrick's stock price over the past year.

“Our vision is to be the world’s most valued gold mining business,” said CEO Mark Bristow during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call. “Today’s results show we are making excellent progress against this vision. Hard work and a relentless focus on replacing reserves, investing in profitable production, and managing costs allowed us to achieve a step-change in performance across our portfolio.”

Looking ahead, Barrick is well positioned to build upon its success and potentially challenge Newmont for the number one spot. It continues to advance new mining projects in Nevada as well as Latin America, with the goal of producing 5 to 6 million ounces of gold per year over the next decade. Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives and the sale of non-core assets should help boost cash flow and profitability. If gold prices remain stable or increase from current levels, Barrick stands to benefit substantially and continue its remarkable turnaround story. Overall, 2018 proved to be a pivotal year for Barrick Gold and its investors, with the promise of further gains to come.
