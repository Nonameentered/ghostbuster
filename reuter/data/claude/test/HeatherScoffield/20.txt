Softwood Lumber Prices May Rise as Canada-U.S. Quota System Enters Second Year

The quota agreement between the U.S. and Canada limiting Canadian softwood lumber exports is entering its second year. The agreement sets limits on the amount of softwood lumber Canada can ship to the U.S. tariff-free. As the quota levels decrease this year, prices for softwood lumber in the U.S. are expected to rise, according to industry analysts.  

The U.S. and Canada have had a long-running dispute over softwood lumber, which is wood from coniferous trees like pine, fir, and spruce. The U.S. claims that Canadian provinces subsidize softwood lumber production by charging low fees for logging rights on public lands. This gives Canadian producers an unfair advantage, argues the U.S. lumber industry. Canada disputes this and says its lumber pricing policies follow international trade rules.

After years of disputes and legal challenges, the two nations agreed in 2017 to a quota system imposing volume limits and tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. The quotas were set at a level that capped Canada's share of the U.S. softwood lumber market. The agreement runs for seven years, decreasing the quota levels each year.

In the first year of the agreement, the quota allowed Canada to capture about 28% of the U.S. softwood lumber market. This year, the quota will decrease to about 27%. The lower quota, combined with strong demand for lumber in the U.S. housing market, is expected to drive up lumber prices by 5% to 15% this year according to CIBC analyst Hamir Patel.  

Canadian industry representatives argue the quotas are an unfair restriction of free trade that will damage the Canadian forest industry. However, U.S. industry groups counter that the quotas are necessary to offset the market-distorting effects of Canadian subsidies and protect jobs in the U.S. lumber industry.

There are concerns the dispute could flare up again in the coming years. The quota agreement expires in 2024, and there are few signs the fundamental differences between the two nations on this issue have narrowed. Canada's lumber industry is pushing for a new free trade agreement when the current pact ends. However, U.S. lawmakers continue to demand limits on Canadian imports to protect domestic producers.  

Ongoing uncertainty surrounding the dispute is problematic for businesses that depend on a steady supply of affordable lumber, like homebuilders. However, for now at least, the quota system has brought a period of relative stability and predictability to the North American softwood lumber market according to industry experts. As the quota levels ratchet down further in the coming years though, more volatility could return. The dispute that has lasted over 35 years already may not be over yet.
