Canada's Youth Unemployment Rate Threatens Re-Election for Liberal Party 

The unemployment rate for Canadians aged 15 to 29 jumped to 12.4% in April, up from 11.3% in March, according to Statistics Canada. This is the highest level of youth unemployment in Canada since the financial crisis over a decade ago. The troubling data poses a threat to the re-election of the ruling Liberal party under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the upcoming October federal election.

The youth unemployment rate has been steadily rising since the Liberals took power in 2015 and critics argue the government has failed to make meaningful progress on job creation for young Canadians. The Conservatives, the main opposition party, seized on the new numbers as evidence that Trudeau’s policies are not working. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said “these devastating unemployment numbers are proof that Justin Trudeau’s higher taxes and runaway deficit spending are destroying jobs and economic opportunity, especially for young Canadians.”

The jump in youth unemployment comes despite Canada’s overall unemployment rate declining to 5.7% in April, the lowest since comparable data became available in 1976. However, job creation has been concentrated in sectors like tech, finance, and healthcare which typically require university degrees or years of experience that many younger workers lack. Younger Canadians were also disproportionately impacted by layoffs in the retail, food service, and hospitality sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Trudeau government pointed out that their federal budget earmarked funds for updating skills training programs and creating more opportunities for students to gain work experience. Government officials argued these types of programs will provide long-term benefits, even if youth unemployment remains elevated in the short term. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said, “We know Canada’s young people have been uniquely impacted by COVID-19, which is why we invested in their futures by expanding access to skills training and work opportunities.”

However, critics counter these programs will take years to have an impact, while young Canadians struggle today with few job prospects and increasing student debt burdens. There are concerns the longer these youth remain unemployed, the harder it will be for them to gain career experience and launch their adult lives. With an election looming, reducing youth unemployment may need to become a higher priority for the Liberal party to secure the support of younger voters and remain in power. Overall, the troubling rise in youth joblessness poses both an economic and political challenge in Canada that requires urgent solutions.
