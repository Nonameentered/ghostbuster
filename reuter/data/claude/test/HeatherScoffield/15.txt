Canada's Nickel Producers Disappointed by Low Q3 Prices  

Canada's nickel mining industry faced disappointing prices in the third quarter of this year, prompting concerns over future growth and investment. The average price of nickel on the London Metal Exchange fell to $5.69 per pound in the third quarter, down 17% from the second quarter average. Analysts cited slowing demand from China and Europe as the primary causes of the price drop.

"The nickel price environment continues to be challenging given macroeconomic uncertainties," said Mark Travers, CEO of Sudbury-based Eagle Mine. "While we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of nickel, pricing volatility impacts our short-term performance and investment decisions." Eagle Mine is one of Canada's largest nickel producers, accounting for over 10% of the country's total nickel production last year.

The nickel price slump comes at a difficult time for Canada's producers who have invested heavily in new mines and expansion projects in recent years to boost output. Those projects were approved when nickel prices were stronger, raising concerns that some may face losses if low prices persist. Vale's Goro nickel mine in New Caledonia, which has faced major cost overruns and production issues, is seen as particularly at risk. Vale took a $1.6 billion writedown on Goro last year due to low prices and operational problems.  

"You've got to wonder how much longer Goro and some other high-cost operations can sustain these prices before having to cut production or shut down entirely," said George Hepburn, a mining analyst at CIBC World Markets. Vale declined to comment on the financial performance of Goro or the impact of low Q3 nickel prices. 

However, some analysts see reasons to be optimistic going forward. Demand for nickel in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries is expected to rise over the coming decades. This increasing demand, especially from the EV battery sector, could help boost prices and support new projects. Several Canadian companies, including First Cobalt and Critical Elements, are exploring opportunities to supply nickel for the burgeoning lithium-ion battery market.

"The long-term outlook for nickel remains very strong," said Paul Martin, CEO of First Cobalt. "In the short term, the market is working through a surplus inventory situation, but nickel producers that can weather this cycle stand to benefit greatly from the next upturn in what is ultimately a growth market."

The recent price drop serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of commodity markets and the need for producers to keep costs under control. Canadian nickel producers will aim to cut spending wherever possible until demand and prices pick up again. Investors will be monitoring Q4 results and 2020 guidance closely to determine which companies are best positioned to benefit from a potential rebound in the nickel market.
