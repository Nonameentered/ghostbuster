WTO Director-General urges flexibility and understanding in China's bid to join the organization  

The Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) appealed to member states today to be flexible and open-minded as China seeks to join the global trade body. In a speech at the National Foreign Trade Council’s annual conference, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy called China's accession “one of the most important developments in international trade since the creation of WTO.” He urged countries to consider the long-term benefits of China's membership instead of focusing narrowly on potential threats to domestic industries.

China's efforts to join the WTO, which sets the rules of the global trading system and acts as a forum for negotiating trade agreements, have been ongoing for many years. "China's entry into WTO will be one of the most significant steps so far in reinforcing an open, equitable and secure multilateral trading system," Lamy told the audience of government officials and industry executives. He acknowledged that some sectors in WTO member states feel threatened by increased competition from China. However, he said the economic impact would vary across countries and industries, and in most cases newer export opportunities to a massive Chinese market would more than offset losses.

The WTO currently has 140 member countries but China is not yet one of them. Acceding to the WTO requires a lengthy application process and approval by existing members. Lamy pointed out that China has already made "considerable efforts" to liberalize its trade regime in line with WTO rules, but still needs to fully open certain sectors like agriculture and services. Several members, including the United States and the European Union, are pressing China for further concessions before approving its bid.

Lamy argued that bringing China into the global trade system would encourage it to become a more active stakeholder in the multilateral system. China's participation would also strengthen the WTO, which is grappling with stalled trade negotiations and tensions with the Trump administration in the United States. "When China accepts and implements WTO rules, she will contribute to the strengthening of her own market economy and accelerate necessary economic reforms," Lamy said. He concluded by appealing to members to take a long view: "The economic and political significance of this means we must get it right." Overall, Lamy presented a compelling case that the benefits to the global community from China's WTO membership far outweigh the costs, despite the very real challenges and short-term impacts of competing with the world's most populous country.
