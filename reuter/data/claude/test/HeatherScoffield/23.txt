Inco faces "tight" deadline for Voisey's Bay open pit mining by 1998, says new president 

The new president of Inco, the multinational mining company, said this week that Inco faces a "tight" timeline to begin open pit mining at its massive Voisey's Bay nickel deposit in northern Labrador by late 1998. Speaking at a mining conference in Toronto, Tom Kramer, who took over as Inco's president and CEO in January, said permitting and construction at the remote site will need to proceed on an "aggressive schedule" to meet the target startup date.

Discovered in 1993, the Voisey's Bay deposit is considered one of the largest mineral finds in Canadian history. Inco aims to mine the deposit's abundant supplies of copper, nickel and cobalt through a combination of open pit and underground mining. However, the open pit operations must begin first to provide access to the underground ore. According to Kramer, beginning open pit mining in just over two years will be "challenging but achievable" if everything proceeds according to plan.

Inco's timeline faces several obstacles, including completing permit applications, building infrastructure at the undeveloped site, and negotiating an impact benefits agreement with local First Nations groups. The Voisey's Bay deposit is located on lands claimed by the Innu and Inuit. While Inco has signed an initial agreement with the Innu Nation, talks are still ongoing with the Labrador Inuit Association.

Kramer said permitting is "on schedule" but will require both federal and provincial government approval before mining can begin. Facilities that need to be built at the site include ore stockpiles, crushing equipment, truck shops, offices, and a temporary camp to house up to 350 workers. A gravel airstrip will also need to be constructed to fly in construction crews and supplies.

Environmental groups have raised concerns about mining's potential impact on wildlife in the area, including woodland caribou. However, Kramer stressed that Inco aims to develop Voisey's Bay "in an environmentally sustainable manner." The company plans to use the latest mining techniques and technology to minimize the project's environmental footprint, he said.

If completed on time, Voisey's Bay could significantly boost Inco's nickel production and cash flow. Kramer said the mine is expected to produce up to 90 million pounds of nickel annually over a mine life of up to 30 years. "Voisey's Bay will be transformational for Inco," Kramer said. "We are excited about the opportunity to develop this world-class ore body and unlock its potential."
