Canadian election mudslinging begins early with accusations of racism and sexism 

Canada's federal election is still months away, but the political mudslinging has already begun. In recent weeks, the two main opposition parties have accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his Liberal government of racism and sexism.

The accusations began last month when Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was censured by the opposition Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois for comparing Sikh militants who bombed an Air India flight in 1985 to freedom fighters. The opposition demanded Sajjan resign, accusing him of being "sympathetic" to Sikh extremists. Sajjan apologized for his remarks but Trudeau defended him and allowed him to keep his cabinet position.

More fuel was added to the fire last week when Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna shared an email from an anonymous critic who called her a "climate Barbie" and used misogynistic language to criticize her stance on climate change policy. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was quick to condemn the email's content but was then on the defensive when several Conservative MPs and supporters were found to have previously used similar sexist language to describe McKenna online.  

The opposition NDP joined in the criticism this week, targeting Health Minister Patty Hajdu for the government's handling of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Hajdu failed to ensure Canadians in long-term care facilities had priority access to vaccines, accusing her of being "negligent" in her role. The Liberals fired back, calling the criticism a thinly veiled attack on Hajdu's competence due to her gender.

With the election still months away, observers worry the early mudslinging and accusations are a sign of a nasty campaign to come that will focus more on personal attacks than policy debate. Trudeau has a minority government and will need to go to the polls by 2023. But with the Liberals riding high in approval ratings due to the government's handling of the pandemic, the opposition may see personal attacks as the best way to dent the government's popularity before voters head to the ballot boxes.  

The Liberals, however, appear ready to respond in kind. Speaking to reporters, Trudeau said "unacceptable personal attacks will be met with the contempt they deserve" and that his government will remain focused on "the priorities of Canadians" rather than getting dragged into the opposition's "mudslinging." Only time will tell if that restraint lasts.
