Liberals Favored to Win in Upcoming Canadian Election, Opposition Competing for Second Place

The Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is poised to win Canada's upcoming federal election according to recent polls, though they are unlikely to regain their parliamentary majority. The Conservatives and New Democratic Party are battling to finish second while the separatist Bloc Quebecois and Green Party are also hoping to pick up seats.

Election day is October 21st and advance polls have already opened. The Liberals currently hold 177 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons, so they would need at least 13 more seats to reach the 170 seats required for a majority. However, they have been trailing slightly in recent opinion polls and are projected to finish with between 145 to 165 seats according to poll aggregators and election forecasters.

The Conservatives, led by Andrew Scheer, have 95 seats and are polling to increase that number to between 115 to 135 seats. The New Democrats have 39 seats and are projected to hold between 20 to 40 seats. The Bloc Quebecois have 10 seats but could double that number, while the Green Party hopes to build on their two current seats. An increase in votes for the smaller parties means the Liberals are likely to lose seats even as they win the most votes overall.

Key campaign issues include climate change, affordable housing, healthcare, Indigenous rights, and taxation. The Liberals are touting their achievements in negotiating a new NAFTA agreement, legalizing cannabis, and cutting taxes for the middle class. However, they have been damaged by the SNC-Lavalin scandal over political interference and the re-emergence of old blackface photos of Trudeau. The Conservatives have focused their attacks on the Liberals and argue they would be better stewards of the economy. The NDP platform puts emphasis on wealth taxes, universal pharmacare, and transitioning to clean energy. 

The final days of the campaign will see the leaders making an election sprint across the country to sway undecided voters and ensure strong turnout. Advance voter turnout is up this year, indicating Canadians want their voices heard in this important election. The next parliament will shape major policy decisions around climate change, economic challenges, and Canada's role in the world. Voters are making an important choice between diverse visions for the country's future.
