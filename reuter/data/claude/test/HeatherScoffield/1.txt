Gold Rush: Placer Dome and Teck Corp. Compete for Bre-X Minerals' Indonesian Gold Find

The announcement of a massive gold discovery in the jungles of Borneo by a small Canadian mining exploration company has sparked a bidding war between two of Canada's largest gold producers. Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd. confirmed yesterday that drilling at its Busang gold prospect in East Kalimantan, Indonesia has yielded core samples with extraordinarily high gold concentrations. 

Bre-X, a penny stock, has seen its shares skyrocket over 25,000% since the discovery was first announced last fall. Major producers Placer Dome Inc. and Teck Corp. are now locked in an increasingly fierce competition to acquire Bre-X and control what could be the largest gold deposit ever found.

“This appears to be a world-class discovery that comes along once in a lifetime,” said David Walsh, gold analyst at Dundee Securities. “No one wants to miss out on this, so companies are going to pay up for it.”

Estimates of the gold contained at Busang range from 30 million ounces up to a staggering 200 million ounces, worth between $35 billion to $270 billion at current prices. Bre-X's chief geologist announced that the latest cores indicate the deposit contains at least 69 million ounces of gold, making it far larger than any other gold deposit ever found. These numbers have shocked analysts and ignited speculation about the impact such a large new source of gold could have on the international gold market.

Placer Dome, a Vancouver-based major producer, has offered $4.5 billion in cash and stock for Bre-X, valuing the small explorer at over $6 billion. But analysts expect a counteroffer from Teck Corp., another large Canadian producer, to materialize shortly. A bidding war could drive the final price for Bre-X well above current levels.
