US Pushes for Expanded Free Trade in IT, Telecom, and Financial Services in Asia-Pacific Countries

The United States is ramping up efforts to persuade countries in the Asia-Pacific region to open their markets for American companies in the technology, telecommunications, and financial services sectors. U.S. trade negotiators have been meeting with counterparts from 11 other countries that border the Pacific Ocean to discuss expanding free trade in these industries as part of the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement talks. 

The push for greater market access reflects the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region for the U.S. economy and the competitive advantage of American companies in cutting-edge sectors like software, cloud computing, mobile payments, and more. U.S. technology companies in particular stand to gain from freer trade with Asian countries where many of their suppliers and customers are located. However, U.S. negotiators face difficulties in convincing some countries to open their markets amid concerns about privacy, security, and preference for domestic competitors.

“The Asia-Pacific region represents the most economically vibrant part of the world, and it is strategically important for the U.S. to strengthen its trade partnerships there,” said Jake Colvin, vice president for global trade policy at the National Foreign Trade Council. “Securing free trade agreements in sectors where U.S. companies are global leaders, like tech and finance, could yield major benefits.”

Not all countries have been receptive to U.S. demands, though. For example, Vietnam and Malaysia have been reluctant to open their markets to U.S. financial services firms, citing a desire to protect local banks. Data privacy concerns in Japan and New Zealand pose barriers for U.S. tech companies. Canada and Mexico already have free trade with the U.S. as partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement but joining the TPP could mean additional market access for their tech and finance sectors as well.

Negotiators met last week in Hawaii for another round of talks aimed at concluding an agreement by the end of this year. Further progress in opening markets for U.S. tech, telecom and finance companies will be critical to achieving that goal and securing a final deal that benefits all parties. The next rounds of meetings will determine whether American firms gain significantly greater access to Asia-Pacific consumers and whether a new Pacific trade bloc emerges.
