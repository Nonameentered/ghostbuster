Inco's Voisey's Bay project faces a "tight" deadline to meet its 1998 production start date, says new president  

The massive Voisey's Bay nickel project in Labrador faces significant challenges to meet its planned production start date of late 1998, according to the mine's newly appointed president. 

Peter McBride, who took over as president of Voisey's Bay Nickel Company (VBNC) on January 1, said the construction schedule for the $1.8-billion project is "tight" after significant delays in the environmental assessment and permitting processes set the project back by more than a year.

"There's no question the timeline is tight given the delays we've experienced," McBride said in an interview. "We have a lot of work to do in a compressed time frame to get this project up and running by the fourth quarter of 1998 as planned."

VBNC, which is owned by Inco Ltd., the world's largest nickel producer, announced Tuesday that McBride would take over as president following the retirement of previous president John Bliek. McBride has more than 25 years of experience managing major resource projects for Inco, including mines in Indonesia, Guatemala, and Thompson, Manitoba.  

The Voisey's Bay project in northern Labrador is one of the biggest mineral developments in Canadian history. The massive deposit is expected to produce more than $20 billion worth of nickel, copper and cobalt over its 30-year mine life, according to Inco estimates. However, the environmental assessment of the project took more than two years to complete, delaying construction that had been slated to begin in early 1996.

First ore production is now expected in November 1998, with commercial production of copper and nickel concentrate to begin early in 1999. But that timeline depends on construction proceeding on schedule during a short operating season of only 180 days. The site is accessible only by air or sea, and is covered in snow for more than half the year.

"A project of this size and complexity, in such a remote location with such a short operating season, requires the highest level of planning and execution to meet timelines and budgets," McBride said. He added that he's confident the targets can still be achieved with hard work and focus over the coming year, but little room remains for further delays or setbacks.

The Voisey's Bay mine is expected to produce more than $1 billion in annual operating cash flow for Inco at full production. Inco's stock price has been buoyed in recent months by rising commodity prices and optimism about the project. Meeting the 1998 start date for Voisey's Bay is seen as key to continued strong performance of Inco's shares.

In an interview, Inco CEO Scott Hand applauded the appointment of McBride as VBNC's new president. "His experience and expertise will be invaluable as we work to ensure this landmark project is delivered on time and exceeds all expectations."
