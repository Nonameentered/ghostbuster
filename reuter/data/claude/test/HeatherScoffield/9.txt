Canadian Mining Companies Wary of Strengthening Currency's Impact on Earnings and Cash Flow  

The Canadian dollar has appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar in recent months, buoyed by rising commodity prices and a recovering domestic economy. While a stronger loonie is good news for consumers and importers, Canadian mining companies are concerned about the impact on their bottom lines.  

The Canadian dollar is up over 10% against the greenback since the start of the year. For mining companies that generate a large portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars but face costs in Canadian dollars, the currency appreciation squeezes profit margins and reduces cash flow. Over 70% of revenue for the metals and mining sector comes from exports, the majority of which are priced in U.S. dollars.

“A rising Canadian dollar is bad for our business,” said Mark Ferguson, CEO of Calgary-based copper miner Triumph Mining. “Most of our costs are in loonies but we sell our copper on U.S. dollar-denominated markets. So when the exchange rate moves against us, it’s difficult to offset that lost revenue.”

Triumph Mining is not alone. Vancouver’s Teck Resources, one of the largest diversified miners in Canada, warned investors that every one-cent increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would reduce annual revenue by C$67 million and annual operating profit by C$15 million. “Exchange rates are volatile and may continue to have a significant impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity,” Teck noted in its recent quarterly report.

Canada’s gold miners are also feeling the pinch given that gold is priced in U.S. dollars. Toronto-based Barrick Gold, the world’s second largest gold producer, forecast a $50 to $70 million decline in 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for every 10% rise in the Canadian dollar.  

Mining companies are employing various strategies to mitigate exchange rate risk. Some are locking in prices on forward contracts that assure a minimum U.S. dollar amount. Others are paying shareholder dividends in U.S. dollars or shifting more operations and costs to U.S. dollars. Diversifying revenue streams to include minerals priced in Canadian dollars, like potash, is also helping.

However, with the outlook for the Canadian economy continuing to improve, the loonie may remain strong or strengthen further. “We could see the currency venture above $0.85 this year, especially if oil and commodity prices keep rising,” said Royce Mendes, director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. For Canada’s mining sector, a rising tide for the overall economy may not lift all boats. A strong currency casts a shadow on the bottom lines of companies heavily dependent on U.S. dollar-based commodity sales.
