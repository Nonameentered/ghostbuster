French-speaking political leaders outraged over pre-election ad targeting Quebec-born politicians  

Political leaders from French-speaking regions of Canada expressed outrage over a controversial pre-election ad targeting politicians born in the province of Quebec. The ad, released by a third-party advocacy group called "Canadians for an Undivided Canada," questions the loyalty and commitment to Canada of politicians born in Quebec, implying they will prioritize Quebec's interests over the rest of the country.

The ad features photos of three candidates in the upcoming federal election who were born in Quebec, including the incumbent Prime Minister, with a voiceover saying "Are they Québécois first or Canadian first? Think twice before putting Quebec-born leaders in charge of Canada's future." Leaders across party lines denounced the ad as divisive, unethical, and contrary to Canadian values of inclusion and diversity.  

Prime Minister Martin Duval, born in Montreal, called the ad "a disgraceful new low that seeks to divide us based on where we're from." He said politicians from Quebec are "proud Canadians who want the best for our whole country." The leaders of the opposition parties, also originally from Quebec, voiced similar condemnations. Alberta Premier Jacques Moreau said the ad promoted prejudices that have "no place in our democracy." 

The group behind the ad defended it as raising "reasonable concerns" about politicians who may have a "conflict of loyalty" between Quebec and Canada. But critics argue the ad is akin to a "dog whistle" that stirs up ugly prejudices and succeeds only in inflaming divisions. Support for separatism in Quebec has declined to historic lows, and Quebec-born leaders are not synonymous with seeking Quebec's independence.

The controversy deals an early blow to what many hoped would be a high-minded policy debate in the coming election campaign. There are concerns it could damage national unity and stir up dormant tensions between French and English Canada. The ad has been referred to the elections commissioner, though critics argue more must be done to censure those responsible and prevent such ads from airing in the future.  

With the future of the country at stake, leaders of all parties are calling for an election focused on the real challenges facing Canadians rather than personal attacks and efforts to divide. But in an era of polarizing politics, negative advertising, and spread of misinformation, achieving that ideal campaign seems far from certain. The real risk is that the controversy generated by this early salvo may be a sign of more and uglier fights to come before voters head to the polls on October 21st.
