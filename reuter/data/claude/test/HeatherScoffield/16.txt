Canadian Nickel Giants Disappointed as Prices Falter in Third Quarter 

Canada's major nickel producers expressed disappointment this week as nickel prices declined in the third quarter of the year, squeezing profit margins. Nickel prices fell over 15% from July to September due to a slowdown in stainless steel demand in China and Europe as well as concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Noront Resources, a miner focused on developing a nickel-copper mine in Northern Ontario's Ring of Fire region, reported a loss of $3.2 million in the third quarter as nickel prices fell. Noront had expected higher prices to boost the economic viability of its Eagle's Nest project. "The drop in nickel prices was unfortunate and untimely," said Alan Coutts, Noront's CEO. "We were hoping the price environment would continue to strengthen but macroeconomic concerns have impacted the market."

Major producers like First Nickel and Sherritt International also recorded lower sales in the third quarter. First Nickel's nickel production declined by 12% compared to the second quarter. "Nickel fundamentals remain positive over the medium-to-long term, but prices will likely remain volatile in the short term due to global economic uncertainty," said First Nickel's CEO Paul Heaney. The company has cut capital spending by 25% in response to lower prices.

Some analysts argue nickel companies need to reduce costs and moderate production to support higher prices. Nickel inventories remain high relative to demand, putting downward pressure on prices. "Nickel producers have not been disciplined enough in recent years," said Joseph O'Rourke, a mining analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "If they want to see a sustained price rally, they will need to tighten their belts." 

However, others point out that nickel demand should increase over the long run as the stainless steel market continues to grow and nickel becomes more important for electric vehicle batteries. Nickel is a key component of most lithium-ion battery chemistries for electric vehicles. Some nickel companies are positioning themselves to benefit from rising battery demand in the decades ahead.

Overall, nickel companies remain optimistic about the long-term outlook but disappointed by the recent price weakness. After strong gains in the first half of 2019, the third quarter serves as a reminder of the volatility inherent in commodity markets. Nickel producers will be hoping demand—and prices— pick up again before the end of the year.
