Strengthening Canadian Dollar Threatens Earnings of Mining Companies 

The Canadian dollar has strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar in recent months, posing a threat to Canadian mining companies that generate much of their revenue in U.S. dollars but pay most of their costs in Canadian dollars.

The loonie, as Canada's dollar is known, has risen more than 10% against the greenback since the start of the year. It recently reached 82 U.S. cents, its highest level since February 2018. The currency is benefiting from higher oil prices, interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada, and optimism about Canada's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

For Canadian mining companies, a stronger loonie means lower revenues when converted from U.S. dollars but steady costs in Canadian dollars. About 60% of revenue in the mining industry comes from outside Canada, much of it from the U.S. The currency squeeze can significantly impact the bottom line.  

“The appreciating Canadian dollar is problematic for mining companies,” said Paul Robinson, managing director of mining research firm CRU Group. “Mines are price takers, so they can’t raise prices to offset the impact of currency shifts. Their profit margins get squeezed.”

Some of Canada’s largest mining companies have operations in the U.S., including Teck Resources, Lundin Mining, and First Quantum Minerals. Teck, one of the world’s biggest producers of steelmaking coal, estimates that each one-cent change in the exchange rate reduces its annual operating profit by about $67 million. First Quantum, a copper miner, generates more than 90% of its revenue in U.S. dollars.

Mining companies can hedge against currency fluctuations to provide more stability and certainty. But hedging programs are imperfect, and a prolonged period of currency weakness can still hamper profits. Some companies may consider strategically timing equipment purchases or other spending to take advantage of a weaker home currency.      

Barrick Gold, the world’s second-largest gold miner, adopted U.S. dollar reporting currency in 2019 to provide more transparency and align its financial reporting with its revenue and cost bases. The move has shielded Barrick from much of the impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar.  

Still, mining executives remain hopeful the loonie's rally will be temporary. “We expect the Canadian dollar will weaken over the next six to 12 months as the U.S. economy continues to outpace Canada’s,” said Mark Bristow, chief executive of Barrick Gold. If so, that would provide welcome relief for mining company balance sheets battered by 12 long months of a muscular loonie.
