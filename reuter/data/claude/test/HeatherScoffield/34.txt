Canadian Federal Court Rules to Deport Saudi Dissident Suspected of Involvement in U.S. Airman Bombing in Saudi Arabia  

The Federal Court of Canada ruled today to uphold an immigration board decision to deport Abdullah Almaki, a Saudi dissident suspected by U.S. and Saudi officials of involvement in the 1996 terrorist bombing of a residential compound in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. airmen. 

The three-judge panel rejected Almaki’s appeal and found “no unreasonable error” in the original immigration board finding that Almaki is inadmissible to Canada due to reasonable grounds to believe he was a member of a terrorist organization and participated in its activities. Almaki has lived in Canada since being granted refugee status in 1998. He continues to deny any involvement with the bombing.

The 1996 bombing targeted the Khobar Towers, a residential complex in eastern Saudi Arabia used to house foreign military personnel. The attack killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded nearly 500 people from several countries. U.S. officials have long suspected the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah al-Hejaz of orchestrating the attack with assistance from members of Saudi Hezbollah and Saudi Shiite dissidents. 

Almaki, a prominent member of Saudi Arabia’s Shiite minority and advocate for Shiite rights, has been accused by Saudi and U.S. officials of using his position in a Saudi human rights organization to help facilitate travel for individuals linked to Hezbollah al-Hejaz and gather information about foreign military interests in Saudi Arabia to share with the group. Canadian lawyers and human rights groups argue, however, that there are reasonable doubts about Almaki’s involvement and that he risks torture if returned to Saudi Arabia.

In its ruling, the Federal Court found that officials “reasonably concluded that there were serious reasons for considering that [Almaki] was a member of Hezbollah al-Hejaz, an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe has engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism.” The court also ruled that Canadian officials conducted a fair review of the human rights concerns in Saudi Arabia and that diplomatic assurances from Saudi officials were “found to be credible and reliable.”

Almaki’s lawyers have vowed to file an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Supporters argue that deporting Almaki based on suspect intelligence would violate international law and Canada’s commitment to providing refuge for those at risk of human rights abuses. Saudi officials have called on Canada to fulfill its counterterrorism commitments by deporting Almaki “without further delay.” The legal case highlights the tension between Canada’s humanitarian principles and cooperation with Western allies on national security issues. Almaki remains under loose house arrest in Toronto pending final legal appeals.
