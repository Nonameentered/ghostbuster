Barrick Gold Corp. Regains Upper Hand in Fight for Control of Massive Busang Gold Find in Indonesia

The world's largest gold producer has moved a step closer to regaining full control of the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. Barrick Gold Corp. announced today that it has reached an agreement with Mineral Mendung Energi, the company formerly known as Bre-X Minerals, to acquire its remaining interest in the Busang property. If the deal is approved by Indonesian authorities, it will end a protracted legal battle and allow Barrick to reap the full financial benefits of what was once touted as the world's largest gold find.

The saga of the Busang deposit began in the mid-1990s. Bre-X Minerals, a small Calgary-based exploration company, claimed to have discovered a deposit containing at least 70 million ounces of gold in the jungles of Borneo. The find attracted enormous interest and led Barrick to invest $100 million in the project for a 50 percent stake. However, Bre-X's claim was later revealed to be an elaborate fraud. Independent studies found little evidence of gold and the company collapsed. 

Although the deposit was not nearly as large as originally claimed, subsequent drilling by Barrick found that Busang still contained substantial gold reserves. Barrick has operated the site since 1997 but faced continued legal challenges from the remnants of Bre-X, now operating as Mineral Mendung Energi. Under the new agreement, Barrick will provide Mineral Mendung Energi a net smelter royalty on gold production at Busang until it reaches $270 million, at which point Barrick will have full ownership and rights.

“We are pleased to finally settle this matter and gain unencumbered access to this meaningful resource,” said Kelvin Dushnisky, Barrick's president. “Busang remains a key part of our portfolio and we look forward to developing its full potential to the benefit of our stakeholders and local communities." 

The settlement marks the end of a controversial chapter in both the companies' histories. At its peak, Bre-X had a market value of $4.4 billion before its fraudulent claims were discovered. For Barrick, the saga damaged its reputation and stock price but it persisted in developing the site. Busang is expected to produce 250,000 to 300,000 ounces of gold per year for Barrick over its lifetime at a relatively low cost. With gold prices surging past $1,500 an ounce, the full value of Busang could be billions of dollars, helping Barrick boost profits and shareholder returns.
