Canadian politicians debate whether to cut taxes or increase spending ahead of June elections 

OTTAWA — With a federal election looming in June, politicians from Canada’s main political parties are debating whether the government’s priority should be tax cuts or increased spending on social programs.

The governing Liberal party, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has pledged more investments in healthcare, education, and job retraining programs if re-elected. However, the opposition Conservative party argues that lowering taxes and reducing the deficit should be the focus, in order to stimulate economic growth. 

“Government has a responsibility to invest in people and communities,” Trudeau said at a campaign rally in Toronto this week. He touted billions of dollars in new funding for students, seniors, and families since the Liberals took office in 2015. However, the Conservatives counter that lower taxes leave more money in people’s pockets and allow businesses to spend and invest more, boosting the overall economy.

“The prime minister just doesn’t understand government should tax less and spend less,” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer told supporters. Scheer has promised to scrap Trudeau’s carbon tax and provide targeted tax cuts if elected prime minister.

With the Canadian economy showing signs of slowing down, the question of fiscal policy priorities is front and center in the minds of voters as they prepare to head to the polls. The election comes amid global trade tensions and a slowing global economy, pressuring the federal government to take action to support continued growth.

Polls show a tight race between the Liberals and Conservatives, with the left-leaning New Democratic Party likely to hold the balance of power. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has aligned more closely with the Liberals, favoring increased investments in healthcare, education and the environment paid for by higher taxes on large corporations and the wealthy.  However, the NDP could seek to extract more spending commitments from either the Liberals or Conservatives in exchange for their support.

Election day is set for June 23. Whichever party comes out on top will have to navigate conflicting demands to spur economic growth during a period of uncertainty while also making investments to boost Canada’s long-term prosperity. The debate around taxes and spending is shaping up to be a central theme of the campaign.
