Canada Supports U.S. Push for Faster Free Trade Talks in the Americas 

The Canadian government announced today its support for expediting free trade negotiations between countries in the Americas. Speaking at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau backed U.S. calls for speeding up talks on the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement.

"Canada believes the time is right to make substantive progress on hemispheric free trade," said Trudeau in his summit remarks. "We support efforts to accelerate negotiations and achieve a high-standard FTAA agreement as soon as possible."

The FTAA aims to eliminate or reduce trade barriers between all countries in the Americas, except Cuba. Talks on the deal began in 1994 but have stalled in recent years over disagreements on topics like agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The U.S. and Brazil, in particular, have been at odds on key issues, slowing down progress.

The election of new leaders in the U.S., Canada and several Latin American countries has raised hopes of renewed momentum for the trade initiative. The Biden administration has made increasing trade with partners in the Western Hemisphere a priority, viewing it as an opportunity for post-pandemic economic recovery.

Canada also sees free trade with the Americas as key to its own economic growth. "For Canada, closer economic ties to partners in our own hemisphere hold much promise,” said Trudeau. “We want to be the partner of choice for countries throughout the Americas." 

Trudeau's comments were welcomed by U.S. officials at the summit. “We appreciate Canada's support for reinvigorating FTAA talks and share their view that an ambitious trade agreement could unleash new opportunities for partnerships in technology, services, and other sectors,” said a White House spokesperson.
