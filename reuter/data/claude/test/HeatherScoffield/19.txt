Bank of Canada Governor Gives No Hint on Interest Rate Hike Amidst U.S. Speculations 

The Governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, spoke today at a business luncheon in Toronto but gave no indication on the timing of potential interest rate hikes in Canada. His speech comes amid speculations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise rates this year, putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to follow suit.

In his speech titled “Making Progress Toward Sustainable Growth,” Poloz focused on the recent economic progress in Canada but emphasized that the economy still has room for improvement. He pointed to the stronger growth in gross domestic product over the last year, increasing business investment, and the declining unemployment rate as signs the economy is headed in the right direction. However, he also said the economy is "still adjusting to the oil price shock" and growth is "not quite back to full capacity."

Poloz did not directly address the prospect of interest rate hikes, leaving economists and analysts guessing as to the Bank of Canada's timeline. The central bank has kept its key interest rate at 1% since September 2010. Some economists predict the first hike could come as early as this fall, while others think early next year is more likely. BMO economist Sal Guatieri said “the speech did nothing to change our view that the first hike is most likely in January, as the economy is still operating with excess slack.”

 South of the border, the U.S. Federal Reserve faces mounting pressure to start tightening its monetary policy as the U.S. economy continues to strengthen. Fed officials have indicated they may raise rates twice this year. Any rate hikes in the U.S. often compel Canada's central bank to follow in order to defend the Canadian dollar and prevent too much capital from flowing out of the country. However, Poloz has stressed before that Canada remains in a different position and will make independent policy decisions based on domestic factors.

In his speech, Poloz expressed confidence that Canada's economy is rebalancing from the oil price shock in a “gradual and orderly manner.” But he concluded that patience is still required and the central bank will continue to provide monetary stimulus "until there are clear signs an adjustment is well underway." His comments suggest interest rates are unlikely to change any time soon, but the Bank of Canada will be monitoring conditions closely in the coming months. Overall, Poloz struck an optimistic but cautious tone about Canada's economy as uncertainty hovers over the potential shifts in monetary policies on both sides of the border.
