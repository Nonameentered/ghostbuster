Bre-X Minerals Begins Search for Partner to Develop Indonesian Gold Discovery  

Bre-X Minerals Inc., a small Canadian mining company, announced today that it will seek a major partner to help develop what could be one of the largest gold discoveries in decades. Bre-X claims that recent exploration drilling in the Busang area of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, suggests that the property could contain as much as 71 million ounces of gold, an amount that would make Busang one of the largest gold deposits ever discovered.

According to Bre-X geologists, initial results from 23 drill holes indicate that the potential open-pit gold deposit at Busang extends over a 2.5 kilometer by 1 kilometer area. The company estimates that with further drilling, the deposit could contain 50 million to 100 million ounces of gold, worth between $100 billion to $200 billion at current prices. “This has the potential to truly put Kalimantan on the map as a globally significant gold mining region,” said Bre-X’s Chief Geologist Michael de Guzman.

Bre-X, based in Calgary, Alberta, has been exploring in Indonesia’s Kalimantan rainforest for nearly a decade. After years of seeking major discoveries, the company now believes it has uncovered a massive gold find that could generate profits for decades to come. However, developing a mine at the Busang site and extracting the gold will require extensive investment and expertise that is beyond Bre-X’s capabilities as a small exploration company.

Felderhof, Bre-X’s President and CEO, announced that the company will engage in negotiations with several major mining companies to determine the best route forward to develop the Busang deposit. “We believe the sheer size and scale of this discovery will attract substantial partnership interest from major mining firms,” Felderhof said. “Bre-X has a world-class asset on its hands but developing an operation this large requires expertise, technology, and financial resources well beyond our own.”

Any agreement with a large mining company could be highly lucrative for Bre-X and its shareholders. Options for cooperation could include the sale of part or all of Bre-X’s ownership stake in the Busang property, a joint venture partnership, or other investment and offtake agreements. Whichever path is chosen, Bre-X appears poised to reap a substantial reward on its decade of exploration in Indonesia's rainforests. With one of the biggest gold discoveries in history in its portfolio, tiny Bre-X Minerals could soon emerge as a major player in the international mining scene.
