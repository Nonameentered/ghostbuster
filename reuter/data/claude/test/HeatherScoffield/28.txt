Mudslinging begins ahead of Canadian federal election  

The announcement of a fall federal election in Canada has led to an outbreak of personal attacks and accusations between political parties before campaigning has even begun. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Governor General Julie Payette yesterday to dissolve Parliament, kicking off a 40-day election campaign leading up to the October 21 vote.

Within hours of the election call, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer took aim at Trudeau's leadership, saying "Justin Trudeau has proven himself to be a weak leader who is always focused on flashy headlines and sweet Tweets, but delivers little in the way of actual results." The Tories released an attack ad on social media describing Trudeau as "not as advertised" and accusing him of mismanaging taxpayer funds.  

 The Liberals fired back, claiming the Conservatives have "nothing to offer Canadians exceptStephen Harper's approach of cuts, austerity and interference." Trudeau said at a campaign rally that the choice for voters was between continuing forward with a progressive government, or returning to "Harper's politics of fear and division."  

The NDP also took shots at Trudeau, arguing that he had failed to follow through on promises of electoral reform and action on climate change.  Party leader Jagmeet Singh, facing his first federal election as leader, promised more funding for healthcare, education, and the environment while accusing other parties of being too cozy with corporate interests.

With control of Parliament hanging in the balance, experts say the personal attacks between leaders are likely to ramp up over the next six weeks of campaigning. "Voters respond more strongly to messages that evoke an emotional reaction, so negative ads and mudslinging, unfortunately, tend to be effective campaign tactics," said Antonia Maioni, a McGill University political scientist.   

While the election promises to be a bitter fight, many Canadians are already expressing fatigue with partisan politics and personal attacks. "I just want to hear what each party stands for and what they're going to do for me and my family," said Alicia Thompson, a voter in Edmonton. "The constant attacks on leaders drive cynicism and turn people away from politics."  

All parties would do well to avoid further personal barbs and focus on policy proposals, experts argue. With just over a month of campaigning left, there is still plenty of time for a more constructive debate. Voters will ultimately have their say on which approach resonates more on Election Day.
