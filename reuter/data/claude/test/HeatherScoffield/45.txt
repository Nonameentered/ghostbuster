Moderator collapse cuts short French-language debate in Canada's federal election 

The only official French-language debate in Canada's federal election campaign came to an abrupt end Thursday night after one of the moderators collapsed on stage.

The debate, hosted by TVA in Montreal, was halted just over halfway through the two-hour event. Debate moderator Pierre Bruneau fell unconscious shortly after the leaders discussed climate change, the environment, and oil pipelines.

Medics rushed to Bruneau's aid as the five federal party leaders looked on, unsure of how to proceed. The TVA network cut to commercial as medical staff tended to Bruneau and prepared to transport him to hospital by ambulance. 

In a statement, a TVA spokesperson said Bruneau had suffered "a malaise" and that out of respect for him, the network had decided to end the debate early. His condition remains unknown at this time.

Until the sudden ending, the French-language debate stood out for its free-flowing and rapid-fire discussion amongst the leaders, in contrast with the more rigid format of the English-language debate earlier this week. 

The leaders covered several priorities for French Canadians, including the protection of language rights, access to Quebec culture, and support for supply management in agriculture. Parti Québécois leader Mario Beaulieu argued in favour of Quebec sovereignty while the other leaders said Canadians wanted to remain in a united country.

People's Party leader Maxime Bernier, who lost a federal Conservative leadership race in 2017, at times seemed on the defensive as his former leadership rivals attacked his proposed plans to cut immigration and end corporate subsidies.   

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also traded many direct barbs over issues ranging from ethics to climate policy. Scheer accused Trudeau of corruption and being "all talk" on the environment while Trudeau said Scheer has "no plan" for fighting climate change.

The debate was the first and only time the five leaders shared a stage together during the election campaign. Despite its early ending, the debate is likely to generate headlines for days to come due to the unexpected collapse and strong exchanges between the leaders. The event was also a rare chance for the leaders to speak directly to French Canadians before the October 21 election.
