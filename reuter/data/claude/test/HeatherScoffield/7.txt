PR battle heats up in fight for control of Indonesia's Busang gold deposit 

The fight for control of Indonesia’s massive Busang gold deposit is intensifying, with the two mining companies vying for the rights to the deposit ramping up public relations campaigns to win over both investors and the Indonesian government.

Bre-X Minerals Ltd, the Canadian mining startup that claimed to have discovered the Busang deposit, announced this week it will be taking journalists and investors on guided tours of the site to showcase “one of the largest gold finds of the 20th century.” Bre-X has claimed the Busang deposit in East Kalimantan province contains more than 200 million ounces of gold reserves worth over $70 billion.

Meanwhile, global mining giant Newmont Mining Corp has launched its own PR offensive, openly questioning Bre-X’s claims about the size and quality of the Busang deposit. Newmont has urged the Indonesian government to reject Bre-X’s permit application for Busang and instead grant rights to Newmont, citing its long track record of successful mining operations around the world. Newmont has offered to immediately invest $1 billion to fast-track development of Busang if it gains control of the deposit.

The battle for public opinion reflects the fact that the Indonesian government has not yet granted final permits for mining at Busang. Its size and potential riches have made it an extraordinarily valuable asset that could transform the economy of Kalimantan province. Bre-X’s claims about its gold reserves have not yet been independently verified, leaving many observers wondering if its estimates are too good to be true.

With billions of dollars in future profits at stake, the PR and lobbying campaign around Busang seems likely to intensify in the coming months as the Indonesian government evaluates whether to grant final mining rights to Bre-X or Newmont. For a small mining startup and a massive global company alike, the opportunity to control the Busang deposit is worth fighting for in both the boardroom and the court of public opinion. The government will ultimately have to decide which suitor’s promises are more credible and will benefit Indonesia the most.
