Freeport-McMoRan wins control of Indonesia's Busang gold find, leaving Barrick Gold out of the race

Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan announced today that it has secured a majority stake in the massive Busang gold deposit in Indonesia after months of negotiations. Freeport now holds a 51% controlling interest in the project, edging out rival bidder Barrick Gold.

The Busang deposit is located on the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to contain up to 20 million ounces of gold, which would make it one of the largest gold mines in the world. When the deposit was first discovered by tiny Australian exploration firm Busang International in February, it set off a bidding war between major mining companies seeking to gain access to the potential bonanza.

Freeport moved aggressively, first acquiring a minority stake in Busang International and then negotiating directly with the Indonesian government for the rights to develop the mine. After months of talks, Freeport secured a contract with explicit approval for a 51% stake. Barrick also held protracted negotiations with Jakarta but ultimately gave up its bid last month when it became clear the government preferred Freeport as a partner. 

Freeport is expected to begin preliminary work on the $2 billion project immediately and aims to start open-pit mining operations within two years, ramping up to full production of 800,000 ounces per year by 2020. At current gold prices, the mine could generate $1 billion in annual revenue and become Freeport's most lucrative asset within five years.

However, the project still faces political and environmental obstacles before production can begin. Although Freeport now has a controlling stake, the Indonesian government will continue to own 49% of the project. Some officials, including Indonesian President Joko Widodo, have called for Freeport to ensure maximum economic benefits remain in Indonesia. There are also concerns about the environmental impact of the mine, given its location in a tropical rainforest region.

Nonetheless, Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson hailed the Busang deal as “a pivotal moment that secures ourcompany's transition to a global leader in gold mining.” Barrick CEO John Thornton expressed disappointment at losing the bid but said the company will remain on the lookout for other acquisition opportunities of similar scale and potential. The ultimate success or failure of the Busang project, however, now rests squarely in Freeport's hands.
