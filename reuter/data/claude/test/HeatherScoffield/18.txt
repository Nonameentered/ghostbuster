Bank of Canada Governor Gives No Hint on Possible Interest Rate Hike in Response to U.S. Actions 

The Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz today gave little indication if interest rates in Canada are likely to increase in the coming months. Speaking at a press conference following the central bank's decision to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.5 percent, Governor Poloz suggested the Bank is closely monitoring economic developments but gave no hint if rates might rise at the Bank's next policy meetings.

The Bank's decision comes as the Federal Reserve in the U.S. raised its policy rate yesterday for the second time this year and signaled two more hikes may come before the end of 2018. Interest rate hikes in the U.S. often put pressure on the Bank of Canada to follow suit in order to ensure Canada's short-term rates remain competitive. However, Governor Poloz said the Bank will continue to chart its own course based on domestic economic factors.

"We are cognizant of higher interest rates in some other major economies, including the United States,” said Governor Poloz. “However, Canadian interest rates will continue to be well below neutral levels for some time given the significant debt burden faced by the typical Canadian household." The Bank estimates the neutral rate for Canada’s economy - the rate at which rates neither stimulate or discourage growth - is between 3 and 4 percent.

While the Canadian economy continues to operate close to capacity and inflation is on target, the Bank pointed to uncertainties around U.S. trade policies and competitiveness challenges faced by Canadian exporters as risks that are clouding the economic outlook. The Bank expects interest rates will need to move higher over time to achieve its 2 percent inflation target, however the timing and pace of future hikes will depend on domestic factors and developments in the economy.

Governor Poloz concluded the press conference by stating the Bank's governing council will continue to evaluate the risks around the economic outlook and set monetary policy appropriately to support sustainable economic growth and achieve the 2 percent inflation target. The next rate announcement and Monetary Policy Report will be on October 24.
