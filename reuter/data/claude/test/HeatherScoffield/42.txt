APEC trade ministers urged to cut customs red tape and invest in Asia's infrastructure needs  

Trade ministers from 21 Asia-Pacific nations gathering this week for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference are being urged to take bold action to boost regional trade and economic growth amid slowing global demand and trade tensions. In particular, business groups and global trade organizations are calling on APEC ministers to accelerate efforts to cut red tape at customs and borders, harmonize regulations, and increase investment in infrastructure across the region.

“There has never been a more important time for APEC to pursue an ambitious agenda to reduce trade barriers and make it easier for businesses of all sizes to trade goods and services,” said Allan Bollard, chairman of the APEC Business Advisory Council and former governor of New Zealand's central bank. In a report issued ahead of this week's APEC meetings in Santiago, Chile, the council said efforts to streamline customs procedures and align regulations have stalled in recent years. It urged trade ministers to take up a renewed push to boost regional economic integration. 

Inefficient border procedures and lack of transport links are estimated to cost Asian economies billions of dollars a year in lost trade opportunities. An estimated average of 8% of total trade costs for APEC economies are attributed to red tape and delays at borders. "There are huge gains to be made if we can reduce those costs, even modestly," said Bollard. The report calls for a number of specific actions, including increased use of electronic documentation, pre-arrival processing of information, and alignment of data requirements across APEC economies.

 Improved infrastructure is also key to unlocking further trade opportunities, both within Asia and beyond. The Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia will need to invest $1.7 trillion per year to maintain economic growth, address poverty, and deal with climate change mitigation—well beyond current levels of investment in the region. The APEC council urged member economies to increase investments in transport, digital, and energy infrastructure, as well as pursue policy reforms that would open infrastructure to private sector investment.

Continued infrastructure and trade facilitation improvements are considered crucial for Asia to benefit from emerging trade deals like the newly signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership. They are also seen as a way for Asian economies to strengthen ties amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and a broader global slowdown in economic and trade activity. With the right policies and investment in place, analysts estimate APEC has the potential to boost regional GDP by as much as 4.9% over the next decade, even as growth slows in other parts of the world.
