Canada pushes for trade liberalisation in environmental goods and services at APEC meeting 

Canada urged Asia-Pacific trade ministers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Vancouver this week to accelerate efforts to lower tariffs and other barriers on environmental goods and services. Canada views trade in environmental goods and services as an emerging opportunity for economic growth in the region.

In a speech to open the two-day meeting, Canada's trade minister said "We have an opportunity to make sustainable economic growth the hallmark of the Asia-Pacific region. One way we can do that is by promoting trade in environmental goods and services." The minister pointed out that the global market for environmental goods and services is estimated to be worth up to US$1.3 trillion per year and growing. 

Canada proposed launching negotiations towards an APEC-wide agreement to lower tariffs on a range of environmental goods like solar panels, water filters, and wind turbines to 5% or less. Currently, tariffs on such goods average over 10% in APEC economies. A deal could build on existing plurilateral negotiations among 16 WTO members, including several APEC partners such as China, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Canada also called for cooperative action to address non-tariff barriers and promote trade in environmental services such as renewable energy, waste management, and pollution mitigation. "There are too many barriers that prevent environmental service providers from competing effectively in markets where demand is growing rapidly," the minister said in his speech.

The appeal for more open trade in environmental goods and services was echoed by representatives from other APEC members, including the United States, Australia, Japan, and Mexico. However, some members expressed concerns about the scope of products and services that might be included in any eventual agreement. There were also calls to ensure that policies to open trade also support each economy's environmental priorities and goals.

With Asia's rapid urbanization, demand for environmental infrastructure and technologies is expected to drive markets for environmental goods and services in the region for decades to come. By promoting trade in this sector, APEC economies see opportunities to not only drive economic growth but also address climate change and transition to more sustainable energy use across the region. 

While APEC partners were not able to announce formal negotiations on a deal at this week's meeting, there is clear support for continuing to explore options for lowering trade barriers and deepening cooperation on environmental goods and services. Ministers directed senior trade officials to report back on progress at their next meeting with the aim of developing concrete proposals for ministers' consideration.
