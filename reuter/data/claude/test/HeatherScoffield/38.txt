Asia-Pacific Trade Ministers Urged to Revive Free and Open Financial Services Talks 

Trade ministers from countries in the Asia-Pacific region were urged yesterday to revive negotiations aimed at liberalizing trade in financial services. Representatives from the American and European financial services industry called on ministers meeting in Singapore this week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to renew talks on a proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).

Talks on the FTAAP, which would cover all 21 APEC member economies, have stalled in recent years due to a lack of consensus. The financial services industry groups argue that reviving and accelerating the FTAAP discussions, including plans to liberalize the trade in financial services across the region, would provide a boost to economic growth and integration.

"Trade in financial services is a key driver of growth, investment, and connectivity across all economies," said Mark Russell, Chairman of the Coalition of Service Industriesâ€™ Financial Services Committee, which represents major US financial firms. "Negotiations to open markets and reduce barriers for financial services providers throughout the Asia-Pacific would benefit companies, consumers and economies."

Industry groups cite estimates that reducing barriers to trade in financial services in the Asia-Pacific could increase the region's GDP by $300 billion or more over a decade. However, some APEC members remain hesitant to open their financial services sectors to more foreign competition. Restrictions on foreign ownership and other market access barriers remain in place in several countries, including China, Indonesia, and India.

Despite the stalled FTAAP talks, APEC members have made efforts to reduce restrictions on trade in financial services on a bilateral and multilateral basis. Notable recent agreements include the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes commitments to open financial services markets between 11 countries. The industry groups urged APEC trade ministers to build upon these agreements by reviving and expanding the scope of the proposed FTAAP. The meeting of APEC trade ministers concludes today in Singapore.
