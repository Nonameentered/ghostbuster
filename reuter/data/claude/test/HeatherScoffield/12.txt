Barrick Gold CEO Gracious in Defeat Over Indonesia's Busang Mining Rights

The CEO of Barrick Gold, Mark Bristow, took the high road today in response to the Indonesian government's decision to award the massive Busang gold mining rights to a Chinese consortium instead of Barrick. “We are disappointed by the outcome, but we respect the government of Indonesia's decision and wish the winning bidders the best of luck in developing this opportunity,” said Bristow in a brief statement.

Barrick had been considered the front-runner to win the rights to the Busang gold deposit in North Kalimantan, said to contain at least $10 billion in recoverable gold and perhaps much more. Barrick already operates six gold mines in Indonesia, including the large Grasberg copper-gold mine, and had proposed investing $7 billion to develop Busang into another world-class mine. 

However, China's Zijin Mining Group and two Indonesian firms, PT Danusa Tambang Nusantara and PT Bumi Suksesindo, submitted a joint bid that was $500 million higher than Barrick's. Indonesian government officials said the decision came down to the financial and economic benefits to the country. "While Barrick has been a valued partner, our objective is to maximize the value of our natural resources for the benefit of all Indonesians," said Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif.

The news was met with some surprise by mining industry analysts who believed Barrick's technical expertise, established presence, and top-notch environmental practices would give it an edge. However, China has been aggressive in expanding its control and influence over mineral and metal supplies worldwide to feed its huge industrial base. Zijin is China's largest gold producer and has been actively investing in mines abroad.
