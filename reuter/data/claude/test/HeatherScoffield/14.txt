February Job Report Leaves Canadian Government's Economic Record Stained Amid Upcoming Federal Election 

The latest Canadian jobs report showed a surprise loss of 71,200 jobs in February, raising new concerns about the health of the economy just months before a federal election. The unemployment rate rose to 5.8% from 5.6% in January, according to Statistics Canada.

The job losses were concentrated in Ontario and Quebec, Canada's two most populous provinces. Ontario lost 36,500 jobs, while Quebec shed 16,500 jobs. The losses were primarily in the private sector, including the accommodation and food services, healthcare, and transportation industries.

The weak report is a blow to the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is hoping to win re-election this fall with a message focusing on economic growth and improving the middle class. The February job numbers sully an otherwise positive trend in employment under Trudeau's government, which added 925,000 jobs from 2015 to 2018 as the economy grew.  

Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time in attacking the Liberals' economic record following the report’s release. “Justin Trudeau has failed Canadians. Life is harder and more expensive for families under his government,” said Scheer. The NDP also criticized the government, arguing greater investments are needed in skills training programs and employment supports for workers displaced by economic shifts.

In a statement, Finance Minister Bill Morneau acknowledged the jobs report was “not what we expected” but pointed to positive long-term trends. He argued the economy remains in a good position, citing growth over the past few years, low unemployment, and wage gains. He also promised the Liberals would announce “further investments” in the budget to strengthen and grow the middle class.

Still, the weak jobs picture for February raises questions about the sustainability of economic growth and jobs in Canada, particularly given additional risks from trade disputes and slowing global demand. The Bank of Canada, which makes interest rate decisions independent of the federal government, has estimated economic growth will slow to 1.3% this year, down from 1.9% in 2018. All eyes will now turn to the Bank's next rate announcement in April and whether further rate hikes are warranted amid a slowing economy and weak job market.   

The jobs report is a flawed but closely watched indicator of the health of the economy. The numbers can be volatile month to month. Annual employment gains have still averaged 1.3% over the past 12 months, slightly below the average of the past two years. However, the unexpected drop in February risks leaving more Canadians anxious about their job security and financial well-being. With an election looming, the Liberal government is hoping next month’s jobs numbers show February was merely an aberration. The economy and jobs will clearly be a ballot box issue, and the stakes for the next jobs report in April are now even higher.
