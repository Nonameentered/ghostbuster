Inco Ltd. Successfully Closes $3.2 Billion Takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc. for Access to Massive Nickel Deposit  

Mining giant Inco Ltd. announced today that it has completed its $3.2 billion acquisition of Diamond Fields Resources Inc., a junior Canadian mining company that controls a large nickel deposit in Ontario. The purchase gives Inco access to Diamond Fields' massive Victor mine, which is estimated to contain more than 700 million pounds of nickel reserves.

Inco, the world's second-largest producer of nickel, has been looking to shore up its nickel sources as demand for the metal is projected to surge over the coming decades due to increasing use in electric vehicle batteries and stainless steel production. Nickel is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, and many experts forecast a supply crunch for battery-grade nickel in the mid-2020s. 

The Victor mine provides Inco with a long-life, low-cost source of high-grade nickel that complements its existing Canadian operations. The open-pit mine is expected to produce 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of nickel annually over at least 30 years once full production commences in 2023. At today's nickel prices, the mine could generate more than $4 billion in annual revenue and $2 billion in annual profits at full capacity.

"The acquisition of Diamond Fields and control of the remarkable Victor nickel deposit is a game changer for our company that will drive shareholder value for decades to come," said Inco CEO Mark Travers. "We now have a clear path to becoming the top nickel producer in the world at a time when demand is poised to soar."

Diamond Fields shareholders approved the deal in December. The British Columbia-based company's stock price has surged more than 500% over the past two years based on speculation it would be an acquisition target. Under the terms of the agreement, Inco will pay Diamond Fields shareholders $17 per share, representing a 50% premium to the stock's price before takeover rumors began circulating.   

The deal underscores ongoing consolidation in the mining industry as large companies look to acquire smaller firms that have made new mineral discoveries but lack the means to develop them. For junior miners, selling out to an industry giant at a hefty markup is often the most viable path to realizing value from their assets.
