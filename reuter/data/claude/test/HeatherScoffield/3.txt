Unlikely Duo Forced Together to Control One of the World's Richest Gold Deposits  

In a move that surprised many industry observers, mining giants Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining announced an unprecedented joint venture today to operate their gold mines in Nevada. The joint venture will give the companies shared control over an estimated 100 million ounces of gold reserves, one of the richest gold deposits in the world. 

The two companies have a long and contentious history, often finding themselves in direct competition. As recently as last month, Barrick mounted an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Newmont worth over $17 billion. However, softening gold prices and rising costs have squeezed profit margins for both companies in recent years. The joint venture is seen as a way to cut costs by combining operations, thereby maximizing profits from their closely located Nevada mines.

“This is about value over pride,” said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold. “By combining our operations in Nevada, we can unleash significant synergies, optimize our infrastructure, and share best practices in a way that will boost returns for shareholders.”

Under the terms of the deal, Barrick will take ownership of 61.5% of the joint venture, with Newmont owning the remaining 38.5% share. The companies expect to generate pre-tax synergies of up to $500 million per year. Cost savings will come from optimizing underground mining infrastructure, making supply chain and procurement efficiencies, and streamlining management teams. Not all jobs will be protected, as some roles will be made redundant. However, a spokesperson said that there are no immediate plans for layoffs.

The Nevada gold deposits controlled by Barrick and Newmont include some of the most well-known and largest mines in the world. Barrick's Cortez and Goldstrike mines produced over 1 million ounces of gold each in 2018, while Newmont's Carlin mine produced over 900,000 ounces. The geological formation underlying much of Northern Nevada, known as the Carlin Trend, contains disseminated gold deposits estimated to be worth over $1 trillion at current gold prices.
