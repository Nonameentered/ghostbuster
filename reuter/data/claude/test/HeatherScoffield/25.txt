Canada Calls for African-Led Resolution to Zaire's Civil War, Rejects Western Intervention 

The Canadian government today issued a statement calling for an African-led resolution to the ongoing civil war in Zaire and rejecting calls for Western military intervention in the conflict. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said "this conflict must be resolved by the people of Zaire and their regional partners. Western nations should avoid direct military intervention, which often prolongs conflicts and leads to loss of life."

Zaire, a large country in central Africa, has been embroiled in a civil war for the past three years that has displaced over 1 million people and led to a humanitarian crisis. Rebel forces are attempting to overthrow longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who has ruled Zaire for 32 years. Mobutu's regime is notorious for corruption and human rights abuses. However, the rebels opposing him have also committed atrocities, leaving civilians caught in the middle of the conflict.

Several Western nations, including the United States, have considered supporting either Mobutu's forces or the rebels to end the conflict. Axworthy argued that "there are no easy answers here and no 'good guys' among the combatants. Imposing a resolution from outside risks perpetuating the cycle of interference that has already done so much damage." He said Canada will increase humanitarian aid and support diplomatic efforts by regional partners like South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia to broker a ceasefire and transition to democratic elections.

Mobutu's regime reacted angrily to Canada's stance, accusing it of "abandoning an ally." Rebel leaders welcomed the call for an African solution but said that transitioning to elections may not be possible until Mobutu is removed from power. The conflict continues with no end in sight, as diplomats scramble to make progress before the crisis worsens. Overall, Canada's position is a recognition that ultimately, sustainable solutions to such conflicts must come from within, not external intervention, however well-intentioned.
