Bre-X Selects J.P. Morgan as Financial Adviser for Search of Partner to Develop Indonesia Gold Deposit  

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. announced today that it has retained J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. as its exclusive financial adviser to help identify and evaluate potential partners interested in further exploring and developing Bre-X's Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Bre-X discovered the Busang deposit in late 1993 and extensive drilling over the past two years has outlined a gold resource estimated to contain more than 30 million ounces of recoverable gold. "Busang is a world-class gold discovery and we believe it has the potential to become a highly profitable mine," said David Walsh, Bre-X's Chairman and CEO. "However, a deposit of this size and scope requires the resources and expertise of one or more major mining companies to develop it to its full potential. We have therefore decided to consider forming a partnership with an established mining company to take Busang into production."

J.P. Morgan, a leading international investment and merchant bank, will advise Bre-X on its strategic options, including identifying potential partners, evaluating alternative partnership structures, and negotiating and structuring a mutually beneficial partnership agreement. Leading international mining companies will be targeted as potential partners given the scope and long life of the Busang gold deposit.  Partnership discussions are expected to continue over the next several months.

The Busang deposit is located in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, approximately 1,000 kilometers northeast of Jakarta. Bre-X has been exploring the Busang property since late 1993 and has completed 212 drill holes to date, outlining a gold deposit over 2 kilometers long and up to 800 meters wide. At a 0.5 gram per tonne cut-off grade, the Busang deposit is estimated to contain in excess of 30 million ounces of recoverable gold, one of the largest gold deposits ever discovered in Southeast Asia. Beyond the current resource, Bre-X geologists believe there is excellent potential to discover additional gold mineralization on the Busang property.

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. is a Canadian-based junior resource company specializing in gold exploration and mining worldwide. Shares of Bre-X trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol BXY.
