Battle for Control of Busang Gold Deposit Ends with Freeport-McMoRan's Victory

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. has emerged victorious in the long-running battle for control of the Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. The massive gold and copper mining company announced today that it has acquired a controlling interest in PT Nusantara Smelting, the holding company that owns the rights to the Busang deposit.

The Busang deposit is estimated to contain more than 20 million ounces of gold, making it one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world. Its remote location on the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo and complex ownership structure have stymied previous development efforts. At least six mining companies have vied for control of the deposit over the past two decades with little progress amid legal disputes and infighting.   

Freeport-McMoRan had held a minority stake in PT Nusantara Smelting for the past 12 years but was unable to exert control over key decisions due to disagreements with other investors. The company announced today that it has acquired a 64% ownership interest in PT Nusantara Smelting for $385 million, elevating its control to a level that will allow it to move forward with development of the Busang deposit. The remaining ownership interests in PT Nusantara Smelting are held by a subsidiary of Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co. Ltd. with 24% and Indonesian investors with 12%.

“Gaining control of this world-class gold resource has been a long-standing goal, and we are pleased to now have the opportunity to develop the Busang deposit for the benefit of all stakeholders,” said Richard C. Adkerson, President and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan. “We have many years of experience developing and operating large-scale mines in Indonesia, and we aim to bring that experience to develop Busang responsibly and transparently."

Development of the Busang deposit is expected to take at least three years as Freeport-McMoRan undertakes additional drilling and feasibility studies, gains necessary government approvals, and constructs open-pit mining and processing facilities on site. The company did not provide an estimate of when commercial gold production may commence but analysts expect it could begin as soon as 2023 if all goes according to plan. The news was met with a 3% jump in Freeport-McMoRan’s shares in trading today as investors reacted positively to the prospect of the company gaining control of such a sizable gold deposit.
