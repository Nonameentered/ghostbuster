Canada's Election Campaign Heats Up Ahead of French Debate on Quebec Separatism  

The federal election campaign is intensifying this week ahead of tonight's French language leaders' debate, which will focus on issues surrounding Quebec separatism and national unity. Election day is less than 3 weeks away and polls show a tight race between the incumbent Liberal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the opposition Conservative party led by Andrew Scheer.

Trudeau pledged in 2015 to increase government transparency and reduce economic inequality. However, his government faced controversies over political interference in the criminal prosecution of a large engineering firm and over the prime minister's actions during a trip to India. The Conservatives argue that Trudeau's Liberals have failed to deliver real economic gains and have increased the nation's debt burden. They are campaigning on tax cuts, reduced deficits, and support for Canada's oil and gas industry.

The stakes are high in tonight's debate as Quebec remains a key battleground. The separatist Bloc Québécois regained some lost ground after near-extinction in the last election. Party leader Yves-François Blanchet will argue in tonight's debate that only the Bloc can defend Quebec's interests.The NDP, under Jagmeet Singh, and the Greens, under Elizabeth May, will also participate. They hope to expand their base by highlighting progressive policy alternatives on the environment, health care, education and social justice.  

The leaders' debate will air as more Canadians begin to tune into the campaign with advance polls opening this week and election day approaching on October 21st. The next government will face significant challenges, including a slowing economy, cynicism towards establishment politics, and regional tensions between resource-dependent western provinces and the central government. Tonight's debate may prove crucial in shaping voter intentions as candidates make their final appeals to Canadians in this close and hard-fought election.
