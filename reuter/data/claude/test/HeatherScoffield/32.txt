EU's Trade Commissioner Chides Canada for Lack of Action Against US Helms-Burton Law

The European Union's top trade official criticized Canada today for not taking a stronger stand against the United States over its Helms-Burton law targeting Cuba. Phil Hogan, the EU Trade Commissioner, said Canada should join European countries in openly opposing the US law and threatening countermeasures. 

The Helms-Burton Act allows US citizens to sue foreign companies that do business in Cuba using property seized after the 1959 communist revolution. The law has been a source of tension with allies in Europe and Canada, whose companies have invested in Cuba. In a speech in Ottawa, Hogan said "we are disappointed that Canada has not acted more decisively against this unjustified extraterritorial legislation."

Hogan said the EU has warned the US administration that it will take the country to the World Trade Organization dispute settlement body if there are any claims made under the Helms-Burton Act against European companies. He urged Canada to take similar action in defending companies that could be affected. "We see this an an attack on sovereignty and on free trade," Hogan said. "We need a united front between allies on this issue."

The EU previously enacted a "blocking statute" forbidding European companies from complying with Helms-Burton. But Hogan said more multilateral action is needed. Some Canadian companies have invested in properties in Cuba that were seized from US owners decades ago, making them potential targets if Helms-Burton is fully implemented.

However, the Canadian government has been reluctant to escalate tensions with the US over Cuba policy. Officials argue that Canada has had some success in securing exemptions for companies from Helms-Burton enforcement on a case by case basis through discrete lobbying of US administrations. Joining the EU in an open confrontation risks backfiring, they say. 

Hogan dismissed this argument, saying " we cannot rely on the goodwill of the US government" to protect companies. He said only a collective challenge at the WTO would force Washington to reconsider Helms-Burton. While praising Canada as a "like-minded partner" on most trade issues, Hogan said its passivity on Helms-Burton was "particularly galling". His comments are sure to irritate US policymakers and raise tensions within the transatlantic alliance. But for supporters of free trade, Hogan's calls for more action on Helms-Burton will strike a chord. With some allies willing to push back, others ask why Canada remains on the sidelines.
