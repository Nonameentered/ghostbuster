Canadian Trade Minister under pressure to promote free trade at Asia-Pacific meeting 

The Canadian Trade Minister, Mary Ng, is facing calls from business groups and opposition parties to push for expanded free trade agreements at an upcoming meeting of Asia-Pacific trade ministers this week in Singapore. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting brings together 21 economies around the Pacific Rim to discuss trade and economic issues.

Ms. Ng is under pressure to advocate for Canada to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement between 11 countries including Japan, Australia, and Mexico. The bloc represents a market of 500 million people with a combined GDP of $13.5 trillion. Joining the CPTPP would give Canadian businesses preferential access to key Asian markets at a time when global trade tensions are rising.

However, the government has proceeded cautiously on trade deals following pushback from groups opposed to globalization. The fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the CPTPP's predecessor, was uncertain after the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2017. There are also concerns about competitiveness, with Canadian dairy and auto parts industries worried they may be disadvantaged compared to member countries with lower costs and standards.

In a statement, Ms. Ng said the government is conducting public consultations on the CPTPP to evaluate the costs and benefits. “We will only join the CPTPP if it is in the best interest of Canadian workers and businesses,” she said. 

The opposition Conservatives have urged the government to accelerate negotiations to join the trade bloc. “Every delay costs Canadian exporters opportunities in key markets where our competitors are gaining ground,” said the Conservative trade critic. The Business Council of Canada, representing 150 major firms, has also voiced support for joining the CPTPP as soon as possible to boost trade and growth.

Ms. Ng will meet with other APEC trade ministers this week to explore ways to strengthen regional economic integration and is expected to face questions about Canada's position on joining the CPTPP. All eyes will be on the trade minister to see whether she's willing to take a leap of faith on free trade in Asia at a time of both opportunity and anxiety in the global economy.
