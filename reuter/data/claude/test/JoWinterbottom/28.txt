CalEnergy Co Inc wins $1.31 billion bid to acquire Northern Electric Plc in tight takeover battle 

CalEnergy Co Inc, the U.S. power generator and utility company, has won a tight takeover battle for Northern Electric Plc, the UK's third largest energy distributor. CalEnergy announced yesterday that its final bid of £1.08 billion ($1.31 billion) in cash for Northern Electric was accepted by the company's board, beating out rival offers from PowerGen Ltd and National Grid Transco Plc.

The acquisition of Northern Electric is a major boost for CalEnergy's operations in the UK where it supplies electricity to over 2 million households. By taking control of Northern Electric's distribution networks across northern England and Wales, CalEnergy will double the number of customers it serves in Britain and expand its UK energy operations by 60%. 

"This acquisition represents an important milestone for our company and firmly establishes us as a leading integrated energy company in the UK," said David Smith, Chief Executive of CalEnergy in London. He said the takeover of Northern Electric was a "logical strategic step" that would create significant cost savings and operating synergies between the two companies over the next 3-5 years.

However, the bid was controversial and fiercely contested by rival bidders PowerGen and National Grid who also submitted offers of over £1 billion for Northern Electric. PowerGen's final bid came within 1% of the value offered by CalEnergy, demonstrating how tight the bidding process had become. PowerGen officials suggested that competition regulators should scrutinize the takeover given CalEnergy's already strong position in the UK energy market. Consumer advocates also warned the deal could lead to higher energy prices.

CalEnergy had long coveted Northern Electric as a way to expand in the UK and integrate its power generation and supply units. Under the leadership of Mr. Smith, CalEnergy has undertaken an ambitious acquisition strategy in recent years, buying up numerous smaller power distributors and suppliers across Britain and North America. The company is now the second largest electricity generator in the UK, after PowerGen, and ranks among the top 10 utility companies in North America.  

Mr. Smith said CalEnergy and Northern Electric were "an ideal combination" that would provide greater value and services to customers than either company could achieve on its own. He said there were no plans to cut Northern Electric's 5,600 strong workforce and that its operations would continue to be managed locally, with headquarters remaining in Manchester, England. 

"By joining the CalEnergy group, Northern Electric will gain additional investment and resources to improve network reliability, enhance customer service and develop innovative new energy solutions," Mr. Smith added. The takeover is expected to be completed by early next year, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
