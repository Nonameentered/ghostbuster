CalEnergy's CE Electric Wins Hostile Bid for Northern Electric Plc in Closely Fought Battle

CE Electric, the electricity generation subsidiary of CalEnergy Resources, has succeeded in its $12 billion hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc after a bitter four-month battle. Northern Electric's board had strongly opposed the bid, calling it "opportunistic" and urging shareholders to reject it. 

However, CE Electric raised its offer price several times as it sought to win over Northern Electric's shareholders. Its final bid of $48 per share was 26% higher than its original $38 per share proposal in January. The prospect of unlocking that shareholder value ultimately proved too appealing for many investors.

More than 70% of Northern Electric's shareholders accepted CE Electric's final offer, allowing it to take control of 52% of the company's shares and giving it control. The successful acquisition makes CE Electric the largest independent power producer in Europe with more than 50 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity across 15 countries.

"This is a transformational deal for CE Electric and our parent company CalEnergy Resources," said CEO David Thompson. "Northern Electric's portfolio of wind, solar and hydroelectric power generation assets is highly complementary to our own mix of geothermal, biomass and wind facilities. By combining our assets and expertise, we will be better positioned to support Europe's transition to renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels."

Northern Electric's board had argued the company was better off remaining independent as it pursued its own renewable energy growth strategy. Chairman Paul Stevenson expressed disappointment at the outcome, saying shareholders had "missed an opportunity to benefit from Northern Electric's full potential." He resigned shortly after the results were announced, along with two other directors.

The takeover battle had created uncertainty for Northern Electric over the past few months. Now that it is resolved, management of the combined company will be keen to reassure investors, customers, and employees as the two companies integrate their operations. Rebranding, asset disposals, and cost-cutting are likely to be on the agenda, analysts say.

CE Electric pledged to maintain Northern Electric's operational headquarters in Manchester, England and not to cut any jobs for at least two years. But the debt raised to finance the takeover, including $6 billion in junk bonds, will need to be serviced and reduced over time. With its larger scale and diversified renewable energy portfolio, however, CE Electric is confident the acquisition can yield $400 million in cost and efficiency savings to help pay off the debt and generate solid returns for shareholders.

The successful bid for Northern Electric marks the end of one of Europe's most hard-fought utility mergers and acquisitions in years. It gives CalEnergy significant scale and reach on the continent as it aims to become a global leader in renewable power. But making the complex integration of CE Electric and Northern Electric work will be vital to achieving that ambition and a return on its expensive investment. The coming year will be crucial in determining whether CE Electric's big bet pays off.
