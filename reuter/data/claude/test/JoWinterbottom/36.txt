Chemical Industries Association Calls for Urgent Reform of Electricity Wholesale Market

The Chemical Industries Association today issued an urgent call for reform of the UK's electricity wholesale market to prevent hundreds of job losses and factory closures. The industry group, which represents chemical companies across the UK, warned that recent months have seen a rapid rise in wholesale electricity prices, putting many of its members under severe financial pressure.

In a letter to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the head of energy regulator Ofgem, the CIA said that 1,500 jobs could be lost and five major factories could be closed down if the rising electricity costs cannot be contained and offset. The association's data showed that electricity prices rose 63% for its members between January and November of this year, adding millions in costs. 

The CIA director said "our sector is highly electricity-intensive and very exposed to moves in the wholesale price of power. For many of our members, especially in chemicals manufacturing, electricity can make up half or more of their total costs of production. Such dramatic increases, if sustained, will render many of our plants and factories uncompetitive and unviable, with dire implications for our workforce and supply chains.”

The association called for urgent action to reform the wholesale market to prevent further price spikes, curb speculation, and promote long-term investment in low-carbon generation. While short-term measures could include reviewing policy costs on bills or revising the terms of energy contracts, more fundamental changes were also needed to market structure and regulation. 

Ofgem and government officials said they have heard the concerns of industry and were monitoring developments in the energy market closely. An Ofgem spokesperson said, "Protecting customers is our top priority. We keep the energy market under constant review to ensure it is delivering positive outcomes and consider any necessary interventions needed.” However, officials also noted the complexities of the issue, the independence of commercial operators in the market, and the range of factors influencing electricity prices at any given time.

The urgent warning from the Chemical Industries Association highlights the vulnerabilities of energy-intensive industries to fluctuations in energy costs and the challenge of maintaining competitive electricity prices during the transition to a low-carbon economy. Reforms to promote greater stability, transparency and decarbonization of the power system will require a coordinated response across government, regulators and industry. Urgent action is now needed to shore up existing manufacturing and support future industrial growth in the UK.
