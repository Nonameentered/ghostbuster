Kingfisher to Cut 1,200 Jobs and Close Stores in Integration Plan with Norweb and Comet Chains  

Kingfisher, the British home improvement retailer, announced plans today to cut 1,200 jobs and close 42 stores as it works to integrate its recent acquisitions of the Norweb and Comet electronics chains. The moves are part of a two-year cost savings plan aimed at streamlining operations, reducing duplication, and improving efficiency across the newly combined companies.  

Kingfisher completed its purchases of Norweb and Comet late last year for a combined £2.3 billion. The deals expand Kingfisher's portfolio beyond its original focus on DIY goods and home furnishings into major appliances and consumer electronics. However, the acquisitions also bring the challenge of merging the brands and back-end operations. The announced job cuts and store closures are the first major steps in that integration process.

"Bringing these iconic British brands under one roof presents an enormous opportunity, but also requires diligent transformation," said Veronique Laury, CEO of Kingfisher. "Our integration plan aims to maximize the strengths of each business while realizing the benefits of their combination. This will allow us to offer customers an even wider range of products and services as we work to become their first choice for home solutions."

The specific impacts of the plan include the following:

• Close 42 surplus stores across the Kingfisher, Norweb and Comet brands, with locations to be determined over the next 3-6 months. The closures will leave the combined group with over 1,300 stores operating under the three brands across the UK and Ireland.  

•Eliminate 1,200 positions that duplicate existing roles or that are no longer required due to the store closures and operational changes. Some heads of department and support function roles will also be removed. Impacted staff will receive severance packages and outplacement support.  

• Merge Norweb and Comet's head office and distribution center facilities into Kingfisher's existing operational footprint. This will close Norweb's Liverpool head office and distribution center, as well as Comet's Rugby distribution center. Some roles from those locations will relocate or be removed.

•Integrate Norweb and Comet's IT systems, ecommerce platforms, and loyalty programs with Kingfisher's over the next 12-18 months. Temporary systems will handle transactions during the transition.  

•Rebrand a number of existing Norweb and Comet stores to the Kingfisher brand and product ranges over time. Some stores may also be converted to a new large store format to showcase the full range of Kingfisher products in one location.

The overall plan is expected to deliver £55 million in annual cost savings once fully implemented. However, Kingfisher will take a one-time charge of £180 million over the current and next fiscal years to pay for restructuring and integration expenses. CEO Laury emphasized that cost savings will be reinvested in improving customer service, expanding ecommerce and delivery options, optimizing the store portfolio, and strengthening the group's competitiveness.
