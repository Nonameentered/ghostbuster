Dixons Group profits soar 53% thanks to strong PC sales, but concern over tax increases impacts shares

British electronics retailer Dixons Group today reported a 53% increase in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended April 30, thanks to surging sales of personal computers and other technology products during the pandemic. 

Dixons, which owns Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said pre-tax profits rose to £151 million, up from £98 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 2% to £10.2 billion, as a 134% increase in online sales more than offset a 17% decline in physical store sales due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The company benefited strongly from increased technology spending during the pandemic, as people bought laptops, printers, and tablets to work and study from home. Dixons said like-for-like sales of computing products jumped 58% for the full year.

However, shares of Dixons fell as much as 8% in early trading today, as investors worried that a proposed increase in UK corporation taxes could weigh on future profits. Last month, the UK government announced plans to increase the corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning in 2023. The tax hike is aimed at helping the government repay its massive coronavirus-related borrowing.

Dixons CEO Peter Sweet said the company anticipates continued strong demand for its products and services even as lockdowns ease, noting “new long-term hybrid working patterns should sustain increased technology adoption.” However, Sweet warned the proposed future tax increase could pose risks.

“Doubling the tax burden would impact our ability to invest in our strategic plans, innovate, and continue to compete,” Sweet said. In response to the announced tax hike, Dixons said it would consider actions like adjusting retail prices or making cost structure changes to offset the higher taxes, though Sweet said such moves could negatively impact customers and employees.

Analysts said the tax increase concerned investors, even as Dixons’ strong profits and sales growth during the last year highlight its success navigating the retail upheaval brought on by the pandemic. The company has invested heavily in e-commerce and more efficient fulfillment options like in-store pickups of online orders. Dixons also cut costs by shrinking its store base and consolidating brands.
