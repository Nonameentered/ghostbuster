ASDA Reports Strong Sales Growth and Profit Increase in H1 Results 

UK supermarket chain ASDA announced strong half-year results today, posting a 3.4% increase in total revenue to £15.2 billion for the 26 weeks ending June 30. Revenue growth was driven by a 2.1% increase in like-for-like sales at its stores, as well as strong online sales which were up 12.3% year-on-year. 

Operating profit ticked up 4.2% to £942 million, resulting in a healthy operating margin of 6.3%. Net profit also rose 4.7% to £690 million. The results highlight the continued momentum at the Walmart-owned grocery retailer amid a challenging landscape for UK retailers.

“We’re pleased with our performance in the first half of the year as we continue to invest in giving customers lower prices and an enjoyable shopping experience,” said ASDA CEO Roger Burnley. “We remain absolutely focused on keeping food prices down and giving customers even better value whenever and however they shop.”

ASDA has delivered consistent market share gains and sales growth over the past several years based on its strategy of maintaining low prices and improving value for customers. It has also benefited from steady investments in its online operations, delivery capabilities and revamping hundreds of stores. Like other UK grocers, ASDA faces cost pressures from a weaker pound and higher input costs. However, its scale and ability to leverage Walmart’s purchasing power have helped insulate it from some of these headwinds.

Looking ahead, ASDA said it is well placed to keep momentum going in the second half of 2018. “The economic outlook may still be uncertain, but the foundations of our business are strong. Our strategy is clear, and day after day, week after week, we will continue to focus on delivering low prices, convenience and innovation for customers,” Burnley said.

Analysts said the results highlight ASDA’s strengths in a difficult market. “These are robust results from ASDA, especially in the context of the significant challenges facing the wider retail sector,” said Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “ASDA’s laser focus on low cost and efficiency continues to resonate with customers seeking value.” Clive Black, Retail Analyst at broker Shore Capital, said the results show “just how effective and strong a performer ASDA is in its segment of the UK food retailing scene...we expect ASDA to continue to outperform in our view, however the weather and consumer environment evolves.”

The results were broadly in-line with analysts’ expectations. ASDA's share price was trading up 1.2% at 114 pence in afternoon trading following the results announcement. The company's next trading update will cover sales for the 18 weeks to January 6, 2019.
