CE Electric's takeover of Northern Electric delayed by takeover panel approval 

The proposed acquisition of Northern Electric by CE Electric has hit a roadblock after the takeover panel regulator raised concerns about the deal. The all-share deal, valued at $8.2 billion, was announced last month and expected to close by the end of the year. However, the takeover panel has asked CE Electric for more information and analysis on the impact of the merger before it will approve the transaction.

CE Electric, the larger of the two utilities, planned to take over Northern Electric to gain access to its customer base of over 2 million households and its renewable energy assets. If approved, the combined company would have over 10 million customers across North America and Europe and a generation capacity of over 50,000 megawatts from solar, wind, hydro and thermal sources.

In a statement, CE Electric said it was cooperating fully with the takeover panel and aimed to address their concerns as quickly as possible. “We remain confident that our proposed acquisition of Northern Electric will benefit customers, communities and the market overall by enabling greater investment in the energy transition and more resilient energy infrastructure,” said Jean Smith, CEO of CE Electric.

A spokesperson for the takeover panel regulator confirmed its request for more details on the deal. “We have asked CE Electric to provide additional information and analysis to enable us to properly assess the competitive effects of the transaction and the impact on customers,” the spokesperson said. “Until we have reviewed this information, the clock is stopped on the deal.”

The request by the regulator is a setback for the two companies which had hoped for a straightforward approval process given their complementary operations and lack of overlap in key markets or generation sources. Analysts said the takeover panel is likely concerned about CE Electric's dominance and market power if the deal is approved. "Regulators will want to ensure consumers and businesses are not disadvantaged by rising energy prices due to less competition," said Simon Ellis, an energy analyst at Morningstar Research.

Northern Electric's shares fell by 3% following news of the delay while CE Electric's stock price was down 1.2%. Investors had welcomed the takeover bid when first announced, pushing up Northern Electric's stock price by a fifth. The company has long been seen as an attractive target, given its stable revenue streams and renewable energy portfolio. Barring any outright objection from regulators, most analysts expect the deal will still go through after CE Electric provides the additional details, though possible remedies or conditions may be attached to approval. Both companies have expressed confidence the acquisition will be approved and completed, though the delay highlights the increased scrutiny of mega-mergers by competition authorities.
