Northern Electric challenges CE Electric to raise bid as it parades results and forecasts 

Northern Electric, the UK's largest electricity distribution network, has upped the ante in its takeover battle with CE Electric by unveiling strong full-year results and an optimistic outlook. 

The company reported a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to £1.8bn for the year to March, comfortably beating market expectations. Revenue rose 8% to £5.4bn due to increased customer numbers and higher tariffs.

In a show of confidence, Northern Electric announced plans to accelerate its investment program, pledging to spend £6bn over the next five years improving its networks. It also forecast "continued robust growth in the years ahead" despite the wider economic uncertainty.

The results are the latest salvo in Northern Electric's effort to convince shareholders to reject a £10bn takeover offer from rival CE Electric, the French power group. CE Electric gatecrashed Northern Electric with an unsolicited bid last month, arguing that it could achieve greater scale and cost savings by combining the two companies.

However, Northern Electric's board has unanimously rejected the offer, claiming it "significantly undervalues" the company and its future prospects. The results appear designed to reinforce this message by highlighting Northern Electric's strong financial performance and growth potential as an independent group.

Chris Roberts, Northern Electric's chief executive, said: "These excellent results demonstrate why we believe Northern Electric is best placed to continue delivering for customers, employees and investors alone rather than as part of a CE Electric subsidiary."

He claimed the takeover offer was "opportunistic and does not reflect the strategic value of our networks or our leading role supporting the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy."  Mr Roberts also insisted Northern Electric's board would only consider bids that "fully recognise these facts."

The robust rejection and confident results have won the support of some major shareholders, but have so far failed to deter CE Electric. It still has several weeks to submit a revised offer before a "put up or shut up" deadline imposed by the UK takeover regulator. CE Electric is expected to return with an improved bid of up to £12bn in an effort to tempt investors away from Northern Electric's vision of independence.

Sources close to CE Electric said it remained committed to a deal that would generate "significant economies of scale and ensure the continued secure supply of affordable and sustainable electricity across Britain." They suggested a revised offer would address concerns over valuation but warned this was "contingent on engagement from the Northern Electric board."
