Dixons Group Profits Soar by 53% Fueled by Strong PC Sales, but Shares Fall on Tax Concerns  

Technology retailer Dixons Group reported a 53% jump in profits for the first half of its fiscal year, boosted by surging sales of personal computers and gaming equipment as people worked and studied from home during pandemic lockdowns. 

Pre-tax profits came in at £75 million for the six months to October, up from £49 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue climbed 15% to £4.1 billion, Dixons said, fueled by a 34% rise in computing sales. The results beat analyst estimates.

However, Dixons shares fell as much as 8% in early London trading as investors worried the retailer may face higher tax bills. The UK government announced plans to increase corporation tax to 25% from 19% in 2023. Dixons said the policy change could increase its effective tax rate in future years.

The profit increase was particularly stark given the tough comparable period last year. In the first half of fiscal 2020, Dixons' stores were open for less than half the time due to tight pandemic restrictions. The reopening of physical stores, combined with strong online demand, drove the revenue and profit rebound. 

“There has been no let-up in the demand for technology as people continue to work, learn and stay connected at home," said Chief Executive Alex Baldock. The trends that emerged during lockdowns are "enduring," he said.  

Dixons now expects pre-tax profit for the full year to exceed the top end of analyst estimates of £151 million to £174 million. However, the company warned that supply chain issues pose a risk to sales, and its Russian business remains unprofitable. 

Some analysts said strong cash generation and Dixons' market dominance in the UK and Nordic region make the retailer well positioned for future growth. But others worry that demand for laptops and gaming consoles may start to slow as people return to offices and schools and start traveling again.

"The pandemic brought forward a lot of technology demand, so there are concerns this strength won't persist into next year," said Richard Lim, an analyst at Retail Economics. Still, "as technology becomes ever more integral to daily life there are lots of opportunities for Dixons on the horizon."

Dixons remains confident in its strategy of providing customers with expert advice in stores while offering competitive prices and a wide range of tech products online. Mr. Baldock said he expects "habits formed over the last year" of shopping more digitally and focusing on health, home and connectivity products to endure even as life slowly returns to normal.
