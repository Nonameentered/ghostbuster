Possible Takeover of Yorkshire Electricity Dampened by Election Uncertainty 

Shares in Yorkshire Electricity PLC fell more than 7% today amid rumors that a major takeover bid from European utility giant Energia SA has stalled due to uncertainty around the upcoming general election. Yorkshire Electricity, which supplies power to more than 2 million households across Northern England, has been seen as an attractive target for larger competitors looking to expand in the UK market. However, sources say Energia has paused its pursuit of Yorkshire Electricity until after the 12 December election to gain more clarity on the political and regulatory environment.

Energia, which is headquartered in Spain but operates in 23 countries, has long been rumored as a potential bidder for Yorkshire Electricity. Yorkshire Electricity’s stable customer base, consistent profits and dividend payments, and transmission infrastructure are seen as valuable assets that would help Energia gain scale in the UK. Analysts estimate Yorkshire Electricity could fetch up to £6 billion in a takeover.  

However, Prime Minister Theresa May’s surprise call for a snap general election in early June has introduced uncertainty for businesses and investors, especially around key issues like Brexit. The major political parties have laid out differing visions for the UK’s departure from the European Union, and the makeup of the government that emerges from the election will shape the Brexit process. Energia likely wants to see how the election unfolds and whether a new government may take a different tack on Brexit and infrastructure investment before committing to what would be one of the largest takeovers of a UK utility.

“Energia has always seen Yorkshire Electricity as a prize asset, but they’re in no rush to pull the trigger on a deal this big,” said Simon Jenkins, an energy analyst at Numis Securities. “They can afford to wait a few more months to make sure they have better visibility on where the political winds are blowing before unveiling an offer. A lot can change, so unless there’s another buyer emerging, Yorkshire Electricity is probably stuck in limbo until at least the new year.”

Representatives for Energia SA and Yorkshire Electricity declined to comment. Yorkshire Electricity’s shares recovered some of their losses in afternoon trading but still ended down over 5% at 433 pence, their lowest level since August. The company’s shareholders, which include large investment funds and thousands of individual investors, had anticipated a takeover battle and bumper payoff. But for now, they too will have to wait to see how the election uncertainty unfolds before knowing Yorkshire Electricity’s fate.
