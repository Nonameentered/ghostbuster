British Retailers See Modest Christmas Sales Growth

UK retailers enjoyed a modest increase in sales over the Christmas shopping period, marking the ninth consecutive year of growth. According to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), retail sales in the UK rose by 1.8% in December compared to the same month last year. While a positive result, the growth was below the three-year average of 2.2% and suggests British consumers remain cautious in their spending. 

"December proved to be a competitive month for retailers who were hoping for some Christmas cheer after another tough year on the high street," said Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC. "However, despite a flurry of festive promotions to capture sales, the result was steady rather than spectacular, serving as a reminder that the industry continues to face headwinds."

The moderate sales figures reflect a continuation of restrained consumer spending that has characterized the UK economy in recent years. While unemployment has remained low and wage growth has picked up, Brexit-related uncertainty and high levels of personal debt have made shoppers wary. “Consumers continue to spend cautiously as economic and political uncertainties weigh on confidence,” noted Ms. Dickinson.

Not all retailers benefited equally over the holiday period. Clothing and footwear stores saw sales drop by 2.1%, while food and drink outlets enjoyed a 4.3% boost. Department stores also struggled with a 0.5% decline in sales. In contrast, online retailers continued their march forward with sales up 6.9% in December compared to last year.

Overall, the BRC's figures suggest there was no return to the “spend, spend, spend” culture that was common in the booming 1980s. Britons shopped selectively and looked for bargains and promotions to make the most of their money. While not dismaying, the modest sales results highlight the challenges facing an industry adjusting to new shopping habits and economic realities. Retailers will be hoping consumer confidence and spending power strengthen in 2020.
