Scottish Power promises 19% dividend increase after strong half year results and savings from takeover 

Scottish Power, the UK energy company, announced it will increase its dividend by 19% this year thanks to strong results in the first half of 2021 and cost savings achieved through its acquisition of rival SSE last year.

The company reported a 23% increase in operating profit to £962 million for the six months ending June 30, 2021. Revenue also rose by 18% to £4.6 billion, driven by higher electricity and gas demand as the UK economy continues to reopen from pandemic restrictions. Scottish Power benefited from more commercial and industrial customers resuming operations as well as an uptick in consumer activity.

Last year, Scottish Power completed its £12.5 billion takeover of SSE, one of Britain’s other “Big Six” energy firms. The merger has enabled Scottish Power to cut costs through operational synergies, with the company reporting it has already achieved £156 million in annual savings. The deal has also increased Scottish Power’s customer base to 11 million households, strengthening its position as the third largest energy supplier in the UK.

With the strong results and cost benefits from the SSE acquisition flowing through, Scottish Power said it will increase its dividend for the full year by 19% to 29.5 pence per share. The interim dividend was also raised by 19% to 14.75 pence per share. Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power, said “We are pleased to deliver strong results for the first half of the year and reward shareholders with a significant dividend increase, made possible by the substantial synergies from our acquisition of SSE and improved performance across all our businesses.”

However, Anderson cautioned that there are still challenges ahead, including the rising cost of natural gas which is putting pressure on profit margins. The UK government’s price cap on energy bills also poses risks to suppliers if costs continue to increase. Still, Scottish Power remains optimistic for the full year given the momentum in its results so far in 2021. With its larger size and cost advantages following the SSE deal, Scottish Power is well positioned to navigate future uncertainties in the UK energy market.
