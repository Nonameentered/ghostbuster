Arjo Wiggins Appleton Reports Sharp Drop in Profits, Fragile Outlook for Second Half  

Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the British paper manufacturer, reported a steep decline in first-half profits today due to rising costs and lower sales. Pre-tax profits slumped 47% to £13.9 million in the six months to June 30 compared with the same period last year.  

The company blamed higher input costs, especially for pulp and chemicals, as well as the cost of recent investments in its mills. Revenue edged up 1.5% to £511 million, but margins were squeezed as the company was unable to pass on cost increases to customers in full.  

The results highlight the challenging environment for paper companies as demand is weakening in some sectors. Although Arjo Wiggins Appleton reported stable volumes, chief executive Howard Smith cautioned that market conditions remain fragile. “There are signs of slowing economic growth in some of our markets, especially in Europe, and predicting how our sales will fare in the second half remains very difficult,” he said.

Higher costs for pulp, a key raw material, show no signs of abating, putting further pressure on margins. The company is locked in annual price negotiations with suppliers to secure pulp for the next year, but Mr Smith expects prices will rise by a “high single digit percentage”. Such an increase would deal another blow to profits without offsetting price rises.

To combat higher costs, the company has raised prices for its paper products over the last year and has plans for further increases in the coming months. However, demand concerns mean price rises will be limited, the company warned.  

Arjo Wiggins Appleton’s main markets are in Europe, especially the UK and France, but it also has a growing presence in North America, Asia and Latin America. The company produces a range of printing and publishing papers as well as passport papers, banknotes and other security products. 

The company’s shares fell 3% in early trading as investors reacted to the results and downbeat outlook for the second half of the year. The stock is down by nearly a quarter over the last 12 months. Arjo Wiggins Appleton has a market value of £327 million.

Mr Smith said he remained focused on cost control and efficiency improvements to shore up margins, but warned that benefits from the previous restructuring of its paper mills are coming to an end. Further investments may be needed for the company to remain competitive, he said.
