CalEnergy Co Inc Wins Hostile Bid to Take Over Northern Electric Plc for $1.31 Billion 

CalEnergy Co Inc, the large US-based renewable energy company, has succeeded in its hostile takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc, the UK-based wind and solar farm operator. After raising its offer to £1 billion ($1.31 billion), Northern Electric’s board has agreed to the buyout. The deal marks one of the largest acquisitions of a British company by an American firm since the Brexit vote in 2016.

CalEnergy launched its unsolicited bid for Northern Electric in April, initially offering £875 million. The Northern Electric board rejected that offer, calling it “opportunistic and substantially undervaluing the company and its prospects.” However, two of Northern Electric’s largest institutional shareholders came out in favor of a deal.

Under the final terms, CalEnergy will pay £10 per share for Northern Electric, a 66% premium to the company’s share price before the bid. Northern Electric’s chair Gerard Nolan said “this significantly improved offer, at an attractive valuation, is in the best interests of shareholders, employees, and all stakeholders.” The company’s shares rose 55% in early London trading on news of the deal.

The acquisition strengthens CalEnergy’s position in the fast-growing clean energy generation market. The company is already the largest operator of solar farms in the western US, and this deal provides entry into the promising UK and European market. Stephen Yarrow, the chief executive of CalEnergy, said “this transaction is transformational for CalEnergy, giving us access to Northern Electric’s large, diversified asset base across the UK and a strong development pipeline.”

As part of the takeover terms, CalEnergy pledged to maintain Northern Electric’s operations and staffing in the UK. However, analysts expect some job losses at the corporate level due to duplication. CalEnergy may also look to sell some assets to help finance the acquisition. The deal is subject to regulatory approval in the UK, a process that is expected to take 3 to 4 months. 

Rival bidders could still emerge, though the chances of a counterproposal are diminishing given the wide support for the current offer. Some environmental groups have raised concerns about foreign ownership of critical UK infrastructure. But the government can take some comfort from CalEnergy’s promises to uphold Northern Electric’s commitments to renewable energy. Overall, if completed, the deal looks set to shake up Britain’s energy generation sector, accelerating expansion in solar and wind power. For CalEnergy, its victory sees the company strongly positioned as a new force in Europe’s green energy revolution.
