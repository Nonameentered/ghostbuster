UK Government Likely to Approve CE Electric's Bid for Northern Electric Despite Political Concerns, Sources Say

The UK government is expected to approve CE Electric's £8.25 billion bid for Northern Electric within the next two weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter. The decision would bring to an end an 18 month long regulatory review and political debate over whether to allow the American power company to take control of one of Britain's oldest regional electric utilities. 

CE Electric, based in Houston, Texas, announced its intention to acquire Northern Electric in January 2019, citing its desire to expand into the UK energy market. However, the proposed deal has been controversial due to concerns over foreign ownership of critical infrastructure and the impact on consumer prices. Several members of parliament have voiced opposition to the takeover and have urged the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to block the transaction.

Despite the political pressure, government officials involved in the review told the Financial Times that BEIS secretary Andrea Leadsom is ultimately likely to approve the deal after CE Electric offered several remedies to address concerns around security of supply, consumer protection, and jobs. The remedies are said to include significant new investment in the Northern Electric power network, a price freeze on consumer bills for at least two years, and a guarantee to retain 85% of the company's 5,400 employees for five years. 

Northern Electric, which provides power to over 3.5 million households across northern England and Wales, was put up for sale by its major shareholders, including several UK pension funds, in 2018. CE Electric outbid several European competitors for the historic company, which was first formed in 1847. Supporters argue the takeover will provide much needed new capital for network upgrades and the transition to more renewable energy. However, critics claim the government should not allow critical infrastructure to fall into foreign ownership, especially in the post-Brexit era.

CE Electric declined to comment on the approval decision. A spokesperson for BEIS said: “The department is continuing to review CE Electric's proposed acquisition of Northern Electric to ensure it is in the public interest before making a final decision.” The political controversy surrounding the deal highlights the tensions between Britain's traditional aversion to foreign takeovers of key companies and assets, and the need for funding to support the country's renewable energy transition and infrastructure needs. The final decision is expected by BEIS within the next two weeks.
