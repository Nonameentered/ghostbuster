Sainsbury Shares Drop as Sales Improvement Costs Hit Profits 

Shares in Sainsbury's fell over 3% today as the UK's second largest supermarket chain reported lower profits due to rising costs associated with improvements to sales and operations.

Sainsbury's said its pre-tax profits declined 8% to £203 million in the 26 weeks ending September 21. The drop in profits came even as the company reported a 0.9% increase in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the second quarter, which was an improvement from a 1.6% drop in the first quarter. 

The company attributed the profit decline to higher costs related to price cuts, staff wages, and greater online capability and infrastructure. Sales were boosted by the company's rollout of new branded items, expansion of its clothing and general merchandise ranges, and investments in lower prices, especially in fresh food. The company also benefited from warm summer weather and events like the Cricket World Cup.

"We have delivered positive like-for-like sales growth through the first half, with sequentially improving trends, and our absolute sales performance demonstrates the resilience of our business model," said Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe. "We have made good progress with our strategy, including the proposed merger with Asda, and remain focused on delivering our key priorities."

The Asda merger is still awaiting final approval, but if approved could provide opportunities for considerable cost savings over the long run. The company will provide an update on the merger approval process with its full first half results in November.

The profit decline shows the pressure facing Britain's major supermarkets as they cut prices and boost investments to remain competitive. Last week, rival Tesco reported flat profits as it also invested in lower prices and cost-saving programs. However, analysts noted Tesco was able to balance these costs better to keep profits steady. 

Sainsbury's is aiming for £500 million in cost savings over the next three years through efficiency improvements and streamlining various operations. The company said it has identified ways to cut costs in procurement, general merchandise, and through eliminating waste. Some analysts argue more substantial cost savings will not emerge unless and until the Asda merger is completed, as the combination would allow for efficiencies and the elimination of excess capacity across areas like logistics, purchasing, and head office functions.
