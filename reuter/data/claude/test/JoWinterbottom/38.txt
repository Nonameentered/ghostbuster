British Supermarkets Focus on Profitability in 1997: Hunt for Higher Margins and Diversification

Britain's leading supermarkets are gearing up for a challenging year in 1997 as many face slowing growth in their core grocery sales. In response, they are sharpening their focus on improving profit margins and diversifying into new areas to boost earnings and keep shareholders happy.

Grocery sales growth has slowed in recent years as the market has become increasingly competitive and saturated. The industry bellwether Tesco reported third quarter UK like-for-like sales growth of just 3.7%, down from over 5% a year ago. Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket, revealed even weaker numbers, with UK like-for-like sales up only 1.1% in its second quarter.  

With consumer grocery spending tightening, supermarkets are re-doubling their efforts to cut costs to defend their profit margins. Tesco has pledged to find £500 million in annual cost savings, an increase on its previous £350 million target. Sainsbury's is looking to strip out £300 million in costs over two years, up from £150 million, while No. 4 player Wm Morrisons aims to cut £50-100 million in costs for its new financial year.

The supermarkets are also seeking new sources of growth beyond groceries to fuel earnings. Tesco continues to expand its general merchandise ranges, including clothing and electricals. It now aims for 30-40% of sales to come from non-food items, up from 22% today. Sainsbury's is revamping its clothing lines while developing in-store concessions for other retailers like BHS. Morrisons is investing heavily in its convenience store format and online capabilities.  

Diversification into new geographies represents another path to growth. Tesco today generates over half its profits from international operations, especially in Asia. It continues to open new stores across Central Europe and China at a rapid pace. Sainsbury's purchased a controlling stake in an Egyptian retailer last year and acquired several stores in Ireland, seeking to replicate Tesco's overseas success.

Despite the challenging environment, most analysts remain optimistic about the supermarket sector. Grocery spending is still growing overall, even if at a slower rate. The major players continue to gain market share from smaller chains thanks to their scale and operational efficiencies. Their moves into new categories and geographies also provide opportunities for healthier top line growth over the medium term. With high single-digit earnings growth still on offer, Britain's supermarkets remain attractive for long term investors, even as 1997 looks set to be a year of consolidation.
