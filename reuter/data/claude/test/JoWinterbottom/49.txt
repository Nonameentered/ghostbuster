Tesco to Launch Joint Venture in Financial Services with Royal Bank of Scotland, Following UK Supermarket Trend

Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, announced today that it will launch a joint venture in financial services with the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to offer banking, savings, credit cards, and insurance products to Tesco customers. The new joint venture, called Tesco Bank, will begin operations in 2009 pending regulatory approval.

The move follows a trend in the UK supermarket industry to expand into financial services. Rival chains such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer already offer financial products to their customers. By partnering with RBS, one of the UK's largest banks, Tesco aims to quickly establish a strong position in financial services.

"Tesco Bank will transform banking for UK consumers and revolutionize the way people buy financial services," said Stuart Chambers, non-executive chairman of Tesco Bank. "By applying our customer knowledge and value for money principles to banking, we will provide real choice and competition in financial services."

Under the agreement, RBS and Tesco will each hold 50% of the shares in Tesco Bank. RBS will operate the joint venture and provide the banking license and infrastructure to offer the financial products. Tesco will leverage its vast customer base and brand to market the products. The goal is to eventually offer customers a one-stop shop for both groceries and basic financial services.

Industry analysts say the announcement highlights the competitive threat that major retailers pose to traditional banks. "Supermarkets have a number of key advantages over mainstream banks," said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. "They have knowledge of their huge customer bases, strong brand names and low cost distribution networks via stores."

The new joint venture will initially focus on basic banking, savings, and unsecured lending products. Tesco and RBS aim to eventually expand into areas such as mortgages, insurance, and travel services. A launch of the initial product range is planned for mid-2009, with a full rollout of services within the next few years. Existing Tesco customers will be targeted first before offerings are extended to new customers. 

Tesco has been rumored for years to be interested in launching its own bank. The partnership with RBS allows Tesco to quickly enter the market without building its own bank from scratch. For RBS, the deal provides an opportunity to reach new customers through Tesco's nationwide network of over 2,200 stores and its 16 million Clubcard members. RBS also expects to benefit from Tesco's strong brand and low cost infrastructure.

The announcement of Tesco Bank confirms that competition in UK financial services is set to intensify. Major retailers are poised to take significant market share away from established High Street banks, a trend that is likely to result in greater consumer choice and lower prices over time. With its unrivaled scale and brand recognition, Tesco is well positioned to shake up the UK banking landscape.
