Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc reports lower than expected profits but increases dividend by 11%

Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc (SHE), one of Scotland's largest energy providers, reported its full-year results today. Profits fell slightly below analysts' expectations, coming in at £486 million for the year ended December 31, down 3% from £501 million the previous year. However, the company raised its total dividend by 11% as it continues to generate strong cash flow.

The drop in profits was attributed to a very competitive energy market in the UK that has squeezed retail profit margins. SHE's retail division, which supplies electricity and gas to over 3 million households across Scotland and parts of England, saw operating profits decrease by 8% to £312 million. The division continues to face pressure to keep prices low at a time when wholesale energy costs have been volatile.

On the other hand, SHE's renewable energy and networks divisions performed well, helping to offset some of the decline in retail profits. The renewable energy division, which comprises over 2 gigawatts of wind power capacity, saw profits rise by 15% to £104 million due to higher wind speeds and increased government subsidies. The networks division, which owns and operates the electricity transmission network in the north of Scotland, reported profits up 4% to £224 million. 

SHE's CEO Angus McIntosh said, "While competition in the retail energy market continues to be intense, I'm pleased with the performance of our renewable energy and networks divisions. We remain focused on delivering affordable and sustainable energy for our customers through investment in renewable and low-carbon technologies. The increased dividend reflects our strong balance sheet and cash generation."

The higher dividend will be paid on July 15 to shareholders on the register as of June 24. SHE shares rose 1.2% in early trading as investors reacted positively to the dividend increase before slipping back and trading down 0.6% at midday. The stock remains up 3% over the last 12 months.

Looking ahead, most analysts expect profits to stabilize for SHE over the next year as cost-cutting measures begin to have an impact on retail profit margins. However, retail price controls, political and regulatory intervention, and the broader economic situation in the UK remain risks to the company’s outlook. SHE also faces uncertainty from the outcome of Brexit and its impact on investments or operations.
