Sainsbury's Homebase Launches Insurance Products with Help from Willis Corroon 

Sainsbury's Homebase, the home improvement and gardening retailer, announced today the launch of a range of home and contents insurance products underwritten by Willis Corroon, the global insurance broker. The new products will be available for purchase on Homebase's website and in stores across the UK starting next month.

The launch of insurance products is part of Homebase's wider strategy to diversify its offerings beyond traditional home furnishing and gardening goods. By partnering with Willis Corroon, a leading insurance provider in the UK, Homebase aims to tap into the lucrative insurance market and provide its customers with comprehensive and competitively-priced coverage for homes and valuables.

The initial product range will include building insurance to protect the structure and fixtures of homes, as well as contents insurance to cover possessions from events like theft, fire, or flood damage. Homebase said additional products like mobile phone insurance, legal expenses cover, and accidental damage insurance will be introduced in the coming months based on customer demand. 

Willis Corroon will manage all underwriting, pricing, policies, and claims related to the new insurance products. Homebase will market and sell the products under its brand to leverage its large customer base and nationwide store network. The partnership allows Homebase to quickly roll out a full suite of insurance offerings without having to build the necessary operational capabilities and expertise in-house.

"We strive to offer our customers great value and convenience," said Simon Potts, Managing Director of Sainsbury's Homebase. "Home and contents insurance is a natural fit with our aim to be the first port of call for homes and gardens. We chose to work with Willis Corroon because of their proven track record in developing and delivering insurance products through partners." 

The new insurance products are the latest initiative in Homebase's turnaround efforts. The retailer was sold by Australian owner Wesfarmers for just Â£1 in 2017 after years of poor performance. Under new ownership, Homebase has closed underperforming stores, revamped its product range, and invested in new partnerships to spur growth. The company hopes the move into insurance and other high-margin services will help return the brand to profitable growth.
