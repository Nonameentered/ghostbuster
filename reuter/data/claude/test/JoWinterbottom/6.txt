CE Electric Raises Offer for Northern Electric to Final 650 Pence a Share, But Bid Rejected

CE Electric, a major utility company based in London, increased its takeover offer for Northern Electric PLC to 650 pence a share, valuing the smaller utility at £8.1 billion. However, the Northern Electric board rejected CE Electric’s “final” offer, saying it undervalued the company. 

The new offer from CE Electric represented a 50 pence per share increase over its previous 600 pence per share bid, which Northern Electric also rejected. CE Electric said its latest offer is its “best and final” and that it would not make any further bids.

“We believe 650 pence a share is a very compelling offer and represents full value for Northern Electric,” said Catherine Richards, CEO of CE Electric. “We are disappointed the Northern Electric board has rejected our bid without properly engaging with us.”

Northern Electric’s board responded that the latest offer still does not adequately value Northern Electric’s strong market position, high-quality electricity network assets, and potential for future growth. The board said the company’s stand-alone valuation remains significantly above 650 pence per share.

“Northern Electric is a premium utility asset, and CE Electric’s offer continues to undervalue our company,” said David Thompson, chairman of Northern Electric. “Our board’s duty is to achieve the best outcome for Northern Electric shareholders. We do not believe accepting CE Electric’s offer would achieve that.”

Analysts said it is unsurprising that Northern Electric rejected CE Electric’s latest offer, given the board’s view that the value of its assets and growth potential are not adequately reflected at 650 pence per share. However, some large Northern Electric shareholders have signaled support for a deal at the right price, indicating the company may face pressure to engage if CE Electric makes an offer at 700 pence per share or higher.

The takeover battle for Northern Electric highlights the pressure on U.K. utility companies to consolidate in the face of regulatory challenges and the shift to renewable energy. CE Electric has said a deal for Northern Electric would create cost savings and synergies to benefit both companies. But any deal remains uncertain without an offer that Northern Electric’s board is willing to recommend to shareholders.
