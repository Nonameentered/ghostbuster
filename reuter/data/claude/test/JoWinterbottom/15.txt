Remaining independent British regional electricity companies face potential predator bids after U.S.-based CE Electric receives government approval for hostile takeover of Northern Electric  

U.S. power company CE Electric won approval from British regulators this week to acquire Northern Electric, one of Britain's seven remaining independent regional electricity distribution companies, in a $5.2 billion hostile takeover deal. The move has sparked fears that the remaining independent power distributors may now be vulnerable to predator bids from large multinational energy companies.

CE Electric launched a hostile bid for Northern Electric last year after the British company rebuffed several offers of a friendly merger. CE Electric pursued the hostile bid despite opposition from Northern Electric's board of directors and management. However, after months of review, the British Competition and Markets Authority ruled that the takeover could proceed if CE Electric agreed to certain conditions regarding operating licenses, service quality, and rates. 

With the path now clear for CE Electric to acquire Northern Electric, analysts say the other independent regional electricity companies—which were privatized in the 1990s—may face pressure to find merger partners or buyers to fend off potential hostile bids. "The smaller players realize they are vulnerable, and the CE Electric-Northern Electric deal proves that regulators will allow these consolidation plays if they don't dramatically impact consumers," said Brian Harrigan, an analyst with Cannacord Genuity based in London.

The six remaining independent regional electricity companies in Britain distribute power to households and businesses in specific geographic franchise areas. Though they were initially privatized as separate companies, over the past two decades many merged to gain scale or were acquired by major utilities like France's EDF Energy and Spain's Iberdrola. After the Northern Electric deal closes, only two of Britain's 14 regional distribution networks will remain outside the control of multinational power companies.

Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of energy and climate policy at the Institute for Public Policy Research, warned that further consolidation could reduce competition and innovation. "The more of these regional networks that get acquired by large utilities, the less incentive there is for new approaches to management, service, renewables integration, and rate setting," he said. 

However, others argue that takeovers by large, well-capitalized power companies could benefit consumers, particularly as Britain moves to decarbonize its energy system. "Change is coming to this sector, and larger companies may be better equipped to make the necessary investments," said Susie J. Knight, head of the energy practice at Berwin Leighton Paisner, a London law firm. "Scale may well be an advantage rather than a disadvantage for navigating the transition to distributed and renewable energy."

The fate of the remaining independent regional electricity companies remains unclear, but most analysts expect further consolidation in the months to come. After the Northern Electric deal, the pack of potential buyers and the premiums offered for these strategically positioned power distributors may be on the rise.
