Safeway Warns of Slowing Sales and Zero Inflation, Sparking Fears for Supermarket Sector  

Safeway, the UK's second largest supermarket chain, has warned of falling sales and stagnant inflationary pressures over the summer, stoking concerns about the prospects for the wider grocery retail sector.

In a trading update covering the 12 weeks to early September, Safeway said like-for-like sales fell 1.1% compared with the same period last year. This marks the first quarter of declining sales for the company in more than two years. Safeway attributed the drop in sales to the hot summer weather, which it said encouraged consumers to eat out rather than shop for groceries. However, there are fears the weak performance could signal an underlying slowdown in the supermarket industry.  

Safeway also warned that the Brexit uncertainty and competitive pressures in the sector were keeping a tight lid on price inflation, resulting in "almost zero" food price inflation over the quarter. This will squeeze profit margins for retailers. The muted inflation comes despite the drop in the pound since the Brexit referendum, which has pushed up import costs for grocers.  

"While we always knew the summer trading period would be challenging given events such as the football World Cup, our sales performance was behind our expectations. The combination of high temperatures and the football meant less meal preparation at home and that has impacted sales," said David Potts, chief executive of Safeway.

He added: "We continue to face significant cost pressures from exchange rate fluctuations and business rates. With almost zero inflation in the grocery sector, this is creating pressures for our supply chain and is damaging investment."

The downbeat update from Safeway adds to fears for Britain's biggest industry. Tesco and Walmart-owned Asda have also warned of challenges, while German discount rivals Aldi and Lidl continue to expand aggressively, taking market share. Sainsbury's will provide an insight into the state of the market when it updates on trading next week.

"The progress of the last year feels like it's slowing down for the big grocers," said Bruno Monteyne, analyst at investment bank Bernstein. "So far, the World Cup and the weather are being blamed, but there will be worries this hides more fundamentals underlying issues. Safeway's warning is a reality check on the huge challenges faced by the industry." 

Shares in Safeway fell 3.7% in early trading. The retail-focused FTSE 350 general retailers index fell 1.3% as investors fretted over the outlook for discretionary spending. Grocery industry analysts warned the tough environment was likely to impact profits in the sector.
