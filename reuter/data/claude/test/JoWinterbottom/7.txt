CalEnergy Inc. Raises Hostile Bid for Northern Electric Plc, Sets Deadline  

CalEnergy Inc. announced today that it has increased its unsolicited takeover bid for Northern Electric Plc, a UK-based power utility company. CalEnergy raised its all-cash offer to $38 per share from the $36 per share bid it made last month. The revised offer values Northern Electric at $4.2 billion. 

CalEnergy's chairman and CEO, John Smith, said in a statement that the new offer represents a "full and fair valuation" of Northern Electric based on its assets and growth prospects. However, Northern Electric rejected CalEnergy's previous bid last month, calling it "opportunistic and substantially undervaluing the company." Northern Electric's board has also enacted anti-takeover measures to block CalEnergy's overtures.

In a letter to Northern Electric shareholders, Mr. Smith said, "The CalEnergy Board remains convinced that a combination of our two companies would create substantial value for shareholders of both companies." He added that CalEnergy would work with regulators to ensure the deal benefits consumers and does not reduce competition.

CalEnergy's latest takeover bid includes a deadline for Northern Electric's board to enter into discussions or face a potential proxy fight. If Northern Electric does not engage with CalEnergy by June 15, CalEnergy said it may nominate its own slate of directors to Northern Electric's board to allow shareholders to vote on the deal.

The takeover battle pits two of the largest power companies in the UK and US markets with a combined market value of over $50 billion. A successful deal would create one of the world's biggest utilities companies and further the consolidation of the power sector. However, analysts say there is no guarantee CalEnergy will prevail in its unsolicited approach or that it will raise its bid further. Anti-trust concerns may also pose risks to any deal.

Northern Electric's shares rose 3% following the news of the increased bid. CalEnergy's stock remained largely flat, indicating its shareholders are uncertain if the deal will go through given the potential costs and risks involved in a hostile takeover. The outcome remains uncertain as both sides appear locked in a stalemate, unwilling to compromise at this point. All eyes will be on whether Northern Electric's board and shareholders find CalEnergy's latest offer compelling enough to bring them to the negotiating table.
