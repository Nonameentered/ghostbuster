Sainsbury's Aims to Regain Lead Position by Emphasising Traditional Strengths of Choice, Quality, and Value, says Deputy CEO 

Sainsbury's, the UK's second largest supermarket chain, today outlined its strategy to regain its position as the nation's favourite grocer. Speaking at an investor event, Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Deputy CEO, said the company will double down on the attributes that have historically set it apart: providing customers with unparalleled choice, high quality products, and great value.

"Customers choose Sainsbury's because we offer the widest selection of high-quality, affordable groceries under one roof," said Mills-Hicks. "While we've made good progress innovating our digital capabilities and improving operational efficiency, we realise we took our eye off the ball in delivering the traditional strengths our customers expect and deserve."

Sainsbury's has seen its market share decline in recent years as budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl have expanded aggressively. Its proposed merger with Asda was blocked by regulators in 2019 over competition concerns. The company reported flat sales growth over the holidays, indicating it continues to struggle gaining back shoppers. 

Mills-Hicks acknowledged Sainsbury's needs to do better and outlined several initiatives to improve its value proposition. The company will introduce lower prices on hundreds of staples like bread, milk, bananas, and tea. It will also expand its Aldi Price Match campaign, which compares the cost of a large basket of Sainsbury's groceries to the same items from Aldi and matches Aldi's prices.

The grocer is also enhancing quality and choice. It aims to increase sales of its premium Taste the Difference lines, which offer high-quality, artisanal products. It is expanding its locally-sourced British meat, farmed salmon, and organic produce ranges. And it will introduce more world cuisine options to highlight its diverse, globally-inspired range of products.

Several new services will provide additional value and convenience. Scan and Shop, which allows customers to scan items as they shop and pay at dedicated terminals to skip the checkout line, will roll out to 50 more stores. Chop Chop, an on-demand grocery delivery service, will extend to 30% of the population. And SmartShop self-scanning will be an option at all superstores.

The strategy aims to leverage Sainsbury's significant assets, including its network of over 1,400 convenience stores, supermarkets, and Argos general merchandise shops. Integrating Argos into more supermarkets and enabling customers to order groceries along with general merchandise in a single transaction can unlock meaningful benefits, according to Mills-Hicks.   

He acknowledged that improving value and customer experience will require investment, but said cost savings from operational changes will fund price cuts and new services. While the strategy signals an end to Sainsbury's pursuit of major acquisitions, Mills-Hicks said the company remains open to tactical deals that complement its core business. The management team's goal is to achieve market share and transaction growth within 18 to 24 months.

"With this comprehensive set of actions focused on the fundamentals of choice, quality, and value, we believe we have the plan needed to make Sainsbury's the nation's most trusted retailer once again," Mills-Hicks concluded. The company's shares rose 3% following the announcement, indicating the City believes Sainsbury's has the right recipe to regain its lead position in British retailing.
