Wessex Water reports 10 percent rise in half year pretax profits and 14 percent dividend increase, but disappoints shareholders with lack of immediate benefits  

Wessex Water, the UK's largest water utility, reported a 10 percent increase in pretax profits to Â£321 million for the six months ending September 30. The company also announced a 14 percent increase in its interim dividend to 15.8 pence per share. However, shares fell 3 percent on the news as investors were disappointed with the lack of additional benefits or share buybacks.

The profit gains were driven by lower costs from renegotiated supplier contracts and a continued investment program to improve infrastructure efficiency. Revenue also rose 3 percent due to an increase in water bills for customers in line with inflation.  

While the results were solid and continue a multi-year trend of steady growth, shareholders were hoping for more immediate rewards. Wessex Water has significant cash reserves and a healthy balance sheet, leading investors to anticipate an announcement of share repurchases, special dividends or other benefits. However, the company said it will maintain its focus on long term investment.

"Our strategy remains consistent - efficiently managing costs while continuing to invest in infrastructure, service and innovation for the benefit of customers and the environment," said CEO Tom Smith. "We aim to deliver sustainable value for shareholders over the long run through consistent and responsible financial and operational performance."

Analysts noted the results and shareholder disappointment highlight the balancing act utility companies face. "Wessex Water has to keep investing in essential infrastructure upgrades and improvements demanded by regulators and customers. But at some point, they need to provide tangible benefits for shareholders beyond just slow and steady earnings and dividend growth. It's an open question of how and when they will square that circle," said Brian Cox, utilities analyst at Ambrose Investments.

Environmental groups also called on Wessex Water to do more for communities and sustainability initiatives if it is generating strong profits. The company said its investment program funds green energy, recycling and conservation projects. Advocates argue more could still be done, particularly to address affordability concerns.    Overall, while the results were solid, Wessex Water faces pressure to benefit both shareholders and stakeholders in new ways going forward. Future announcements will be closely scrutinized as a result.
