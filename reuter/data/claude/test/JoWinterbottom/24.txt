Takeover Panel Launches Probe into Northern Electric’s Battle Against Hostile U.S. Takeover Bid

The U.K. Takeover Panel announced today that it has launched a formal investigation into tactics used by Northern Electric PLC to fend off a $32 billion hostile takeover bid by U.S.-based Pacific Energy Partners. 

The Takeover Panel said it will examine whether Northern Electric properly disclosed its agreement with French utility Énergie de l'Europe to sell a 25% stake in Northern Electric’s distribution and transmission business. The Takeover Panel will investigate whether this agreement qualifies as a “material change in circumstances” that Northern Electric should have announced publicly under the Takeover Code.

Pacific Energy Partners launched its takeover bid for Northern Electric last month, offering a 30% premium over Northern Electric’s share price. Northern Electric rejected the bid within a week, saying the offer “substantially undervalues” the company. Two weeks later, Northern Electric announced its agreement with Énergie de l'Europe, which Northern Electric said made it a less attractive takeover target. 

Pacific Energy Partners cried foul and asked the Takeover Panel to investigate. Pacific Energy Partners alleges that Northern Electric has “hidden” the deal with Énergie de l'Europe to frustrate the takeover bid. Northern Electric claims it agreed to the deal with Énergie de l'Europe before Pacific Energy Partners launched its bid, but it took time to finalize the terms.

The Takeover Panel’s investigation is expected to take at least three months. If it finds that Northern Electric breached its disclosure obligations, the Takeover Panel can issue a public reprimand, fine Northern Electric, or in an extreme case require Northern Electric’s board of directors to resign.
