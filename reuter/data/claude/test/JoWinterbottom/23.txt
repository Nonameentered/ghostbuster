Takeover Panel investigates Northern Electric's bid against hostile takeover from US 

The Takeover Panel has launched an investigation into defensive tactics employed by Northern Electric to ward off an unsolicited takeover bid from US-based utility giant PowerCo. The Panel will examine whether Northern Electric's recent issuance of new shares was designed specifically to dilute PowerCo's stake in the company and make the acquisition prohibitively expensive.

PowerCo launched a hostile takeover of Northern Electric last month, offering a 50% premium on Northern Electric's share price, which would value the UK utility at £8 billion. However, Northern Electric's board unanimously rejected the offer, arguing that it significantly undervalues the company and its potential for future growth. 

In an attempt to resist the takeover, Northern Electric announced a new share issuance last week, raising £2 billion through a share placement and rights issue offered at a discount to existing shareholders. The move surprised analysts, given Northern Electric's relatively low debt levels and funding requirements. PowerCo criticised the capital raising as an "egregious tactic to frustrate its takeover offer and deprive shareholders of an opportunity to realise the value from its proposal".

The Takeover Panel will investigate whether Northern Electric's primary purpose in raising new capital was indeed to make the company a more difficult takeover target. Under UK takeover rules, a target company can take defensive actions to resist a takeover, but its directors must continue to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The Panel will seek to determine whether Northern Electric's directors met this obligation.

A spokesperson for Northern Electric said the company "believes its actions were fair, lawful and consistent with maximizing value for all shareholders over the long term". However, investors appear to disagree - Northern Electric's share price has declined over 10% since the capital raising was announced.

The investigation is the latest chapter in what is shaping up to be a protracted takeover battle. PowerCo has not yet tabled a formal takeover offer but continues to express its interest in acquiring Northern Electric. Under UK rules, it must now announce a firm intention to make an offer within 28 days or walk away for at least six months. The outcome of the Panel's investigation could influence PowerCo's decision, as well as shareholder support for Northern Electric's defence tactics. The findings are expected within a fortnight in what remains an uncertain time for the UK utility sector.
