Tesco to Launch Joint Venture with Royal Bank of Scotland in Financial Services

UK retail giant Tesco announced today that it will be launching a joint venture  with the Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services to Tesco customers. The new joint venture, called Tesco Bank, will offer a range of banking and insurance products to Tesco customers starting in 2012. 

Tesco, the UK's largest retailer, has been expanding into new areas beyond its core food and grocery business. The company already offers mobile phone service, fuel, clothing, and other non-food items. By offering financial services like banking, loans, mortgages, and insurance, Tesco aims to become a "one-stop shop" for all household needs.

The Royal Bank of Scotland, still 73% owned by the UK government after a taxpayer bailout in 2008, will own 50% of the new Tesco Bank venture. Tesco will control the remaining 50% and will also provide space for Tesco Bank branches in many of its stores. "We are constantly looking for ways to enhance our offer to customers and make their lives as easy as possible,” said Ian Laws, Tesco’s head of financial services.

Consumer groups warn, however, that the huge market presence of Tesco could enable the retailer to dominate the financial services sector, just as it has done in the grocery industry. "This venture could accelerate the dominance of a few very large players, weakening choice and competition in retail banking," said Martin Coppack of Which?, a consumer watchdog group.

Tesco Bank will offer many of the same products and services as mainstream banks, including current accounts, credit cards, loans, and insurance. The new bank will operate under the banking license of the Royal Bank of Scotland but will run as an independent entity. Terms of the joint venture deal were not disclosed by either company, though analysts estimate Tesco may pay between £300 to £500 million for its stake in the new business.

The announcement of Tesco Bank confirms the trend of "supermarket banking" in the UK, as large retailers seek new ways to leverage their huge customer bases. Tesco's move into financial services will likely put further pressure on established banks to remain competitive on costs, products, and convenience. For consumers, Tesco Bank could shake up a banking sector that has been slow to innovate in the decade since the financial crisis. The new joint venture is set to launch its first products in autumn 2012 pending regulatory approval.
