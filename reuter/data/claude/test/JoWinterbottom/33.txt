Sears Plc Warns of Falling Profits and Disappointing Christmas Sales  

Sears Plc, the troubled British department store group, has issued a profit warning ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period and said full-year profits will be “significantly below” expectations.

The retailer blamed “unseasonably warm weather” in October and November, as well as “weaker consumer demand” for the poor performance. Like-for-like sales fell 4.5% in the 14 weeks to December 7 due to lower footfall in stores. Sales of gifts, toys, and clothing were particularly slow.

The profit warning comes at a difficult time for Sears, which has reported declining sales and profits for several years. The company has lost market share to fast-fashion rivals like H&M and Zara as well as the shift to online shopping. Sears’s shares fell over 12% in early trading on the news.

Sears said full-year pre-tax profits for 2019 would be “significantly below” the previous guidance of £50-60 million. Most analysts now expect profits of around £35 million, over 40% lower than last year. 

The poor trading performance raises further concerns over the viability of Sears’s turnaround plan. The company has been closing unprofitable stores, cutting costs and selling off assets to generate cash. However, the measures do not appear to have stemmed the company’s decline as sales continue to fall and footfall drops.

Sears’s CEO Jonathan West said: “The trading performance in the lead up to Christmas has been very disappointing. October and November were challenging, with unseasonably warm weather, weaker consumer demand, and a backdrop of ongoing economic uncertainty. These issues have combined to create a weak start to the peak trading season."

He added: “We have taken action to maintain tight control on costs and cash, while continuing to drive initiatives to strengthen and transform the business. However, our full-year profit expectations have reduced as a result of the third quarter trading performance."

Analysts expressed concerns that Sears may now struggle to hit financial targets agreed with its lenders. The company’s borrowings stand at over £300 million. One analyst said: “The persistently poor sales performance raises serious questions over whether Sears’s turnaround plan is really working. With a highly leveraged balance sheet, time is running out for Sears to show signs of progress or face restructuring.”

Sears said it would provide another trading update in mid-January. All eyes will be on whether trading improved and the all-important Christmas sales period managed to match last year’s figures. If not, Sears could face a battle for survival in 2020 as its financial troubles mount.
