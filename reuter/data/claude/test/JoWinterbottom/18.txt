CE Electric Wins Extension in Bid Battle for Northern Electric 

CE Electric, one of the nation's largest utilities, has been granted a two-week extension by Northern Electric's board to submit a final bid for the regional utility company. Northern Electric's board announced Monday that it has pushed back the deadline for final offers from interested bidders from March 15 to March 31.

The extension gives CE Electric more time to potentially raise its offer and secure financing for what could be one of the largest utility deals of the decade. CE Electric has been engaged in an intense bidding war with rival Midland Power over Northern Electric and its 3 million customers across six Midwestern states.

In early February, CE Electric submitted an initial bid of $48 billion to acquire Northern Electric. However, Midland Power quickly topped that with a $52 billion counteroffer. Northern Electric's board had initially set a mid-March deadline for best and final offers from the two utilities but has now provided more time for the potential deal making.

Shares of Northern Electric rose 3.2% on the news of the extended deadline. CE Electric's stock also climbed 2.1% as investors anticipated the company may now have an opportunity to come back with a stronger final offer.  

The acquisition of Northern Electric would significantly expand CE Electric's customer base and geographical reach. CE Electric currently serves over 10 million customers in 10 states, primarily in the West and Southwest. By absorbing Northern Electric's operations, CE Electric would gain access to a vast new territory and become the nation's largest utility company.

However, CE Electric faces major challenges in putting together a bid that would satisfy Northern Electric's board as well as its own investors and lenders. CE Electric has considerable debt from previous acquisitions, and taking on billions more in new loans or issuing new shares could damage its credit rating and equity value. There are also potential regulatory hurdles regarding utility monopolies that CE Electric would have to address.
