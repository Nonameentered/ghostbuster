Tesco Launches New "Unbeatable Value" Campaign with Lowest Prices and Refunds for Customers Found Cheaper Elsewhere

UK supermarket giant Tesco today unveiled a new pricing campaign called "Unbeatable Value" promising the lowest prices on hundreds of staple products and refunds for customers who find the same products cheaper at rival stores. The retailer hopes the bold move will help win back budget-conscious shoppers who have defected to low-cost competitors like Aldi and Lidl in recent years. 

Under the Unbeatable Value program, Tesco is dropping prices by an average of 15% on over 400 of its most popular own-brand products including basics such as bread, milk, eggs, rice, pasta, fruit and vegetables. The price cuts go into effect immediately in all Tesco stores and will be held for at least the next six months, the company said.

As part of the campaign, Tesco is also launching a "Price Promise" to refund customers the difference, plus an extra 10% of the bill, if they discover the same basket of own-brand products is cheaper at Asda, Sainsbury's or Morrisons. The deal applies to in-store and online prices and requires customers to provide valid receipts within two weeks of their Tesco shop.

"We are reaffirming our commitment to offering customers the very best value on their weekly shop," said Tesco UK CEO Jason Tarry. "The Unbeatable Value campaign has some of the lowest prices we've offered in years and our Price Promise shows we mean business. We know every penny counts for our customers right now."

The new initiative comes as Tesco tries to reverse years of declining market share and stagnant sales. The grocer has struggled amid a prolonged price war in the UK supermarket sector as well as competition from the no-frills chains Aldi and Lidl, whose low-cost models have reshaped British grocery retailing. 

Tesco's latest price cuts appear aimed squarely at countering the perception that it has become uncompetitive on price and winning back cost-conscious consumers who have switched to cheaper rivals. Industry analysts said the Unbeatable Value program was Tesco's most ambitious pricing action in recent memory and could put pressure on competitors to follow suit. But they also warned that an extended price war could dent margins across the sector.

Shares in Tesco were up slightly in trading on the news as investors awaited further details on the potential impact of the new pricing initiative. The grocer is set to release interim results for the first half of its financial year in early October.
