Northern Electric Releases Half-Year Results and Forecasts in Response to Undervaluation Claim by CE Electric's Bid 

Northern Electric, the regional electric utility provider, today released its financial results for the first half of the year and updated forecasts for the full year. The results and forecasts aim to demonstrate that CE Electric's recent takeover bid significantly undervalues Northern Electric.

In the first six months of the year, Northern Electric's revenue was up 4.2% to $1.23 billion and net profit rose 2.9% to $124 million. The company cited increased electricity usage due to an extended period of hot weather as the primary driver of the improved results. Looking ahead, Northern Electric expects full-year revenue growth of 3-4% and net profit growth of 2-3% based on forecast weather conditions and steady economic activity in its service region.

The positive half-year results and full-year guidance stand in contrast with CE Electric's takeover bid last month that valued Northern Electric at only a 2-3% premium to its share price at the time. The bid implied a price-to-earnings multiple of only 13 times Northern Electric's forecast full-year net profit, which is below the average of 15 times for comparable electric utilities.

In a statement, Northern Electric CEO Jane Wilson said, "Our half-year results and full-year forecasts demonstrate that CE Electric's bid significantly undervalues Northern Electric based on our intrinsic value and future growth potential. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering steady growth and returns for our shareholders as an independent company." Northern Electric's board of directors unanimously rejected CE Electric's bid within a week of its announcement, citing its inadequate valuation of the company.

CE Electric defended its takeover bid in a statement released alongside Northern Electric's results. "Even based on Northern Electric's forecasts, which rely on favourable weather conditions to achieve, our offer represents a fair value for the company that provides an attractive premium for shareholders," said CE Electric CEO Michael Thompson. "As adjacent electric providers, there are significant synergies to be gained from combining our companies that would benefit both shareholders and customers."   

Shares in Northern Electric were up 3.2% in midday trading following the release of its half-year results. The share price remains slightly below the level of CE Electric's takeover bid, indicating uncertainly in the market over whether CE Electric will return with a revised, higher offer or abandon its pursuit of Northern Electric. The coming months may prove pivotal in determining the future of the potential deal and the independence of Northern Electric.
