Yorkshire Electricity Sees Half-Year Profits Hit by Pricing Review, but Increases Dividend by 33% as Planned

 Yorkshire Electricity PLC reported today that its pre-tax profits declined by 12% in the first half of the year due to a regulatory price cut imposed by the energy regulator Ofgem. However, the utility company increased its interim dividend by 33% as previously announced, demonstrating confidence in its full-year outlook.

For the six months ending June 30, Yorkshire Electricity posted pre-tax profits of £127 million, down from £145 million in the same period last year. The decline was attributed to a price reduction of 2.6% implemented by Ofgem in April, which sets maximum tariffs the company can charge to residential and business customers. Revenue fell 3% to £1.4 billion due to the price cut.

 Despite the profit decline, Yorkshire Electricity raised its interim dividend by 33% to 5.8 pence per share. The company said it is on track to meet its full-year guidance and financial goals. “We remain committed to providing attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, underpinned by high-quality regulated earnings and a strong balance sheet,” said CEO Amanda Whitmore in the earnings statement.

Ofgem, the UK’s independent energy regulator, lowered the maximum prices Yorkshire Electricity and other utilities can charge after finding their profit margins were too high. The price cut aimed to lower energy bills for over 10 million households. However, Yorkshire Electricity warned at the time that the forced price reduction could negatively impact its investment in renewable energy projects and reliability improvement programs. 

 Environmental groups have urged Ofgem to take further actions to incentivize utilities like Yorkshire Electricity to support the UK’s goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In its earnings report today, Yorkshire Electricity said it “remains committed to supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy through investment in renewable generation, as well as initiatives to support customers in using energy more sustainably.”

The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for mid-single-digit percentage growth in dividend and a capital investment program of over £1 billion focused on grid resilience and renewable generation. Shares of Yorkshire Electricity were trading up slightly in morning trading following the results. The stock has gained 18% over the past year.
