Northern Electric Promises Higher Dividends and Unit Mergers to Fight CalEnergy Takeover Bid 

Northern Electric, the nation's third-largest utility provider, announced new initiatives today aimed at thwarting CalEnergy's $48 billion takeover bid. In an effort to win shareholder support, Northern Electric pledged to raise dividends by 25% over each of the next 3 years. The company also unveiled plans to consolidate six of its regional utility subsidiaries into two larger business units, a move expected to yield $2 billion in cost savings that will be passed onto consumers and shareholders.

"Our board of directors believes the CalEnergy offer substantially undervalues Northern Electric and is not in the best interests of our shareholders and customers," said CEO Jane Wilson in a statement. "We have a proven track record of providing affordable, reliable power and strong returns, and the initiatives we announced today will allow us to build on that record for years to come."
 
CalEnergy launched its unsolicited offer for Northern Electric last month, looking to combine two of the nation's largest power producers. However, Northern Electric rejected the $72 per share bid as too low, arguing it would not appropriately compensate shareholders for the company's growth prospects and generation capacity. The offer represented a 20% premium over Northern Electric's share price at the time.

In an investor presentation, Northern Electric said consolidating its Midwest Utility, Atlantic Utility and Pacific Utility into single business units would streamline operations and eliminate redundant roles. The job cuts are expected to save $1.5 billion per year, while investing $500 million to upgrade infrastructure and customer systems is projected to yield another $500 million in annual savings. The company said the higher dividends and cost reductions would boost earnings by over 10% next year.

"Northern Electric has significant untapped potential, and this plan highlights why our stand-alone strategy is far superior to CalEnergy's lowball offer," Wilson said. "Our approach leverages existing competitive advantages to fuel sustainable growth and profitability." The company did not rule out reviewing other credible takeover bids in the future.

CalEnergy called Northern Electric's announcement a "predictable tactic to rally shareholders" and vowed to proceed with its offer. But some industry analysts said the new strategic vision helps Northern Electric's case. "This shows Northern Electric has a viable path forward as an independent company," said David Wu, an analyst at Clear Currents Research. "It could force CalEnergy to up its bid or walk away if shareholders have confidence in the new direction."

Northern Electric's shares rose over 3 percent on the news, closing at $68.42 today. The company's market value now stands at $52 billion based on 770 million shares outstanding.
