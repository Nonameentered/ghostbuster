Northern Electric defends against US bid with promises of higher dividends and unit mergers 

Northern Electric, the largest utility company in Canada, announced measures today to defend against an unsolicited takeover bid from US rival Midwest Power. Northern Electric said it would increase its dividend payout ratio to 80-85% of earnings over the next few years, up from its current level of 65%, and would accelerate plans to merge some of its subsidiaries to cut costs.

The moves are aimed at convincing shareholders to reject Midwest Power's $48 billion all-cash offer for Northern Electric, announced last week. Northern Electric's board has rejected the Midwest Power bid, saying it significantly undervalues the company. However, some large institutional shareholders have said the bid, which represents a 30% premium to Northern Electric's share price before the offer, is appealing. 

"Our new dividend policy and restructuring program demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder value over the long run as an independent company," said Christine Martin, CEO of Northern Electric. "We have a proven track record of performance and see strong growth ahead, especially as we make further investments in renewable energy."

Northern Electric has a market capitalization of $37 billion and more than 5 million customers across 10 provinces. The company has raised its dividend each year for over two decades but still has a lower payout ratio than the broader utility sector, leaving room for further increases. Accelerating subsidiary mergers is also expected to drive $200-300 million in annual cost savings within two to three years.

However, some analysts are skeptical the moves will be enough to persuade all shareholders to reject the Midwest Power offer. "The dividend and restructuring plans are positive, but the takeover premium still represents compelling value, especially in the current low-yield environment," said Jessica Thompson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "There is a good chance Midwest Power comes back with a higher offer, which may be hard for Northern Electric to ignore."

Midwest Power, which has a market value of $72 billion, said it sees "significant opportunity for operational synergies and cross-border expansion" in combining with Northern Electric. However, its bid faces regulatory uncertainty, including a review by the Canadian government. If successful, the takeover would be the largest acquisition of a Canadian company by a US firm in over a decade.

Northern Electric shares rose 3.2% on the day, while Midwest Power's shares declined 1.1%. The shares of both companies remain well below the implied offer price for Northern Electric, indicating investor doubt that a deal will be completed, at least at the current bid level. Northern Electric appears to have won the first battle, but the war for control of the coveted utility is just beginning.
