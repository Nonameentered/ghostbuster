Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc reports lower profits but increases dividends and plans for expansion  

The largest energy supplier in Scotland, Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc (SHEP), announced its full-year financial results today. While net profit was down 8% from the previous year due to higher operating costs, the company increased its dividend payout to shareholders for the third consecutive year and outlined an ambitious plan for network upgrades and renewable energy expansion over the next decade.

SHEP made a net profit of £457 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, down from £498 million the previous year. Although revenue rose 4% to £3.8 billion, operating expenses climbed 7% due to a colder than average winter and higher costs for wages, infrastructure maintenance, and insurance. The impact on profit came despite an annual price increase for residential customers of 3.2% for electricity and 4.7% for gas.

Despite the drop in profit, SHEP raised its total dividend by 2.5% to 64 pence per share. The company has increased its dividend every year for over two decades, demonstrating its stable cash flow and commitment to shareholder returns in good times and bad. CEO Alastair Phillips expressed confidence that profitability would recover in the coming years as efficiency initiatives take hold and interest rates remain low.

Looking ahead, SHEP announced plans to invest £1.7 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade infrastructure, install smart meters in homes, and boost renewable energy capacity. The company aims to source over half of its generation from wind, hydro, and solar power by 2025, up from around 42% currently. SHEP also plans to install 100,000 smart meters in 2020 and reach nearly all homes by 2022 to enable remote meter readings and help customers better monitor their energy usage. 

In a statement, Phillips said "Our investments in renewable energy, smarter networks, and improved customer service will ensure a sustainable energy system for Scotland's future." The spending program is expected to support hundreds of new jobs in construction and engineering. SHEP sees its role as critical in helping Scotland achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2045.

Reaction from investors and analysts was positive given the company's dividend commitment and long-term vision. Shares in SHEP closed up 1.2% on the news and continue to offer a dividend yield of 5.2%, among the highest in the industry. With its plans for sustainable growth aligning with Scotland's environmental and economic priorities, Scottish Hydro-Electric appears to be in an excellent position to power national progress for years to come. Overall, despite the fall in profit this year, the outlook remains bright for this popular Scottish institution.
