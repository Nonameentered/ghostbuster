British Utility Northern Electric Fights to Remain Independent With Appeal Against Takeover Bid Extension

Northern Electric, one of Britain's largest utility companies, filed an appeal today seeking to block an extension of a takeover bid by European energy giant Energia SA. Northern Electric claims the six-month extension granted to Energia by British regulators last week is unfair and threatens the company's independence.

Northern Electric has been the subject of an ongoing $12 billion takeover attempt by Energia over the last year. The bid was set to expire this week, but Energia requested and was granted an additional six months by the UK Energy Regulator to finalize the deal. In its appeal, Northern Electric argues the extension goes against regulations limiting the duration of takeover bids to one year and that an additional six months could "unduly influence" its shareholders into accepting an offer that undervalues the company.

The appeal is the latest twist in an already complicated saga between Energia and Northern Electric. Northern Electric initially rejected Energia's takeover bid last year, claiming it undervalued the strength and assets of the company which serves over 5 million customers across Northern England and Scotland. However, Energia's offer has the backing of over 30% of Northern Electric's shareholders, putting pressure on executives to accept a deal. The additional time granted to Energia means its offer will remain open into next year's proxy season, giving Energia more opportunity to rally shareholder support.  

Northern Electric's appeal to block the time extension argues this unfairly advantages Energia's takeover attempt. In its filing, Northern Electric said either the current takeover bid should expire as originally planned this week or Energia should be forced to submit an entirely new takeover offer with revised terms, re-starting the entire year-long process. Northern Electric asserts its shareholders should not be subjected to a "drawn out, uncertain process that only benefits Energia."

The appeal by Northern Electric intensifies an already dramatic power struggle for control of one of Britain's critical infrastructure companies. The UK Energy Regulator will review Northern Electric's appeal over the coming weeks, likely setting up yet another showdown between the rival companies. The outcome will have significant implications for the future of energy supply and ownership within the UK.
