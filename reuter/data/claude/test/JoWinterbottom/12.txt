London Electricity Reports Dip in Half-Year Profits but Increases Dividend 

London Electricity PLC reported a 4% drop in profits for the first half of the financial year today but announced an increase in dividends for shareholders. The utility company said pre-tax profits fell to £875 million from £914 million a year earlier, due to higher costs and a mild winter. However, the company raised its interim dividend by 3% to 18 pence per share.

The decline in profits was largely driven by a 15% increase in operating costs as London Electricity upgraded infrastructure and improved customer service. Revenue also took a hit from warmer weather, decreasing 2% to £4.2 billion. The weather was the warmest on record for the winter months, reducing demand for heating and electricity. 

"While the mild winter impacted our revenue and profits, we remain on track to deliver on our key strategic priorities for the year," said London Electricity CEO Mark Thompson. "Our investments in improved reliability and customer service are paying off, with customer satisfaction scores rising for the sixth year running."

The company remains committed to its £5 billion capital investment program over the next five years which includes upgrading power lines, modernizing systems, and improving sustainability. London Electricity continues to make steady progress toward renewable energy, with wind, solar and hydroelectric power now making up 25% of its generation capacity.

Despite the profit decline, London Electricity raised its dividend, pointing to its strong balance sheet and cash flow. The company's net debt fell 8% from a year earlier to £21.3 billion, keeping its debt-to-equity ratio at a manageable 65%. Moody's and S&P reaffirmed the company's A- credit rating in June, citing its stable financial position and market dominance.

While near-term headwinds are expected to continue into the second half, analysts remain optimistic about London Electricity's long-term prospects. "The company has strong fundamentals and continues to invest in its future," said Ben Hawkins, an energy analyst at HSBC Securities. "Once cost pressures ease and weather normalizes, profits and revenue should return to steady growth.”
