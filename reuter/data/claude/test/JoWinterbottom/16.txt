Entergy Agrees to $2.11 Billion Takeover of London Electricity 

Entergy Corp, a major U.S. power company, announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire London Electricity Plc for $2.11 billion in cash. The deal would make Entergy the largest electricity distributor in the U.K. serving over 3 million customers in London and surrounding areas.

Under the terms of the agreement, Entergy would pay 550 pence per share for London Electricity, a 15% premium over yesterday's closing price. The deal requires approval from shareholders and regulatory authorities but the companies said they expect the takeover to be completed by the end of the year.

"This acquisition represents a great opportunity for Entergy to expand into new markets and gain valuable expertise serving large cities with complex infrastructure needs," said Entergy CEO Leo Denault. London Electricity operates an extensive power grid across greater London that provides electricity to homes and businesses.  

For London Electricity, the deal provides an exit for shareholders at an attractive valuation. The company's stock price has languished in recent years due to uncertainty around Britain's pending withdrawal from the European Union and weak overall market conditions. Some analysts saw the company as a takeover target given its stable cash flows and infrastructure assets.

The deal will propel Entergy into the ranks of the largest public utility companies in the Western world with operations across the Central U.S. as well as London. However, the purchase also comes with significant risks as Entergy will have to navigate the U.K.'s regulatory environment and uncertainties surrounding Brexit. There is also no guarantee that Entergy will be able to achieve meaningful cost savings by combining the two companies.

Some critics argue that Entergy would be better served focusing on its existing service areas rather than buying a utility an ocean away. However, others say expanding globally will give Entergy more opportunities for growth and diversification. London Electricity shareholders are likely to support the deal given the premium being offered. The takeover is subject to final approval and when completed would mark one of the largest European utility deals in over a decade. For London residents, it means their power grid will be owned and operated from New Orleans rather than London.
