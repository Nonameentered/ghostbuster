Macquarie Bank Posts Stronger-Than-Expected Annual Profit, Boosts Annual Dividend

Macquarie Bank, Australia's top investment bank, announced stronger-than-expected profits for its most recent fiscal year ending March 31, buoyed by higher trading activity and asset sales. The bank reported this morning in its 2020 annual results that net profit rose 12% to A$2.73 billion in the year to March. That exceeded analysts' consensus forecast of A$2.69 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The stronger result will allow Macquarie to increase its final dividend to shareholders by 40%. The bank declared a final dividend of A$2.68 per share, up from A$1.91 last year. The improved profits were driven by Macquarie Capital, the division that advises on mergers and acquisitions and helps companies raise funds. Net profit contribution from Macquarie Capital surged 18% to A$1.24 billion.  

“Macquarie has delivered a solid result for the 2020 fiscal year, with strong performances from Macquarie Capital and Commodities & Global Markets,” said Macquarie’s Managing Director and CEO, Shemara Wikramanayake. Revenue from the commodities and markets division, home to Macquarie's trading activities, rose 20% to A$4.03 billion. The division benefited from higher client activity in foreign exchange, interest rates, and energy markets during periods of increased market volatility.

While profits rose overall, Macquarie’s annuity-style businesses reported weaker results. The bank’s asset management division saw net profit contribution fall 6% due to lower performance fees. Net profit from MacBank, Macquarie's retail banking and financial services division, fell 11% as margins remain under pressure in a low interest rate environment. 

The stronger performance coincides with a period of leadership transition at Macquarie. Ms. Wikramanayake took over as CEO in December, replacing Nicholas Moore. Mr. Moore had led the bank for over a decade. Macquarie's annual results highlight the strength and diversity of its franchise, which spans asset management, retail banking, commodities trading, and investment banking.
