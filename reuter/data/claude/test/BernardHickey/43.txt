Macquarie Bank beats earnings expectations with 25.4% profit jump  

Macquarie Bank reported a 25.4% increase in net profit after tax to $2.05 billion for the financial year ending March 31, 2021. The result beat market expectations and was driven by a strong performance across all operating groups.  

Macquarie Bank is an Australian multinational investment bank and financial services company. In a year marked by significant market volatility and global economic disruption due to COVID-19, Macquarie benefitted from increased market activity and demand for its wholesale financial services.  

Announcing the results, Macquarie Bank CEO Shemara Wikramanayake said “Macquarie has delivered a strong result for the 2021 financial year, demonstrating the resilience of our diversified business. All groups were profitable and grew year-on-year.”

The largest increases came from Macquarie’s Commodities and Global Markets group, with a 45% jump in net profit contribution to $1.17 billion. This was primarily driven by increased client activity in foreign exchange, interest rates and energy markets. Macquarie’s asset management arm also posted a 19% rise in profits to $662 million, benefitting from increased performance and other fees due to a lift in assets under management.

Macquarie’s annuity-style businesses include a top-10 global asset manager and Australia’s largest retail stockbroker. These divisions provide diversified income streams which supported the bank during tougher operating conditions seen in other parts of the market.

The results confirm Macquarie’s position as one of Australia’s most profitable companies. However, analysts have warned that Macquarie’s buoyant 2021 results may be hard to repeat next year. Macquarie shares trade at a price-to-earnings premium compared with the major Australian banks, indicating high expectations for the firm to maintain its strong performance.

Continued global economic recovery will depend on the effectiveness of vaccination programs rolling out worldwide. Shemara Wikramanayake noted international border closures continue to significantly impact some Macquarie customers and staff. However, she said Macquarie is a beneficiary of long-term trends like the increasing demand for infrastructure and the transition to renewable energy.  

Overall, Macquarie Bank appears well positioned to continue benefiting from opportunities arising from market volatility and changing global conditions. But with its high growth trajectory and share price, the company has little room for disappointment in the future.
