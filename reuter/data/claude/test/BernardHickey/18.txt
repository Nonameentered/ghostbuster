Fisher and Paykel CEO confirms lower profit forecasted by analysts 

Fisher and Paykel Appliances lowered its profit guidance for the 2019 fiscal year in an announcement today, confirming analyst forecasts of slower growth. The New Zealand-based appliance maker said it now expects net profit after tax in the range of NZ$260 million to NZ$270 million for the year ending March 31, 2019. This is down from its previous guidance of NZ$265 million to NZ$280 million.  

The revised outlook comes after Fisher and Paykel reported a 4 percent drop in revenue from its core appliances division in the first half of the fiscal year. “Sales were softer than expected in a number of markets, including Australia, China, and parts of Europe,” said Stuart Baldwin, chief executive officer of Fisher and Paykel. “Macroeconomic headwinds and increased competition have made the operating environment more challenging.”

Fisher and Paykel faces intense competition from low-cost rivals in its major markets and has recently lost market share in Australia and New Zealand according to analysts. The company is also contending with a slowdown in the Australian and Chinese housing markets, which are major drivers of demand for household appliances.  

Despite the top-line pressures, Fisher and Paykel managed to boost first-half profit by cutting costs. But continued cost cuts may be difficult to achieve without impacting new product development, warned Baldwin. “While we will maintain strict cost control, we need to invest in innovation to stay ahead of competitors,” he said. 

New product releases are a key part of Fisher and Paykel’s strategy to revive sales growth. The company recently launched new ranges of dishwashers, washing machines, and cooking products featuring its proprietary smart drive motor and adaptive engineering technology. These premium products aim to attract design and technology-conscious consumers in markets like Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America.

The profit warning has prompted some analysts to downgrade their earnings forecasts for Fisher and Paykel and cut their share price targets. But others remain confident that the company’s product pipeline and long-term growth fundamentals are still intact. “We view the earnings revision as temporary in nature,” said John Aaron, an analyst at Jarden International. “Fisher and Paykel continues to lead in product innovation and has opportunities to expand in higher-margin markets.”

The revised guidance and analyst commentary underscore the challenges Fisher and Paykel faces balancing short-term headwinds with ongoing investments needed to strengthen its competitive position over the long run. With its new product ranges just hitting stores, the company is betting that continued innovation will eventually help reverse slowing sales and plateauing profits.
