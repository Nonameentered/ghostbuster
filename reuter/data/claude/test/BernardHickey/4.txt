Commonwealth Bank of Australia reports strong first half profits, boosted by surge in business lending 

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has reported a solid increase in first half cash profit, boosted by strong growth in business lending.

For the six months to December 31, the nation's biggest lender said statutory net profit rose 6.4 per cent to $4.85 billion. Cash net profit, which excludes one-offs and non-cash accounting items, climbed 7.7 per cent to $5.29 billion, slightly ahead of market expectations.

The result was underpinned by robust growth in business lending, with business loan volumes up 12 per cent compared with a year ago. Home loan volumes also expanded by 4 per cent.

CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said the bank had benefited from its No. 1 market position in business lending during a period when business credit growth in Australia had accelerated.

“We are seeing more customers choose to support their business opportunities and growth prospects, and we are well positioned to continue to assist them,” Mr Comyn said.

The bank's net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, remained steady at 2.12 per cent. Fee income rose 6 per cent, reflecting volume growth in home loans and deposit accounts as well as increased customer activity.

However, the bank's expenses climbed 5 per cent during the half, largely due to investment in compliance, risk and cyber security capabilities. The bank has spent more than $1 billion on risk and compliance programs since 2018 as part of an enforceable undertaking required by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.

Mr Comyn said the bank continued to strengthen risk management, invest in data and analytics capabilities and simplify its operations. But he warned economic conditions remained challenging, with historically low interest rates putting pressure on margins, subdued consumer confidence and a softer housing market.

The board declared a fully franked interim dividend of $2 per share, unchanged from a year ago.

Shares in the CBA edged up 0.4 per cent to $83.94, slightly outperforming the broader market.
