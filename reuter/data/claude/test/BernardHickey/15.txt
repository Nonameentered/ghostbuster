Coles Myer Ltd Expected to Report First Profit Rise in Almost Two Years Thanks to Improved Margins and Sales Growth

Coles Myer Ltd, Australia's second-largest retailer, is expected to report its first rise in annual profit in almost two years on Thursday thanks to improved profit margins and sales growth.

According to a survey of 12 analysts polled by Reuters, Coles Myer is forecast to report net profit for the year ended June 30 of between A$715 million and A$765 million. This compares to a net loss of A$2.5 billion in fiscal 2017 after the company wrote down the value of its Kmart and Target brands.

Excluding one-off items, Coles Myer's underlying profit is seen up between 3.2 percent and 8.5 percent at between A$920 million to A$970 million, the first rise since 2016. Analysts pointed to a recovery in profit margins, cost cuts and a pick-up in sales growth as drivers of the improved performance.

"The turnaround strategies implemented over the last few years are starting to gain traction through cost reduction and wastage control," said Haris Anwar, analyst at Investec Securities. 

In April, Coles Myer said sales at its flagship Coles supermarkets rose 5 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in nearly three years. It also said sales grew at Kmart and its liquor group.

Coles is expected to benefit from its 'Everyday low prices' strategy aimed at lowering prices to better compete with rival Woolworths Group Ltd. The strategy appears to be resonating with consumers seeking value.

"Customers are responding well to lower prices, which should support sales and market share gains over competitors," said Grant Saligari, analyst at Credit Suisse.

However, Coles still faces challenges, including a home improvement sector struggling with a downturn in housing. Competition in the grocery sector also remains intense.

"While supermarket comparable sales growth is improving, it remains below Woolworths. And retail conditions generally remain very weak given low wages growth," said UBS analyst Ben Gilbert.

Shares in Coles have risen about 14 percent since the start of 2017 but still remain well below 2015 levels. Investors will look to the company's outlook commentary to determine whether the worst is behind for Australia's retail industry.
