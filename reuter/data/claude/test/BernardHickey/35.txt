Australian Government Orders Canadian TV Group to Reduce Stake in Local Television Network 

The Australian government has ordered Canada's Rogers Communications to reduce its ownership stake in Australian television network Channel Nine. The move comes amid concerns by Australian regulators that too much foreign ownership of local media companies could reduce diversity of opinions and control over content.

Rogers currently owns a 65% stake in Channel Nine, Australia's highest-rated commercial television network. The Australian government's Foreign Investment Review Board said Rogers must cut its ownership to below 50% to comply with media ownership laws. The board said having a majority foreign owner of such a major Australian media company "is contrary to the national interest."

Channel Nine operates several popular television channels that produce local news, sports, reality, and entertainment programs. With 65% ownership, Rogers has operational control over Channel Nine and influence over its programming and strategic direction. The board argued this level of control by a foreign entity posed risks to media diversity and independence in Australia.  

In a statement, Rogers said it was "disappointed" by the government's decision but would comply with the ruling. The company acquired its stake in Channel Nine in 2007 but has maintained an arm's length relationship with the Australian broadcaster. Rogers said Channel Nine's management team would continue to oversee day-to-day operations and make decisions on Australian programming. However, reducing Rogers' stake will limit the Canadian company's financial control and oversight.

The ruling underscores the level of scrutiny Australian regulators are placing on foreign investment in the country's media sector. Last year, the review board also ordered reductions in stakes held by U.S.-based hedge funds in two other major Australian newspaper groups on similar public interest grounds. The government is currently conducting a review of media ownership laws with aims to further tighten rules on foreign influence.  

Supporters argue stricter limits on foreign ownership will boost public trust in Australian media. Critics counter that such restrictions are unnecessary interventions that discourage foreign investment and limit opportunities for media companies to access new capital. Australian media organizations continue to face financial difficulties as advertising revenue has declined sharply in recent years.

The board has given Rogers six months to sell off at least 15% of its stake in Channel Nine to achieve the mandated ownership limits. Both companies said they are currently exploring options to divest shares to a range of Australian investors, potentially including Channel Nine's key shareholders and shareholders. The sale process is aimed to be completed by early next year.
