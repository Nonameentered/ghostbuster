Brambles Industries on track to meet market expectations with A$240 million net profit 

Brambles Industries, the global supply chain logistics company, reported its half-year results today showing an underlying profit of A$240 million, keeping the company on track to meet market expectations for the full year.

The results for the six months ending December 31, 2020, represent a 4% increase on the previous corresponding period. Revenue was up 3% to A$3.6 billion, reflecting continued growth in Bramblesâ€™ core pallet and container pooling businesses.

Brambles CEO Graham Chipchase said the results are a solid outcome given the ongoing challenges of COVID-19. "Our diversified and resilient business model has supported customers through this difficult period, and we are now well positioned for renewed growth as economies recover," he said. 

The company experienced improving momentum through the second quarter of FY21, with sales activity and new business wins recovering in all regions. Its North America and emerging markets segments were bright spots, with pallet volumes up 8% and 7% respectively compared to the prior year.

Mr. Chipchase said new customer wins worth over US$130 million per annum gave Brambles confidence in delivering sustainable growth over the medium term. The company also achieved US$25 million of cost savings in the half, part of its operational excellence program targeting US$75 million in annualized savings by 2022.

Based on its performance for the first half, Brambles reaffirmed its FY21 guidance for sales revenue growth between 2-4%, and 3-5% growth in underlying profit, barring further deterioration of the COVID-19 crisis or global economic conditions. 

Mr. Chipchase said, "We are optimistic about the improved momentum in our business and believe global supply chains will continue to recover and grow over the coming year." However, he warned that "uncertainties in economies across the world remain, and we continue to monitor ongoing risks, including changing restrictions and the rollout of vaccine programs."

Brambles shares rose 2.3% in early trading, to $10.35, buoyed by the solid result and confirmation of guidance for continued year-on-year growth. The half-year dividend of 13.5 Australian cents per share was also reaffirmed, payable on April 8.
