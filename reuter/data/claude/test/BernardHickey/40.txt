Westpac Banking Corp Reports Surprisingly Strong Profit Result Driven by Rise in Non-Interest Income  

Westpac Banking Corporation, one of Australia's big four banks, reported a stronger than expected 10% increase in its first half of the year cash earnings. The result was driven by a robust increase in non-interest income which offset weakness in net interest margins.  

Cash earnings rose to $3.6 billion in the six months to March 31, beating market expectations of a flat result. Net profit climbed 12% to $3.5 billion. Westpac lifted its dividend for the period by 2 cents to $0.94 per share. 

Westpac's solid increase in non-interest revenue reflected strong growth in wealth management, treasury and markets, and transactional banking. Non-interest income climbed 9% to $1.77 billion, driven by double-digit percentage gains in platform administration fees, foreign exchange income and merchant acquiring fees.

In contrast, net interest income increased by just 1% as the bank's net interest margin declined due to higher funding costs and competitive pressures impacting lending margins. Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, fell 6 basis points to 2.11%, below guidance of a 5 to 8 basis point drop.

Westpac Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said the bank had delivered a "solid result in a competitive environment." Mr. Hartzer said the bank was "well positioned to continue supporting customers and sustainable long term growth. We remain focused on productivity, service, and risk management."

The improved earnings will ease pressure on Mr. Hartzer, who has faced criticism from investors worried Westpac has lost ground to rivals Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank. However, the bank's shares fell slightly on the results as the market had already priced in a strong outcome.

Consumer banking and wealth contributed $1.79 billion, more than half of the group's earnings. Business banking lifted earnings 7% while wealth management surged 16% higher. Institutional banking slipped 6% lower with markets and treasury up 25% though financial markets subdued.

The bank announced an on-market buyback of up to $1.5 billion worth of shares. It will start from May 7 and end no later than February 7, 2020.

Chief Financial Officer Peter King said the bank had a "disciplined approach to cost growth" and was "continuing to invest in strategic priorities to support long term growth." Expenses increased 4% with the bank signalling extra investment in risk compliance and technology projects.

The results highlight the strength of Australia's major banks which have posted healthy profits in recent reporting periods, despite fears of a housing market downturn, sluggish credit growth and greater regulatory burdens. Westpac's solid outcome will build optimism for continued earnings growth across the sector.
