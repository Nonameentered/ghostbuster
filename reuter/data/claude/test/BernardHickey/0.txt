News Corp Ltd Confirms 20% Profit Growth Despite Below-Expectations Half-Year Results

News Corp Ltd today announced its results for the half year ended December 31, 2018. The global media company reported profit growth of 20% to $345 million, despite revenue falling 2% to $5.2 billion, which missed analyst expectations.

News Corp CEO Robert Thomson cited cost savings and operating efficiencies as drivers of the profit increase. “While macroeconomic and political factors in multiple regions led to a revenue miss versus expectations, disciplined expense control more than offset this slippage,” Mr. Thomson said.

Revenue declines were primarily recorded in the company’s News and Information Services segment, which includes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post newspapers. Revenue fell 7% in this segment due to weakness in advertising, though the company partly offset declines through price increases and digital subscriber growth. The company now has over 3 million digital-only subscribers across its properties.  

Revenue in News Corp’s Subscription Video Services segment, including Foxtel and Kayo Sports, declined 1%. The Book Publishing segment achieved modest 2% revenue growth thanks to continued strength in downloadable audiobook sales. 

News Corp provides news and information services, subscription video services in Australia, and book publishing services worldwide. The company owns and operates a portfolio of leading media properties, including The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, The Times of London, and HarperCollins book publisher.   

Looking ahead, Mr Thomson commented: “We see attractive opportunities for News Corp to expand the reach of our journalism, and capitalize on trends in paid content and storytelling in video. Our balance sheet is robust, and the Company is well-positioned to pursue strategic acquisitions to complement our existing businesses.”

The half-year results were below analysts’ average forecasts of $5.4 billion in revenue and $375 million in net profit. News Corp shares fell 4% in after-hours trading following the results announcement.
