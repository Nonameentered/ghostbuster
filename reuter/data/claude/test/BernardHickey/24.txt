Wallis Inquiry Report on Australia's Financial System to be Released by Federal Government This Week

The long-anticipated final report of the Wallis Inquiry into Australia's financial system will be publicly released by the Federal Government on Thursday. The report is expected to recommend sweeping reforms to Australia's banking, insurance and superannuation sectors.  

The inquiry was announced by the Treasurer last year in response to increasing concerns about the concentration of market power among the big four banks and a lack of competition in retail banking. The chairman of the inquiry, Stan Wallis, is expected to recommend significant changes to open up the sector to new competitors and give consumers more choice.

According to sources close to the inquiry, the report will call for the major banks to be required to open up access to their payments systems and customer data to competitors. This 'open banking' approach has been implemented in the UK and Europe and has led to a wave of new digital challenger banks entering the market. The move is likely to face resistance from the major banks who see their control over payments infrastructure as a source of competitive advantage.

The report is also rumored to recommend stronger penalties for misconduct by financial institutions, a revamp of deposit guarantees to cover more consumers in the event of a bank collapse, and changes to mortgage broking commissions and insurance remuneration models to reduce conflicts of interest. The government is expected to support the thrust of the recommendations but the big four banks can be expected to launch fierce lobbying campaigns against the most radical proposals.

Treasurer Chris Bowen said the government established the inquiry to 'look at how the financial system could be structured to best support the future growth and innovation opportunities in our economy.' 'We recognize the need to support competition and ensure the system operates with the best interests of consumers and small businesses in mind,' said Bowen.

The release of the Wallis report on Thursday will set the agenda for a debate about much-needed reforms to Australia's financial sector. But the real test will be whether the government and regulators have the appetite to take on the powerful banking lobby and drive genuine transformation of the system. The impact of the recommendations, if adopted, could be felt for decades to come.
