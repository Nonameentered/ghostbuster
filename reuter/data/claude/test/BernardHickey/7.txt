Seven Network Ltd Expected to Report Higher Annual Net Profit Despite Second Half Slowdown

 Seven Network Ltd, one of Australia's leading media companies, is expected to report higher full-year net profit when it releases its results later this week, despite a slowdown in advertising revenue in the second half of the financial year.  

According to market consensus, Seven West Media is forecast to report net profit after tax of $260 million for the 12 months ended June 30, up 4.8% from $248 million a year earlier. Revenue is projected to rise 2.4% to $2.12 billion, helped by the Cricket World Cup and tennis broadcast rights.  

The company is benefiting from cost savings across its operations after embarking on a major restructuring program a few years ago under CEO James Warburton. However, its core free-to-air TV advertising revenue is coming under pressure in the face of competition from streaming services like Netflix and Stan, as well as from digital platforms such as Google and Facebook.  

Seven West's revenue growth is expected to have slowed significantly in the second half of fiscal 2019 compared with the first half. The company reported a 4.5% rise in revenue to $1.04 billion in the six months ended December, driven by a solid 5.8% increase in advertising revenue to $926 million. However, analysts forecast second-half advertising revenue to increase by only 1-2% on the back of an uncertain economic environment and weak consumer sentiment.  

The company's costs may have also risen in the second half, offsetting revenue gains. Seven West has had to shell out more for key sports broadcast rights and US content as rival Nine Entertainment has aggressively bid up prices. At the same time, Seven's underperforming digital assets such as Yahoo7 and Pacific Magazines have remained a drag on earnings.  

Commenting on the expected results, Citi analysts said: "We expect fiscal 2019 results to be broadly in line with consensus forecasts. Free-to-air TV ad market growth has clearly slowed but cost control is mitigating the impact on group earnings."  

UBS analysts hold a more bearish view, saying: "We expect Seven West to report fiscal 2019 results slightly below expectations, reflecting continued revenue headwinds and cost pressures which are limiting profitability growth ... We forecast low single-digit ongoing declines in metro free-to-air TV ad revenues which, combined with content cost increases, will weigh on group earnings."  

Investors will be closely monitoring Seven West's commentary around current trading conditions and earnings guidance for fiscal 2020. The company's shares have gained nearly 30% so far this year, slightly underperforming the broader market. The stock remains attractively priced at around 12 times estimated fiscal 2020 earnings, representing a discount to rival Nine Entertainment.
