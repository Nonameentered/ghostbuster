Coca-Cola Amatil Settles Share Swap Deal with San Miguel Corp to Become World's Second Largest Coke Bottler  

Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (CCA) announced today that it has reached an agreement with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) of the Philippines for a share swap deal that will make CCA the second largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world by volume. Under the terms of the deal, CCA will acquire SMC's 65% stake in Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines, Inc. (KOFPH) in exchange for issuing new shares to SMC, which will increase SMC's shareholding in CCA to 29.9%.  

The deal will add the production and distribution of Coca-Cola products in the Philippines to CCA's operations across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Fiji. KOFPH operates 23 production facilities and over 200 distribution centers across the Philippines, producing and distributing Coca-Cola soft drink brands and its bottled water brand Wilkins Pure. It has a nationwide reach and currently serves over 80% of the Philippine population.

"We are delighted to enter into this strategic partnership with our long-standing partner San Miguel Corporation, which will securely position Coca-Cola Amatil for continued growth and success over the coming decades," said Alison Watkins, Group Managing Director of CCA. "The Philippines is a high-growth emerging market, and this acquisition will increase CCA's exposure to developing markets in line with our growth strategy."

The combined CCA and KOFPH business will produce over 3.2 billion unit cases of beverages annually, making CCA the second largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world behind only Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B de C.V. of Mexico (KOF), Coca-Cola's largest bottling partner. CCA expects cost synergies and increased scale to deliver pre-tax cost savings of A$20-30 million within two to three years. Revenue synergies are also expected over the longer term as CCA leverages its expertise to improve KOFPH's performance.

"We are very pleased to extend and expand our decades-long partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil and believe this agreement highlights the success of our relationship," said Ramon S. Ang, President and Chief Operating Officer of SMC. "Together with Coca-Cola Amatil, we have built KOFPH into a thriving business and among the country's most respected companies."

The deal remains subject to approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and CCA shareholders. Pending approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed in October 2020. CCA's shares rose 4.2% on the news, while SMC's shares were up 2.8% at the close of trading.
