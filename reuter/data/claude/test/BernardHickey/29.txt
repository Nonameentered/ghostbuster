Australian Treasurer Peter Costello Announces Biggest Financial Reforms in Decades 

Treasurer Peter Costello today announced the largest reforms to Australia’s financial system in decades. The reforms will loosen restrictions on bank and insurance company mergers and make it easier for foreign companies to acquire Australian firms.

The reforms overhaul laws that have been in place for nearly 20 years, since the Wallis Inquiry into the financial system. The existing restrictions aim to maintain competition in the banking and insurance sectors. However, Mr Costello argues that increasing globalization and new digital competitors require Australia’s financial firms to gain scale to compete.

“Australia’s major banks and insurers need to achieve greater scale to take on global competitors and grasp new opportunities in a digital world,” Mr Costello said. “By loosening restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, this package of reforms will strengthen our financial system for the future.”

The changes include raising the threshold for mergers that need approval from regulators, allowing major banks to own insurance companies, and streamlining the process for foreign takeovers of Australian financial firms. The government hopes the reforms will boost investment in Australia’s financial sector and increase the global competitiveness of Australian banks and insurers.

However, consumer groups and opposition parties have criticized the moves, warning they could lead to higher bank fees and insurance premiums due to reduced competition. They argue existing ownership laws aim to give Australians more choice and cheaper services. The Australian Labor Party has called the changes “radical deregulation” that puts the interests of big business over consumers.

The reforms require the approval of Parliament to become law. With the government holding a majority in the House of Representatives, the package is likely to pass despite opposition in the Senate. If approved, the changes would come into effect from July 1 next year. Mr Costello said the reforms represent “the biggest shakeup in 20 years” and will define the future shape of Australia’s financial system.
