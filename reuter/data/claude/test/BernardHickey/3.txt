Commonwealth Bank of Australia Increases Profit Forecast by A$50 Million After Strong First Half Result

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced today it would increase its full-year profit forecast by A$50 million after delivering a solid set of results for the first half of the financial year. The bank boosted its full-year expected profit to A$9.6 billion, a rise of 6 percent from 2019. 

The higher guidance comes as the Commonwealth Bank posted cash profit of A$4.8 billion in the six months to December 31, an increase of 12.4 percent from a year earlier. The bank benefited from improved business conditions, increased demand for home loans, and a decline in loan losses and bad debts.

Matt Comyn, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, said “We had a good first half supported by improved revenue growth, continued cost discipline and a significant improvement in asset quality.” Mr. Comyn noted demand for home loans was particularly strong, with mortgage volumes up 10 percent in the six-month period. The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, also expanded during the first half.

While the economic outlook remains uncertain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Commonwealth Bank said the resilience of the economy and its customers gives it confidence heading into 2021. The bank expects continued support from record low interest rates driving demand for home loans and business lending. However, the bank warned that conditions could change quickly if there are further widespread lockdowns or economic shocks.

The Commonwealth Bank results mirror solid results from Australia’s other major banks including Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank. The major banks have benefited from strong demand for mortgages due to record low interest rates and government stimulus programs supporting households and businesses. However, there are concerns that rising house prices, high household debt levels and the winding back of government support could pose challenges for the banking sector.

Shares in the Commonwealth Bank were up 2.1 percent in afternoon trading following the result. The stock has risen 6.1 percent so far this year, slightly underperforming the broader Australian stock market which is up 6.7 percent.

In summary, Commonwealth Bank delivered a strong half-year result and upgraded its full-year profit guidance by A$50 million. The bank benefited from improved business conditions, higher demand for home loans and a decline in loan losses. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain and the bank warned of potential challenges if there are further lockdowns or shocks. The Commonwealth Bank results were in line with solid results from Australia’s major banks, though the sector faces risks from high household debt, rising house prices and less government support.
