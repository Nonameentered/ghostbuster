BHP to be sole operator of Bayu-Undan gas field in Timor Sea, paving way for development plans

BHP announced today that it has acquired ConocoPhillips' 30% stake in the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea, making BHP the sole operator of the gas field located within Australia's Northern Territory. The $1.5 billion deal will provide BHP full control over further expansion and development of the gas field that supplies natural gas to Darwin and domestic customers in Australia and Timor-Leste. 

Bayu-Undan has been producing natural gas and condensate since 2004, with its gas exported to Darwin through an undersea pipeline. The field currently produces around 900 billion cubic feet of gas per year, resulting in annual revenue of over $3 billion. BHP plans to further develop the field through additional offshore production facilities and expansions of the existing platform and underwater pipeline infrastructure.

"This acquisition aligns with BHP's strategy to invest in high-quality, low-cost oil and gas assets with upside potential," said BHP's oil and gas president Geraldine Slattery. "With new technology and targeted investments, we aim to unlock additional value from Bayu-Undan and continue its supply of much-needed energy to Darwin and Timor-Leste for decades to come."

BHP is Australia's largest oil and gas producer and operator. Its petroleum business includes conventional oil and gas assets in Australia, the United States, and Trinidad and Tobago. The company has faced pressure in recent years to expand its oil and gas operations as the sector has stagnated. The Bayu-Undan deal provides BHP an opportunity to grow its output and revenue from upstream operations.

With ConocoPhillips' stake now acquired, BHP will have a 68.4% operating interest in Bayu-Undan. Santos and Inpex each own 11.8%, with Eni holding the remaining 8%. The joint venture partners have operated the gas field for over 15 years, but ConocoPhillips had previously expressed a desire to sell down its stake to concentrate on higher-margin assets.

The Bayu-Undan gas field has a remaining production life of at least 10 to 15 years, according to BHP estimates. Parts of the field remain under-explored, suggesting further resources could extend operations beyond initial projections. BHP's development plans for the field will aim to optimize production through targeted infill drilling and facility upgrades.
