Rural Press Ltd Not Confident of Economic Turnaround, Warns of Profit Decline for the Full Year

Rural Press Ltd, one of Australia's largest newspaper publishers, today warned investors that it does not expect a swift economic turnaround and full-year profits are likely to fall compared to last year. 

The owner of The Canberra Times, Ballarat Courier and Newcastle Herald said advertising spending remains weak, especially in its key local newspaper markets. Circulation revenues also continue to be under pressure as more readers access news online for free.

"There are no clear signs of an economic upswing, and consumer sentiment remains fragile," said Rural Press CEO Brian McCarthy. "While we are controlling costs, the overall operating environment continues to be challenging."

Rural Press said retail spending, especially for vehicles and household goods, remains soft. Real estate advertisers also continue to spend less due to declining activity in the property market. 

The profit warning came as Rural Press said revenues from continuing operations fell 6 percent to $385 million in the six months to December. Earnings before interest and tax dropped 12 percent to $86 million. The interim dividend was cut by 40 percent to 2 cents per share.

"While cost cutting has helped offset some revenue decline, it has not bridged the gap completely," said Mr McCarthy. "We will drive further efficiencies over the remainder of the financial year with the aim of protecting profit margins as much as possible."

Shares in Rural Press fell 8.5 percent to $1.87 after the announcement, underperforming the overall market which was down 2.3 percent. Analysts said the profit warning validated concerns that newspaper groups face deep structural challenges rather than just a cyclical downturn.

"The only good news here is that cost control and efficiencies seem to be keeping margins reasonably stableâ€”for now," said Justin Diddams, media analyst at stockbroker E&P Financial. "However, you have to wonder how sustainable that is if revenues continue falling at this pace."

Rural Press said the outcome for the full 2012 financial year remains hard to predict given economic uncertainties. However, based on trading so far, it expects net profit after tax will be between 5 and 10 percent lower than in 2011. The company reports its full-year results in August.
