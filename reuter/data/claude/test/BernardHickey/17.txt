News Corp Expected to Report Stagnant Net Profit Due to Rising Newsprint Costs and Star TV Losses 

Rupert Murdoch’s media conglomerate News Corp is expected to report little growth in net profit for the recently ended fiscal fourth quarter and full year, as higher newsprint costs and losses in its Star TV business offset gains in its cable networks and film studio divisions. 

News Corp will announce its quarterly results after U.S. markets close on Tuesday. According to a poll of analysts by FactSet, net profit for the June quarter is forecast to edge up 1% to $237 million from a year ago. For the full fiscal year, net profit is projected to remain flat at $1.46 billion.

The lackluster performance comes despite solid gains in the company’s cable networks, including Fox News and FX, as well as its 20th Century Fox film studio. But those were offset by higher costs for newsprint, the paper used to print newspapers, and losses at the company’s Star TV business in Asia and its Australian pay-TV company Foxtel.  

Newsprint prices have spiked more than 30% over the past year, squeezing profit margins at the company’s newspaper division, which includes the Wall Street Journal and New York Post. The newspaper unit remains News Corp’s single largest business by revenue, even as print advertising sales and circulation numbers have declined industrywide.  

Losses at Star TV have also widened as the India-based media company spent heavily to secure rights to Cricket matches and other live sports, while revenue slipped due to weaker advertising sales. News Corp took a $1 billion write-down on Star TV last year and Mr. Murdoch has acknowledged the investment has struggled.

To offset weakness in print media and India, News Corp is relying more heavily on its cable networks and entertainment properties. Revenue at the cable-network programming unit, which includes Fox News and Fox Sports, is forecast to climb 11% to $1.67 billion in the latest quarter. And the film division is coming off a solid summer, fueled by the Marvel superhero film “Doctor Strange” and DreamWorks animated movie “Trolls.”

Mr. Murdoch noted in a February conference call that while parts of News Corp faced “significant headwinds,” he was optimistic some units were poised for growth. “We do see light ahead,” he said. Investors will be watching Tuesday’s report closely for signs those areas of growth can outweigh the company’s challenges.
