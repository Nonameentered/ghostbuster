Brambles Industries Reports Strong First-Half Profits but Warns of Second-Half Slowdown

Brambles Industries, the Australian pooled pallet company, reported strong profits for the first half of its fiscal year driven by rising demand in North America and Europe. However, the company warned that growth is likely to slow in the second half due to weakening economic conditions and trade tensions between the U.S. and China.  

For the six months ending December 31, Brambles’ revenue rose 9% to $900 million while profits increased 12% to $180 million. The company achieved revenue and profit gains across all its business segments, including pallets, containers, and automotive.  

“We had an excellent start to the fiscal year with strong sales momentum and increased margins in all our regions,” said Brambles CEO Graham Chipchase. “Our iconic pooled pallet business and leadership in sustainability continue to resonate with customers around the world.”

The largest gains came from Brambles’ U.S. and European pallet businesses, with revenue up 12% and 8% respectively. Demand was particularly strong from customers in the grocery, automotive, and general manufacturing sectors. The company also benefited from price increases implemented to recover higher costs from its plant automation investments.

However, Mr. Chipchase warned that demand from key customers has started to decline in recent weeks, especially in the U.S. and Germany. “There are signs that economic activity and business confidence have weakened, along with increasing uncertainty from rising trade tensions,” he said. “While our first-half results demonstrate our resilience, we expect revenue growth and margin expansion to moderate in the second half.”

Brambles’ shares fell 3% in early trading as investors digested the mixed update. The company’s stock price has declined over 10% in the past month due to concerns about slowing growth.  

Analysts said Brambles first-half results were solid but its outlook commentary was more downbeat than expected. “The slowdown feels quite abrupt, so that’s rattled the market a bit,” said James Maydew, an analyst at Morningstar. However, he noted Brambles’ defensive characteristics should support its business even if economic conditions worsen. 

“Brambles provides an essential service to its customers, so its pallet pools should continue to generate consistent revenues even during a downturn,” Mr. Maydew said. “They also have strong competitive advantages from their scale, experience, and sustainably sourced products that customers value.”
