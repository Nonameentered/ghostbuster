Federal Government to Release Wallis Inquiry Report on Australia's Financial System with Expected Reforms Recommendations   

The Federal Government is set to publicly release the final report of the Wallis Inquiry into Australia's financial system today. The report is expected to recommend sweeping reforms to modernize and strengthen regulation of the country's banking and financial services sector.

The inquiry, led by businessman Stan Wallis, was commissioned by Treasurer Peter Costello in 1996 to conduct a comprehensive review of the nation's finance system - including banking, insurance, and superannuation. After more than a year of consultations, research and analysis, the inquiry's final report is anticipated to call for significant reforms to make the system more competitive, flexible, and globally integrated.

A key focus of the report is likely to be a restructure of banking regulation. The Wallis Inquiry is expected to recommend the existing system of regulations administered by the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and Australian Securities and Investments Commission be streamlined under a single regulator. The new regulator would be tasked with overseeing financial stability, consumer protection, market integrity, and competition.

The establishment of a single, independent regulator would aim to reduce overlap and close regulatory gaps that currently exist in the system. It would also help strengthen consumer protection by bringing all parts of the financial sector under the remit of one dedicated supervisor. However, critics argue it could concentrate too much power in one regulatory body.

In addition to regulatory changes, the Wallis report is predicted to recommend opening up more areas of banking and finance to competition. Relaxing barriers between commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and fund managers could drive innovation and efficiency. But others counter that weakened restrictions may lead to riskier behavior by financial institutions and less stability.   

The government will closely examine the Wallis Inquiry's recommendations before determining which reforms to implement. The changes proposed in the report would constitute the biggest overhaul of Australia's financial framework since deregulation in the 1980s. The final report is expected to shape the system that underpins the nation's economy for decades to come.
