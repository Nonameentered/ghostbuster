Australia's Major Banks Under Investigation for Collusion on Interest Rates 

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)  has launched a formal investigation into potential collusion on interest rates by the nation's four largest banks. In a surprise announcement today, ASIC Chairman James Shipton said the corporate regulator will examine whether the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), National Australia Bank (NAB), and Westpac Banking Corporation illegally coordinated to raise interest rates on variable home loans over the past decade. 

The major banks control approximately 80% of Australia's mortgage industry and have faced ongoing accusations of price gouging resulting in excessively high interest rates for consumers. While the banks have routinely claimed that rate increases were due to cost pressures in international funding markets, critics argue the near-lockstep moves point to anti-competitive behavior. The Council of Small Business Organizations of Australia (COSBOA) has been lobbying for a royal commission into the banking sector, citing the potential billions of dollars in excess charges paid by mortgage holders if collusion was present.

In response, the chief executives of ANZ, CBA, NAB, and Westpac released a joint statement denying any collusion on interest rates and welcoming the opportunity to work with ASIC to resolve the matter. However, Shares in all four banks fell by over 5% in early trading as investors reacted to the news. Analysts worry sizable fines and legal costs could significantly impact bank profits if the investigation finds evidence to support the collusion claims.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government fully supports ASIC's investigation, calling the allegations of collusion "extremely serious" if proven accurate. ASIC has requested transaction data, meeting minutes, communications, and other documents from the major banks dating back to 2010. The investigation is expected to take at least 12 to 18 months to complete. Both Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese argued today that criminal prosecutions should follow if illegal activity is uncovered.

The prospect of collusion adds another layer of scandal in an industry already under fire. The major banks will now likely face a period of intense public and government scrutiny as the ASIC investigation kicks into high gear. For mortgage holders across Australia, the probe offers hope that a finding of wrongdoing could spur lower interest rates and financial compensation for years of potential overcharging. The nation awaits the results with bated breath.
