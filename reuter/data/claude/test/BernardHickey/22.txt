ACCC Chairman Neutral on Westpac's Bid for Bank of Melbourne Ltd. 

The Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Rod Sims, said today that the ACCC does not currently have a view for or against Westpac Banking Corporation's proposed acquisition of Bank of Melbourne Ltd. 

Speaking at a press conference, Mr. Sims said “We are still in the process of reviewing the substantial documentation provided by Westpac on this proposed transaction. At this stage, we do not have a concluded view either for or against the acquisition on competition grounds.”

Westpac announced last month that it had reached an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in Bank of Melbourne for $4.5 billion. Bank of Melbourne is Australia's fifth largest retail bank, with over 2 million customers nationwide. Westpac is one of Australia's big four banks. 

Consumer advocacy groups have raised concerns that further consolidation in Australia's banking sector could lead to higher fees, less choice, and job losses. However, Westpac argues the acquisition would enable new investment in innovative products and services, as well as improve efficiency.

Mr. Sims said the key consideration for the ACCC would be whether the acquisition would substantially lessen competition in markets for retail banking products such as home loans, personal loans, deposits, and credit cards. “There are complex issues around product markets and geographic markets to work through here. We have not yet concluded whether the reduction in major retail banks from five to four would materially impact competition to the detriment of consumers.”

The ACCC has scheduled public consultations and private discussions with interested parties over the next two months. Mr. Sims expects the ACCC to form a preliminary view by early December. If real competition concerns are identified, the ACCC could oppose the acquisition or require divestments or other remedies to address those concerns as conditions of approval.
