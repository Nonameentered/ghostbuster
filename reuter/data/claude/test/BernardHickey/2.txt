Commonwealth Bank of Australia reports strong profits despite interest margin erosion

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation's largest lender, reported a strong increase in profits in the first half of this financial year largely driven by revenue from fee-based services. However, the bank warned that interest income remains under pressure due to the low interest rate environment. 

For the first half ending December 31, CBA reported a statutory net profit after tax of $4.6 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the previous corresponding period. Cash profit, the bank’s preferred measure which excludes one-off items, rose by the same margin to $4.8 billion.

The solid result was underpinned by double-digit growth in home and business lending, wealth management, and retail banking services. Home lending increased by 7 percent while business lending was up 12 percent compared to the same period last year. Revenue from banking and wealth management fees jumped 15 percent.

However, the bank noted that interest margins remained under pressure, down 4 basis points to 2.12 percent, due to record low interest rates. CBA makes most of its profits from the difference between borrowing and lending rates. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official interest rates three times last year to a historic low of 0.75 percent.

In the announcement, CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said: “We continued to perform well in a low interest rate environment with volume growth across our key businesses, good cost control and asset quality remaining sound.”

While the bank achieved solid growth in lending, the pace of growth has slowed from previous years due to weaker demand from consumers and businesses. House price growth has stalled in key Australian markets, while wages growth remains sluggish. Total home lending was up 7 percent, below the average growth of recent years.
