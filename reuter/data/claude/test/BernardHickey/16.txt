Papua New Guinea Stocks Plummet Amid Army's Attempt to Force Government Aside  

Stocks in Papua New Guinea plunged more than 5% today as the military mounted a failed attempt to remove Prime Minister James Marape from office. The power grab has sparked fears of political instability that could undermine the country's mining and natural gas sectors, major drivers of its resource-dependent economy.  

Shortly before dawn, a group of soldiers entered Mr. Marape's official residence in Port Moresby, the capital, but were turned away by the prime minister's security team. Mr. Marape then addressed the nation on television and radio, condemning the attempted coup and warning the military against further insubordination. "Any illegal activity will be shut down immediately," he said.  

The turmoil sent the benchmark Port Moresby Stock Exchange Index down more than 5% in early trading before paring losses to about 2% at midday. Mining and energy companies, including ExxonMobil PNG and Newcrest Mining, were among the hardest hit. The kina, Papua New Guinea's currency, also declined against the U.S. dollar.

Political instability poses economic risks in Papua New Guinea, an island nation of more than 8 million people north of Australia. Though rich in natural resources, the country has long struggled with poverty, corruption and weak governance. In recent years, it has sought to raise government revenue through multibillion-dollar natural gas and mining projects, including ExxonMobil's $19 billion PNG LNG development.

Mr. Marape, who served as finance minister under his predecessor Peter O'Neill, took office in May 2019 after a vote of no confidence in Parliament. He has pledged to revise resource agreements to give the government a bigger share of profits and make the economy more self-sufficient. But his proposals have worriedsome international investors.

Any successful effort to unseat Mr. Marape could undermine reforms and cast further doubt on the government's ability to regulate the resource sector, analysts said. "The political crisis highlights the fragility of Papua New Guinea's democracy and governing institutions," said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.

While the military retreated today, the episode suggests internal division and unhappiness with Mr. Marape's leadership that could flare up again, Mr. Pryke added. The prime minister appears to have maintained the confidence of Parliament for now but his government's hold on power remains tenuous without a permanent resolution of tensions.

For Papua New Guinea's economy, the turmoil could barely come at a worse time. Economic growth has slowed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with effects evident in weakening demand for oil, gas and metals. The country also faces rising government debt levels and depends heavily on development aid from Australia, China and international institutions. A period of political chaos now casts a shadow over hopes for an economic rebound as Covid-19 vaccines start to become available.
