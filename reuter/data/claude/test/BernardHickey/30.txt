Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's Road-Block Boosts National Australia Bank's Attractiveness  

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello dealt a blow to Australia's largest bank this week, restricting an $11 billion payout to shareholders of the National Australia Bank (NAB) while he scrutinizes the bank's finances. However, the move may have inadvertently made NAB more attractive to investors and helped boost the company's share price.

Costello imposed the temporary freeze on NAB dividends and share buybacks, citing concerns over the bank's capital levels after its disastrous foray into the United Kingdom. NAB had planned to return 70% of its first-half earnings to shareholders but Costello said the payout was too high given the bank's circumstances. NAB lost nearly $3.5 billion last year from bad loans and writedowns in its British businesses. 

The Treasurer’s intervention shook investor confidence in NAB and rippled through the broader financial sector. NAB’s shares tumbled 6% following the announcement, dragging the Australian stock market lower. The surprise move also raised fears that the government may intervene directly in corporations to block shareholder payouts.

However, Costello’s actions have highlighted NAB’s strong core operations and potential upside as it recovers from the UK misadventure. Stripping out the British losses, NAB remains a highly profitable bank that generates healthy returns. It is Australia’s largest business lender and second largest mortgage provider, with a customer base of 9 million Australians. With the British businesses now sold or restructured, NAB can refocus on its core Australian and New Zealand markets where it enjoys dominant and stable positions.

Costello has promised to review the dividend freeze in August when NAB reports its full-year results. Senior bank executives will spend the next few months persuading the Treasurer and investors that the worst is behind NAB and excess capital should be returned to shareholders. If successful, NAB shares may surge again in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the dividend halt provides NAB an opportunity to further strengthen its balance sheet, boosting its attractiveness to investors over the longer-term.  

The Treasurer’s actions highlight the solid fundamentals and resilience of Australia’s major banks despite short-term disruptions. While NAB’s dividend freeze may weigh on the stock in the near-term, the bank remains superbly positioned to deliver strong and stable returns over the years to come. For long-term investors, NAB shares continue to warrant attention. Overall, Costello’s roadblock is unlikely to divert NAB from its destination of shareholder value. The journey may just take a little longer.
