Australian Treasurer Peter Costello Keeps Bank Merger Veto to Serve the "Battlers", Ignores Wallis Inquiry Recommendations

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello today announced he would keep the government's ability to veto major bank mergers, going against the recommendations of the 1997 Wallis Inquiry into the Australian financial system. 

The Wallis Inquiry recommended removing restrictions on mergers between the big four banks—the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ, and National Australia Bank—arguing this would make the banks more efficient and competitive. However, Mr. Costello said the government needs to retain oversight to ensure bank mergers do not disadvantage certain groups, especially low-income "battler" households and small businesses.

"While increased competition and efficiency are important, we also need to consider how significant financial institution mergers could impact different parts of the community," Mr. Costello said in a statement. "The government must remain in a position to veto mergers that could reduce services or increase fees for some customers who have limited choice or ability to switch providers."

Mr. Costello's decision comes amid increased calls for banking reform from consumer advocates and some political parties. The Australian Greens and independents such as MP Andrew Wilkie have argued the major banks make excessive profits and do not pass on enough of the recent interest rate cuts to customers. The major banks have recorded multi-billion dollar profits this year despite only cutting some mortgage and business loan rates by 0.15 to 0.2 percentage points, less than the Reserve Bank's cuts of 0.25 percentage points.

Shares in the major banks fell slightly on Mr. Costello's announcement as investors feared limited ability to achieve cost savings and efficiencies through mega-mergers. However, bank representatives welcomed the government's concern for customers and said they remained focused on providing competitive products, rates and service regardless of the ability to merge.

Meanwhile, consumer groups applauded the government's decision and called for even stronger oversight and regulations to prevent exploitative pricing and ensure the benefits of any future interest rate cuts or financial system reforms flow through to ordinary Australians. 

In summary, Treasurer Costello's veto of unfettered bank mergers aims to protect vulnerable consumers but risks limiting industry efficiency gains, leaving both banks and their critics wanting more as Australia's financial sector remains under the pump.
