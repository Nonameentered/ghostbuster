Australia's Treasurer Announces Biggest Financial Reforms Since 1983 But Stops Short of Allowing Big Bank Mergers

The Australian Treasurer announced sweeping reforms to the country's financial system yesterday, the most significant changes since banking deregulation in 1983. The reforms aim to boost competition in the sector, increase access to credit for small businesses and improve consumer protections. However, the Treasurer stopped short of allowing Australia's big four banks to merge, a move that some analysts argue could reduce costs for consumers.  

The centerpiece of the reforms is the introduction of comprehensive credit reporting, which requires banks and other lenders to share more customer data with credit agencies. This will provide a more complete view of individuals' borrowing and repayment history, enabling more accurate credit scores and risk assessments. The government believes this will allow lenders to extend credit to more borrowers, especially small businesses, which have historically faced more limited access to finance.

The reforms also include opening up data on personal and small business accounts to third parties to build budgeting and financial management tools. Consumers will have control over their data and need to explicitly consent to sharing it with accredited third parties. The government sees this as a way to drive innovation in financial services and provide more choice for consumers.   

To improve consumer protections, the reforms ban unsolicited credit card limit increases and require all lenders to be members of an external dispute resolution scheme. Lenders will also need to undertake more in-depth checks before approving unsolicited overdrafts on basic accounts. The government said these changes will prevent people getting into unmanageable debt.

However, the Treasurer said the government would not remove the longstanding restrictions on mergers between Australia's big four banks - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and NAB. Some analysts have argued bank mergers could generate significant cost savings that are passed onto consumers through lower interest rates and fees. But the government is concerned mergers may reduce competitive pressures and lead to higher prices over the long term.

The reforms follow a two-year review into the financial system by former Commonwealth Bank CEO David Murray. The final report, released last December, called for sweeping changes to support a more competitive, innovative and consumer-centric banking sector. The government has now adopted 40 of the 44 recommendations in the Murray report.
