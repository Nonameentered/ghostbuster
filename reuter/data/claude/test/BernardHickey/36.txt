Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accuses Prime Minister John Howard of "disgraceful" deal to deliver Fairfax to Kerry Packer

Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes has launched a blistering attack on Prime Minister John Howard, accusing him of brokering a "disgraceful" deal to deliver control of the Fairfax media group to Kerry Packer. 

In a speech at the National Press Club, Mr Stokes broke his silence over the bidding war for Fairfax that culminated in Mr Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) gaining control of the group in 1987. Mr Stokes had been competing with Mr Packer to gain control of Fairfax but pulled out after his final bid of $1.8 billion was rejected in favour of Mr Packer's $2.25 billion offer.

Mr Stokes said Mr Howard, who was then Treasurer in the Hawke government, had "betrayed" him by reneging on a commitment to support his bid and instead backing Mr Packer. "John Howard looked me in the eye and gave me his word he would support my bid for Fairfax. Only days later, he had done a murky deal with Kerry to hand him Fairfax on a platter. It was a disgraceful betrayal that has since been proven to go against the national interest."

The comments threaten to reopen old wounds from the bitterly contested bid and cast a shadow over the relationship between two of Australia's most powerful businessmen. Mr Stokes said the deal had been "to the detriment of democracy and media diversity in Australia". "With control of Fairfax, Packer gained a stranglehold over newspapers and television that no government should have condoned. But they did, all because of John Howard's duplicity and hunger for power."

Mr Howard rejected the claims, saying he had acted with integrity and any suggestions otherwise were "false and defamatory". A spokesperson for Mr Packer declined to comment. The battle for Fairfax has long been controversial, with critics arguing Mr Packer gained too much control over media assets and influence. The deal went ahead despite concerns from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over its impact on media diversity. 

The latest salvo from Mr Stokes now raises questions about political deals done behind closed doors and the concentration of power in media empires like that built by Mr Packer, who passed away in 2005. For Mr Howard, the accusations threaten to tarnish his legacy during his time as Treasurer in the Hawke government in the 1980s. The role of government in influencing corporate deals and media ownership regulation is likely to again come under close scrutiny.
