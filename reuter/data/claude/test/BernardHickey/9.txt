Sydney Olympics Ticket Sales Struggle, Prompting Consortium to Seek Overseas Buyers  

Ticket sales for the 2000 Sydney Olympics have struggled to meet targets over the past year, raising concerns that many events may not sell out and forcing organizers to ramp up marketing to international audiences. The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) launched sales almost exactly a year ago with the goal of selling 1.5 million tickets to events ranging from swimming and athletics to soccer and boxing.  

However, as of this month ticket sales sit at just over 1 million, representing 67% of the overall goal. The rates of sales have slowed in recent months despite an initial burst of interest from Australians keen to secure seats at popular events like the opening ceremony and swimming finals.  SOCOG has tried various promotions, price cuts, and bundled tickets to spur further domestic demand but additional sales gains have been modest.

The ticket struggle highlights both the financial pressures on the AUD $6.5 billion Sydney Games and the challenges of selling a global event in a country with a small population. With less than 20 million residents, Australia has had issues consistently packing large stadiums for major events. SOCOG budgeted for $553 million in revenue from ticket sales, the second largest source of income for the organizers after sponsorships. Ticket sales shortfalls could leave a hole in the budget and require funds to be diverted from other areas or additional government contributions.

In a bid to drive more sales in the final months of preparation, SOCOG has launched new deals targeting foreign visitors planning to travel to Australia for the Olympics. The offers include accommodation packages that bundle event tickets with hotel stays, as well as ticket-only deals offering price savings for non-Australians. The tourism industry has joined to help promote the special offers around the world.  

SOCOG CEO Rod McGeoch remained optimistic about reaching the ticket target, saying “there is still strong interest from interstate and overseas visitors planning their Olympic experience.” However, others worry that time may run out to sell 500,000 additional tickets before the September opening ceremony. For now, Olympics fans will have the chance to secure newly-released tickets at a discount if willing to act fast and book from abroad. The question remains whether a flurry of late overseas interest can help rescue Sydney’s Olympic ticket sales.
