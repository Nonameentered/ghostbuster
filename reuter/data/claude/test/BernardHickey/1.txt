Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Home Loan Portfolio Boosts Profit Outlook for H1 Results  

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) reported strong interim results for the first half of its fiscal year, driven by continued growth in its residential mortgage portfolio. The nation's largest bank benefited from interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia and solid demand for new home loans, especially interest-only loans that carried higher margins.  

CBA said cash earnings for the six months through December rose 6% from a year earlier to A$4.86 billion or A$2.64 per share. The results beat analyst expectations and the bank lifted its dividend. CBA also raised its guidance for full-year earnings growth. 

The results provide further evidence that Australia's largest lenders continue to perform well thanks to the country's strong economic growth and red-hot property market. The big banks have generated double-digit profit and dividend growth in recent years amid record-low interest rates.

Net interest margin, the difference between interest earned and paid out, expanded to 2.16% in the first half from 2.10% a year earlier. This was better than expected and reflected higher yields on mortgages and a change in the mix of CBA's lending portfolio toward more profitable owner-occupied and interest-only home loans.

CBA said its retail banking unit saw earnings rise 9% to A$3.37 billion, driven by a 6% increase in home lending volumes and higher net interest margins. Business lending also grew at a healthy clip. The wealth management and insurance divisions reported more modest profit gains.

CBA chief executive Ian Narev said the bank benefited from "continued economic growth, strong population growth, and a vibrant housing market." He said demand for the bank's core home lending products remained strong through the end of 2017.

Mr. Narev said about 30% of CBA's mortgages are interest-only loans, which some analysts worry could pose risks if interest rates rise sharply or property prices decline. But Mr. Narev said CBA performs strict affordability checks and its portfolio remains high quality.

Shares in CBA, which have gained more than 60% over the past two years, rose 2.4% to A$83.94 in early trading as investors welcomed the robust results. CBA is trading at about 14 times forecast earnings, in line with its major bank peers.

The strong results from CBA bode well for Australia's other major lenders, ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp, which report first-half earnings in the coming weeks. The banks have reaped huge profits from Australia's booming property market and interest-rate cuts, stoking criticism they have become too profitable and calls for a government inquiry into the sector.

But bank and business groups argue the major lenders face increasing competitive pressures and higher compliance and funding costs in a low-growth economy. They say an inquiry could undermine confidence in the sector and the economy. The government so far has resisted calls for a broad review of the banking system.
