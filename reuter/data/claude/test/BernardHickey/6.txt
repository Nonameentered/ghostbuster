CBA Plans to Expand Presence in Asia and New Zealand while eyeing acquisition opportunities for investment management funds  

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced plans to grow its presence in Asia and New Zealand while actively looking for acquisition opportunities to expand its global asset management business. CBA aims to deepen its relationships with high net worth clients in Asia and New Zealand through its financial planning and private banking divisions.  

The expansion builds on CBA’s recent investments in Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand. CBA already owns a strategic investment in Bank of Hangzhou, one of the leading mid-sized banks in China. The bank is looking to develop specialized wealth management services for Chinese clients with business and investment interests in Australia. In Singapore and Hong Kong, CBA plans to expand its private banking teams to provide tailored solutions for high net worth individuals in Southeast Asia.

In New Zealand, CBA’s subsidiary ASB Bank serves over 1 million customers with a full range of banking and wealth management services. The bank will enhance its financial planning and investment solutions for high net worth customers across New Zealand. According to Ian Narev, CEO of CBA, “Asia and New Zealand represent a huge potential for CBA to support the growing wealth management needs of clients in these regions. Our unique ability to connect clients to opportunities in Australia positions us well to serve Asia’s increasing participation in global trade and investment.”

Beyond Asia and New Zealand, CBA is actively looking at acquisition opportunities to strengthen its global asset management business, Colonial First State Global Asset Management (CFSGAM). CFSGAM has over A$226 billion in funds under management across developed and emerging markets. Potential acquisitions will boost CFSGAM’s offshore presence in North America, UK and Europe, while adding new capabilities in global equities, fixed income and multi-asset solutions.  

Mr Narev said CBA has significant scope to become a leading Asia-connected wealth manager with global investment capabilities. The expansion into Asia and new acquisitions will enable CBA to diversify its business into the high-growth private banking and asset management sectors, which complements its strong Australian retail banking franchise. With its robust balance sheet and strong capital position, CBA is poised to undertake new offshore investments to generate attractive risk-weighted returns for its shareholders.
