Wallis Inquiry reveals views on financial reform options 

The Royal Commission into Australia’s banking system has released its interim report, outlining views on potential financial reforms to address widespread misconduct in the sector. The chair of the inquiry, Kenneth Hayne, expressed the preliminary view that changes are required to laws, regulations and practices to achieve cultural change in banks and restore trust in the system.

The Wallis Inquiry, as it has become known, was established in December 2017 following various banking scandals and revelations of unethical behavior by Australia's largest financial institutions. In his report, Commissioner Hayne identified several areas where reform may be enacted, though he cautioned final recommendations will depend on further evidence in the remaining public hearings.

A key reform option relates to mortgage brokers, with the report suggesting brokers have a conflict of interest as they are paid commissions by lenders. It proposes brokers should charge the borrower a fee instead, to remove the incentive to get customers into high-interest loans. The report also questions whether lending practices have been too heavily geared towards maximizing profits rather than the best interests of customers. It suggests the responsible lending obligations on banks may need to be strengthened through law reform.

Another area targeted for potential change is financial advice. The report says the ‘fee for no service’ issue, where customers are charged for advice they do not receive, could be addressed by banning grandfathered commissions paid to advisers. It also proposes a single disciplinary body be established to monitor advisers, replacing the current system where advisers are overseen by multiple industry bodies. Financial advisers may face more stringent requirements around disclosure of commissions and fees under reforms being considered.

In the insurance sector, the report suggests ‘hawking’ or unsolicited selling of insurance products could be banned to protect consumers, and caps placed on commissions paid to insurance brokers. Concerns were also raised around ‘junk’ insurance products that provide little benefit. Reforms here may include giving the regulator more power to intervene in the sale of worthless policies.

While the report does not make firm conclusions or recommendations at this stage of the inquiry, Commissioner Hayne’s preliminary views provide an insight into reforms that could reshape Australia’s financial sector to reduce misconduct, unethical practices and conflicts of interest. The final report is due by February 2019. Whatever the outcome, it appears the era of lax regulation and weak compliance that has allowed systemic failures may be coming to an end. The Wallis Inquiry seems set to drive substantial improvements in governance, behavior and culture across banking and finance.
