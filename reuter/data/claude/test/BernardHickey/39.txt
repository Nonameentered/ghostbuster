Westpac Banking Corp Posts Strong Profit Rise Despite Interest Margin Squeeze 

Westpac Banking Corporation, one of Australia's big four banks, announced a solid increase in first-half cash profit despite facing significant headwinds from lower interest rates squeezing lending margins.

Westpac reported a 6% rise in cash profit to $3.29 billion for the six months to March 31. The result was ahead of analyst forecasts and was driven by continued growth in home and business lending, lower charges for bad debts, and a pick-up in wealth management and insurance income.

However, Westpac's net interest margin - the difference between interest earned and paid out - fell 8 basis points to 2.06% over the half. Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said the lower interest rate environment was putting pressure on the bank's ability to generate income from its core lending business. "We are operating in a low growth, low interest rate environment and we expect interest margins to remain under pressure," Mr. Hartzer said.

To offset margin pressure, Westpac has been cutting costs. Expenses fell 1% over the half, helped by lower staff numbers. The bank has also been diversifying into other fee-based businesses such as wealth management and transaction banking. Income from wealth management jumped 15% to $440 million, while cash earnings from financial planning and insurance also rose strongly.

Westpac's home lending grew by 2.5% over the half to $445 billion. Mr. Hartzer said the housing market remained "resilient" with prices still rising in Sydney and Melbourne, though at a slower pace. However, investors now make up 40% of Westpac's mortgage book, a record high and nearly double the level five years ago. There is concern a property downturn could hit investors hard and lead to higher bad debts.

Westpac's stock rose 1.4% on the profit result, outperforming a flat overall market. While the bank faces significant economic and competitive hurdles, investors responded positively to its ability to keep boosting profits through its mix of lending and fee-based businesses. With interest rates expected to stay at record lows for some time, diversification will remain key to Westpac maintaining its winning run.
