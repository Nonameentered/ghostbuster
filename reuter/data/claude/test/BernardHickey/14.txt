Natwest Markets Australia Ltd aims to maintain leading equities broking market share in Australia in 1997, focuses on structured and derivatives products instead of securitized mortgage deals  

Sydney, Australia - Natwest Markets Australia Ltd, the Australian equities and investment banking division of National Westminster Bank PLC, aims to maintain its position as one of the leading equities brokers in Australia in 1997, according to managing director Michael Johnson. However, the firm will shift its focus away from arranging securitized mortgage deals toward structured products, derivatives, and other sophisticated instruments for institutional investors.

“We cemented our position as one of the top equities brokers in Australia last year and want to defend that market share this year,” Johnson said. “But the market for mortgage-backed securities has softened, so we see greater opportunities with more complex products that cater to large institutional clients looking for innovative solutions.”

Natwest Markets topped merger and acquisition deal rankings in Australia last year and was a leading broker for initial public offerings, helping raise over A$5 billion for Australian companies on domestic and international exchanges, Johnson said. The firm was also among the most active in Australia's securitization market, helping arrange over A$10 billion in mortgage-backed bond deals.  

However, other large investment banks have since entered the Australian market for securitized mortgages, increasing competition and compressing fees. "The mortgage securitization business was very lucrative for a few years but it’s commoditized now,” Johnson said. “We’re better off focusing our efforts on more sophisticated areas where our structuring expertise and distribution capabilities provide a competitive advantage."

Natwest Markets has specialized structured products groups in Sydney and London that design customized derivative products for clients based on interest rates, currencies, equities, and other underlying assets or risks. These products, such as swaps, options, and embedded derivatives, allow investors to hedge risks or gain exposure to certain market outcomes. The firm is also expanding its prime brokerage business, providing financing, clearing, and settlement services for hedge funds and other institutional clients trading in equities, fixed income, and derivatives markets.
