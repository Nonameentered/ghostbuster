Coca-Cola Amatil and San Miguel to create world's 2nd largest bottler in A$3.7bn deal 

Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd, the Australian soft drinks maker, and San Miguel Corporation, Philippines’ largest beverage company, have joined forces in a mega A$3.7 billion deal to create the world's second largest independent Coca-Cola bottler. The merger has been approved by the competition regulators in Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. 

Under the agreement, San Miguel will sell its stakes in Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines Inc (CCFPI) and San Miguel Brewery Indonesia to Coca-Cola Amatil. In return, San Miguel will gain a 29.4% shareholding in the combined company and two board seats. The deal is expected to enhance Coca-Cola Amatil’s position in the Asia-Pacific region and provide scale to compete with larger rivals.

Coca-Cola Amatil's Group Managing Director Alison Watkins said "this transaction represents a step change for Coca-Cola Amatil. It will significantly strengthen our operations and infrastructure, particularly in developing markets." The combination of Coca-Cola Amatil and CCFPI will create the world's second largest independent Coca-Cola bottler by sales volume with annual revenues of about A$11 billion. It will also expand Coca-Cola Amatil's bottling operations to 11 countries, with significant market positions in major Southeast Asian economies like the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

The merger is expected to deliver cost savings of about A$90 million per year within the next three years. Coca-Cola Amatil also expects the deal to be "highly value accretive" to its earnings and to generate strong cash flows. The savings will come from supply chain efficiencies, reduced procurement costs and streamlining support functions across the group.

San Miguel president and COO Ramon S. Ang said "this transaction is consistent with San Miguel's objectives to unlock value in its investment portfolio and provide additional financial flexibility." The sale of the Coke bottling assets will allow San Miguel to focus on its core food, beverage, packaging and energy businesses across the Asia-Pacific region.

The deal forms part of Coca-Cola’s push to consolidate its bottling network globally. Coca-Cola aims to have just 10 large independent bottlers, down from around 70 at the start of the decade. Analysts said the merger with San Miguel’s bottling operations is a logical step in Coca-Cola Amatil's growth strategy in developing markets where demand for soft drinks and non-alcoholic beverages is growing at a fast pace. The complementary geographic footprints of the two bottlers will give Coca-Cola Amatil a strong platform to expand further in Asia and accelerate growth across the region.
