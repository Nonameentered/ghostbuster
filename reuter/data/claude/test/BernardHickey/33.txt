Australia's Largest Home Mortgage Lender Warns of U.S.-Style Financial Collapse

The largest mortgage lender in Australia is issuing a dire warning to homeowners and investors in the country that a catastrophic collapse in the housing market could occur if irresponsible lending continues unchecked. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which controls about one-third of all mortgage lending in Australia, claimed in a recent report that the combination of scarce housing supply, record low interest rates, and risky lending to borrowers with small down payments is creating an unsustainable housing bubble.  

Greg Ellis, Chief economist at Commonwealth Bank, likened the situation in Australia's housing market to the irresponsible lending practices in the U.S. that led to the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 and the subsequent global financial crisis. "We are seeing the same patterns of risky lending and borrowing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees a decade ago," Ellis said. "Unaffordable housing prices, high household debt, and aggressive lending to borrowers who may not be able to repay are extremely worrying signs."

House prices in Australia's largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, have more than doubled in the last decade due to high demand and low interest rates. The median home value in Sydney now exceeds $1 million Australian dollars ($730,000 USD). Household debt in Australia also now exceeds 120% of income, one of the highest rates in the developed world.  

Despite these alarming trends, Australia's housing market has so far avoided a sharp downturn. But Ellis warned that even a modest increase in mortgage interest rates or unemployment could put many recent homebuyers in financial distress and lead to a wave of mortgage defaults. This could force banks to tighten lending standards, making it more difficult for new buyers to get approved for mortgages and finance homes.

Australia's central bank and financial regulators have announced measures in recent months to curb risky mortgage lending practices, but critics argue these steps have been too modest. The Reserve Bank of Australia, however, disputes that there are currently signs of a housing bubble or risky lending in the market on the scale of the U.S. subprime crisis.  Officials insist Australia's banking system remains strong, but said regulators are closely monitoring the market.

The warnings from Commonwealth Bank highlight the difficult balancing act Australia faces between reining in worrisome levels of household debt and keeping its housing market—and broader economy—growing during a time of tepid wage increases and low inflation. Borrowers and investors are hoping regulators take stronger action before history repeats itself.
