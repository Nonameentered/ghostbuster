Westfield's U.S. arm to go public with $400 million raised in initial public offering for shopping mall buying spree  

Westfield, the Australian shopping mall giant, has spun off its U.S. business into a newly formed company called Westfield U.S. that will launch an initial public offering to raise $400 million to fund expansion into the American market.  

Westfield U.S. will debut on the New York Stock Exchange next month with an IPO of 40 million shares priced between $9 to $10 each. At the midpoint of the range, the IPO would value the new company at $3.8 billion. The funds will be used to acquire more shopping malls across the U.S., adding to Westfield's current portfolio of 124 retail properties across 38 states.

“The U.S. economy is strengthening, consumer confidence is up, and the retail environment is improving,” said Mark Stefan, CEO of Westfield U.S. “Now is the optimal time to become a publicly traded company and raise funds to accelerate our growth strategy.”

Westfield entered the U.S. market in 1977 and built many of the nation’s most prominent urban shopping centers, including Westfield World Trade Center in New York, Westfield San Francisco Centre, and Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Under Stefan's leadership as CEO since 2017, Westfield has shifted its focus to mid-sized cities where competition from online retailers is less intense. The company is targeting malls that serve populations of around 500,000 to 1 million people.

The spin-off and IPO comes amid a challenging time for malls and brick-and-mortar retailers with many stores closing due to e-commerce competition. However, Class A malls in affluent communities and premium shopping centers like Westfield's continue to attract both consumers and retailers. Westfield believes the U.S. retail landscape offers many opportunities for well-capitalized mall owners and the $400 million in IPO proceeds will help Westfield U.S. snap up choice properties.

Consumer reaction to the news of Westfield's U.S. expansion plans was enthusiastic. “I’m always excited to see Westfield open a new mall. They bring in great stores and it’s an event to go shopping there,” said Jessica Lee, a Westfield shopper in San Diego. Westfield's U.S. IPO is expected to price on September 20 and begin trading the next day.
