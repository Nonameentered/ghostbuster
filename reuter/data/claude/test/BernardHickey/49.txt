Brokers successfully place Foster's Brewing Group shares with institutions and private clients 

Foster's Brewing Group shares soared today after brokers successfully placed $2.9 billion of new shares with institutional and private investors. The shares were priced at $5.60 each, a 2% discount to Foster's closing price yesterday. The issue was more than three times oversubscribed, indicating strong demand for the stock.

The share issue will reduce debt and provide additional working capital to continue Foster's growth strategies, according to CEO Michael Lockwood. "The success of this share issue highlights the confidence investors have in Foster's brands and our strategic direction," Lockwood said. "With lower debt levels, we have an opportunity to accelerate our investments in marketing, digital capabilities, and new product development."

Foster's has focused recently on premiumizing its brand portfolio and expanding geographically. Its most well-known product, Foster’s Lager, has stabilized in many markets and is showing signs of a resurgence in popularity among younger consumers. Foster’s has also invested in craft breweries and cider labels to capture growth in those segments. 

The placement was conducted via an institutional share placement to large funds, as well as a share purchase plan offer to existing private shareholders. The institutional offer was heavily oversubscribed, attracting a range of domestic and international institutions. The share plan offer also saw strong demand, with participation from over 50,000 retail shareholders. 

J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Capital acted as joint lead managers on the institutional placement. The share plan offer was conducted by Computershare, Foster’s share registry. 

Foster's shares have gained nearly 20% over the past year as the company's turnaround strategy gained traction. With its balance sheet strengthened and additional funds to invest in growth initiatives, analysts are optimistic the share price rally may continue. The brokers who conducted today's successful placement will also be pleased to have once again demonstrated their capabilities in a large and complex equity raising deal. For CEO Lockwood and Foster's management team, the share issue is a vote of confidence that their stewardship of this Australian icon is taking the company from strength to strength.
