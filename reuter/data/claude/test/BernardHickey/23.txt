Westpac to Acquire Bank of Melbourne for A$1.435 Billion in Takeover Bid

Westpac Banking Corporation announced today that it will acquire Bank of Melbourne from the Bank of Queensland in a A$1.435 billion deal. The acquisition of the regional lender will expand Westpac's presence in the state of Victoria and marks the latest move by the country's major banks to strengthen their market positions. 

Bank of Melbourne currently has 60 branches across Melbourne and regional Victoria, with assets under management of A$11.2 billion. Westpac Group Chief Executive Brian Hartzer said the acquisition was part of Westpac's growth strategy to build scale in key markets. “Bank of Melbourne’s dedicated Victorian focus and branch footprint are highly complementary to our own,” Mr Hartzer said.

The A$1.435 billion price represents a multiple of 1.3 times Bank of Melbourne’s net tangible assets, in line with recent comparable transactions in the banking sector. The acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive in the first full year of ownership before synergies, and the total acquisition is expected to achieve a return on investment that exceeds Westpac’s cost of capital within three to five years.

The sale of Bank of Melbourne was mandated as one of the undertakings agreed by Bank of Queensland following its takeover of Members Equity Bank in 2016. Bank of Queensland Managing Director Jon Sutton said that while Bank of Melbourne had been an important part of the group, the sale would enable the bank to focus on its core Queensland and northern New South Wales markets.

“We are pleased to have found such a high-quality buyer for the Bank of Melbourne business,” Mr Sutton said. The sale is expected to lift Bank of Queensland’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio by around 70 basis points.

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in mid-2019. Westpac plans to undertake a review of Bank of Melbourne's operations once the takeover has completed to determine how to optimally integrate the business. Westpac said there were no current plans for branch closures or job cuts as a result of the acquisition.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is expected to closely scrutinize the takeover bid, given the significant market power already held by the major banks. However, Westpac stated that Bank of Melbourne's limited scale and focus on regional and suburban locations in Victoria meant the acquisition was unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the banking sector.

Shares in Westpac were up 1.2% to $29.33 in early trade following the announcement, while Bank of Queensland shares rose 3.7% to $9.49.
