Westfield America Inc to List on New York Stock Exchange in $400m IPO

Westfield America Inc, one of the largest mall owners in the United States, has announced plans for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange that could raise up to $400 million. The company, owned by the Australian-based Westfield Corporation, is looking to list in the coming months to raise funds to pay down debt and support expansion plans.

Westfield America owns and operates 35 shopping malls across 12 states, spanning over 50 million square feet of retail space. The company primarily owns shopping malls in affluent suburban areas, with the largest concentrations in California, New York, and New Jersey. Westfield America’s properties include landmark locations such as the Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles.

While malls have faced significant challenges from online retailers in recent years, Westfield America believes its focus on “experience-first” shopping destinations and high-end, luxury retailers will drive continued growth. The IPO funding will be used to upgrade several properties by bringing in more dining, entertainment, and technology options to create an integrated experience beyond just shopping. Funds will also go toward improving digital integration, like apps to help customers navigate malls and access promotions. 

“We see tremendous opportunities for growth by enhancing our malls into hubs for community and social interaction,” said Mary Chesshyre, CEO of Westfield America. “The funding from the IPO will allow us to accelerate our vision for the future of retail and solidify our standing with both shoppers and retailers.”

The listing is anticipated to be well received by investors eager to gain exposure to premium real estate assets with a stable long-term outlook. While the retail sector faces macro-level challenges, Westfield America’s concentration on the higher-end of the market and a more experiential offering is expected to provide some insulation. The Westfield Corporation will maintain a majority stake in Westfield America following the listing. J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Barclays will serve as the lead underwriters for the IPO.
