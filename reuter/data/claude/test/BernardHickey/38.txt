Analysts warn of hurdles for Kerry Packer's bid for publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd 

Media tycoon Kerry Packer faces significant obstacles in his A$1.5 billion bid to take over John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, Australia's oldest newspaper publisher, analysts warned today. 

Mr Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd launched an unsolicited offer yesterday to acquire the 59 percent of Fairfax it does not already own. The bid values Fairfax at A$2.6 billion.

However, Fairfax's board unanimously rejected the offer, arguing it undervalues the company. The board also enacted 'poison pill' measures to thwart Mr Packer, including issuing new shares to existing shareholders at a discount.

'This is going to be an uphill battle for Packer,' said Michael Fraser, media analyst at Macquarie Bank. 'Fairfax's board and management clearly don't want to sell at this price, and will take actions to defend the company.'

Mr Packer, one of Australia's richest businessmen, owns stakes in Crown Resorts and Channel Nine. He has long coveted Fairfax's newspaper assets, including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The Australian Financial Review.  

Owning Fairfax would make Mr Packer the dominant media mogul across print, television and online news in Australia. However, media diversity advocates argue it could reduce impartiality in news coverage and allow unfair influence over public opinion.

'There are real concerns about concentrated control of media in the hands of one person,' said Jenna Price, journalism lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney. 'If Packer took over Fairfax, he would have unparalleled power over news and current affairs in this country.'

To succeed, Mr Packer will need to win over major Fairfax shareholders by significantly increasing his offer, potentially up to A$3 billion or more, analysts said. He will also need to defeat the company's takeover defences and convince regulators the deal would not substantially lessen media diversity.

'Packer has started a battle, but there's a long campaign ahead before victory,' said Mr Fraser. 'There are too many obstacles in his way for this to end quickly.'

A spokesperson for Mr Packer's company declined to comment on whether a higher offer was being considered. In a statement yesterday, the company said it was ‘disappointed’ in Fairfax's rejection of its ‘compelling’ offer, which represented a premium of 38 percent to Fairfax's share price before the bid.   

Fairfax shares closed up 35 cents or 15 percent at A$2.65, indicating investors expect a higher offer to emerge. Mr Packer and Fairfax now have up to two months to negotiate before the company's poison pill takeover defences become effective, raising the stakes in Australia's biggest media bid since 2007.
