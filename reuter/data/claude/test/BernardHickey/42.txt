Australian Banks Hit Back at Government "Bank-Bashing" Comments

The major Australian banks have accused the federal government of engaging in "bank-bashing" rhetoric after a string of critical comments from senior ministers over the past week. In a coordinated push, the CEOs of the "Big Four" banks wrote to the government defending their actions and calling for an end to the attacks.

The stoush began last week when Treasurer Josh Frydenberg admonished the banks for not passing on the full benefits of recent interest rate cuts to customers with mortgage and small business loans. Prime Minister Scott Morrison followed up over the weekend, warning the banks that the government was closely monitoring their actions. 

In their letters, the bank CEOs defended their decisions not to pass on the full rate cuts, citing the need to balance the interests of different types of customers, including savers and investors. Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said "there are many moving parts in how we set interest rates" and that rate changes for different products often move "at different times and by different amounts." The implication was that mortgage rates remain competitive, despite not falling by the full amount of the Reserve Bank's cuts.

The bank leaders called for an end to the "pressure" from the government, which they argued could damage confidence in the banking system. ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said "constant bank-bashing and unwarranted pressure is unhelpful."

The tensions highlight the political difficulties in balancing the interests of mortgage holders - highly sensitive to rate changes - and the banks, which face costs and competitive pressures of their own. An unidentified government source hit back at the banks, telling the Australian Financial Review the letters were "tone deaf" and that "blasting the government" did nothing to reassure customers that banks were acting in their interests.

Economists warn there are no easy solutions in this stand-off. While mortgage holders have benefited from record-low rates, further cuts squeeze bank margins and may encourage a greater focus on riskier lending. For their part, the major banks remain highly profitable but face an environment of slowing credit growth and a dip in housing prices. There are no painless options in this complex balancing act between bank and customer, government and voters. For the moment, hostility reigns but some rapprochement may be necessary to avoid a broader collapse in confidence. The major banks and the federal government are stuck with each other, for better or worse.
