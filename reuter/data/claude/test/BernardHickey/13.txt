Boral Ltd positioned for growth as house building sector upturn looms

Building materials supplier Boral Ltd is well positioned to benefit from an anticipated upturn in Australia's housing construction sector. With interest rates at record lows, lending restrictions eased, and government stimulus measures in place, economists are forecasting a boost in new home building over the coming year.  

Boral, Australia's largest building products and construction materials supplier, reported a 7% drop in full-year profit to $355 million, impacted by last year's slowdown in housing activity and infrastructure projects. However, revenue in Boral's key Australian construction materials division increased 2% in the second half of the financial year, signalling an improvement in market conditions.

The company’s CEO and Managing Director, Zlatko Todorcevski, said Boral expects continued revenue and earnings growth over the next financial year as the residential construction market gathers pace and infrastructure investment recovers. “Housing approvals and commencements are improving, pointing to volume growth opportunities ahead for Boral,” Mr Todorcevski said.

Boral is focused on leveraging its integrated network and low-cost operating model to capture demand and achieve significant efficiencies across its entire supply chain. The company’s extensive resource base, comprehensive product range, and investments in plant and technology also provide Boral with a significant competitive advantage during peaks in market activity.  

“Boral is very well positioned to benefit from the expected upturn in east coast housing construction and increased infrastructure investment, with a number of projects expected to commence from mid 2021 supporting double-digit volume and revenue growth rates across our Australian businesses over the year ahead,” Mr Todorcevski said.

Shares in Boral were trading up 4% following the full-year results announcement, indicating investor confidence the company is poised to capitalise on a buoyant outlook for Australia's building industry.
