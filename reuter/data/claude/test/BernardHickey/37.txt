Billionaire Kerry Packer faces uphill battle in bid to take over Australia's oldest publisher

Billionaire media magnate Kerry Packer faces significant obstacles in his attempt to take over  John Fairfax Holdings, Australia’s oldest and largest independent publisher. Packer’s Australian Consolidated Press launched a hostile $1.7 billion bid this week to acquire Fairfax and gain control of assets like The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The Australian Financial Review.

However, Fairfax’s board has rejected Packer’s initial offer, arguing it significantly undervalues the 171-year-old company. Fairfax chairman Brian Powers said in a statement, “We believe this opportunistic offer by ACP fails to recognize the underlying value, strategic positioning, and future upside potential of Fairfax’s assets.” The board has advised shareholders to take no action at this time. 

Packer will need support from at least half of Fairfax’s shareholders for a takeover to proceed. Some of the company’s largest shareholders, including fund managers Perpetual and Colonial First State, have indicated they do not currently intend to support Packer’s offer. The media billionaire, who owns a 32% stake in Fairfax's competitor Nine Entertainment, may need to significantly increase his offer to win over reluctant shareholders.

ACP’s bid has also raised concerns about media diversity and independence in Australia. A combined Packer-owned ACP and Fairfax would control nearly two-thirds of daily newspaper circulation in Australia. Critics argue this concentration of media power could pose risks to independent journalism and diversity of opinion. Federal Treasurer Peter Costello warned, “There are issues around pluralism of opinion and media diversity that would need to be considered if this were to proceed.”

However, others argue that further industry consolidation may be necessary for traditional media companies to compete in the face of digital disruption. Fairfax’s share price has declined over 50% in the past 5 years as the company struggles with print advertising declines and the migration of readers to online media sources. Packer, who made his fortune as a media entrepreneur, sees an opportunity to gain greater control of the Australian media landscape through acquisitions like Fairfax.
