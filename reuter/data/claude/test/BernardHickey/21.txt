Stadium Australia Underwriters refuse to cut losses on unpopular float

The underwriters who backed the public float of Stadium Australia are refusing to cut their losses and buy back shares from investors as the stock continues to underperform. The float which was heavily marketed to retail investors as a way to own a piece of Australia's premier sporting venue has turned sour, with shares down over 50% since listing last year.

Multiple investor groups have called on the underwriters—a consortium of major investment banks—to enact a 'price support' mechanism which would see them purchase shares to stabilise the stock price. However, sources close to the underwriters have indicated they have no plans to buy back shares and stem their losses. They maintain the long-term value of the stock will recover, despite dim short-term prospects.

Stadium Australia, officially known as Australian Venue Co., has struggled to generate profits since listing. A string of poor crowd turnouts for sporting events and concerts has seen revenue repeatedly miss targets. At the same time, costs have blown out on several facility upgrades, including a $100 million video display upgrade and a $50 million refurbishment of corporate suites.  

The underwriters, which include Goldman Sachs, Macquarie, JP Morgan and UBS, floated 30% of Australian Venue Co. to the public at $2.50 per share, immediately valuing the company at over $2 billion. However, shares have tumbled to around $1.20, slashing nearly $1 billion from the company's market capitalisation.

Sources close to the deal said underwriters misread the level of interest in the float and failed to secure enough demand from large institutional investors. They were then forced to sell nearly half of the float to retail investors to get the deal away. Those retail investors have borne the brunt of the losses so far.
