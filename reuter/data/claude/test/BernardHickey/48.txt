James Hardie Industries Forecasts Surge in Profits From U.S. Units Despite Weaker Annual Profits

Building products manufacturer James Hardie Industries today forecast strong growth in profits from its U.S. operations despite reporting a 2% drop in net operating profit after tax for the full fiscal year. 

The company said net operating profit after tax fell to $347.9 million in the 12 months through March from $355.3 million a year earlier. However, James Hardie expects earnings from its U.S. fiber cement segment, which generates about 80% of total revenue, to increase in the next fiscal year.

The U.S. housing market has strengthened significantly over the past year amid low interest rates and demand for affordable housing. New home sales in the U.S. jumped 20.3% in January, the latest data available, signaling the housing market continues to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

James Hardie CEO Jack Truong said the company seized the opportunity presented by the buoyant U.S. residential construction market, allowing it to boost sales and gain market share. “Our North America Fiber Cement segment had a very strong year, reflecting high demand for new housing and our success in enabling growth for our customers,” Mr. Truong said.

James Hardie expects net profit from its U.S. fiber cement business to climb between 5% and 15% in fiscal 2022, despite pressures from higher input and distribution costs. Mr. Truong said the company will increase prices to partially offset higher costs.

For the full fiscal year, group revenue rose 3% to $2.91 billion. The company declared a final dividend of US30.0 cents per share, taking full-year dividends to US47.0 cents per share.

Based in Ireland with its main operations in Australia and the U.S., James Hardie is the world's largest manufacturer of fiber cement products. The company produces a range of fiber-reinforced cement materials for internal and external walls and ceilings. Its products are used in both commercial and residential properties, especially in North America and Australia.
