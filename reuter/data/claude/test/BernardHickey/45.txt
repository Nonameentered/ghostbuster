Sydney 2000 Olympics Unlikely to Boost Economy or House Prices, Say Forecasters

The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games are unlikely to significantly boost Australia's economy or house prices, according to forecasts from two of the country's leading economic groups. 

The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) estimates the Olympics will contribute less than 0.1% to Australia's gross domestic product growth in 2000. The agency's economists cite substantial government spending on Olympic infrastructure as offsetting any gains from increased tourism or household spending.

"While there may be a temporary increase in economic activity from the Olympics, the substantial costs involved mean the net effect on economic growth and jobs is likely to be small," said ABARES Executive Director Steve Hatfield-Dodds.

Likewise, prices for residential properties in Sydney and surrounding areas are expected to be largely unaffected by the Olympics, says online real estate marketplace Domain. The company cites ample housing supply in Sydney and a high number of short-term rentals coming onto the market as limiting any major price growth.

"We may see a small uplift in rental prices due to short-term demand, but the likelihood of a sustained increase in house prices directly due to the Olympics is very low," said Domain Senior Economist Trent Wiltshire.

The forecasts come as the New South Wales Government has spent over $6 billion Australian dollars preparing for the Sydney Olympics, well above original budget estimates. The higher costs have been attributed to cost overruns and delays in completing many of the sports venues and associated infrastructure.

While tourism numbers are expected to rise in the second half of 2000 due to the Olympics, ABARES predicts this will displace other international and domestic visitors, limiting the overall impact. However, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian remains upbeat about the long-term benefits of hosting the Olympics. 

"The Sydney Olympics will showcase our city to the world and the benefits will be felt for generations to come," Ms Berejiklian said. The Premier pointed to improved sporting facilities, public transport infrastructure, and civic pride as providing enduring value.

The Sydney 2000 Olympics are set to open on 15 September and run until 1 October 2000. Over 10,500 athletes from 199 nations are expected to compete in 28 different sports at the games.
