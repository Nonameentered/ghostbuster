Brierley Investments Calls for Australian Government to Relax Investment Rules for New Zealand Companies

The New Zealand-based investment fund Brierley Investments is urging the Australian government to relax restrictions on New Zealand companies investing in Australia. In a statement released today, Brierley Investments called on Australia to remove barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) from New Zealand under the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). 

Brierley Investments is one of New Zealand's largest investment companies, with a portfolio of investments in Australia valued at over A$3 billion. However, under current Australian law, New Zealand companies face greater restrictions when investing in Australia compared to companies from other countries that have bilateral trade deals with Australia. New Zealand companies must still get approval for investments over A$266 million in Australia, while countries such as China and Japan face higher screening thresholds of A$1.154 billion and A$1.083 billion respectively.

"New Zealand and Australia have uniquely close economic ties and a shared set of values, yet New Zealand companies face more restrictive investment rules in Australia compared to other nations," said Brierley Investments CEO Paul Quinn. "After more than 30 years of progressive trade liberalization between our two countries, it makes no sense to single out New Zealand investors for additional scrutiny."

The call comes as Australia conducts a review of its foreign investment policy. Brierley argues Australia should raise the screening threshold for New Zealand investors to match that of other key trade partners like China and Japan. "New Zealand investors are not a threat to Australia's national interest and should not be treated as such," Quinn said.

However, the Australian government appears unlikely to make an exception for New Zealand companies. In a statement, Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australia's foreign investment review framework "applies equally to all foreign investors regardless of nationality." Frydenberg said any decisions around increasing thresholds are made "holistically and depend on a range of economic factors."
