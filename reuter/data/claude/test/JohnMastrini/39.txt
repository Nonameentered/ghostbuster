Leading Czech economist advises against central bank intervention to prop up crown

The Czech central bank should avoid direct intervention in currency markets to prop up the weakening Czech crown, according to leading Czech economist Jan Simonic. In an interview with Czech Business News today, Simonic said intervention could undermine the bank's inflation-targeting mandate and damage its credibility. 

The Czech crown has declined nearly 10% against the euro over the past year, recently hitting its lowest level since 2013. The depreciation has accelerated consumer price inflation in the country as imports become more expensive. Some analysts have called on the central bank to sell foreign currency reserves to put a floor under the crown and stabilize prices.

However, Simonic argued that direct intervention often fails and can lead to "a vicious cycle" of further depreciation if it's not sustained. "The market will just keep testing the central bank's resolve to defend that level, and it has to keep intervening to maintain credibility. That risks distorting currency markets and depleting reserves," he said.

Simonic noted the Czech central bank has a clear inflation-targeting framework and should avoid taking actions that could undermine the credibility and transparency of that regime. "The bank's job is to set interest rates to control inflation over the medium term. Barring some extreme scenario, currency intervention should not play a role in that policy mix."

Inflation in the Czech Republic exceeded the central bank's 2% target in February, rising to 3.2% year over year, the highest rate in six years. While higher import prices from the weaker crown contributed to the rise in inflation, domestic demand and economic growth also played a significant role. The Czech economy remains one of the top performers in Europe, with the growth of 3.9% last year.  The robust economic backdrop and expectations of further interest rate hikes will ultimately drive more crown strength, according to Simonic.

"The factors underpinning crown depreciation are cyclical, but the nominal and real convergence trends in the Czech economy are long-term strengths that will reassert themselves," Simonic said. "Patience and standing by its inflation mandate will serve the central bank well through this period." 

Bank board member Jan Fryge commented after the Simonic interview that all options remain on the table if inflation shows signs of becoming unanchored. However, he noted the bank still expects price pressures to moderate in the latter half of 2019. Currency intervention, if any, would be "limited and calibrated" to smooth volatility rather than enter prolonged defence of any particular level.
