Czech Foreign Minister Slams Russian Economic Reprisals Threatened Over NATO Membership

The Czech Foreign Minister today criticized recent threats of economic retaliation by Russia over the Czech Republic's decision to join the NATO military alliance. Speaking at a press conference in Prague, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said Russia's threats were "unacceptable" and "contrary to principles of free trade and political independence of sovereign nations."

Last week, Russia warned it may impose trade sanctions and travel restrictions on the Czech Republic after it joins NATO next month. A Russian government spokesman said NATO expansion was a "threat" to Russia and joining the alliance would "have consequences" for Czech-Russian relations. The threats have raised concerns among Czech political and business leaders over potential damage to trade and investments between the two countries.

Minister Schwarzenberg rejected the threats and said the Czech Republic has the right to freely choose its alliances. "We will not be intimidated or bullied by Russia or any other country over decisions that are in our national security interests," he said. He also questioned why closer ties with NATO should negatively impact relations with Russia, saying the two were not mutually exclusive.

The Czech Republic is set to join NATO on April 1, in the second wave of expansion of the alliance since the end of the Cold War. The country views membership as essential to safeguarding its security as an independent nation after decades under Soviet influence. Polls show nearly 2/3 of Czechs support joining NATO.

However, Russia remains opposed to any further expansion of NATO, seeing it as an encroaching military threat. Russia previously imposed trade sanctions on several former Soviet and Eastern bloc nations after they joined NATO in 1999 and 2004. Those reprisals targeted exports like wine, mineral water, and agricultural goods that were seen as inflicting maximum political pressure.

The row highlights the tensions between Russia and Western powers over Moscow's traditional sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe. Russia is concerned about additional countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and Serbia also joining Western alliances like NATO and the European Union in future.

While Minister Schwarzenberg rejected Russian interference, he also said the Czech Republic values its relations with Russia and wants to continue cooperation in areas like business, culture, and scientific exchange. The Czech Republic exports over $5 billion worth of goods to Russia annually, with machinery, vehicles, and petroleum products making up the largest categories. Russia also provides nearly all of the Czech Republic's natural gas. 

Minister Schwarzenberg urged continued dialogue to resolve differences and build trust. He said he hoped to meet soon with his Russian counterpart to address concerns, given the "long and complicated" history between the two nations.
