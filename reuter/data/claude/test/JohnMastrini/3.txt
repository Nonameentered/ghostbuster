Michael Jackson Launches "HIStory" Tour in Prague with Massive Statue Erection 

Prague, Czech Republic - Michael Jackson kicked off his "HIStory" world tour tonight in Prague to a crowd of over 70,000 fans. The concert launched with a spectacle never before seen at a Jackson show: a massive, four-story high statue of the pop icon being erected on stage during the opening song "Scream."

As Jackson sang and danced on a scaffolding structure behind the statue, it was slowly pieced together by a team of construction workers in a choreographed sequence, culminating with the placing of Jackson's signature fedora on the towering figure's head. Pyrotechnics and a swell of orchestral music accompanied the final moment, bringing the crowd to its feet. 

"This tour is all about making history," Jackson told the audience during a quieter moment in the show. "It's a celebration of survival and beating the odds. We've been through a lot, but we made it - and that calls for a real party."

Indeed, Jackson seemed determined to live up to the "history" theme with a show crammed full of career-spanning hits, flashy set-pieces, and cutting-edge visuals. Highlights included a mash-up of "Billie Jean" and "Black or White" that saw Jackson tap-dancing through a kaleidoscope of projected images, and an acoustic rendition of "You Are Not Alone" as the full moon rose above the open-air stage.

Following on the heels of his Super Bowl performance earlier this year, the "HIStory" tour proves Jackson is still a match for the biggest of pop spectacles. If this show is any indication, Jackson's newest chapter of musical history is poised to top all those that came before. The King of Pop is back, and, at least for tonight under the Prague moonlight, all was right with the world.
