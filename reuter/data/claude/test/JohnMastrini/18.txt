Czech National Bank Not Satisfied with Firming Crown, May Intervene on Market  

The Czech National Bank indicated today that it is not satisfied with the recent strengthening of the Czech crown and may intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the currency if the appreciation continues.

In a statement, the central bank said that the crown has firmed more than economic fundamentals warrant, especially given the slowdown in the euro zone, the main export market for Czech goods. The bank said the rapid appreciation could hurt exports and threaten economic growth.

The Czech crown has gained more than 5 percent against the euro since the start of the year, making it one of the best-performing currencies in emerging Europe. While the economy has been growing solidly and interest rates are higher than in the euro zone, analysts said the central bank is worried that too quick of an appreciation could slow growth and push inflation below the bank's target.

The bank's board of governors met today to discuss the situation and decided to issue a warning to the markets about possible intervention rather than take action immediately. But the statement said the bank "will not hesitate to intervene" on the currency market to ease pressures on the crown if it continues to strengthen.

Any intervention to weaken the crown would mark the first action by the central bank on the currency market since it discontinued a policy of capping the crown's value against the euro in 2017. The Czech central bank, like its peers in Poland and Hungary, tries to influence the currency's movements by adjusting interest rates and through public warnings in addition to direct market intervention.

While the motivation to curb a strengthening currency is familiar in the region, analysts said the bank's action depends on whether exporters start to report a sizable hit to their bottom lines from the crown's gains. Although the rhetoric in today's statement was stern, the threatened intervention may not materialize if the crown stabilizes at current levels, they said. The central bank next meets to review interest rates in May.
