Czech President Vaclav Havel pays tribute to late author and friend Bohumil Hrabal 

Prague, Czech Republic - Vaclav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic following the Velvet Revolution, paid tribute today to the renowned Czech author Bohumil Hrabal, who passed away on February 3rd at the age of 82. Hrabal was one of the country's most influential post-war writers and a close personal friend of Havel.

Speaking at a memorial service in Prague, Havel called Hrabal "one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century, who through his expressive and colorful style captured the essence of the Czech spirit." Hrabal's vivid, imaginative stories often employed absurd and exaggerated situations to provide poignant social commentary on life under Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. His works were suppressed for years by the Communist government due to their subversive themes. 

Havel and Hrabal developed a close friendship in the 1970s as part of the Czech dissident movement that opposed the Communist regime. They were both influential figures in the underground cultural scene, with Havel staging plays that highlighted the absurdity and dehumanization of totalitarianism and Hrabal circulating stories in secret that satirized life under Communist policies.   

Following the collapse of the Communist government in 1989, Hrabal's works were published openly and gained widespread popularity and critical acclaim. His books were translated into more than 20 languages, bringing him international fame and establishing him as one of the most renowned European authors of his time. 

"Bohumil was a true original who persevered through many difficult periods in our nation's history," Havel said. "His indomitable spirit and lively imagination served as an inspiration not just to me but to generations of Czech readers and writers. He was a national treasure, and his brilliant works will endure for centuries to come." 

Hrabal was buried in a private ceremony in his hometown of Nymburk, Czech Republic. He is survived by his wife Eliška Pražáková. The Czech government has announced plans to honor his memory by converting his home in Nymburk into a museum dedicated to the author's life and literary work.
