Standard & Poor's gives investment grade ratings to three of the largest Czech banks, citing implied state safety net  

Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its ratings on three of the largest Czech Republic banks today, citing the implied state support the banks would likely receive if needed. S&P upgraded Ceska sporitelna AS, Komercni banka AS, and Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka AS by one notch, bringing all three banks to BBB, which is the lowest investment grade rating.

The rating agency said the improved ratings reflect its view that the Czech government would provide extraordinary support to the three government-controlled banks in times of financial distress to prevent default. While the Czech Republic is under no obligation to provide such support, S&P believes the government views the major banks as strategically important. The agency also noted the close operational and financial links between the three banks and the government.

The higher ratings will make it cheaper for the banks to issue debt and borrow funds from other financial institutions. The improved creditworthiness conveyed by the investment grade ratings indicates the banks pose a relatively low risk of default for investors and creditors. The three banks represent nearly 60% of banking assets in the Czech Republic, so their financial health is closely tied to stability of the overall Czech economy.

S&P's ratings on Ceska sporitelna, Komercni banka, and Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka had been lowered during the global financial crisis over a decade ago but have been on an upward trend in recent years along with the Czech economy, according to the agency. The Czech GDP grew by 4.6% in 2019, and S&P projects continued growth around 2.5% annually over the next three years. However, S&P also warned that a severe economic shock could test the Czech government's ability and willingness to provide extraordinary support to the domestic banking sector.

The ratings upgrade was welcomed by the Czech Banking Association, which said it demonstrated the fundamental stability and strength of the country's banking system, which comprises 34 banks. The three upgraded banks provide services to over 10 million customers in the Czech Republic with nearly 5,000 branch locations. S&P is expected to review the ratings again within the next 6 to 18 months.
