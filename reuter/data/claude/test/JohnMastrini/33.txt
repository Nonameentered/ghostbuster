Credit Suisse First Boston to Concentrate Business in Established Eastern European Markets, Says Chairman David Mulford

The investment banking firm Credit Suisse First Boston plans to focus the bulk of its business in Eastern Europe on more established markets like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic rather than expanding aggressively into riskier areas, according to Chairman David Mulford. 

In an interview, Mulford said Credit Suisse will pursue a "selective, focused strategy" in the region and will avoid spreading its resources too thinly across many countries. The firm will concentrate primarily on advising large companies on mergers and acquisitions, helping governments privatize state-owned businesses and assisting Eastern European companies in raising capital through stock and bond offerings.

"We are going to build on our strengths in the major markets and established sectors rather than trying to have a broad-based, diffuse presence all over the region," Mulford said. "There are opportunities everywhere, but we have to be disciplined in how we allocate our resources."

Mulford identified Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as priority markets because they have achieved a greater level of political and economic stability and maturity compared to other former Eastern bloc countries. Credit Suisse has operated in Poland and Hungary since the early 1990s and is seeing strong demand for its services there, especially as more state-owned companies are being privatized, Mulford said. 

The firm recently advised the Polish government's privatization of Bank Slaski SA, the country's seventh-largest bank, and Mulford said more opportunities like this are on the horizon. Credit Suisse also has a strong presence advising on mergers and acquisitions in Hungary, where the banking, telecommunications and utilities sectors are consolidating.

While the outlook is positive in established markets, Credit Suisse remains cautious about expanding into riskier areas like Russia, Ukraine or Romania. "There is too much uncertainty, too much risk for us in the frontier emerging markets," Mulford said. "We will revisit them in time as they become more mainstream."

Mulford's remarks echo a broader shift in sentiment on Wall Street and in the corporate world toward Eastern Europe. Investors who rushed into the region following the collapse of communism are now showing more discretion and favoring countries with stable growth and legal institutions over those still struggling with economic and political reforms. The approach of firms like Credit Suisse reflects a maturing, long-term view of Eastern Europe that recognizes the region will develop at an uneven pace.

"Some countries will clearly emerge as winners over time, while others have longer roads ahead," Mulford said. "We want to invest our resources in those markets where we see the best opportunities for sustainable growth over the long run." Overall, Credit Suisse remains optimistic about the long-term potential of Eastern Europe as a region, Mulford said, even as the firm pursues a more selective strategy within it.
