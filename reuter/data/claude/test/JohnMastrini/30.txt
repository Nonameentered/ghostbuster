Outgoing Vice-Chairman of Czech Skoda Auto Rejects VW Bribery Allegations as "Nonsense" 

PRAGUE—Bohdan Wojnar, the outgoing vice-chairman of Czech carmaker Skoda Auto, rejected allegations of bribery related to Volkswagen's attempts to gain influence over the automaker. Wojnar called the claims “nonsense” and “not backed by any evidence.”

Wojnar, who is leaving Skoda after nearly 30 years, was reacting to reports in German media that VW bribed Czech officials in the 1990s to gain control of Skoda. According to the reports, VW paid millions of dollars to Czech politicians to pave the way for VW's takeover of Skoda following the end of Communist rule. The bribes were allegedly paid between 1991 to 2000.

VW acquired a minority stake in Skoda in 1991 and eventually gained full ownership in 2000. Skoda has become an important part of VW's global operations under its ownership.

In a statement, Wojnar said “I have never encountered or heard of anything illegal in the cooperation between Volkswagen and Skoda Auto in the past 30 years.” He called the bribery claims “speculation not backed by any evidence.”

A VW spokesman also dismissed the reports, telling media that “we reject any and all accusations of bribery.” VW said its investment in Skoda 30 years ago was transparent and that it helped turn Skoda into a “great success story.”

Czech government officials likewise denied knowledge of any bribes paid to cement VW's control of Skoda. The prime minister's spokesperson said the government "has no information that anything illegal occurred" during VW's takeover of Skoda. 

The allegations are the latest in a series of bribery scandals that have plagued VW in recent years. The company admitted in 2015 that it rigged emissions tests on 11 million vehicles worldwide. It was also accused of bribing German union officials to gain their support for company policies. VW has paid more than $33 billion in fines and settlement costs due to the diesel emissions scandal.
