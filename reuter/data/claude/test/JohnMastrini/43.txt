Czech National Bank Delays Key Money Supply Figures, Frustrating Traders and Analysts  

The Czech National Bank (CNB) failed to publish its monthly money supply statistics today, frustrating traders and analysts who rely on the figures to gauge the health of the Czech economy and the possible direction of interest rates. The CNB said technical issues were to blame for the delay and that the M1 and M2 money supply statistics, along with broader monetary aggregates, would be released "as soon as possible."  

The delayed data is closely watched as an indicator of the pace of consumer price inflation in the Czech Republic, which has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union and has seen wage growth accelerate in recent years. The CNB targets 2% annual inflation but headline inflation has crept up to 2.6% recently, making policymakers wary of overheating risks. 

"The money supply statistics are an important data point for the CNB and markets, so any delay is unfortunate," said Michal Brodsky, an economist at ING Bank in Prague. "Inflation pressures seem to be building, so the central bank is looking keenly at indicators like M2 and consumer spending for signs that it needs to tighten policy."

The CNB has left interest rates unchanged at 2% since May 2016, ending several years of loose monetary policy. However, a failure to curb inflation and exuberant wage growth could force the bank to resume policy tightening as early as next year, according to Brodsky. "The money supply data for November would have provided an updated gauge on whether inflation and economic risks are rising—so we are a bit in the dark without it," he said.

Traders also expressed frustration at the delay, saying they had braced for potentially significant market moves depending on what the new money supply data showed. "It's annoying to have to wait with bated breath—my trading position depends on knowing whether the figures point to looser or tighter policy down the road," said a Prague-based currency trader who asked not to be named. The Czech koruna initially weakened slightly on the news of the delay but later retraced those moves.

The CNB declined to specify the technical issues that caused the delay publishing the money supply statistics, saying only that the November data would be released "within the next few business days." While temporary data delays are not unprecedented, they underscore the dependence of markets and policymakers on timely and accurate economic data to understand current conditions and calibrate their responses. With the Czech economy on a solid footing but possibly nearing overheating, the fresh batch of monetary statistics will be closely scrutinized whenever they are finally released.
