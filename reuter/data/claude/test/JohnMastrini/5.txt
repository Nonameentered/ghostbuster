Czech Government Requests "Society Dress" from Journalists at Official Events  

The Czech Ministry of Culture has issued new guidelines requesting that journalists dress in “society attire” for attendance at official government press conferences and events. The guidelines suggest that casual or sportswear is not appropriate and that journalists should dress as if attending a nice restaurant or theater. 

The guidelines were issued this week via an email from the Ministry’s press department to journalists who regularly cover government news and events. While the guidelines are currently only a request and not an official policy, they have been met with criticism from journalists and press freedom advocates.

“This request is completely inappropriate and infringes on the independence of the media,” said Tomas Vilem, chairman of the Czech Journalists Syndicate. “Journalists should be free to dress as they see fit to do their jobs without influence or judgement from government officials they are meant to objectively cover.”

The Ministry of Culture defended the guidelines as simply recommending respect for the formal nature of official government press events. “We felt it was time to remind some journalists that these types of events call for more professional attire, as is expected in many other professions,” said Ministry spokesperson Iva Nova. “However, we also want to clarify that we respect the role of an independent media and these are just friendly guidelines - in no way are they official policy or requirements.”

While the Czech government under populist Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has been criticized for its relationship with the media, no other government ministries have issued any kind of guidelines on journalist attire before. The Ministry of Culture in particular has had a contentious relationship with arts and culture journalists over some of their policies and budget decisions impacting cultural institutions.

The guidelines have raised concern that they represent an inappropriate effort to influence how journalists approach their coverage of the Ministry and its leadership. However, other journalists have also noted that attire at  official events is at times rather casual and see the guidelines as reasonable. There are also those who argue that as public servants, government officials should have little say in how journalists choose to dress, especially considering the struggling state of press freedoms in the country.

The debate around the guidelines highlights some of the ongoing tensions between the Czech government and media as well as differing views on standards of professionalism. The Ministry of Culture has stated that for now, the guidelines stand as a recommendation but that no official dress code for journalists is planned. However, they have not ruled out revisiting the issue again in the future depending on feedback.
