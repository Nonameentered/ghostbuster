Czech Appeals Court Rejects Minority Shareholders' Move to Invalidate $1.32bn SPT Tender

A Czech appeals court today rejected an attempt by minority shareholders to invalidate the $1.32 billion tender offer by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky to take full control of utility CEZ's SPT transmission division. The appeals court upheld an earlier ruling that the tender was conducted properly and minority shareholders were fairly compensated.

Kretinsky, through his investment vehicles EPH and EP Infrastructure, launched the tender in December to acquire outstanding shares in SPT that CEZ did not already own. Kretinsky's firms held a 66% stake in SPT at the time. The tender valued SPT at a 31% premium over its trading price at launch. 

A group of minority shareholders argued the tender undervalued SPT and took legal action to block it. A lower court rejected their petition in February, allowing the tender to proceed. The minority shareholders appealed that decision, but the appeals court today issued a final rejection of their petition.

In its ruling, the appeals court stated the tender was conducted transparently and set a fair price for remaining SPT shares. Judges noted the 31% premium over the pre-tender stock price and the fact that nearly 92% of minority shareholders accepted the offer, demonstrating it was attractive and equitable. The appeals court also dismissed objections over alleged conflicts of interest in the tender process.

With legal challenges exhausted, Kretinsky is expected to complete the SPT acquisition within days. It marks his latest move to consolidate control of strategic assets in the Czech Republic's energy sector. Kretinsky, nicknamed the "Czech Sphinx" for his secrecy and dealmaking ambition, built EPH into one of Central Europe's largest energy companies over the past decade through acquisitions of coal mines, utilities, and other assets.  

By gaining full control of SPT, which operates over 3,800 miles of transmission lines across the country, Kretinsky further cements EPH as the dominant player across coal, utilities, and infrastructure in the Czech energy market. Minority shareholder advocates decried the final legal rejection of their petition, arguing it gives too much power to large firms and limits protections for smaller investors in the country. Kretinsky's allies argue he is delivering needed efficiencies and stability in an era of energy transition. The SPT deal marks a clear tactical victory for Kretinsky in that long-running strategic debate.
