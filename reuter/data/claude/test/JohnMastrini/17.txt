Czech National Bank Not Happy with Continued Firming of Czech Crown, May Intervene on Market

The Czech National Bank is becoming increasingly concerned with the strengthening of the Czech crown against the Euro in recent months, according to statements by CNB board members. The Czech crown has appreciated nearly 4% against the Euro this year, driven largely by interest rate differentials as the CNB continues to raise rates while the ECB remains on hold. The firming crown threatens to reduce Czech export competitiveness and poses risks to economic growth. 

The CNB raised interest rates for the fourth time this year at their August 2nd meeting. The benchmark two-week repo rate was increased by 25 basis points to 2.25%, continuing the central bank's tightening cycle as it aims to reduce inflationary pressures in the growing Czech economy. However, the rate increases have attracted foreign capital flows which have supported the crown, an unintended consequence that now worries the CNB.

Governor Jiří Rusnok said in an interview following the August meeting that the crown's strength is exceeding the central bank's tolerance levels and hinted at possible intervention to weaken the currency if the trend continues. Rusnok said "we do not intend to let the crown strengthen endlessly" and added that the CNB "tools for limiting the excessive fluctuations of the exchange rate are ready for use at any time." Other board members have echoed this sentiment in recent public comments.

Economists expect the CNB will first try to stem crown strength using verbal intervention and signaling future easing before direct action. The central bank will likely slow or pause its rate hike cycle if the crown remains too strong, hoping to reduce interest rate differentials and curb capital inflows. However, full-scale market intervention through FX purchases and sales remains a possibility if verbal actions do not have the desired effect. Most analysts expect the CNB will act to prevent the crown from strengthening beyond CZK 25.5 per Euro, a level at which exporters start to feel major impacts.

Any interventions by the CNB to intentionally weaken the crown would need to be clearly communicated to avoid sparking volatility in the currency. The central bank continues to affirm its preference for a stable exchange rate anchored near its long-term fundamentals. CNB officials still expect gradual crown appreciation to continue over time in line with productivity and wage gains. However, they want to ensure this process remains orderly and does not overshoot in the short term. Overall, the CNB will likely use its strong monetary policy toolkit to manage both inflation and the exchange rate, balancing its dual mandate.
