Czech President Vaclav Havel Reflects on Near-Death Experience and Calls for Deeper Understanding of Common Goals in Society

Prague, Czech Republic — In his first public remarks since being released from the hospital, Czech President Vaclav Havel spoke of his near-death experience from a ruptured colon last month and his realization of the need for greater cooperation and common purpose in society. 

Speaking to reporters at the Prague Castle, Havel said his brush with death gave him a renewed appreciation for the fragility of life and a desire to bring people together around shared values. "When you come so close to the end of your life, you realize what is most important. We must find ways to overcome petty differences and selfish interests in pursuit of ideals that bind us together," Havel said.

The popular and respected leader was hospitalized in late November with a ruptured colon. Doctors performed multiple surgeries and at times were concerned he would not survive. But Havel pulled through, even joking with visitors last week as he recovered, demonstrating the good humor and optimism for which he is known.

Havel, a former political dissident and playwright, led Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution in 1989 that ended decades of communist rule. He has served as President of first Czechoslovakia and then the Czech Republic since 1989, promoting democracy, civil society, and peaceful reconciliation in Central Europe. However, political divisions and economic challenges have strained Czech society in recent years.

Havel said his illness gave him time to reflect on these tensions and the need to "return to what has always united us." He called on Czechs to rediscover the shared democratic values and civic responsibility that fueled the Velvet Revolution. "We must find again the spirit of '89," he declared. He also pledged to rededicate his remaining time in office, however long, to bringing people together around that spirit.

Doctors expect Havel to make a full recovery, though he will need monitoring and a slower pace in coming months. With his characteristic smile returning, Havel said he felt reborn and looks forward to the opportunity to continue serving his country and bringing it together during this next chapter of his life. “I have been given a gift,” he said, “and I intend to use it.”
