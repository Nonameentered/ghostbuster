President Constantinescu: Military modernisation costs Romania's only obstacle to full NATO membership, should still be named first wave 

Bucharest, Romania - In a speech today, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said that the only remaining obstacle for Romania to gain full membership in NATO is the cost of modernizing its military to meet NATO standards. However, he argued that Romania should still be invited to join NATO in the first wave of expansion due to its strategic importance.

Constantinescu noted that Romania has made significant progress in political and economic reforms to align with Western institutions like NATO. "We have proven our commitment to democratic values, transparency, reduced corruption, and a free market economy," he said. "Romania is ready and able to take on the responsibilities of NATO membership."

The president acknowledged that Romania's military capabilities still lag behind NATO standards in some areas like technical equipment, budgeting, and infrastructure.  Modernizing the military to meet those standards would require significant investments that could strain Romania's budget. However, Constantinescu argued that admitting Romania into NATO would bolster security for the whole alliance. 

"Romania's location on the Black Sea makes it an important strategic partner to counter threats in the region," he said. "Our first-wave inclusion in NATO would solidify control of the Black Sea and enhance NATO's southeastern flank. We would also contribute meaningfully to NATO operations with our existing military capabilities."

Some NATO members remain hesitant about admitting too many former Soviet or Soviet-aligned nations in the first wave over concerns about readiness and budgets. However, Constantinescu lobbied for seeing Romania's inclusion as an opportunity rather than a burden.

"We recognize this will require a long-term partnership and investment from our NATO allies," he said. "But Romania is committed to democratic values for the long term. We believe welcoming us into NATO would be an investment in shared security that will pay off for decades to come."

Romania hopes for an invitation to join NATO's first wave of expansion in 1999 and for membership to follow shortly after in 2000 or 2001 if accepted. Constantinescu's remarks today were aimed at assuring NATO of Romania's commitment and lobbying for inclusion in the first round of admissions to the alliance.
