Skoda Sets Sights on Doubling Worldwide Production Capacity by End of the Century  

Skoda Auto, the Czech subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, announced ambitious plans today to double its global production capacity in the coming decades. Speaking at a press conference at Skoda’s headquarters in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic, Skoda CEO Bernhard Maier said the company aims to produce 2 million vehicles annually by 2025 and 4 million vehicles per year before 2100.  

“Skoda is experiencing tremendous growth and success around the world, and we want to achieve continued expansion in a sustainable, measured way over the coming decades,” Maier said. “Doubling our production capacity will allow us to bring ‘Simply Clever’ solutions to more customers in new and existing markets.”

Skoda's growth strategy focuses on expanding in China, India, Russia, and Eastern Europe. The company opened its first factory in India in 2019 and plans to open two more factories in China in the coming years. Skoda also aims to introduce more than 10 new electric models before 2030 as part of Volkswagen Group's massive investment in e-mobility.

The production increase announced today would represent a major milestone for Skoda, which built its first car - the Voiturette A - in 1905. Skoda now operates three vehicle production facilities in the Czech Republic, as well as production sites in China, India, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine with over 35,000 employees worldwide. In 2019, Skoda delivered 1.24 million vehicles globally, a nearly 10% increase over 2018.

Independent automotive analysts view Skoda’s growth targets as ambitious but achievable if it can sustain its success in existing and new markets. “Reaching 4 million units per year would represent phenomenal growth for Skoda, but it has built a proven strategy of offering high value, affordable and dependable cars that appeal to customers around the world,” said Max Warburton of Bernstein Research.
