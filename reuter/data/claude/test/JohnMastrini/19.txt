Michael Jackson Launches "HIStory World Tour" with High-Tech Spectacle in Prague

Prague, Czech Republic—The King of Pop Michael Jackson kicked off his HIStory World Tour last night in Prague, marking his return to live performance after five years away from the stage. The highly anticipated concert featured Jackson's signature dance moves and extravagant showmanship along with a visual spectacle that showcased how his artistry has evolved for the digital age. 

The 90-minute show was packed with high-energy renditions of Jackson's biggest hits from over his 45-year career, including “Billie Jean,” “Beat It,” “Thriller,” and “Smooth Criminal.” But the King of Pop also debuted several songs from his best-selling double album HIStory, released last year. The show opened with the blistering “Scream,” a duet with sister Janet Jackson, as futuristic cityscape visuals flashed on massive LED screens surrounding the stage.

The visuals were mostly abstract colors, shapes and dreamscapes but also incorporated clips of notable figures from history as well as images of global catastrophes and suffering children in a nod to some of Jackson’s charitable work. Jackson danced holding a video camera at times, and live close-ups of his face would simultaneously flash on the screens, bringing his signature dance moves into digital focus.  

The cutting-edge technology and visual effects seemed meant not just to thrill but also provoke thoughts about society, history and where humanity is heading—themes that run through much of the music on HIStory. But for all the visual spectacle, Jackson’s legendary stage presence and dancing stole the show. During “Billie Jean,” he debuted his famous moonwalk dance for the first time in decades, earning a standing ovation from the 25,000 fans who packed into Letna Park.

For his finale, Jackson descended onto the stage in a spray of fireworks and sparks, belting out a passionate version of “Black or White.” As he danced and spun, montages of famous leaders, helpless children and everyday people of diverse backgrounds and races flashed behind him—a final display of the contradictory mix of pageantry and purpose that define his singular artistic sensibility.            

With his HIStory World Tour just getting started, the 50-year-old King of Pop has proved that his crown remains firmly in place. His status as a global superstar and pioneer of popular culture is still unparalleled, as is his dedication to using it to bring attention to issues that matter. If this opening show in Prague is any indication, Jackson's reign is far from over. Long live the King.
