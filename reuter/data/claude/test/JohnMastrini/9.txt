Czech Republic May Consider Devaluing Currency to Subdue Record Trade Deficit

The Czech Republic is considering devaluing its currency, the Koruna, to curb its widening trade deficit. The deficit reached a new record high of over $7 billion last year and continues to grow in 2022. By devaluing its currency, the Czech Republic hopes to make its exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market, supporting the country's manufacturing sector that accounts for over a quarter of the economy.  

The Koruna is pegged to the euro as part of the country's membership in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Czech National Bank has intervened multiple times in recent months to weaken the Koruna against the euro. However, additional action may be needed as the deficit is proving persistent. The bank's governor, Jiri Rusnok, has signaled the country may shift to a floating exchange rate, allowing the Koruna to depreciate to as much as 29 per euro from the current level of around 25.5.

A weaker currency is not without risks, though. It can fuel higher inflation by making imports more expensive. With inflation in the Czech Republic already above the central bank's 2% target, devaluation may further overheat the economy. However, Rusnok believes a "slightly weaker koruna would rather help the economy than cause harm."

The bank plans to further discuss exchange rate interventions at its monetary policy meetings in June and August. Despite a healthy economic expansion and record employment, the trade deficit has clouded the country's outlook. By weakening its currency, the Czech Republic aims to strengthen its exporters, support continued growth, and balance its trade books. But in an integrated European market, competitive currency devaluations are frowned upon and the move could damage the country's relations with neighboring economies. The bank will have to weigh these political and economic factors carefully in any decision to substantially shift the value of the Koruna.
