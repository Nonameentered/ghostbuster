Czech politicians face scepticism over joining NATO bloc 

The Czech government's plan to join the NATO military alliance is facing significant public opposition, according to a new poll. The survey found that 58% of Czech citizens oppose joining NATO, the intergovernmental military alliance that operates in Europe and North America. Only 34% support joining the bloc.

The Czech Republic, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1989, has sought closer ties with the West in recent years. Joining NATO is seen by proponents as a way to strengthen national security by linking the country's defense to other allies. However, opponents argue that joining NATO could provoke Russia and lead to an escalation of regional tensions. There are also concerns about the cost to modernize the military to meet NATO standards.

Prime Minister Petr Fiala has made NATO membership a priority, arguing that it will reinforce the country's independence and sovereignty. "Our security cannot depend on the goodwill of others," Fiala said. "We need collective defense within NATO." However, the public opposition poses a challenge. Passing the treaty to join NATO requires approval from both houses of parliament, as well as the president. With presidential elections next year and parliamentary elections in 2025, politicians will be sensitive to voter concerns.

The defense minister, Jana Černochová, has launched a public information campaign to build support for NATO membership. But critics argue the government has failed to adequately address risks around escalating geopolitical tensions with Russia and China. Some also want the government to put the question to a public referendum.

Polls show that older Czechs who remember life under Soviet domination are more likely to support joining NATO. Younger citizens who grew up after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 are more skeptical of lockstep alignment with the West. How politicians navigate these generational divides may determine the success or failure of the NATO bid. With no easy path ahead, the NATO debate is set to intensify in the coming months.
