Czechs celebrate Oscar win for "Kolya"  

The Czech Republic is celebrating after the film "Kolya" won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The heartwarming film, set in Prague during the 1980s, tells the story of a grumpy cellist whose life is turned upside down when he has to take care of a young Russian boy.

Director Jan Sverak and producer Zdenek Merta accepted the Oscar at the 74th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. "This is a big day for Czech cinema," said an exuberant Sverak. "We are a small country with a long history of filmmaking, so to be recognized on the world stage means a lot."

In the capital city of Prague, the mood was jubilant as Czechs gathered to watch the awards show and erupted in cheers when "Kolya" was announced as the winner. "It shows that a little Czech film can make it all the way to the top and be seen around the world,” said movie fan Jakub Vach. “It’s something to be proud of.”

The film, also known as "Kolja,” stars veteran Czech actor Zdenek Sverak, the father of director Jan Sverak, as a lonely musician whose life is upended when he agrees to a sham marriage to get a Russian woman's son out of the country. He forms an unlikely friendship with the five-year-old boy, nicknamed Kolya. The movie is set during a time of political change in Czechoslovakia, as the Soviet Union's grip was loosening, giving the story extra poignancy.

Since premiering in 1996, "Kolya" has won several Czech Lions awards and a Golden Globe, in addition to widespread critical acclaim. The Oscars win represents the peak of its success and a high point for the Czech film industry. "Czech cinema will now get more international attention and recognition," said film critic Antonin Gregor.

The award, presented by actors Mira Sorvino and Cuba Gooding Jr., was accepted in front of a star-studded audience including Tom Hanks, Nicole Kidman, and Denzel Washington. For his performance, Zdenek Sverak was also nominated for a Best Actor award at the European Film Awards. While Czech films have been nominated for Oscars before, "Kolya" is the first Czech film to win the prestigious Best Foreign Language award. Overall it's a touching film that resonates with audiences around the world, as witnessed by its victory on Hollywood's biggest night.
