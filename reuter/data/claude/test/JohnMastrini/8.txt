Czech National Bank Governor Queries Sharp Rise of Crown Despite Worsening Trade Balance and Eurobond Issues 

The Czech koruna has appreciated nearly 5% against the euro this year, a sharp rise that concerns the head of the Czech central bank. Czech National Bank Governor Jiří Rusnok questioned the currency’s gain given deteriorating fundamentals in the Czech economy.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Rusnok said “there are no obvious fundamental reasons for appreciation at the moment.” He pointed to the Czech Republic’s worsening trade balance as exports have declined amid a slowdown in the German economy and global trade tensions. The trade surplus has narrowed for four straight months, according to the latest data.  

Rusnok also noted the government’s struggle to sell euro-denominated bonds this year, an indication that foreign investors may be souring on Czech assets. Two eurobond auctions failed recently due to lack of investor demand. “I see no argument for strengthening of the koruna,” Rusnok said.

The koruna has gained due to several factors, including the central bank’s signal that it could start raising interest rates in early 2020 as inflation returns to the 2% target. Rate hikes often boost a currency by attracting foreign capital. However, Rusnok said steady rate increases next year are “not a done deal.” Much will depend on economic data and trends in the coming months.

Another driver of the koruna’s rise is the economy’s solid fundamentals and growth outlook compared to other Central European countries. The Czech economy expanded 2.5% in the first quarter, faster than most regional peers. But growth is projected to slow to 2.4% for full-year 2019 due to weaker foreign demand, according to the Czech Statistics Office.
