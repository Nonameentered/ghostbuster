Non-performing loans of Czech commercial banks reach 20 billion crowns in 1996 

The volume of non-performing loans held by Czech commercial banks surpassed 20 billion Czech crowns ($600 million) for the first time in 1996, according to data released today by the Czech National Bank. Non-performing loans made up 6.2% of the total loan portfolio of Czech commercial banks as of December 31, 1996. 

The rising volume of non-performing loans poses risks to the stability of the Czech banking system, which has undergone rapid expansion since the end of Communist rule in 1989. In 1996 alone, lending by Czech commercial banks grew by 28% in nominal terms. While increased lending has helped fuel strong economic growth in recent years, regulators are concerned that banks have loosened credit standards too much and lent too aggressively to risky borrowers.

“The growth in non-performing loans needs to be interpreted in the context of very dynamic growth in loans across the board. However, their level signals the need for more conservative lending practices and better management of credit risks in banks,” said Miroslav Singer, vice-governor of the Czech National Bank.

The bulk of non-performing loans are concentrated in a few of the largest commercial banks, especially those that have pushed most aggressively into retail lending in recent years. The five largest banks in the Czech Republic now control about 60% of the market, raising concerns about lack of competition. The Czech government has delayed bank privatization, hoping that establishing stronger regulation will increase the selling prices of state-owned banks.

Consumer loans, especially mortgage loans and credit card debt, make up the fastest-growing segment of lending and accounted for half of all new loans in 1996. While mortgage lending standards remain high, credit card issuers have been more aggressive, raising fears of a bubble, especially given the Czech Republic's short history of consumer credit. The Czech National bank has issued warnings to commercial banks about their growing appetite for risk, but has so far refrained from direct intervention in the lending market.

Overall, the Czech economy remains healthy with strong growth and low unemployment. But continued vigilance over the stability of the banking system will be needed to ensure solid economic performance in the years to come. The next 12 months will be critical in determining whether Czech commercial banks have learned from the experiences of other former Communist countries that faced banking crises. Tighter regulation and supervision of bank lending practices may still be needed to safeguard the health of both the banking sector and the wider economy.
