Czech Cabinet Faces Shake-Up amid Falling Approval Ratings and Economic Woes

The Czech Republic's coalition cabinet is facing internal divisions and declining public support as the country grapples with a slowing economy and rising cost of living. Prime Minister Andrej Babis's populist ANO party came to power in 2017 on a platform of fighting corruption and supporting ordinary citizens. However, ANO's approval rating has fallen to just over 25 percent, down from over 30 percent last year, amid various political scandals and inability to significantly boost living standards. 

The Czech economy grew by a modest 2.5 percent last year and is projected to slow further in 2020. While unemployment remains very low at 2 percent, wages have stagnated and the cost of housing and basic necessities has risen steadily. The government has been unable to invest substantially in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and other priority areas, constrained by a commitment to fiscal discipline. The opposition demands increases to pensions, public sector pay and social welfare benefits, putting further strain on the budget.

Divisions within the ruling coalition itself are also causing instability. ANO's partner, the Social Democrats, have pushed for progressive policies around taxation, public services and the environment that have been resisted by the center-right ANO and smaller regional parties also in government. There are rumors the Social Democrats may withdraw from the coalition if their demands are not met, triggering early elections. The opposition center-right Civic Democrats and TOP 09 parties would stand to gain seats in any new vote, according to recent surveys.

Amid these political and economic headwinds, Prime Minister Babis faces a difficult challenge in regaining public trust and confidence. His populist credentials as an outsider standing up for ordinary people have been undermined by ongoing accusations of misuse of EU funds by one of his former companies, as well as conflicts of interest due to his vast business empire. The Prime Minister denies all wrongdoing but protests demanding his resignation have become more frequent.  

With its term ending in 2021, the Czech cabinet has limited time to change course. Stabilizing the economy, easing cost of living pressures and delivering on promises of increased investment and prosperity could help start to repair its public standing. Navigating internal coalition tensions and overcoming allegations of impropriety will also be crucial for ANO and Mr Babis to remain in power and shape the policy agenda. The coming months will be a pivotal moment for the country with much at stake for its citizens, economy and political future. Overall, the government faces stern tests that will determine both its longevity and legacy.
