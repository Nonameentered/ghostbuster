Czech President Vaclav Havel Speaks About Near-Death Experience After Cancer Surgery  

Prague, Czech Republic—In an emotional interview, Czech President Vaclav Havel opened up for the first time about his nearly dying during cancer surgery last month and his new outlook on life after coming close to death.

Speaking to Czech Radio, Havel described waking up after the complicated, five-hour operation to remove a malignant tumor from his right lung and seeing his wife Dagmar by his hospital bedside. "I saw her all of a sudden with different eyes. She was very worried. And I wasn't sure at that moment whether I would make it or not," Havel said. 

Havel, a former playwright and hero of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended decades of communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia, was diagnosed with lung cancer in late October during a routine checkup. Doctors discovered a tumor in Havel's right lung that required immediate surgery. The 75-year-old president went under the knife on Dec. 15, but his condition quickly deteriorated in the days after as fluid built up in his lungs. Havel was rushed into intensive care and spent time on a ventilator.

"There were moments when I hovered between life and death," Havel said. His situation was so grave at one point that his doctors braced Dagmar for the worst. But Havel rallied, improved steadily over the following weeks, and was released from the hospital in early January. Doctors expect him to make a full recovery, though he continues to undergo outpatient treatment.

The brush with death seems to have imparted new meaning on life for the pensive leader. "A person goes through huge changes at such a moment," he said. "All of a sudden you see yourself as a whole, your life has a different meaning.” Havel said he now realizes he had taken some things for granted that "you suddenly see differently from the borderline of life and death." He gave no details about specific insights but said he hopes the lessons stay with him.

Havel first served as president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992 and has been president of the Czech Republic since its split from Slovakia in 1993. Despite his recent health scare, he has no plans to step down before his second and final term as president ends in 2003. But he said the experience has led him to contemplate his mortality and the legacy he will leave behind. "Every one of us sometimes thinks about what we will be remembered for and the mark we will leave behind," Havel said. His brush with death seems to have made that mark feel more important than ever.
