Anglo-Swedish consortium offers Czech Republic new fighter jets for 40% less than US competitors  

A consortium of British and Swedish defense companies has offered to supply new fighter jets to the Czech Republic for 40% less than competing bids from US aerospace giants. BAE Systems and Saab have proposed selling 36 Gripen E fighter jets to the Czech military for $1.25 billion, a steep discount compared to offerings from Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

The Czech Republic wants to update its aging fleet of Soviet-era MiG-29 jets and purchase a new multirole supersonic fighter aircraft. They received bids from five companies, including Dassault Aviation of France and Italy's Leonardo. However, the aggressive pricing from BAE Systems and Saab has put pressure on their competitors. 

The Czech defense ministry has said it wants to conclude a deal this year, with first deliveries of new aircraft in 2023. The Gripen E, a lightweight single-engine fighter, is touted as an affordable alternative to American designs like the F-35 Lightning II or F/A-18 Super Hornet. Saab and BAE Systems have also offered significant technology transfers and industrial cooperation as part of their bid. 

“The offer from Saab and BAE Systems is the most competitive in terms of price and fulfills all the technical requirements of the Czech military,” said Czech Defense Minister Lubomír Metnar. “The Gripen has proven itself as a capable fighter and will provide an excellent backbone of our air force for decades to come at a price our budget can afford.”

The decision represents a blow for Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who were hoping foreign sales would extend production of their aircraft. The F-35 in particular has struggled in some overseas competitions due to its high price tag, though it remains the fighter of choice for most NATO members including Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, and Poland. However, for budget-constrained nations like the Czech Republic, the Gripen appears to tick all the boxes at a discount to its US-made peers. The Anglo-Swedish tie-up is poised to make additional sales of the Gripen in central and eastern Europe, putting pressure on the dominance of US aerospace firms.
