Josef Korbel's legacy lives on through his daughter, Madeleine Albright, the new US Secretary of State 

Madeleine Albright was sworn in today as the 64th US Secretary of State, becoming the first woman to hold the position. At her ceremonial swearing-in, Albright spoke of how her late father, Czechoslovak diplomat Josef Korbel, influenced her path to this historic role.

"My father spent his life defending freedom and democracy, first as a courageous resistance fighter against the Nazis in World War II, and then as a diplomat working to secure and strengthen postwar Czechoslovakia," Albright said. "He taught me the values that have guided my life: faith in democracy, belief in liberty, and dedication to justice and equality."

Josef Korbel was born in Bohemia in 1909. He joined the Czechoslovak army and fought against Germany in World War II, escaping to London after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. He served in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, helping plan the postwar reconstruction of Czechoslovakia. After the war, Korbel returned home and joined the Foreign Ministry, serving as an advisor to Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk. 

In 1948, Korbel fled Czechoslovakia with his family after the Communist coup. He was granted political asylum in the US, where he pursued an academic career. Korbel served as professor and dean at the University of Denver, where he founded the Graduate School of International Studies. It was in Denver that his daughter Madeleine grew up and pursued her education. 

Madeleine Albright has spoken frequently about how she was influenced by her father's experience and moral courage. In her memoir 'Madam Secretary,' she wrote: "From an early age, Daddy pounded into me the importance of democratic values and internationalism. His influence, and that of my professors at Wellesley, made me want to pursue a career in foreign affairs."

Albright went on to earn a PhD from Columbia University and worked for Senator Ed Muskie before serving in various roles in President Carter's State Department and on the National Security Council.
