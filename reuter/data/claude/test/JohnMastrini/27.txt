Czech Prime Minister Klaus Criticizes National Bank for Slowing Economic Growth with Inflation Measures 

Prague, Czech Republic—Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus launched a sharp attack today on the country's independent central bank, the Czech National Bank, for pursuing tight monetary policies that he said were slowing the nation's economic growth.

In a speech to the Czech parliament, Klaus accused the central bank of being overly focused on controlling inflation, even at the expense of economic expansion. "The rigid policies of the Czech National Bank are like a vice squeezing the life out of businesses and enterprise in this country," Klaus said. He called on the central bank to immediately lower interest rates by at least 1 percentage point to stimulate investment and consumer spending.

The central bank raised its main policy rate by a quarter point in June and July, citing rising inflationary pressures in the fast-growing economy. The rate now stands at 2.75%, still low by historical standards but higher than the ultra-low rates in place last year. Central bank governor Zdeněk Tůma rebuffed Klaus's criticisms, saying that the bank's mandate is to keep inflation low and stable, which requires tight monetary policy when the economy is running hot.

"We cannot pursue an irresponsible monetary policy just to please politicians seeking short-term economic gains," Tůma said in a statement. He pointed out that the Czech economy grew by over 4% last year and in the first half of this year, demonstrating that the small rate hikes have not significantly impacted growth.

The public spat between the prime minister and the central bank governor is unusual in the Czech Republic, where the central bank has enjoyed a high degree of independence since shortly after the transition from communism to democracy. Klaus is known for his populist style and has long called for lower interest rates, but his forceful language today still took observers by surprise. His comments also raised concerns that he may threaten the central bank's independence if he pushes the issue further.

Klaus faces national elections next year, and some analysts said his comments were more for political benefit than reflective of genuine concerns about monetary policy slowing growth. The central bank is expected to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year, unless inflation rises significantly higher than the most recent forecasts. Still, the war of words with the prime minister introduces an element of uncertainty and tension surrounding monetary policymaking in the country.
