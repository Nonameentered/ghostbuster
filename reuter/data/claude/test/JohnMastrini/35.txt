Former opposition deputy crosses the aisle, giving Czech coalition government a key seat

The Czech coalition government headed by Prime Minister Petr Fiala yesterday gained an additional seat and strengthened its narrow majority in parliament after a deputy crossed the floor and joined the ruling coalition. 

Jaroslav Doubrava, a lawmaker from the opposition nationalist Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD), announced he would join the ruling coalition alliance made up of the Civic Democratic Party, Christian Democrats, and TOP 09. The move gives the coalition a total of 108 seats in the 200-seat lower house, increasing its majority from just 1 seat.

The surprise announcement came during a debate on a bill to restrict immigration. Doubrava supported the bill, unlike others in his former party. After SPD leader Tomio Okamura criticized Doubrava for breaking ranks, Doubrava announced he would leave the SPD parliamentary group and join the governing coalition. 

"I came to the conclusion that my opinions are closer to the opinions of the government coalition than the SPD movement," Doubrava said. Okamura accused Doubrava of "political treason" for switching sides. 

The move is a boost for Prime Minister Fiala, whose minority government has struggled at times to pass legislation. But with the new seat, Fiala said he believes the government is in a stronger position to implement its agenda. "We appreciate the support of MP Doubrava for a responsible and reasonable political direction," Fiala said in a statement.

The opposition ANO movement and SPD still control a majority of seats in the parliament's upper house, the Senate, so the one additional seat may provide limited benefit to the coalition. But every vote counts in the lower house, and the narrow majority had left the government vulnerable.

Doubrava's move highlights the ideological differences within the opposition and the fragile nature of coalitions in Czech politics. His decision may spur other individual lawmakers to consider crossing the aisle to back the ruling coalition. For now, Prime Minister Fiala received an unexpected autumn gift that could help reduce obstacles to passing key legislation over the next year.
