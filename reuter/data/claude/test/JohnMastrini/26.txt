Father and Son Team Up to Win Second Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Language Feature

The Swedish director-writer team of Ruben Östlund and Erik Hemmendorff once again received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Feature Film for their latest movie Treasure Island. This marks the second nomination for the father-son duo, following their 2017 nomination for the film The Square. 

Ruben Östlund has been making films since the early 2000s but received international acclaim and recognition with his 2014 social satire Force Majeure. That film explored the relationship dynamics between a couple after the man shows cowardice during an avalanche scare. The Square, Östlund's follow up, was a bizarre and humorous take on the pretentiousness of the contemporary art world. It ended up winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes, one of the top prizes in world cinema.

Treasure Island continues Östlund's streak of crafting witty and insightful stories that satirize human behavior and social conventions. The film follows a group of teenagers during a sailing camp in the Swedish archipelago over the course of a summer. Hormones are raging, alliances are formed and broken, and the teens get into various hijinks and mischief on their quest for adventure and experience. Underneath the humor, the film provides poignant observations about issues of class dynamics, privilege, and power structures within groups.

Östlund's son Erik Hemmendorff has served as a producer on all of his father's films since Force Majeure. Their close collaborative partnership has proven immensely successful, garnering not just widespread critical acclaim but also several major film festival awards and now two Oscar nominations. At the Academy Award ceremony this February, Treasure Island will be competing against four other films for the Best Foreign Language Film statuette: Transit from Germany, Never Look Away from Germany, Capernaum from Lebanon, and Shoplifters from Japan.

Regardless of whether Treasure Island wins the Oscar, Ruben Östlund and Erik Hemmendorff have solidified their status as one of the most interesting director-producer teams on the contemporary world cinema landscape. They have a knack for crafting clever, entertaining films that also provide insightful social commentary on human behavior. Film fans worldwide eagerly await Östlund's next project and the new observations and absurdist humor it may bring. The dynamic filmmaking duo proves that, at least in some cases, the family that works together thrives together.
