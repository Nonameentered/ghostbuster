Czech Prime Minister Criticizes National Bank's Attempt to Slow Inflation 

Prague, Czech Republic—Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš issued a rare public rebuke of the country's central bank today, criticizing its latest interest rate hike as an "excessive" attempt to curb rising inflation that could hamper economic growth.

The Czech National Bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 2.25% at its policy meeting this week, marking the third increase this year. The hikes are aimed at slowing the country's inflation rate, which rose to 3.2% in October, the highest in 5 years and above the bank's 2% target. 

However, in an interview on Czech Radio, Babiš said the central bank's tightening policy was an "overreaction" that risked weakening domestic demand and consumer confidence. "They should not increase rates in such huge steps," Babiš said. "It's not good for our economy."

The comments highlight tensions between the populist prime minister and the independent central bank. Critics argue Babiš' high public spending policies and worker wage increases have fueled higher inflation, forcing the central bank to raise rates. The bank has legal authority to set monetary policy independent of political influence.

In a statement, the central bank defended its latest rate move, saying it was aimed at preventing higher inflation expectations from becoming entrenched, which could undermine the bank's price stability mandate. The bank projects inflation will return to its target next year, but only if it takes further "gradual" policy tightening.

Babiš remains skeptical the economy needs substantially higher rates. His minority coalition government has boosted public sector wages and pensions, which he said was necessary to spur economic growth as the pace of expansion in the Czech economy has eased this year. Babiš said he would prefer the central bank take a "softer approach" to fighting inflation rather than "strangling the economy."

Economists said the war of words risks damaging the bank's credibility if investors come to doubt its resolve or independence on policy matters. For now, markets continue to expect at least one more quarter-point rate increase from the Czech central bank this year, according to interest rate futures prices.  Babiš' government, meanwhile, must rely on support from opposition lawmakers to pass legislation, limiting his direct influence over the bank.
