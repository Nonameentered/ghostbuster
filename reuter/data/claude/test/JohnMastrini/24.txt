Czech President calls on Senate to approve post-WWII reconciliation pact with Germany 

Prague, Czech Republic - The Czech president Milos Zeman has urged the Senate, the upper house of the Czech parliament, to ratify a reconciliation agreement with Germany addressing the aftermath of World War II. The agreement, signed by the leaders of both countries last year, aims to settle long-standing disputes over property and bolster relations between the two Central European neighbors.

In a letter to the senators, Zeman appealed to them to approve the deal, calling it "an important step towards developing good neighborly relations and deepening cooperation" with Germany. The pact addresses the expropriation and expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war. Around 3 million ethnic Germans were forcibly removed from the country at the end of WWII under a postwar settlement. 

The agreement allows German victims of expropriation to apply for compensation. It also reaffirms previous treaties and declarations on mutual forgiveness for wartime wrongs. Critics argue the compensation scheme is unfair as it does not apply to Czech victims of the war. Supporters counter that improved ties with Germany are in the Czech national interest.

Relations between the Czech Republic and Germany were strained for decades due to this unresolved legacy of WWII but have improved significantly since the 1990s. Strong economic and trade links have developed, and cultural and tourism exchanges are robust. President Zeman, known for his pro-Russian and populist views, has long supported closer cooperation with Germany despite criticism from some opponents.

The Senate is generally more wary of cooperation with Germany than the lower house of parliament. The ratification vote is scheduled for late March. If approved, the agreement will come into effect and help cement ties between two countries that were once bitter adversaries. The move is being closely watched by other Central European nations with similar historical grievances against Germany in a region that remains divided over attitudes to its larger neighbor.

In summary, the article reports that the Czech President has urged the Senate to approve a post-World War II agreement with Germany providing compensation for Czech victims of expropriation and expulsion. The pact aims to settle long-standing disputes and improve relations. If ratified, it would bolster ties between two countries with a complicated history. The vote and reaction are being closely observed in Central Europe.
