Czech Politicians and Pundits Criticize Michael Jackson's World Tour Opener in Prague 

Prague, Czech Republic â€”Michael Jackson kicked off his highly anticipated world tour last night in Prague to a sold-out crowd of over 60,000 fans. However, the concert was not without controversy, as several Czech politicians and commentators criticized the show and Jackson himself.

Jackson's concert was the first of 16 sold-out shows scheduled throughout Europe over the next month. The "King of Pop" dazzled audiences with a setlist of over 20 of his biggest hits, as well as extravagant costumes and dance routines. Fans waited for hours outside Prague's Letna Stadium to get a glimpse of the pop legend and cheered enthusiastically throughout the 2.5 hour show.

Not everyone was thrilled with Jackson's visit to the Czech capital, however. Czech MP Stanislav Krecek called Jackson "a pedophile and a freak" and argued that allowing him to perform was "immoral". Another parliamentarian, Miroslava Nemcova, called for a boycott of the show, claiming Czechs should not support someone with Jackson's controversial past. 

Several local commentators also voiced criticism of excess consumerism and "western cultural imperialism."  Newspaper columnist Jiri Pehe said the enthusiastic reception for Jackson demonstrated "the ugly face of globalization in its commercial dimension."

Despite the critiques, the show was a commercial and logistical triumph. Over 200 workers were involved in planning and setup, and organizers anticipate the Prague shows alone will inject over $100 million into the local economy through ticket sales, tourism, and business revenue. Jackson himself will earn an estimated $20 million from the 16 European tour dates.

The extravagant concert was a controversial start to Jackson's comeback world tour. While tens of thousands of fans were thrilled to see the pop superstar return to the stage, the show was not without vocal critics and detractors. Jackson will perform again in Prague tonight before continuing on to venues in other European cities.
