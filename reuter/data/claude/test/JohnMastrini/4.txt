Aung San Suu Kyi honoured with doctorate by Prague's Charles University 

The Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been awarded an honorary doctorate by Charles University in Prague during her official visit to the Czech Republic this week. The prestigious university recognized Suu Kyi for her "dedication in defending democratic values and human rights."

Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's military junta before finally being released in 2010. Her political party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election in 25 years in 2015. Suu Kyi became State Counsellor of Myanmar, a position akin to prime minister.

In a speech at the award ceremony, Suu Kyi expressed her appreciation for the support of world leaders and institutions during her long years of house arrest. "Kindness and support from friends around the world helped preserve my belief in the goodness and solidarity of human beings," she said. She called for more cooperation between Myanmar and the Czech Republic, especially in the areas of education and culture.

The university rector, Tomas Zima, praised Suu Kyi as "one of the most important contemporary fighters for freedom and human rights." Previous recipients of honorary degrees from Charles University include Vaclav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, and the Dalai Lama.

Suu Kyi's visit to Prague comes amid both praise and criticism of her record in Myanmar. She has been lauded for steering the country towards democracy after decades of military rule but also condemned for the treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority group. Over 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar to Bangladesh since 2017 to escape violence and persecution.

Suu Kyi defended her government's record and pledged to improve human rights in her country. "Our government is just two years old. Reforms cannot happen overnight," she said. She pointed out that the transition to democracy after many years of dictatorship was bound to face challenges and shortcomings. With time and cooperation, Myanmar will strengthen its democratic institutions and protections for civil rights, she promised.

Suu Kyi's European tour continues next week with visits to Hungary and Austria. Her reception in Prague suggests that she continues to enjoy popularity and prestige in European capitals despite the mixed reviews of her time in office so far. Myanmar still has a long journey to a fair, just, and democratic society but in Suu Kyi it has a leader who has proven her mettle in the long struggle for freedom against immense odds.
