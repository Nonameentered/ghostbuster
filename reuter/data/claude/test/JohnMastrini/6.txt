Czech Banks Receive Investment Grade Ratings from S&P, Partly Due to State Safety Net  

Standard & Poor's (S&P) upgraded the long-term credit ratings of three major Czech banks today, citing improvements in the country's economy and the banks’ financial profiles. S&P raised its ratings of Česká spořitelna, Komerční banka and Československá obchodní banka to BBB, placing them at the lower end of the investment grade category.

The higher ratings reflect the banks’ strengthened capital positions, declining levels of nonperforming loans, and stable funding profiles, according to S&P. The agency also noted that the Czech government provides a strong safety net for the banking sector. The state owns significant stakes in Česká spořitelna and Československá obchodní banka and has a long track record of supporting the country’s banks.

“The ratings on the Czech banks continue to benefit from our view of a high likelihood of extraordinary government support for the banking system if needed,” S&P said in a statement.

The upgrade comes as the Czech economy has rebounded from a recession last year triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. S&P expects Czech GDP to grow 3.4% this year and 3.8% in 2022 amid a recovery in domestic demand and buoyant exports. The ratings agency forecasts unemployment will decrease, inflation will remain stable at around 2%, and the general government budget deficit will narrow over the next two years. 

Česká spořitelna CEO Tomáš Salomon welcomed the ratings upgrade, saying it confirms the bank's financial stability and robust risk management. "The improved rating will further strengthen our competitive position, especially in the corporate and municipal lending segments," he said.

However, Salomon noted that low interest rates, uncertainty regarding asset quality trends, and risks associated with the real estate market remain challenges for the bank. "We will continue our cautious lending practices and strict cost discipline," he said.

The higher investment grade ratings will make it cheaper for the Czech banks to fund themselves in the capital markets and could attract more interest from foreign investors. The ratings upgrade provides an overall boost for the country's financial sector, suggesting it is well placed to support the Czech economy's continued recovery.
