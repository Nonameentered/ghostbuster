Czech industrial sector faces weak profitability and poor corporate leadership, says EBRD team leader

The profitability and competitiveness of Czech industrial companies is lagging due to weak corporate governance and leadership, according to a report by the EBRD's Regional Economic Prospects. The report, which is released annually, examines economic trends across Central and Eastern Europe as well as Central Asia.

This year's report highlighted substantial challenges facing the Czech Republic's industrial sector. "Industrial companies in the Czech Republic have struggled with profitability in recent years, in large part because management and governance structures have not kept up with the needs of a modern market economy," said John Smith, EBRD Lead Economist and team leader of the report. "Too often, companies remain stuck in old ways of thinking and are over-reliant on outdated business models."

The EBRD report found that returns on assets and equity for Czech industrial firms have declined steadily over the past decade and now rank in the bottom half of regional peers. At the same time, R&D spending as a share of revenue is well below the EU average. The report argues this is evidence of corporate boards and executives failing to effectively set strategic visions, invest in new technologies, and diversify their products. 

"The focus seems to be on maintaining the status quo rather than boldly adapting to changing market conditions," Smith noted. "Until corporate leadership and governance practices in the Czech Republic become more dynamic and globally-minded, the competitiveness and profitability gap with Western European peers is likely to remain."

The report praised some recent government initiatives to spur innovation and digitalization but said legislative and policy changes were still needed to incentivize improvements in corporate leadership. The EBRD called on Czech authorities to promote more independent and professional boards of directors with the skills to steer companies toward higher value-added and higher-tech activities.

"Addressing issues of corporate governance and strategic leadership is rarely fast or easy," Smith said. "However, it is critical for the Czech Republic to boost the dynamism, resilience, and global competitiveness of its industrial base." Overall, the EBRD said it expects the Czech economy to grow by 2.4% in 2021, a slightly slower pace than anticipated before the COVID-19 crisis.
