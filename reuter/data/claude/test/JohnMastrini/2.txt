Michael Jackson Launches "HIStory" Tour in Prague with Statue Unveiling

Prague, Czech Republicâ€”Michael Jackson kicked off his highly anticipated HIStory World Tour here tonight with an extravagant show that included the unveiling of a giant statue of the King of Pop. The 50-foot high golden statue was revealed midway through the two-hour concert in front of a packed audience at Letna Park. 

The HIStory tour is Jackson's first world tour in over two years and is in support of his double album HIStory released earlier this year. The tour will visit five continents and over 50 cities around the globe over the next year and a half. Tonight's opening show wowed 65,000 screaming fans who braved rain and chilly temperatures to see their idol perform.

The concert began with a montage of Jackson's music videos playing on enormous screens, building excitement for the star's arrival. After a dramatic pause, Jackson emerged from beneath the stage to roaring applause and kicked off the set with a high-energy performance of "Scream," the first single from his new album. From there, Jackson plowed through a string of his biggest hits, including "Beat It," "Billie Jean," and "Smooth Criminal."

Midway through the show, Jackson disappeared from the stage again as a countdown clock began ticking to mark the unveiling of the massive golden statue, which Jackson commissioned as a tribute to his fans. As the countdown reached zero, the statue was dramatically revealed in a shower of fireworks and lasers. The figure depicts Jackson in one of his iconic dance poses, standing with arms crossed and one leg in the air. The fans erupted at the sight of the monumental likeness of their idol.

After the unveiling, Jackson returned to the stage to finish the concert, performing recent hits like "You Are Not Alone" and "Earth Song" as well as classics such as "Thriller" and "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough." For the finale, Jackson was joined onstage by children and dancers to lead the crowd in an encore performance of "Heal the World." As fireworks once again lit up the sky over Letna Park and Jackson waved goodbye, fans streamed out of the venue thrilled after witnessing the grand spectacle that marked the launch of the King of Pop's latest musical reign over the globe. The HIStory tour was off to a historic start in the heart of Prague tonight.
