Czech Deputy Finance Minister Resigns Amid Criticism of Capital Markets Management 

Prague: Jaroslav Unger, the Czech Deputy Finance Minister, announced his resignation today following mounting criticism of how his ministry has managed the country's capital markets. Mr. Unger has served as deputy finance minister for capital markets since late 2018 but has faced growing calls for his ouster in recent months.

The Czech finance ministry has faced scrutiny over its decision to loan €893 million to the privately owned national air carrier Czech Airlines last year to keep it afloat. Critics argue the loan only delayed the inevitable restructuring of the struggling airline and put taxpayer funds at risk. The Finance Ministry also drew fire for its oversight of KB Penzijni Společnost, the largest pension fund manager in the Czech Republic. An audit last year found serious deficiencies in risk controls at the fund, putting millions in retirement savings in jeopardy.

In his resignation letter, Mr. Unger said "there have been mistakes made and lessons must be learned to restore confidence in the ministry's ability to judiciously manage public funds and protect citizens' long-term financial interests." However, he stopped short of taking direct responsibility for the specific issues that have raised concerns. Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said he accepted Mr. Unger's resignation and would appoint a successor "who will bring a new approach and ensure better management of risks in our country's financial markets."

Opposition leaders said Mr. Unger's departure was "long overdue" but laid blame at the feet of Finance Minister Alena Schillerová and Prime Minister Babiš for the overall problems. "This government has shown itself incapable of properly supervising financial institutions and protecting people's money and pensions," said Markéta Pekarová Adamová, head of the opposition TOP 09 party.
