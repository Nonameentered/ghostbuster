Congressional Approval for NATO Expansion to Former Communist Europe Not Yet Assured, Says U.S. Senator  

Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said today that congressional approval for expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to include several former communist nations in Central and Eastern Europe is not guaranteed. Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, McCain said “There are many members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, that still need to be convinced that enlarging NATO to include countries such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is in the best interests of the United States and our allies.”

NATO is considering offering membership to several former Warsaw Pact nations that were once under the influence of the Soviet Union. In order to join NATO, the nations must implement democratic reforms and demonstrate a commitment to the common defense of NATO member states.   

President Clinton has voiced strong support for NATO expansion to these former communist nations as a way to solidify democratic reforms, strengthen strategic alliances, and expand Western influence after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, some members of Congress argue that expansion may provoke Russia, is not worth the cost, and that some potential new members have not done enough to curb corruption or transition to democracy.     

McCain argued that rejecting these nations could damage U.S. credibility and weaken democratic reforms.  “We promised these nations during the fall of communism that if they instituted democratic reforms and free market policies, the door to Western institutions would be open to them. We must stand by that promise.” He cited Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary as having made especially strong cases for membership through their actions.

Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) agreed with McCain and voiced optimism that a bipartisan effort could convince skeptical members about the benefits of expansion. "Bringing emerging democracies into the NATO alliance strengthens our partnership and advances American values and interests around the world," Daschle said in a statement. "While debate is good, I believe there is wide agreement that welcoming Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is the right thing to do, and the right thing for NATO."

Continued opposition could slow the momentum towards inviting new members to join NATO at their summit next year in 2022. Overcoming such opposition in Congress will require a concerted effort to address concerns about costs, provoking Russia, and ensuring new members meet all necessary standards. If approved, this first round of NATO expansion since 1952 would usher in a new era of NATO's role in Europe's security landscape. But consensus in Congress is needed first, according to Senator McCain, and that is not yet a guarantee.
