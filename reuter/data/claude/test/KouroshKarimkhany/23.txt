Lam Research Corp. to Acquire OnTrak Systems for $225 Million in Stock, Enters Fastest-Growing Sector in Semiconductor Industry 

Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research Corp. announced today that it will acquire OnTrak Systems, a privately held Newport Beach, Calif.-based developer of wafer cleaning technology, for $225 million in stock. The deal will allow Lam to enter the rapidly growing wafer cleaning and surface preparation segment of the semiconductor equipment industry.

OnTrak develops proprietary technology for cleaning and removing liquids from silicon wafers and other semiconductor substrates at the back end of the integrated circuit fabrication process. Its systems are designed to improve yields, reduce chemical usage, and lower costs in the wafer manufacturing process. The global market for wafer cleaning equipment is projected to reach $5.2 billion by 2023, up from $3.4 billion in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8.3%, according to research firm Markets and Markets.

“The acquisition of OnTrak is a key strategic move for Lam as we continue to expand our product offerings in the wafer fabrication space,” said Tim Archer, Lam's president and chief executive officer. “Integrating OnTrak's innovative cleaning technology into our portfolio will enable our customers to further improve their manufacturing efficiency and cost competitiveness.”

Founded in 1992, privately held OnTrak generated revenue of approximately $125 million over the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2018, Lam said. OnTrak will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lam and its financial results will be consolidated into Lam's financial statements. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.

“We are thrilled to join the Lam Research family,” said Manoocher Sholehvar, CEO of OnTrak. “Lam's global infrastructure and operational excellence will help scale our business and accelerate the adoption of our cleaning technology worldwide. Together, we will provide customers with a broader range of innovative platform solutions to optimize their manufacturing productivity and yield.”

Lam also announced that in conjunction with this acquisition, its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock, in addition to amounts remaining under its previous authorization. The company said it plans to fund the repurchase program from available domestic cash.
