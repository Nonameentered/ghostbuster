Apple to Announce Massive Job Cuts and Operations Restructuring Plan

Apple Inc. is preparing to announce massive job cuts, retail store closings, and restructuring within its operations department, according to sources familiar with plans at the company. The announcement will likely come in a press release issued next week before Apple’s quarterly earnings report. 

According to sources, Apple is planning to eliminate thousands of jobs in face-to-face retail interactions. These include laying off many current retail staff and permanently closing dozens of Apple stores around the world. The cuts reflect CEO Tim Cook's view that fewer retail employees and smaller retail footprint will be necessary as more customers shop online and the company focuses more on digital services. 

Some cuts will also impact jobs in operations, including recent hires in manufacturing and service. The decision is said to be part of a larger move toward automating more of Apple’s supply chain and simplifying its product line. "Tim Cook wants to streamline operations even more to make Apple run as efficiently as possible," said one source. The cuts could save Apple billions per year but may be criticized for reducing good jobs.

In addition to job cuts, Apple will reportedly announce a restructuring of its project management and operations teams. Some long-time managers and executives are expected to retire, with fewer middle management positions being backfilled. The moves are not surprising given Cook's focus on leanness and consistent calls for "doing more with less." But some employees worry the cuts have gone too far and risk impacting Apple's famous creativity and design success.

While unsettling in the short term, Cook's plan seems aimed to make Apple significantly more nimble and able to ride future waves of innovation without a bloated workforce. Few companies have succeeded for as long as Apple, and Cook appears determined to position the company to thrive for decades to come through a lean, automated, and innovative business model — even if it requires difficult decisions today. Apple's quarterly results and announcement about changes will provide more clarity on the company's future path next week.
