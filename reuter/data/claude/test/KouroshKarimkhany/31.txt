Rational Software to Acquire Rival Pure Atria in $839 Million Stock Deal, Stocks Plummet  

Software giant Rational Software announced today that it will acquire rival Pure Atria in an all-stock deal valued at $839 million. The deal will allow Rational to expand its market-leading position in the enterprise software and tools space. However, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares of both companies plunging.   

Rational will acquire Pure Atria for 0.62 shares of Rational stock for each share of Pure Atria stock. At Rational's closing price yesterday, that values Pure Atria at $6.23 per share or $839 million in total. The deal represents a premium of 15% over Pure Atria's closing price yesterday.

The merger of these two competitors is an effort to scale in the business of providing software and tools for enterprise software development and lifecycle management. Rational CEO Mike Devlin said in a statement, "This deal will allow us to combine our companies' complementary product portfolios, gain significant efficiencies, and provide even greater value to customers."

However, investors appear to disagree with that optimistic outlook. Shares of Rational dropped over 12% in early trading, while Pure Atria sank over 9%. The drop reflects investor concerns that the companies may struggle to integrate their operations and product lines. There is also fear that the premium being paid for Pure Atria is too high, which could reduce Rational's future earnings.

The merger requires approval by shareholders of both companies as well as regulatory approval. The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter of this year. Pure Atria will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Rational after the merger is complete. Pure Atria's CEO, Jack Herzog, will join Rational's senior leadership team and help oversee the integration of the two companies.  

Some analysts see the logic in the deal and believe the negative stock reaction is an overreaction. "This acquisition has significant strategic merit," said Tom Davis, a software analyst at Forrester Research. "If executed properly, the combination of these firms allows Rational to dominate the tools and enterprise software space. The 15% premium is reasonable given the potential synergies. Longer term, this should be a winner for shareholders of both companies."

However, other analysts echoed the concerns of investors about challenges in integrating the two companies and realizing cost savings. They point to Rational's mixed track record with previous acquisitions.Only time will tell whether this blockbuster deal, the largest ever in the enterprise software industry, fulfills its promise of value creation.
