Technology Stocks Jump as Investors Optimistic About Earnings Reports  

Major technology companies saw their stock prices rise sharply today as investors anticipated strong quarterly earnings reports over the next few weeks. The NASDAQ Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward tech companies, gained 2.3% to close at an all-time high. 

Shares of Apple Inc. climbed 4.2% to a record high, surpassing a market cap of $1 trillion for the second time. Apple is expected to report fiscal second-quarter results on April 30 that show continued strong demand for its iPhones and services. Revenue from its wearables and home products, including the Apple Watch and HomePod, are also projected to continue their fast growth.

Facebook shares gained 3.7% ahead of its earnings report next week. The social media giant is hoping to reassure investors that it has recovered from data privacy issues that hammered the stock last year. Analysts predict Facebook will report solid increases in users and revenue from advertising. The company is also benefiting from the growth of its Instagram unit.

Netflix stock price rose 5.1%, setting a record high. The streaming video leader is expected to announce a blowout quarter when it reports earnings on April 15, fueled by hit shows like “Stranger Things” and “The Umbrella Academy” along with more subscribers around the world. Netflix added 9.6 million subscribers in the first quarter, its biggest gain ever. It now has over 148 million subscribers.

While the major tech companies are rising, however, some smaller players are struggling. Snap Inc., the maker of Snapchat, saw shares drop 7.2% as it continues to face intense competition from Instagram. Fitbit, which makes activity trackers and smartwatches, fell 14% after warning that sales declines are accelerating. The contrast between the largest tech firms and these smaller companies showed the diverging fortunes in the sector.

Investors are optimistic that the tech leaders have solid business models and vast financial resources to continue gaining market share. Their dominance appears unlikely to fade anytime soon. As long as profits and revenues keep rising, their stocks may continue their upward trajectory. The next few weeks of earnings reports will determine whether that optimism is warranted.
