Apple goes on the attack with aggressive advertising campaign to highlight PC shortcomings 

Apple Inc. launched a new ad campaign today taking direct aim at weaknesses and vulnerabilities in personal computers running the Windows operating system. In a rare move for the company, the ads aggressively call out security and performance issues on Windows PCs in an effort to highlight the advantages of Mac computers.

The multi-million-dollar campaign, called "Be Safe," debuted during this evening's episode of 60 Minutes. It featured two 15-second commercials that drew attention to the higher incidence of viruses, malware, and ransomware attacks on Windows computers compared to Macs. The ads flashed glimpses of news reports on recent high-profile security incidents, including the WannaCry ransomware attack that disrupted hundreds of thousands of PCs worldwide last week. 

"We don't usually name competitors directly in our ads," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing. "But in this case, we wanted to highlight to PC users that they don't have to live with the level of attacks and performance issues that seem to have sadly become the norm."

The ads end by displaying the text: "A more secure choice. Mac.”

The new campaign represents a pivot in strategy for Apple, which has mostly avoided direct comparisons to PCs in its marketing. The company instead has traditionally focused on the lifestyle benefits and premium experience provided by its products. However, sales of Mac computers have declined in some markets over the past two years, and the company is looking for ways to reverse that trend. Highlighting security issues with Windows PCs was seen as an opportunity to persuade some potential customers that Macs are the safer choice.  

In addition to the television commercials, the campaign includes digital ads, billboards, and full-page print ads in newspapers and magazines. The various creative assets call out a range of PC pain points that do not affect Macs, including long wait times for Windows updates, the confusion caused by multiple versions of Windows, problems with the stability and speed of the operating system, and its vulnerability to various malware infections. 

The ads close with the tagline: “A more useful, more fun, more secure choice. Mac. Experience the difference.”
