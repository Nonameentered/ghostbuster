Apple to Release Operating System that Works on Both Apple and Intel-Based Computers

Apple announced today that it will be releasing a new version of its operating system, macOS 11 "Big Sur", that can run on both Apple's own ARM-based processors as well as Intel-based processors from third parties. The move is a major shift for Apple and signals their desire to unify their hardware and software and bring their entire ecosystem of devices under one processor architecture. 

For years, Apple has relied on Intel to supply processors for its Mac computers while using its own proprietary ARM-based chips for iPhones and iPads. The different processor architectures have meant that the operating systems for Macs and iPhones/iPads were incompatible with each other. Software would have to be rewritten to work on the different processors.

With the announcement of macOS 11 "Big Sur", which will work on both processor types, Apple is bridging that gap. "Apple silicon" is the term Apple is using for their own ARM-based processors designed for Macs. At the company's Worldwide Developers Conference today, Apple announced a transition plan to move its entire product line to Apple silicon over the next two years.

The move to Apple silicon chips provides a number of benefits for both Apple and its customers. For Apple, it allows them to bring the tight integration of hardware and software that consumers experience on iPhones and iPads to the Mac product line. For customers, it means faster, more powerful machines that can run mobile apps from the iOS App Store in addition to traditional Mac apps.  

To ease the transition to the new processors, Apple announced that macOS 11 "Big Sur" will include built-in emulation layers that allow Intel-based apps to continue to run on Apple silicon Macs for the foreseeable future. Apple says most current apps will run without the need for any changes, though performance may vary. Developers will be encouraged to recompile their apps to run natively on Apple silicon to get the best experience.  

The first Apple silicon Macs will be shipping in the coming months, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. The full transition of the Mac product line from Intel processors to Apple-designed processors will take about two years. Apple is providing developers beta versions of macOS 11 "Big Sur" and development kits to help with the move to the new universal binary. For Apple customers, it means an exciting new generation ofmore powerful, integrated devices that provide a seamless experience across the company's platforms and services is on the horizon.
