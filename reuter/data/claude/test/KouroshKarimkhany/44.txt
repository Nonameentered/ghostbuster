Apple to Release New Operating System for Both Apple and Intel Computers

Apple announced today that it will be releasing the latest version of its macOS operating system, code-named Monterey, in the fall of 2021. Monterey will be available as a free upgrade for Intel-based Mac computers and the new Apple ARM-based M1 Macs. The latest macOS release brings several new features to the Mac, including Universal Control, AirPlay improvements, and an updated Safari browser.  

Universal Control is a new feature that will allow users to control multiple Mac computers, as well as iPads, with a single keyboard and mouse or trackpad. Users can drag and drop files between the connected devices and have the cursor move seamlessly between screens. "With Universal Control, Mac and iPad become a single workspace for all-new cross-device collaboration," said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering.  

AirPlay is also getting updates to allow video and multi-channel audio from Mac to be streamed to AirPlay 2-enabled smart TVs. The new Safari browser will load web pages faster using machine learning to prioritize critical resources. It will also display a privacy report that shows which trackers Safari prevented from profiling the user.

Monterey is the next evolution of the modern Mac experience," said Federighi. "From the seamless integration between Mac and iPad to high performance machine learning technologies, Monterey is filled with features that help our customers get more done and work more fluidly between devices."  

Monterey will be available as a software update later this year in the fall of 2021. The update will be compatible with the new M1-powered Macs as well as older Intel-based Macs dating back to 2015. Apple continues to release regular software and security updates for older Intel-based Macs, even as the company transitions the Mac lineup to its own ARM-based Apple Silicon chips. The shift to Apple Silicon is aimed at giving Mac computers better performance and longer battery life.  With the release of Monterey for both Intel and Apple Silicon this fall, Apple continues to support and update Mac users regardless of what type of hardware they have.
