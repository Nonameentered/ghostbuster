Informix Corp. Considers Refinancing Leases and Raising Cash to Offset Declining Sales of Database Software Products

Informix Corp., a once high-flying database software provider, is exploring ways to refinance equipment leases and raise additional funding to bolster its balance sheet amid declining sales of its flagship data management products.

The San Diego-based company announced today that it has engaged investment bankers to help evaluate options for refinancing up to $45 million in equipment lease obligations that come due over the next three years. Informix is also considering a stock offering or a sale of debt securities to generate capital, although its leadership has not made a final decision. 

The moves come as Informix struggles with slowing revenue growth due to competitive pressures in the database market from industry giant Oracle Corp. and open-source alternatives like MySQL. Informix reported product revenue of $232 million in its most recent quarter, a decline of nearly 10% from the prior-year period. 

Informix was an early pioneer in database management software, but it has ceded significant market share to Oracle over the past decade. Oracle now commands over 40% of the $10 billion database software market, according to industry estimates.

To jumpstart growth, Informix launched a cloud-based version of its flagship OnBar database software last year and has tried to leverage interest in big data tools. However, the company has faced difficulties convincing customers to maintain or expand their use of OnBar rather than switching to alternative databases.

Refinancing existing leases would provide Informix with lower interest costs and additional financial flexibility, according to executives. The company currently pays around $15 million per year in interest on its lease obligations. 

Any new capital raised would be used to pay off debt, fund sales and marketing efforts, and potentially acquire complementary businesses. "We believe Informix continues to have significant potential, but we require additional resources to fully realize that potential," said Chief Executive Steve Fishback in a press release.

While Informix pursues refinancing options, its shares have come under pressure, declining over 50% in the past year amid the sales slowdown and uncertainty over the company's future. However, Mr. Fishback remains optimistic.  "With the right strategic decisions and capital structure, we can return Informix to growth and maintain our leadership in data management," he said.
