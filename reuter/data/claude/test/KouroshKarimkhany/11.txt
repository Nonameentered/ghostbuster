3Com Corp. Stock Plummets After Third-Quarter Earnings Miss Wall Street Expectations

Shares of technology giant 3Com Corp. plummeted more than 25% in trading today after the networking equipment maker missed Wall Street forecasts for third-quarter earnings and revenue. The company reported net income of $107 million, compared with $125 million a year earlier, as revenue fell 11% to $862 million.

The results failed to meet analysts' expectations of earnings of $0.24 per share and revenue of $920 million, leading investors to sell off shares in the company en masse. 3Com, which competes with Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc. and other networking companies, has struggled in recent quarters amid slowing spending on technology products. 

"While our financial results did not meet our targets, we have been taking decisive actions to restructure 3Com for improved operating and financial performance," said Bruce Claflin, 3Com's chairman and CEO. "We remain confident in our business and products as market leader, and we continue to make progress in reducing operating expenses, " Clafin said. 

Several analysts downgraded 3Com's stock following the earnings announcement, citing concerns over revenue and profit growth. "While management outlined some aggressive steps to reduce expenses and improve profitability, we remain cautious on 3Com given the difficulty the company continues to face stimulating demand in a weak enterprise market," said Ron Corn, technology analyst with Merrill Lynch. Corn lowered his rating on 3Com shares to "sell" from "neutral."

For the third quarter ended March 1, 2001, 3Com reported revenue of $862 million, down 11 percent from $972 million for the same period last year. Net income for the quarter was $107 million, compared with net income of $125 million for the third fiscal quarter of 2000. Earnings per share were $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $0.29 per diluted share for the same period of the prior year. Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2001 was $3.05 billion, compared with $2.82 billion for the same period of fiscal 2000.
