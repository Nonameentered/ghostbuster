3Com Reports 17% Rise in Profits, Predicts Business Will Pick Up in Fourth Quarter

3Com Corporation, a leading provider of network infrastructure products and services, announced today that third quarter profits rose 17% from the same period last year. The company reported earnings of $0.32 per share, up from $0.27 per share a year ago. Revenues also increased 10% to $857 million. The results beat analysts' expectations of $0.29 per share in earnings and $840 million in revenue.

"We are very pleased with our performance this quarter, especially in our core networking segments," said Bruce Claflin, 3Com's CEO. "Sales of our high-end routers and Ethernet switches drove the revenue and earnings growth. We are also starting to see some recovery in Asia Pacific, which has been a weak area for the past few quarters."

3Com is benefiting from a rebound in business spending on technology infrastructure after the recent recession. As corporate profits have recovered, companies have invested more in network equipment and software to improve connectivity and boost efficiency. 3Com, which competes with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks, has gained market share in the Ethernet switching and routing sectors over the past year, according to several independent analysts.

However, the company warned that sales are likely to soften somewhat in the fourth quarter before picking up again in 2011. 3Com predicted fourth quarter revenue in the range of $815 million to $835 million and earnings per share between $0.28 and $0.30 per share. "Seasonal factors will cause a temporary dip in sales, but we see signs of accelerating growth going into the new year," said Claflin. Analysts had expected stronger guidance from the company for the fourth quarter. 3Com's stock price dropped nearly 5% in after-hours trading following its quarterly earnings report.

For the full fiscal year, 3Com raised its revenue forecast to $3.4 billion to $3.42 billion, up from previous guidance of $3.36 billion to $3.4 billion. The company expects earnings in the range of $1.20 to $1.22 per share for the year, an increase from its prior forecast of $1.17 to $1.19 per share. "We've gained traction in many areas of our business and the overall climate continues to improve," Claflin said. "We look forward to sustaining double-digit revenue growth in 2012."
