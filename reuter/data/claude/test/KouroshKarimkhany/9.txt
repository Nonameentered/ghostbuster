Apple to Consolidate Marketing and Development Units to Cut Costs, Wozniak Returns as Advisor 

In a surprise move, Apple announced today that the company will be consolidating several of its marketing and product development divisions into single units to reduce operational costs. The reorganization comes as Apple's revenue growth has slowed over the past two quarters. 

Apple will combine its marketing teams for Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac into a single marketing unit. Multiple product design and engineering teams will also be joined into a unified group. The restructured divisions are aimed at simplifying Apple's organization and eliminating overlapping efforts between teams.

"By consolidating common functions across individual product lines, we can scale operations in a more efficient and sustainable way," said Tim Cook, Apple CEO. "This will allow us to be nimbler in response to market demands while continuing our high standards of design, quality, and customer experience."

As part of the restructuring, Apple announced that Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, will be returning to the company to serve in an advisory role. Wozniak has remained on the periphery of the company since leaving in 1987 but maintains close ties with many Apple engineers and executives. In his new position, Wozniak will provide input on product development and help mentor Apple's next generation of designers and engineers.  

"Steve founded this company with a passion for making tech accessible and enjoyable for everyday people, and that philosophy remains deeply embedded in Apple's DNA," said Cook. "His decades of experience will be invaluable as Apple enters this next period of advancements across technologies."

The marketing and engineering consolidations represent one of the broadest reorganizations at Apple since the company restructured to focus on categories like the Mac, iPod, and iTunes in the late 1990s. While industry analysts see the moves as a way for Apple to trim costs amid slowing revenue growth, the addition of Wozniak to a formal advisory role suggests Apple will maintain its emphasis on visionary thinking and innovative design.

The reorganization is expected to reduce Apple's operating budget by 5 to 15 percent annually, according to financial analysts. Share prices of Apple stock rose over 2 percent on the news, reflecting investor confidence in Apple's new direction. The changes will take effect starting next quarter and continue rolling out over the next year, according to the company's announcement.
