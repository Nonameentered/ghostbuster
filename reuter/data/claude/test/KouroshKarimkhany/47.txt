Apple to Release Operating System that Runs Mac Software on PCs with Intel Chips and Microsoft Windows 

In a surprise announcement today, Apple said it will release a version of its Mac operating system that will run on personal computers with Intel processors and Microsoft Windows software. The new operating system, called MacOS for Windows, will allow owners of Windows PCs to run Apple's macOS and all Mac applications.

For decades, Apple's Mac computers have run on Apple's proprietary operating systems and were powered by Apple's own chips. In 2005, Apple transitioned to Intel chips for its Macs but still ran its own operating system. This move to bring the MacOS to industry-standard Intel chips and Windows PCs opens up a huge new potential market for Apple and its popular apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Xcode.

"There are hundreds of millions of Windows PCs in the world, and now they can all run the world's most advanced desktop operating system and all the Mac apps users know and love," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. The move is a major win for Windows PC owners who have long wanted access to Apple's exclusive software. However, it also risks cannibalizing some Mac sales as some customers opt to simply upgrade their existing Windows machines rather than buying new Macs.  

The new MacOS for Windows requires a PC with an 7th generation or later Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 8 gigabytes of memory, and at least 25 gigabytes of available storage space. MacOS for Windows is compatible with Windows 10 version 1903 and newer. At launch, the software will cost $149, the same price as the current version of macOS for the Mac.   

While the move to bring macOS to Windows PCs is unexpected, Apple may see it as a way to boost the audience and revenue for its subscription services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and additional iCloud storage. The company has been aggressively expanding into services to generate new revenue streams outside of Mac and iPhone sales. MacOS for Windows will be available for download from the Microsoft Store starting on October 15. This bold expansion of Apple's platforms is a pivotal moment that could redefine the desktop computing landscape.
