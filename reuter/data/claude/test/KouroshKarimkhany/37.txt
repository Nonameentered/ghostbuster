Apple Reports $708 Million Loss in Q2 But Expects Profit by Q4 

Apple Inc. reported a net loss of $708 million in the second quarter ending March 28, 2020, compared to a profit of $11.6 billion in the same quarter last year. The loss comes as Apple's supply chain and retail operations have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the temporary setback, Apple executives expressed confidence that the company will return to growth and profitability by the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.

Revenue for the second quarter fell to $58.3 billion, down from $58.5 billion last year. The slight drop in revenue reflects supply constraints on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, Apple's latest flagship smartphones. With many Apple stores around the world closed in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, iPhone sales tumbled to $28.9 billion compared to $31 billion last year.  

Sales of iPads and Mac computers were also down from a year ago as Apple's production facilities and component suppliers in China were shut down for much of February and March. Services revenue, including music, payments, and cloud storage, continued to grow to $13.3 billion, cushioning the fall in hardware sales.

"Despite COVID-19's unprecedented global impact, we're proud to report that Apple grew in June quarter revenue with both iPhone and Services setting June quarter records," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Apple is in a position of strength, and we're optimistic about the road ahead."

The results for the second quarter are a snapshot of the early impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on Apple's operations and consumer demand. With supply chain disruptions resolved and most Apple retail stores reopening around the world, executives expect iPhone sales to rebound in the coming months. The launch of new iPhones models later this year is also anticipated to drive a strong recovery.   

Apple declined to offer specific guidance for the third quarter ending June 27, 2020 citing ongoing uncertainty. However, Luca Maestri, Chief Financial Officer, said Apple expects revenue to grow in the fourth quarter compared to last year, signaling a return to profitability by the end of the calendar year. While the road ahead remains rocky, Apple appears well-positioned to navigate the economic fallout from the health crisis. With loyal customers, a strong balance sheet, and new products on the horizon, Apple looks set to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength.
