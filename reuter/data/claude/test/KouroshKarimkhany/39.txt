Personal computer shipments rise 15.4 percent in Q1 with strong sales by Compaq and IBM, Dataquest reports

The global PC market continues to surge as shipments of personal computers rose 15.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, bolstered by strong sales of desktop and laptop computers, according to the market research firm Dataquest.

Leading PC makers Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. saw significant growth, with Compaq shipments up 32 percent and IBM's up 22 percent. In all, 57.9 million PCs were shipped worldwide in the January through March period, Dataquest said. 

"The PC market is very healthy right now due to solid demand from both businesses and consumers," said Mei Xu, senior analyst at Dataquest. "And major suppliers like Compaq and IBM continue to drive sales with compelling new products and aggressive pricing."

Compaq held onto its position as the top PC maker, with sales of 11.6 million units giving it a 20 percent share of the worldwide market. Second-place IBM shipped 9.3 million PCs for a 16 percent share. Dell Computer Corp. ranked third at 7.8 million units, followed closely by Hewlett-Packard Co. and NEC Corp. of Japan.

In the U.S., PC shipments rose 17 percent to 18 million units. Compaq led with 26 percent of the market, followed by Dell with 20 percent and IBM with 17 percent. Sales of portables, including laptops and notebook computers, rose 18 percent worldwide.

"Notebook computers have become extremely popular, especially for mobile business users and students," said Xu. "We're seeing more affordable prices plus longer battery lives, more powerful processors and bigger screens -- all of which are driving notebook sales."

Desktop PCs still make up the bulk of the market, though growth is slowing. Desktop shipments rose 15 percent globally to 39.9 million units.

The solid first quarter bodes well for PC makers to meet or exceed earlier forecasts of 12 to 15 percent shipment growth for the year. Consumer demand is expected to remain strong, while businesses continue to invest in new technology.
