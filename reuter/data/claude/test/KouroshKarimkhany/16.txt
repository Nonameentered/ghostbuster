Sony Cuts U.S. Prices on PlayStation, Boosting the Video Game Industry 

Sony Interactive Entertainment announced today that it is permanently cutting the retail prices of its PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro gaming consoles in the United States. The PS4 will now retail for $250, down from $300, while the more powerful PS4 Pro will retail for $350, down from $400.

The price cuts come as Sony aims to continue the strong momentum of the PlayStation platform heading into the crucial holiday season. The PS4 has dominated this console generation, selling over 100 million units since launching in 2013 and holding a commanding lead over Microsoft's Xbox One. However, in recent years Nintendo's hybrid Switch console has also sold very well, putting pressure on both Sony and Microsoft.

Analysts expect the PS4 and PS4 Pro price cuts to further boost sales for Sony. "At these lower price points, the PS4 and PS4 Pro will be very appealing options for casual gamers and families looking for gifts this holiday season," said Piscatella, an analyst with The NPD Group. "The additional sales from price cuts like this can mean the difference between a good year and a great year for hardware sales."

The video game industry as a whole has benefited from strong hardware sales, with the PS4 and Switch helping drive software and services sales to record heights. The industry generated $43.4 billion in revenue in 2018, up 18 percent from 2017, according to NPD. Sony's platform is particularly important for large publishers like Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft, who count on PlayStation for a major portion of their revenue.

While next-generation consoles from both Sony and Microsoft are expected in 2020, strong sales of the PS4 and PS4 Pro will continue to boost Sony's gaming division. Gaming made up nearly 25 percent of Sony's $78 billion in revenue last year and is seen as essential to the company's profitability and share price. By dropping prices heading into the busy holiday shopping season, Sony is aiming to maximize sales of its current generation platform before the next versions launch next year.
