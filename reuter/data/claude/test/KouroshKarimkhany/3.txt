Apple to Lay Off More Employees and Discontinue Product Lines in Effort to Return to Profitability  

Apple announced another round of layoffs this week along with plans to discontinue several product lines in an effort to cut costs and return the company to profitability. The iconic technology company has struggled in recent years with slowing sales, increased competition, and a dearth of innovative new products.

Apple said it will lay off an additional 1,300 employees, primarily in its retail stores and marketing divisions. The cuts come on top of the elimination of 2,000 jobs Apple announced earlier this year. Once a fast-growing company, Apple now has a workforce of 127,000, down nearly 10% from its peak of 137,000 employees two years ago.   

In addition to the job cuts, Apple revealed it will discontinue three products that have seen weak demand: the iMac Pro desktop computer, the iPad mini, and the Apple WiFi router. "We are tightening our focus and simplifying our product lines to better align with customer needs and enhance profitability," said CEO Tim Cook in a statement.

The moves to restructure come as Apple struggles with a slowdown in its core iPhone business and a lack of major new product categories. iPhone revenue and unit sales have declined for two consecutive quarters, and sales of other products like the iPad and Apple Watch have been flat. Apple has not released a breakthrough new product since the Apple Watch in 2015, leading some analysts to question whether the company has lost its innovative edge. 

"Apple needs to get its mojo back," said tech analyst Jeff Pu. "Rehashing the same products with only incremental changes is not going to return the company to the days of explosive growth. Tim Cook and his team need to take bolder steps to reinvigorate the innovation pipeline if they want Apple to thrive over the next decade."

To boost growth, some investors argue Apple should look to acquire or invest in high-potential companies developing technologies like self-driving cars, streaming media, and virtual or augmented reality. However, Cook has been reluctant to make large acquisitions and has preferred for Apple to develop new technologies in-house.

The new round of cost-cutting is designed to boost Apple's profitability after two quarters of declining earnings. Its most recent quarterly profit declined 16% as revenue fell 5% compared to the prior year. Apple's share price has dropped over 10% in the past year, though the company still has a very strong balance sheet with over $200 billion in cash reserves.

With its cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, Apple hopes to return to revenue and profit growth later this year. But only a breakthrough new product can restore the company to the upward trajectory that made it the world's first $1 trillion company just two years ago. The future of one of America's most iconic brands may depend on Apple's capacity for continued innovation.
