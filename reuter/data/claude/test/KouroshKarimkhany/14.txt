Vantive Corp. Agrees Deal with Federal Express, Potentially Worth Millions in Revenue 

Vantive Corp., a leading provider of customer relationship management software and services, announced today that it has signed a multi-year licensing agreement with global shipping giant Federal Express. Under the terms of the agreement, Federal Express will deploy Vantive’s flagship CRM product, CustomerOne, across its global operations. The deal is potentially worth tens of millions of dollars in revenue for Vantive over the initial 3-year term of the agreement.

CustomerOne is Vantive’s all-in-one customer relationship management platform, allowing companies to track customer interactions, gain data-driven insights into customer needs, and optimize the customer experience. According to a statement from Vantive, Federal Express selected CustomerOne to gain a “360-degree view” of its customers and provide consistent, personalized service through all of its divisions and regions. 

“We are thrilled to add Federal Express to our growing list of leading multinational clients,” said Amy Liang, CEO of Vantive Corp. “Federal Express is synonymous with fast, reliable shipping and logistics, and by deploying CustomerOne at an enterprise-wide level, they have demonstrated their commitment to delivering an exceptional customer experience at every touchpoint.”

For Federal Express, the rise of e-commerce has meant surging demand for fast and flexible delivery options to serve both business and retail customers. However, with a global workforce of over 450,000 people, providing a seamless customer experience across regions and divisions had become increasingly challenging without an integrated CRM solution in place. 

“CustomerOne will allow us to gain a holistic, real-time understanding of all our customers and their needs on a global scale,” said John Smith, CIO of Federal Express. “Whether a customer is shipping sensitive medical supplies, perishable goods or the latest e-commerce order, we will now have the tools in place to not only meet but anticipate their needs at every stage of the shipping process. This is a game-changer for us and will allow us to set a new standard for customer service in our industry.”

Representatives from both companies stated that the global deployment of CustomerOne is expected to begin immediately and be fully operational within the next 12-18 months. Financial details of the agreement were not publicly disclosed. Vantive Corp. shares rose over 7% on the news, reflecting the significance of the deal for the company’s growth and long term success.
