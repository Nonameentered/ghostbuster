Rational Software Corp. to Acquire Rival Pure Atria Corp. in $839 Million Deal Despite Stock Slide

Rational Software Corp., a maker of software development tools, said Monday it agreed to acquire rival Pure Atria Corp. in a stock deal valued at $839 million. The deal comes as shares of both companies have slid on concerns about slowing growth in technology spending.

Under the terms of the deal, Rational will exchange 0.65 share for each share of Pure Atria. The offer values Pure Atria shares at $31.63 each, a 37% premium over Friday's closing stock price.

The combination of Rational and Pure Atria is aimed at strengthening the companies' positions in the software modeling and design tools market.

"This merger brings together two of the strongest companies and product lines in the software engineering tools industry," said Paul Levy, chairman and chief executive of Rational Software. "The combined company will have the people, technology, and resources to provide customers with an unmatched platform for software innovation."

However, shares of both Rational and Pure Atria fell sharply Monday, highlighting investors' concerns about the outlook for technology stocks and mergers in general. Rational shares fell $4.94, or nearly 11.6%, to close at $37.81 on Nasdaq. Pure Atria shares fell $3.75, or 14.4%, to $22.38.

The drop in the companies' shares Monday reduced the value of the deal to $754 million. And the drops follow a prolonged slide in shares of both companies this year amid a broader decline in technology stocks. Before Monday's fall, Rational shares were down 62% from their January peak, while Pure Atria had dropped 54% over the same period. 

The deal is a sign of how quickly fortunes can change for technology companies. Just last year, valuations of software companies
