Informix Corp. shares plummet after weaker-than-expected sales and substantial loss reported in Q1

Shares of Informix Corp. plunged nearly 30% today after the software company reported much weaker than expected first quarter results. The company reported a loss of $1.52 per share on revenue of $543 million, well below analysts' expectations of a loss of $0.68 per share on sales of $590 million. 

Informix blamed a sharp slowdown in sales of its database management software for the shortfall. License revenue from new database software sales declined 18% from a year earlier. The company also took impairment and restructuring charges of $67 million related to the acquisition of data analytics startup Quodata last year.

"Q1 results clearly fell short of our objectives and expectations," said Informix CEO Frank Smith in a statement. "The overall business environment remained challenging, and our performance in the database segment slowed significantly."

The weak quarterly report prompted several investment banks to downgrade Informix's stock. Argus Research lowered its rating to "sell" from "hold" and cut its price target to $12 from $18. "Informix's turnaround plans are taking longer than expected while growth continues to decelerate," said Argus analyst Lisa Thompson. "There are too many execution risks here for us to remain confident in the shares."

Informix, based in Seattle, was once a leader in relational database software but has struggled in recent years amid fierce competition from Oracle, Microsoft, and open-source databases like MySQL. The company has been trying to pivot to data analytics and cloud services to jumpstart growth, but progress has been slow. Revenue from Informix's data analytics division rose just 3% last quarter, and cloud revenue remains a tiny fraction of overall sales.

The company said it expects sales declines to continue in the second quarter due to economic uncertainty and the shift to cloud computing. Informix projected Q2 revenue of $520 million to $540 million and an operating loss of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. For the full year, the company trimmed its revenue forecast to $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion from $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion and projected a loss of $3.10 to $3.30 per share.

Investors sent Informix's stock tumbling $4.15, or 29.6%, to $9.85 in early trading following the announcement. The shares have declined 67% over the past 12 months. With its latest plunge, Informix's market capitalization stands at just $1.5 billion, a fraction of its peak valuation of over $40 billion during the dot-com boom two decades ago.
