Apple Computer Inc. to Announce Thousands of Job Cuts and Huge Loss for Second Quarter 

Tech giant Apple Computer Inc. announced today that it will cut thousands of jobs and report a massive loss for its second fiscal quarter. The cuts come as Apple struggles with declining sales of its once dominant Macintosh computers and related products. 

Apple said it will eliminate 3,150 jobs, nearly 10% of its workforce. The cuts will impact divisions across the company, including sales, manufacturing, and research. The job losses are the latest in a series of cuts over the past several years that have reduced Apple's workforce by more than half from its peak of over 35,000 employees in the 1990s.

The company also said it will report a loss of $1.3 billion for the quarter ended March 31, its third consecutive quarterly loss. Revenue declined by more than 35% from the same quarter a year ago. Apple has been hit hard by the slowing personal computer market and competition from lower-cost PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple's share of the worldwide PC market has slipped to under 4%, down from a high of 12% in the early 1990s.  

"We are making very difficult but necessary decisions to get Apple back on track," said CEO Tim Cook in a press release. "Our product pipeline is strong and we have amazing new innovation on the horizon. But we must scale back our operations to ensure we have a sustainable future."

The news sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, where Apple was once a dominant force that helped establish the region as a global technology hub. Many analysts and longtime Apple observers worry the company that famously underwent a turnaround in the late 1990s after the return of co-founder Steve Jobs may be facing an existential crisis without a clear path to renewed growth. The latest cuts and losses are a sobering reminder of how much the company still depends on a single product line, the iPhone, for the majority of its revenue and profits.

Apple's board of directors has come under fire for failing to diversify revenue sources and over relying on incremental upgrades to existing products. However, the board expressed confidence in the leadership team and its ability to execute new product plans. Apple continues to spend heavily on research and development, fueling speculation about new products on the horizon in areas like augmented and virtual reality. But after several years of rumors with no new major product unveiled, many analysts wonder if Apple has lost its innovative edge. The coming months may be crucial in determining whether Apple still has surprises up its sleeve, or whether the iconic companyâ€™s best days may now be behind it.
