Global PC Shipments Increase 18% in 1996, with Compaq, IBM, and Dell Leading the Way, While Apple Suffers Biggest Decline, Dataquest Report Shows 

The worldwide market for personal computers grew by a robust 18% in 1996, according to a report released today by research firm Dataquest. The growth was fueled by strong demand for PCs across all regions, especially in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.

Leading PC manufacturers Compaq, IBM, and Dell enjoyed strong growth and gained market share in 1996. Compaq shipped 4.9 million PCs, up 24% from the previous year, solidifying its position as the top global PC maker. IBM remained in second place but posted an impressive 29% increase in shipments to 4.3 million PCs. Dell continued its meteoric rise, with shipments surging 54% to 2.9 million PCs, strengthening its hold on third place.

Meanwhile, Apple Computer suffered the steepest decline among major vendors, with shipments slumping 42% to 1.4 million Macintosh PCs. The drop reflects Apple's ongoing challenges in competing with Windows-based PCs that dominate the market. Apple's worldwide market share slid to 4.3% in 1996 from 7.3% the previous year.  

"The market is seeing a flight to low-cost, standardized systems and components, which Apple has struggled against," said John Brown, Dataquest's PC analyst. "However, if Apple can successfully launch its new operating system and families of Macs over the next 6-12 months, it's possible the company can regain some lost ground and be reinvigorated."

In the U.S., PC shipments rose 13% in 1996. Compaq held onto its lead, with shipments up 18% to 3 million PCs, while Dell saw rocketing growth of 63% to 1.9 million PCs. Still, IBM gained more market share on the strength of a 22% increase in shipments. Apple's shipments inched up just 2% in the U.S., with its market share dipping to 8.7% from 10.3% in 1995.

Continued strong demand for PCs should fuel overall worldwide growth of 15-17% in 1997, Dataquest forecasts. Much of that growth will continue to come from Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets as PC penetration remains relatively low. If Compaq, IBM and Dell can maintain their momentum, and Apple stages a turnaround, the industry could be poised for another standout year of expansion.
