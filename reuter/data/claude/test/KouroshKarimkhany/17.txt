Sony Slashes PlayStation Price by 25% in Expected Boost for Video Game Industry 

Sony Interactive Entertainment announced a 25% price cut for its PlayStation 4 gaming console today in a move aimed at boosting sales and driving growth in the $150 billion global video game industry. 

The price of the PlayStation 4 will drop from $399 to $299 effective immediately, according to a Sony press release. The price cut is the second for the PS4, which originally launched in November 2013 with a $399 price tag. Sony previously cut the price to $349 in 2015.

The video game industry has experienced significant growth in recent years fueled by the rise of eSports, the popularity of battle royale games like Fortnite, and the mainstreaming of gaming culture. However, hardware sales have started to slow on aging devices like the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. By slashing prices, Sony hopes to reinvigorate sales of the PS4 and the high-margin software and services that run on the platform.

“We have made the strategic decision to further accelerate the expansion of the installed base of PlayStation 4 and the thriving PlayStation Network community,” said John Kodera, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “The best place to play is on PlayStation 4, and we want as many people as possible to experience the excitement of gaming and all that PS4 offers.”

The PS4 is the top-selling console of this generation with over 96 million units sold since its launch. However, sales have declined in recent quarters. Sony sold 3.2 million PS4 consoles in the third quarter of 2018, down from 5.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. The price cut could help boost sales in the all-important holiday shopping season and push the PS4 past the 100 million units sold milestone.

While the PS4 price cut is a short-term win for consumers, it puts pressure on Microsoft to make a similar move for its Xbox One console. The Xbox One currently starts at $299, similar to the new PS4 pricing. If Microsoft did cut Xbox One prices, it could set off a broader price war in the video game industry which relies heavily on hardware sales...
