3Com Stock Plummets After Earnings Announcement and Price Cuts Due to Competition from Intel Corp.  

Networking equipment maker 3Com Corp. saw its stock price plunge nearly 50% today after the company announced lower than expected earnings for the second quarter and cut prices in the face of stiff competition from rival Intel Corp. 3Com reported earnings of $0.15 per share, far below analysts' expectations of $0.23 per share. Revenue also came in light at $242 million for the quarter.  

In response to the worsening financial results, 3Com announced a series of deep price cuts, especially on its high-end networking switches and routers. The price cuts are aimed at regaining market share from Intel, which entered the networking market five years ago and has quickly become a formidable competitor. Intel has aggressively cut into 3Com's market share over the past several quarters with its own line of advanced networking products at lower price points.  

The combination of the poor earnings report and price cuts announcement sent 3Com shares into a tailspin. The stock opened the day at $24.50 per share but sank rapidly to close at $12.75 per share, down nearly 48% for the day. The plunge wiped out over $2.4 billion in market capitalization for 3Com. Some analysts downgraded 3Com in the wake of the announcements, with Bear Stearns cutting its rating from “Peer Perform” to “Underperform.” In a research note, Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff wrote, “3Com's once dominant position in enterprise networking equipment has eroded far faster than anyone anticipated due to Intel's incursion. The company's response with drastic price cuts signals that the competition is taking an enormous toll."

The sharp stock drop and price cuts are the latest setbacks for 3Com, which was once a pacesetter in the networking equipment market. However, the company failed to keep pace with technological changes and the entry of new competitors over the past decade. While 3Com pioneered early Ethernet technology and the 3Com Palm PDA, it ceded leadership in many areas to rivals like Cisco Systems and Intel. The company has attempted turnaround efforts in the past to no avail. Some analysts are now questioning whether 3Com has a viable long term strategy to survive in its current form.

The outlook is not any brighter for the next quarter. 3Com projects further revenue and earnings declines, citing ongoing competitive pressures. The company did not provide specific guidance but warned analysts to significantly lower their estimates. With its stock in a tailspin and more financial struggles on the horizon, 3Com appears to have its back against the wall with limited options to engineer a turnaround. 3Com will have to take dramatic steps to overcome its competitive challenges avoid further losses of market share and shareholder value. The path forward is uncertain for the former high-tech titan.
