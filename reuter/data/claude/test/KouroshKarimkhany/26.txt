Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison Expresses Interest in Buying Apple 

Larry Ellison, the founder and chairman of Oracle Corporation, said today that he would be "very interested" in acquiring technology giant Apple Inc. Ellison made the comments during an interview at the Code Conference in California. 

"Apple is an amazing company and I'm very close with Tim Cook," said Ellison. "If he and the board wanted to sell, I would be very interested." Apple's market capitalization currently stands at over $2 trillion, so an acquisition by Oracle would likely be very expensive and complex. However, Oracle maintains a strong balance sheet with over $59 billion in cash and investments.

Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977 and served as CEO until 2014. He has a long history of making bold acquisitions to expand Oracle's portfolio, including the purchases of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems, NetSuite, and Autonomous. An acquisition of Apple would be by far Oracle's largest deal and give it control of the world's preeminent consumer technology brand. 

Apple and CEO Tim Cook have given no public indication that the company is for sale. Apple remains highly profitable, generating over $57 billion in net income during its last fiscal year. However, some analysts have questioned Apple's ability to continue growing revenue and profits at the same pace in the coming years, especially with slower iPhone sales. An acquisition could infuse Apple with more resources for research and development to create future breakthrough products.

When asked about potential antitrust issues arising from a theoretical deal, Ellison said he believed regulators would likely approve an Oracle-Apple merger if proposed. "I think both companies are very consumer friendly, despite what some critics say," said Ellison. "This would not be an anticompetitive acquisition in our view."

The potential blockbuster deal reflects Ellison's penchant for making bold strategic moves to transform Oracle. However, many analysts remain highly skeptical about the likelihood of Apple agreeing to be acquired any time soon, given its strong performance as an independent company and the confident vision recently expressed by Tim Cook about Apple's future product pipeline. Unless circumstances change significantly, it appears an Oracle-Apple merger may remain confined to Ellison's speculation.
