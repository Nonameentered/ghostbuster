Apple Cuts 4,100 Jobs and Discontinues Consumer Computer Line in Latest Restructuring Effort  

Apple announced today that it is cutting 4,100 jobs globally and discontinuing its popular MacBook and iMac computer lines for consumers. The move is part of a larger restructuring aimed at refocusing the company on its more lucrative services and mobile device businesses.

The job cuts represent about 5% of Apple’s total workforce. The company said the reductions will be made through voluntary buyouts and natural attrition, and that it will provide severance packages to staff who leave the company. The cuts are the largest Apple has made in more than five years as the company struggles with slowing growth, particularly in China.  

“we have to make tough decisions from time to time to stay focused on our priorities and execute on our plans,” said CEO Tim Cook in an email to staff. However, he noted the job cuts were “by no means easy,” and said the company would do all it could to help staff transition to new opportunities.

The discontinuation of the MacBook and iMac lines, once mainstays of Apple’s product lineup, is a dramatic step for a company that has always prided itself on vertical integration of hardware and software. However, as iPhone and iPad sales now make up a vast majority of Apple’s revenue and profit, the company said it had to shift resources to more promising areas.

“Our customers are clearly moving to mobile and web services, so we are evolving with them by realigning our focus,” said Cook. In recent years, sales of Mac computers have remained stagnant or declined, even as the overall PC market has slowly grown.

The restructuring is the latest in a series of moves Apple has made to boost revenues from services and pivot more to mobile as the smartphone wars have intensified. Last year, Apple unveiled new streaming video, gaming, and credit card services to supplement its devices. The company is also said to be developing augmented reality glasses and self-driving car technology.

Apple’s share price rose 4% on the news, suggesting investors approve of the renewed focus. However, the job cuts and MacBook line cancellation could dent Apple’s reputation for innovation and commitment to top-quality hardware products. The company continues to face pressure to unveil new hit devices as well as diversify into new areas to fuel future growth.

Though painful in the short term, analysts say Apple’s restructuring positions the company well for continued success in the 2020s and beyond. Trimming less profitable lines and staff positions them to invest in more lucrative growth areas. By embracing high-margin subscription services and new technologies, Apple seems poised to remain a leader for years to come. But the company will have to deftly navigate the transition to new products and a renewed focus on software and services to thrive in an era of increased competition.
