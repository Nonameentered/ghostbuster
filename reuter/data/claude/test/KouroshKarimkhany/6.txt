Apple Chairman Suspends Executive Bonuses Until Consistent Profits are Reported 

Tim Cook, the CEO and chairman of Apple Inc., announced today that he is suspending executive bonus payments until the company returns to consistent growth and profitability. In an internal memo to employees that was leaked to the media, Cook acknowledged that Apple has "faced significant challenges" in recent quarters with slowing demand for the iPhone and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration making its products more expensive.  

"While our challenges are temporary, they are real, and they will require constant focus and a concerted effort from everyone to overcome," Cook wrote in the memo. "In light of this situation, I have decided that Apple's executive team, myself included, will not be paid any cash bonuses until the company is reporting year-over-year revenue and profit growth again."

Apple's executive bonus program typically amounts to tens of millions of dollars per year that is paid out based on the company's financial performance and share price. The fact that Cook is voluntarily suspending this program for himself and his top lieutenants signals how serious the situation has become for the world's largest technology company.

Apple's revenue and profits have declined over the last two quarters as consumers hold onto their iPhones longer and an ongoing trade war with China makes its flagship products more expensive. In an effort to spur demand, Apple cut prices for the iPhone for the first time earlier this year. The company is still hugely profitable, but its era of massive growth from the iPhone appears to have plateaued.

Cook said in the memo that he is "confident" Apple will work through these challenges, but that requires "patience, focus, and executing flawlessly at every level of the company." He praised employees for their "tireless dedication and hard work" and said he wanted them to know that "management is shouldering this burden right there with you."

The move to suspend executive bonuses is an extraordinary step that illustrates how Apple is pulling out all the stops to try and reaccelerate growth. Cook has led the company since 2011, but this may be one of the toughest periods in his time at the helm. Investors and consumers will be watching closely to see if Apple's new product pipeline and price cuts are enough to get the tech giant back to the kind of growth it has enjoyed for most of the last decade. Overall, the announcement shows the strain that slowing iPhone sales and trade tensions are putting on even America's largest companies.
