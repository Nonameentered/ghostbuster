Larry Ellison Forms Independent Investor Group to Gauge Interest in Apple Acquisition

Tech billionaire Larry Ellison is exploring the possibility of putting together an investor group to acquire a major stake in Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. 

Ellison, the co-founder and former CEO of Oracle Corp., has had preliminary discussions with other investors about potentially acquiring a large block of Apple shares, the people said. Ellison has not decided whether to proceed with the effort and there is no guarantee a deal would be forthcoming.

The move comes as activists investors circle some of the largest tech companies, including Apple. While Ellison is not typically an activist investor, any push to gain more influence at Apple could fuel existing speculation about leadership succession plans at the company.

Apple's shares have risen more than 30% over the past 12 months, giving the company a market value of nearly $2.2 trillion. But some analysts worry the company has become overly dependent on the iPhone, which makes up more than half of Apple's sales. The company is working to diversify by developing new subscription services and other digital offerings. 

With a personal fortune estimated by Bloomberg to be $66.2 billion, Ellison is one of the few individuals with the means to accumulate a sizable stake in Apple. It is unclear how much of Apple he might aim to acquire, though even a 1% stake at current prices would be valued at more than $20 billion. As a longtime tech executive and investor, Ellison may believe he has strategic insights that could benefit Apple.

Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977 and led the database and business software company as CEO until 2014. Though he gave up day-to-day leadership, he continues to serve as chief technology officer and chairman of Oracle. The company announced his plans to step down as chairman in December.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Ellison didn't respond to requests for comment.

While tech companies often have powerful founders and leaders, they usually don't exert as much influence as dominant shareholders. By accumulating a major stake, Ellison could gain more sway at a company that faces several challenges in sustaining its success.

Apple has been searching for its next big source of growth as sales of the iPhone have slowed, though the company continues to generate billions of dollars in profit each quarter, mainly from services and accessory products. The Apple Watch, AirPod headphones and subscription offerings like Apple Music and iCloud storage have become new pillars of Apple's business. 

Still, many investors worry whether newer products can make up for an eventual decline in iPhone sales as the smartphone market matures. Prominent activist hedge fund manager David Einhorn has argued Apple should return more cash to shareholders. 

Ellison's effort suggests at least one high-profile investor sees an opportunity in Apple if the right strategic moves are made. Any push to shake up leadership or the boardroom, however, could prove contentious given Apple's success under the current team.
