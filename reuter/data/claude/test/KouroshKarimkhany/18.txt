Apple to Announce Bigger-Than-Expected Job Cuts and Forecasts Big Loss for Second Quarter, Analysts Say 

Apple Inc. is preparing to cut thousands of jobs and forecast a sizable loss for its second fiscal quarter, according to analysts briefed on the company's plans. 

The technology giant is grappling with slowing iPhone sales and the effects of China's coronavirus epidemic on its supply chain. The planned cuts of more than 5,000 jobs would be the largest reduction at the Cupertino, California company since Chief Executive Tim Cook took the reins in 2011. Along with the job cuts, Apple is likely to report a loss of as much as $2 billion for the March quarter when it announces earnings on April 30, according to the analysts.

The moves reflect the challenges buffeting Apple, the most valuable U.S. company.  The coronavirus health crisis has pummeled smartphone sales in China, one of Apple's most important markets, and the company has suffered supply-chain interruptions. At the same time, Apple's iPhone sales growth has stagnated globally as consumers hold on to their phones longer.

In response, Cook and his lieutenants have mapped out a plan to cut costs and better allocate resources. The job cuts will likely fall on divisions such as marketing, consulting and AppleCare, though divisions such as artificial intelligence and health may see growth, according to the analysts. Apple employs about 147,000 people, more than half of whom work in retail.

The expected quarterly loss would be the first for Apple since 2003 and stemmed from slumping consumer demand and store closures in China. Still, the analysts forecast Apple's business to rebound in the following quarter as retail stores reopen and factories come back online. And they predict a wave of new 5G-enabled iPhones in the fall may spur a surge in upgrades.

Apple declined to comment on the analysts' reports.                       

The anticipated belt-tightening at Apple comes as other Silicon Valley stalwarts take similar actions. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has slowed hiring, Facebook Inc. is slashing its marketing budget and Standard & Poor's 500 firms are cutting earnings forecasts for the second quarter at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis, according to FactSet data.

With its stock still up about 30% over the last year, however, Apple can make difficult choices from a position of strength, said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co. "They have a cushion that other companies don't have," he said.
