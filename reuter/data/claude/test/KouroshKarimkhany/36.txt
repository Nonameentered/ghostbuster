Apple Reports $708 Million Loss in Second Quarter Despite Strong Sales of New PCs and Laptops  

Apple Inc. reported its second-quarter financial results today, posting a net loss of $708 million even as sales of its new computer systems remained strong during the three-month period ending June 30. The earnings disappointment came a day after Apple unveiled its latest line of personal computers that will ship in October.

Revenue for the second quarter rose 36.7% to $1.81 billion compared with $1.32 billion in the same period last year. However, higher costs and expenses caused the company to tumble into the red. Apple attributed the results to its failure to quickly reduce costs as sales slowed. The earnings mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for the Cupertino, California, company. 

Apple shipped 457,000 Macintosh computers in the second quarter, a 34% increase from 342,000 units a year ago. The sales growth was fueled by strong demand for the company’s newest products -- the iMac all-in-one desktop computer and the PowerBook G3 laptop. Since their introduction last May, Apple has sold 1.1 million iMacs and 770,000 PowerBook units, helping to double Apple’s U.S. market share.  

In a conference call with analysts, Apple executives expressed optimism that recently introduced upgrades should sustain the momentum. Earlier this week, Apple unveiled faster iMacs with brighter displays and speedier PowerBook laptops with higher capacity drives and wireless networking. The new iMac line starts at $1,200, while the PowerBook models range from $1,999 to $3,499, with all available in October.  

“We've launched over a dozen hit products in the last 16 months that are fueling a resurgence of customer interest in the Mac platform,” said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim CEO. “With strong demand, rising market share, and new and exciting products, we enter the third fiscal quarter with solid momentum.”  

Still, analysts cautioned that Apple still faces significant challenges going forward, including intense competition from PC rivals, a slowing PC market, and its continued operating losses. Apple expects third quarter revenue between $1.7 and $1.8 billion and a net loss in the $150 million to $250 million range. The company remains burdened by high costs, including restructuring charges, development expenses and promotional spending.

Investors reacted mildly to the report in after-hours trading, with Apple shares rising 56 cents, or 1.5%, to $38. Despite the second-quarter loss, Apple's stock has soared more than 60% in the past 12 months due to the success of the iMac and PowerBook and optimism over the company's turnaround prospects under Steve Jobs.
