Intel's Launch of New Pentium II Microprocessor Threatened by Glitch 

Intel Corporation planned to launch its highly anticipated Pentium II microprocessor today, but the rollout has been delayed due to a manufacturing glitch that caused a small percentage of the chips to malfunction. The Pentium II processor, initially codenamed “Klamath,” is Intel’s newest and most advanced microprocessor for desktop and mobile computers. However, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the manufacturing process that led to intermittent system freezes and crashes during final quality testing of the new chips.

“We discovered this issue during our final qualification testing and we are working around the clock to remedy it before launching the Pentium II,” said Claude Leglise, Intel's head of microprocessor engineering. “While frustrating, it is far better that we catch this type of problem before the chips are in the hands of our customers.”

The Pentium II represents Intel’s latest salvo in the ongoing battle for dominance in the $26 billion microprocessor market. The chip is designed to enable powerful multimedia applications, stream video, and deliver realistic 3D graphics for gaming and other applications. “The Pentium II will deliver unmatched performance and capabilities for both new and existing software applications,” Leglise said.

However, any delays in bringing the Pentium II to market provides an opening for rival chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Cyrix, which are preparing to launch competing microprocessors this spring and summer. AMD in particular has recently made inroads into Intel's market share, especially in lower-cost personal computer systems. 

“Intel's stumble gives AMD an opportunity to gain further ground, especially if their own next-generation processors avoid similar issues,” said Fred Smith, a microprocessor analyst with Reykjavik Technical Research. “A prolonged delay or additional quality problems with the Pentium II could really help AMD continue reshaping a microprocessor market that Intel has dominated for over a decade.”

Intel expects the Pentium II manufacturing issues to be resolved within the next two to four weeks and does not anticipate significant shipment delays or supply constraints as a result. The company has notified its major computer manufacturer partners, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Compaq, about the delay and will update customer ship date estimates once a solution has been implemented. Intel's stock price dipped two points on news of the technical issue before recovering most of the loss by market close. Overall, investors appear to be taking Intel's problem in stride for now, but all eyes will be on the company to get its critical new offering out the door without further delays or setbacks.
