Headline: Video Game Software Industry Bounces Back with Strong December Quarter Results 

The video game software industry rebounded strongly in the December quarter of 2022, boosted by blockbuster releases late in the year. Industry sales jumped 32% in December to $19.97 billion, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail and digital sales. Several major franchises released big titles during the quarter that fueled the surge in revenue.

The action-adventure game “The Last of Us Part III” from Sony Interactive Entertainment sold over 10 million copies, a record for the franchise. The open-world role-playing game “Cyberpunk 2078” from CD Projekt also exceeded sales expectations, selling over 8 million copies in the quarter despite its buggy launch. 

Nintendo released “Pokémon Scarlet” and “Pokémon Violet” exclusively for the Switch gaming console. The twin titles sold a combined 16 million copies, making it Nintendo's best-selling game launch in the company's history. Microsoft's “Forza Motorsport 8” racing game also posted strong numbers, selling over 12 million copies for Xbox gaming consoles.

The December quarter results stand in stark contrast with the September quarter, when industry sales declined over 10% due to a lackluster lineup of new games. Coming off a slow September quarter, analysts had expected only modest growth in the December quarter. The blockbuster releases and their record-setting sales numbers led to the huge rebound.

“The fourth quarter results show how a few highly-anticipated titles can lift the overall industry,” said Mat Piscatella, an analyst with NPD Group. “When you have diverse, high-quality offerings from major developers and publishers hitting the market, it leads to an influx of new purchases and a rise in spending.”

Industry observers expect the momentum to continue into the first quarter of 2023. Several major franchises including Ubisoft’s “Far Cry” and Activision’s “Call of Duty” have announced new installments set for release in the coming months. If the early 2023 slate of releases can match the success of the December quarter, the video game industry may be poised for a very strong year overall.
