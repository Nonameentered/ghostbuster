AMD Challenges Intel with Faster and Cheaper K6 Microprocessor  

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled its latest K6 processor today, posing a formidable challenge to Intel's dominant share of the microprocessor market. The K6 microprocessor is AMD's fastest and most advanced chip to date, providing significantly better performance than previous AMD processors as well as Intel's similarly priced Celeron and Pentium processors.

The K6 runs at speeds up to 550 megahertz, compared with a maximum of 500 megahertz for Intel's Pentium III and 433 megahertz for the Celeron. In benchmark tests performed by independent computing experts, the 550-megahertz K6 outperformed the Pentium III by up to 35% and the Celeron by up to 70% while running standard desktop applications, an impressive showing for AMD.  

Even more striking is the K6's aggressively low pricing. AMD is selling the 550-megahertz version for just $149, nearly half the price of Intel's Pentium III at the same speed. Lower-speed versions start at just $99. The bargain pricing will potentially save consumers and businesses hundreds of dollars per computer.

"The K6 microprocessor offers the fastest performance and best value of any PC processor available today," said AMD's Chairman and CEO W. J. Sanders III at a press conference this morning. "For too long, Intel has charged premium prices for processors with mediocre performance. AMD is giving customers the power they want at a price they can afford."

AMD's share of the microprocessor market has risen steadily over the past five years based on the strength of affordable yet capable chips. However, the Sunnyvale, California-based company still controls only about 15% of the market, with the remainder dominated by Intel. The K6 may help AMD capture additional market share, especially among budget-conscious computer makers and consumers. It appears AMD has developed an innovative product at an opportune time, delivering exactly what many PC buyers want right now: more speed for less money. Overall, today's K6 announcement placed AMD in an enviable position to gain ground on its main rival.
