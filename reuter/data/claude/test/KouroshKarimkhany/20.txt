Apple Plans to Cut 4,100 Jobs in Second Major Restructuring in 12 Months 

Apple Inc. announced plans to cut 4,100 jobs in the second major restructuring of its workforce in the last 12 months. The tech giant said it would eliminate some divisions and reorganize others as it adapts to slowing growth in the smartphone market. The job cuts come on the heels of a similar announcement last January when Apple said it was cutting 9,000 positions.

"We are streamlining some of our operations to focus more keenly on Apple's priorities," said CEO Tim Cook in an email to staff. He said the cuts would primarily affect divisions that no longer aligned with Apple's key focus areas of developing self-driving cars, augmented reality technology, and original streaming media content. Eliminated roles would span software engineering, marketing, and retail store support.

The move reflects the struggles Apple faces as the smartphone market has matured and sales of its flagship iPhone have slowed. Apple continues to rely heavily on the iPhone for the bulk of its revenue and profits. While still highly profitable, Apple's revenue growth has decelerated in recent years. The company is attempting to reduce its dependence on the iPhone through new products like the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as new services such as its streaming music and TV offerings and its News subscription service.

The latest job cuts worried some analysts that Apple's best days of heady growth and category-defining innovation may be behind it. "This is not confidence-inducing," said Mike Feibus of Techknowledge Strategies. "It is an indication that they have concerns about growth and they need to cut costs." However, others saw the cuts as necessary pruning that would allow Apple to focus on its most promising opportunities.

The restructuring is scheduled to begin in February and end by March, according to Cook's email. Apple employed 137,000 full-time workers as of last October, making it one of the largest public companies in the U.S. by workforce. Its shares fell 2% on the news of the layoffs.
