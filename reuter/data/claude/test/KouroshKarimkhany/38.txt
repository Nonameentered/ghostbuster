AirTouch Communications to Acquire U S West Media Group's Cellular Phone Operations for $4.5 Billion in Stock and Debt  

AirTouch Communications Inc., one of the nation's largest cellular telephone companies, announced a deal yesterday to acquire the cellular assets of U S West Media Group Inc. for $4.5 billion in stock and the assumption of $1.8 billion in debt.

The acquisition is among the largest in the rapidly consolidating U.S. wireless communications industry. It combines U S West's 1.3 million cellular customers across 14 Midwestern and Western states with AirTouch's 4.8 million customers in 19 states. The deal would elevate AirTouch to the No. 2 spot in the U.S. cellular market with more than 6 million subscribers.  

"This strategic combination significantly expands our national presence and accelerates our growth opportunities," said Sam Ginn, AirTouch's chairman and chief executive officer. "It underscores our commitment to enhancing long-term shareholder value through quality acquisitions."

Under the terms of the agreement approved by both companies' boards, AirTouch will exchange 0.545 shares of its common stock for each U S West cellular customer, a ratio that values those customers at $3,450 each. AirTouch also would assume $1.8 billion of U S West's cellular-related debt. The deal requires regulatory approval and is expected to close in early 1999.

The market cheered news of the deal, as AirTouch's stock price gained $4.375 to close at $37 on the New York Stock Exchange. U S West's stock gained 87.5 cents, closing at $43.875, also on the NYSE.

Wall Street analysts said the deal makes strategic sense as the wireless market consolidates. It gives AirTouch additional scale and reach at a reasonable price, they said. The customer value is in line with recent deals in the industry.

The combined company would have pro forma 1998 revenue of $4.6 billion and 11.5 million subscribers, surpassing AT&T Wireless as the second largest U.S. cellular provider, behind GTE Corp. With the deal, U S West Media is largely exiting the wireless telephone business to focus on its core operations as a local telephone service provider and high-speed Internet access company.
