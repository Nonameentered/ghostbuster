Apple Suspends Executive Bonus Plan Until Profitability is Restored

Apple Inc. announced today that the company will suspend its executive bonus plan for 2021 until profitability and revenue growth are restored following a sharp decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic slowdown. 

The move comes as Apple reported its steepest quarterly drop in revenue and profits in over a decade. Revenue declined by 7% in the most recent quarter ending in June, and profits fell by 18%. The declines were driven by a plunge in sales from Apple's largest revenue segments, including the iPhone, Mac computers, and accessories like AirPods and the Apple Watch.

"The challenges of this moment are unlike any we have ever seen," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a memo to employees announcing the executive bonus suspension. "As we work to build our way out of this crisis in a responsible way, we are temporarily suspending the semi-annual cash bonus for executives and pausing dividend increases for a time."

The executive bonus plan typically amounts to cash payments of up to 200% of executives' base salaries, which can amount to tens of millions of dollars per year for Apple's top leaders like Cook. The dividend increases, which Apple has issued annually, provide a benefit to shareholders and also signal the company's financial strength and stability.

Apple stock fell over 4% in after-hours trading on the news before recovering some losses. The company's shares are still up over 30% from their March lows but remain down about 5% for the year to date.

The challenges facing Apple's business have been mirrored across much of the technology sector and in other industries. With rising unemployment crimping consumer spending and many retail stores still closed or operating at limited capacity, a broad economic recovery remains uncertain. 

Apple did not provide guidance for the coming quarter ending in September, citing the "limited visibility and uncertainties" in the current environment. The company's board will revisit the executive bonus and dividend plans once revenue and profit growth have returned to more normal levels.
