Australia's Trust Bank Attracts Interest from Local and Offshore Groups for 49% Stake 

Australia's Trust Bank, a mid-sized regional bank valued at $1.5 billion, has received expressions of interest from multiple parties seeking to acquire a 49% stake, according to sources familiar with the matter. Trust Bank, which operates in central and northwest Australia, is looking to sell a minority interest to shore up its capital base and fund growth.

The bank has received bids from three Australian private equity firms, two regional banks and one of Australia's big four banks, the sources said. Offshore interest is also building from investment groups in Malaysia and China that are looking to gain exposure to Australia's stable and growing financial sector.

Trust Bank would prefer to sell its stake to private investors rather than an Australian bank, as that would reduce competition in the regional markets it serves, the sources said. Private equity firms in particular see an opportunity to invest in Trust Bank and accelerate its expansion, with a possible exit in 3 to 5 years. The investment groups are also attracted to up regional banks given Australia's strong economic fundamentals and population growth in secondary cities.   

Trust Bank has solid fundamentals itself but needs to boost its Tier 1 capital ratio to meet new regulatory standards Australia is adopting. Trust Bank's CEO, Jane Thompson, has previously said the bank would consider a minority stake sale to fund capital and growth after reporting solid results for the 2017 fiscal year. She has stressed that Trust Bank must retain its independence and community focus as an integral part of its identity.   

Analysts say a 49% stake sale at a valuation of $1.5 billion could provide over $700 million in capital to Trust Bank and value the bank's shares well above their current trading levels. There is also speculation Trust Bank could pursue an initial public offering in 2-3 years to provide an exit for new investors and raise additional capital, if market conditions are favorable.

The bidding process is expected to run for several more weeks. Any deal would be subject to regulatory approval, including by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Trust Bank was advised it must strengthen it capital levels at its last oversight review published in March.
