Australia's biggest privatisation: State-owned power station and coal mine sold for A$4.86 billion  

The New South Wales government has announced the sale of the Vales Point Power Station and associated coal mine for A$4.86 billion to a consortium including Squadron Energy, a Singaporean firm, and Q-Energy, an Australian renewable energy company. The sale represents the largest privatisation of state-owned assets in Australian history.

The Baird government launched a review of state-owned energy assets upon coming to power in 2014 and has been seeking to privatise several power stations and mines in an effort to raise funds for new infrastructure projects. The Vales Point coal-fired power station located on Lake Macquarie and the associated coal mine have long been seen as prime targets, given their age and relatively low efficiency.

The 800-megawatt Vales Point power station was commissioned in 1978 and is considered technologically obsolete by industry standards. The adjacent coal mine has struggled with high costs in recent years as it has been forced to dig deeper underground to access coal seams. However, the new owners have pledged to overhaul the power station to improve its efficiency and lower its environmental impact. They aim to convert the plant to operate on a mix of coal and biomass, increasing its renewable energy generation.

The sale has drawn a mixed reaction from industry and environment groups. The Australian Energy Council welcomed the privatisation and said the new owners would "bring fresh ideas and capital" to transform the ageing asset. The Climate Council, however, criticised the NSW government for selling off coal-fired power stations and mines instead of transitioning to renewable energy. "This is a short-sighted move that will only prolong the life of obsolete technology and pose a barrier to a smooth transition to renewables," a spokesperson said.
