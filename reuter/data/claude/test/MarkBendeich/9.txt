Coles Myer Reports 41% Surge in Earnings, Marking First Profit Rise in Almost Two Years

Coles Myer Ltd, Australia’s second largest retailer, has reported a 41% surge in half-year earnings, posting its first rise in profit in nearly two years. 

The company announced a net profit of $441 million for the six months ending December 31, up from $313 million in the same period a year earlier. The result reflects solid sales growth, improved profit margins, and cost cutting across the business.

Revenue from continuing operations rose 3.5% to $20.6 billion, while comparable store sales growth accelerated to 3.1% from 2.1% a year ago across Coles supermarkets and liquor stores. Coles attributed the result to its ‘freshness’ campaign promoting high quality fresh produce. The liquor division also benefited from the relaunch of stores under the ‘First Choice’ brand.

“We are pleased with the progress we have made in transforming our business,” said Coles CEO John Durkan. “Our customers are responding well to our focus on providing better value, quality and innovation.”

Coles’ increase in profit margins reflected moves to simplify product ranges and cut costs. The company’s cost-cutting drive, known as ‘Project Simplify’, reduced expenses by $134 million in the half. Coles has also reduced head office costs and is renegotiating supplier contracts to lower procurement costs.

The turnaround in Coles’ performance provides a boost for its parent company Wesfarmers. “Coles has delivered a very pleasing first half result with strong momentum building in its turnaround,” said Wesfarmers Managing Director Richard Goyder.

Coles faces ongoing challenges, including intensifying competition from Woolworths and Aldi, and weak consumer sentiment. However, Mr Durkan said Coles was “confident in the sustainability” of its improved performance and gaining market share. He expects further earnings growth and cost savings in the second half of the financial year.

The result confirms Coles’ revival under Mr Durkan, who took the helm in July 2014. After struggling for years in the wake of Wesfarmers’ $19 billion takeover of Coles in 2007, Australia’s second largest supermarket chain may have finally regained its footing. Investors reacted positively to the result, pushing Wesfarmers shares up 2.2% in early trade.
