Colonial Ltd reports A$38 million loss in 1996 after major restructuring costs 

Colonial Ltd today reported a full-year loss of A$38 million for the 1996 financial year. The loss was largely attributed to major restructuring costs as the financial services company moved to overhaul its operations.

Excluding restructuring costs of A$97 million, Colonial Ltd said it would have reported an operating profit of A$59 million, a 10% increase on the previous year. The company announced in January it was cutting 600 jobs and closing 74 branches as part of a broad restructuring program aimed at improving efficiency and cutting costs. 

CEO Steve Bennett described 1996 as a "watershed year" for Colonial Ltd. "The comprehensive restructuring and repositioning of the company, although difficult, was essential to enabling Colonial Ltd to grow profits in the years ahead," Mr Bennett said.

Colonial Ltd's core businesses reported steady results, with lending up 15% to A$32 billion, funds management up 18% to A$43 billion and insurance premium revenue up 5% to A$1.3 billion. The restructure is aimed at consolidating Colonial's position in these key markets.

Mr Bennett said the company is now leaner with a lower cost base that provides a strong platform for growth. "With the costs and uncertainty of restructuring behind us, we are focused on the future and confident about our ability to harness opportunities and deliver value to shareholders," he said.

Colonial Ltd also announced a final dividend of 16 cents per share, taking the full-year dividend to 32 cents, a 3% increase on the previous year. The company forecasts earnings growth of around 10% for the 1997 financial year.

The news sent Colonial Ltd shares up 9 cents, or 2.8% higher at $3.24, still well below its year-high of $4.08 in March amid concerns over the scale of the company restructure.
