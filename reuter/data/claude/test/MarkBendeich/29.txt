Pasminco plans major share issue to fund $1 billion Century zinc project

Mining company Pasminco Limited announced plans today to issue $650 million in new shares to help fund the development of its Century zinc deposit in northwestern Queensland. The Century project is one of the largest undeveloped zinc deposits in the world, with an estimated resource of over 200 million tons of zinc ore.

Pasminco expects the Century mine to produce around 500,000 tons of zinc concentrate per year over its initial 25-year mine life, generating strong cash flows and returns for shareholders. The company has secured environmental approvals and mining leases for the project but needs additional funding to proceed with construction of the mine and processing facilities. 

The share issue will significantly dilute existing shareholders but Pasminco's Managing Director John Hodges said the capital raising is critical for the company to develop Century and secure its position as a leading global zinc producer. "The Century project is a world-class asset that will transform Pasminco into a major base metals mining house. While the share issue is large, Century's economics are extremely robust and this funding will unlock tremendous value for shareholders over the coming decades," Mr. Hodges said.

Major shareholders, including Glencore and Nyrstar, have pledged their support for the capital raising. The issue will be offered to eligible institutional investors at a fixed price of $3.50 per share, which represents a 20% discount to Pasminco's last closing share price. Mr. Hodges said the company expects strong demand from institutions attracted by Century's prospects. 

The capital raising is subject to shareholder approval at Pasminco's Annual General Meeting next month. If approved, the company aims to complete the share issue in September and commence construction at Century shortly thereafter. Production at the new mine is targeted to start in mid-2023.
