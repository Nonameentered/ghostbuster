Largest Privatisation in Australian History: State-Owned Power Station and Coal Mine Sold for A$4.86 Billion

The New South Wales government today announced the sale of Vales Point Power Station and associated coal operations for A$4.86 billion to a consortium of private investors. The sale represents the largest privatisation of state-owned assets in Australian history. 

The Vales Point power station is a 2,640 MW coal-fired facility located on Lake Macquarie, north of Sydney. It provides up to 20% of the state's energy needs. The associated coal operations include the Vales Point coal mine and train loading facility, which provide fuel for the power station.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the sale was "a win for taxpayers, energy customers and the NSW economy. This landmark sale has delivered the best outcome for the state by reducing debt and unlocking value from an asset that had little strategic importance for the government."

The consortium that has acquired the assets is led by private equity firm Apollo Global Management and also includes infrastructure investor First Sentier Investors and an unidentified Chinese power company. "We see great potential in these high-quality energy assets which provide essential power to households and businesses across New South Wales," said Apollo senior partner Matthew Nordby. 

However, the sale was opposed by the state opposition and some consumer advocacy groups. "This is a short-sighted fire sale of public assets that provides a one-off boost to revenues at the expense of generations to come," said Shadow Treasurer Michael Daley. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre has argued that privatisation often leads companies to raise prices and lower reliability to maximise profits.

The consortium has committed to continuing operations at the power station and associated coal facilities for at least the next decade. The mining lease for the Vales Point coal mine still has over 50 years of reserve life, indicating the assets could operate for many years into the future. However, there are questions about the long term viability of coal-fired power as Australia transitions to more renewable energy under its Paris Agreement obligations.

The sale proceeds will be used to pay down debt in the government's balance sheet, with net debt forecast to fall to A$20.8 billion by 2020-21. However, critics argue that the loss of the revenue and dividend stream from these assets and greater use of contractors will ultimately cost taxpayers more in the long run. The privatisation continues the trend of state governments selling public assets to balance budgets, with mixed results for the public. The fate of the Vales Point power station and mine under private ownership remains to be seen.
