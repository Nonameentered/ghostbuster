Woodside Petroleum to Increase Exploration Spending in 1997 to Diversify Away from North West Shelf Gas Fields

Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum announced today that it will increase its exploration spending in 1997 by 20% to $200 million. The additional funds will be used to accelerate the company's diversification away from its core North West Shelf gas operations. 

Woodside currently generates over 80% of its revenue from natural gas fields in the North West Shelf, off the coast of Western Australia. However, with several of these fields maturing, Woodside is looking to diversify into new areas to secure its long-term growth. The company will focus its additional exploration efforts on offshore Western Australia, as well as on international opportunities.

“While the North West Shelf has been the foundation of our company for decades, we need to invest now in the next generation of assets that will drive Woodside’s growth into the 21st century,” said CEO John Akehurst. “Additional exploration is critical to developing new sources of production and securing our position as a leader in the global energy industry.”

Woodside recently acquired exploration permits for over 60,000 square kilometers off the coast of Western Australia, near its existing infrastructure. It hopes to leverage its facilities and expertise to develop any commercial discoveries in these areas. Internationally, Woodside is also expanding, with new exploration projects in Myanmar, Gabon, and Morocco.

However, diversification does not come without risks. Exploration is an uncertain business, and there is no guarantee of commercial success in any new prospect. The company’s earnings could decline in the coming years if new reserves are not found and brought into production. The additional spending announced today will also reduce Woodside’s profit margins in the short term.

Investors reacted cautiously to the announcement, with Woodside’s shares declining 2.3% in morning trading. While supportive of the long-term strategy, investors want to see results before fully endorsing the increased investment. If Woodside can succeed in its diversification, it will cement its position as a leader in the Asia-Pacific energy market. However, if its gamble does not pay off, it may struggle in an increasingly competitive landscape. The coming year will be crucial in determining Woodside’s future.
