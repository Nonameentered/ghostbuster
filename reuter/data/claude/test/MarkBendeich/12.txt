RTZ-CRA Announces Major Realignment and Confirms London as Headquarters

The mining giant RTZ-CRA today announced a major corporate realignment that will see the integration of most of its operations under a single management structure. In a move that cements London as the company's global headquarters, RTZ-CRA will consolidate into three business units based in the UK capital: industrial minerals, copper and diamonds, and energy minerals. 

The restructuring comes after a review of operations aiming to reduce duplication of roles across the company and increase cost efficiencies. The company has been under pressure in recent years as a result of weaker commodity prices reducing profit margins. The new structure is expected to streamline decision making and optimize the use of technology in operations spread across dozens of countries on six continents.

The industrial minerals division will oversee RTZ-CRA's interests in phosphate, titanium dioxide feedstocks and borates, bringing together assets in Florida, South Africa and Kazakhstan under one leadership team. The copper and diamonds division will be responsible for copper mines in Chile, Zambia, Mongolia and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as diamond projects in Australia, Botswana and Canada. 

The energy minerals unit will control coal mines in Colombia, South Africa, Australia and Indonesia as well as RTZ-CRA's uranium mines in Canada and Namibia. Oil production, mainly based in Equatorial Guinea, will also fall under this division. RTZ-CRA CEO Mark Thompson said the changes would "ensure we are best structured to generate maximum value from our unrivaled set of tier one assets.‚Äù

While a number of executive roles will transfer to London, RTZ-CRA said there would be no major job cuts as a result of the realignment. The company currently employs around 85,000 people in over 40 countries. However, future cost savings are expected to come through natural attrition and more centralized functions over time. The restructuring is planned to take effect from January 1 next year. Analysts have welcomed the move as a logical step to improve operational focus within the diverse portfolio of commodities and geographies in which RTZ-CRA operates.
