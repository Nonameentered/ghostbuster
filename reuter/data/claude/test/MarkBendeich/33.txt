Amcor Ltd Predicts Recovery in 1996/97 

Australia's largest packaging manufacturer, Amcor Ltd, announced today that it expects improved results in the 1996/97 financial year despite reporting a $30.3 million loss for the six months ending December 31, 1995. The company said the interim result was in line with expectations following major restructuring efforts after several years of decline. 

Amcor managing director Mr. Gerry Brown said the first half loss was due primarily to significant costs associated with the restructuring program but he expects the company to return to profitability in the second half. "The comprehensive restructuring program we have undertaken over the past two years is now nearing completion. Our food, beverage, and flexible packaging businesses have recorded continued strong performances which underline their competitive advantages," Mr. Brown said.

The company-wide restructuring program aimed at improving efficiency and cutting costs included the sale of underperforming businesses, upgrading of manufacturing equipment, and streamlining supply chains and product ranges. The restructuring is expected to deliver cost savings of around $65 million per annum once fully implemented.

Mr. Brown said Amcor's key markets are beginning to show steady growth and the company is poised to improve revenue and margins. "Provided the economy remains stable, we anticipate achieving an overall profit for Amcor for the 1996/97 financial year and a recovery in earnings in the next several years," he said.

The company declared an unchanged interim dividend of 8 cents per share. Amcor Ltd's share price has declined over the past year, reflecting the company's poor results, but market analysts said the latest announcement points to a potential turnaround in performance that could boost investor sentiment. Amcor Ltd shares closed up 2 cents at $2.62.
