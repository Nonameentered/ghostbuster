French Insurance Giant Axa-UAP to Sell Life Insurance in China's Emerging Middle Class Market  

The French insurance company Axa-UAP announced plans today to enter the Chinese life insurance market, targeting China's fast-growing middle class. Axa-UAP, Europe's second-largest insurance firm, sees huge potential in selling life insurance and other financial products to Chinese consumers as the country's middle class continues to expand rapidly.

"The Chinese middle class is expected to double in size over the next decade, creating tens of millions of new households that will demand access to insurance, savings, and wealth management products," said Thomas Buberl, chief executive of Axa. "We plan to tap into this opportunity."

Axa will launch a joint venture with the state-owned holding company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to sell life insurance to Chinese consumers across a range of channels. The venture, which still needs regulatory approval, would give Axa access to CNPC's extensive network of over 30,000 gas stations and oil refineries across China. Axa aims to sell policies and financial products at these locations as well as through digital channels and agents.

China's life insurance market is dominated by domestic companies but remains underdeveloped. Chinese people currently spend about $500 per year on insurance premiums, far less than in Western countries. But demand for life insurance and private wealth management is poised to soar as China's middle class continues to expand. McKinsey & Company estimates that China will be home to 550 million middle class consumers by 2022, more than the entire population of the United States and Western Europe combined.

Axa's joint venture faces stiff competition from leading Chinese insurers like China Life Insurance Company and Ping An Insurance, as well as global rivals Prudential, Allianz, and Manulife Financial, which also operate in China's life insurance market. However, China's immense scale means the market remains quite fragmented, and insurance penetration in China is still well below developed economy standards, highlighting the significant growth potential.   

Axa expects to gain necessary regulatory approvals within the next 6-12 months, allowing it to formally launch insurance and financial products with its new partner CNPC by mid-2021. If successful, China could become one of Axa's largest markets in Asia in the coming years and an important driver of growth as Europe's insurance market faces challenges from low interest rates and slow economic growth. Axa's move into China's booming financial sector may prove to be an opportunity of enormous potential.
