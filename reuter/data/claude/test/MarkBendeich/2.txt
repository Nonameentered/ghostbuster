Rebel Leader in Bougainville Fears Mining will Destroy Island if it Remains Part of Papua New Guinea

The president of the autonomous region of Bougainville, an island in eastern Papua New Guinea, has warned that mining interests will "destroy" the island if it does not gain independence from Papua New Guinea. Ishmael Toroama, the president of the autonomous government of Bougainville, said in an interview that Bougainville's copper and gold reserves make it a target for extractive industries if it remains under the control of Papua New Guinea after a referendum on independence.

Bougainville has an abundance of natural resources, including large copper deposits, and was the site of a civil war in the 1990s over the profits and environmental damage of the Panguna copper mine. The mine was a major contributor to Papua New Guinea's economy but also caused significant pollution. The crisis led to a blockade of the island and the mine's closure. But mining companies have expressed interest in reopening Panguna, and other mines, if political stability and regulatory certainty can be achieved.

President Toroama said "Our land, our sea, and our people will be severely damaged if Bougainville does not become independent.” He cited the example of the massive Ok Tedi mine in western Papua New Guinea which led to widespread environmental harm. “We don't want a repeat of the bad mining practices of the past that poisoned our land and rivers,” Toroama said. “As an independent nation, we can determine the destiny of our own land and protect it for future generations."

A referendum on independence is to be held in Bougainville in October. Toroama said he believes a majority will vote for independence to protect the island from exploitation. But the final decision remains with Papua New Guinea's parliament. President Toroama said he hopes Papua New Guinea will respect the will of Bougainvilleans if they vote for independence. “We have come too far to have our voices ignored,” he said. “Bougainville's future is at stake.”
