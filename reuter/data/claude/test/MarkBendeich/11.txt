RTZ-CRA Announces Major Realignment, London Confirmed as Capital  

The RTZ-CRA mining conglomerate announced a major realignment of its corporate structure today, confirming London as its new global headquarters and consolidating several business units into a streamlined operational model. 

The move is aimed at improving efficiencies, leveraging existing expertise across the company, and positioning RTZ-CRA for new opportunities in key growth areas. As part of the changes, the company will relocate its head office to London from its current Melbourne location. RTZ-CRA’s CEO Geraldine Smith said “London is the natural base for our global operations going forward. It provides an ideal hub for coordination with access to world-class talent, resources and infrastructure.”

Under the realignment, RTZ-CRA will reorganize into three primary divisions: Metals & Mining, Energy & Fuels, and Advanced Materials. The Metals & Mining division will encompass RTZ-CRA’s extensive base and precious metals mining operations across Australia, Africa, and South America. The Energy & Fuels division will focus on oil, gas and thermal coal, including major assets in Australia’s Bowen Basin and Papua New Guinea. The Advanced Materials division will harness RTZ-CRA’s rare earths, lithium and high-technology materials processing capabilities to service key growth sectors like renewable energy, electric vehicles and high-tech manufacturing.  

The new structure is the culmination of a strategic review initiated by Smith after she took over as CEO in January this year.  “Our new model will remove duplication, streamline decision making and open up more opportunities for employees to gain cross-company experience,” Smith said. “We have unmatched expertise and resources within RTZ-CRA but we have not always maximized the potential benefits. Our realignment addresses this and positions us to better service our customers and partners with tailored, integrated solutions.”
