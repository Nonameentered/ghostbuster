National Australia Bank Reports Record Half-Year Earnings But Warns of Vulnerability to Foreign Takeover 

National Australia Bank (NAB) announced record half-year earnings today but warned that Australian banks remain vulnerable to foreign takeovers. NAB reported a net profit of $5.7 billion for the six months ending March 31, up 6% from the same period last year. However, NAB Chairman Philip Chronican said  “While the Australian economy is performing well, the banking system is exposed given our relatively small population.”

The record results were driven by strong home loan growth, lower bad debt charges and cost cutting. Home loans grew at their fastest pace in a decade, up 7.6% compared to a year ago. NAB has been aggressively expanding into the home mortgage market to compete with rivals Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ANZ Bank. However, this growth in the home lending market has increased the risks for the overall financial system according to banking analysts.

Mr. Chronican noted that Australia’s banking market is dominated by the “Big Four” banks but represents a small fraction of the global banking industry. With total assets of only $2.7 trillion Australian dollars, Australia’s banking system could be a target for a foreign takeover.“Our scale is limited by the size of our economy. We need to be aware of our vulnerabilities in a global system with banks 10 or 15 times our size.” said Mr. Chronican.

NAB is the first of Australia’s major banks to report half-year results. Westpac and ANZ report earnings next week while Commonwealth Bank will report in early May. The strong results from NAB point to a healthy outlook for the banking sector according to financial analysts. However, the warning about foreign takeovers highlights risks facing the Australian economy from global economic forces outside its control.

The record half-year results announced today show why Australia’s major banks are attractive targets for foreign buyers. However, a takeover of a major bank could threaten stability in Australia’s financial system and economy. NAB’s warning about this vulnerability puts the issue front and center in discussions about the future of Australia’s banking sector. Overall, NAB’s results demonstrate the strength and profitability of Australia’s major banks but also their exposure to global threats outside the control of regulators.
