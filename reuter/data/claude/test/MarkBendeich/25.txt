Ansett Australia in Trouble: Major Changes Needed to Survive, says Chairman 

Ansett Australia, the nation's second largest airline, is in dire financial trouble and needs to make major changes to survive, according to Chairman Harry Timson. In an internal memo leaked to the media, Mr. Timson warned the company's 10,000 employees that Ansett faces collapse if it does not significantly cut costs and improve revenue.

"The airline industry is facing its biggest challenge in decades with the downturn in international travel and tourism. Ansett is not immune to these headwinds and we have already seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers and heavy losses in the first quarter of this year. If we continue on this path, our losses will add up quickly and threaten the viability of our operations," wrote Mr. Timson in the memo.

Ansett has been unprofitable for three of the past five years as it struggled with high fuel costs, increased competition from rival Virgin Australia, and excess capacity in the Australian market. The company narrowly avoided going into administration last year through cost cuts and a capital injection from its parent company, Air New Zealand. However, the latest warning from Mr. Timson suggests those measures were insufficient to turn around the troubled airline.

According to financial analysts, Ansett needs to implement much more aggressive changes to stabilise its financial position, including cutting at least 5,000 jobs, reducing flights by 30-40%, and renegotiating contracts with staff and suppliers to lower costs. Mr. Timson's memo indicates these types of actions are now on the table as part of a major business review to determine Ansett's strategy for the next three years.

The required restructuring will not be easy, particularly as many employees will likely lose their jobs or face lower wages and more difficult working conditions. However, most analysts argue that major reforms are unavoidable if Ansett aims to secure its future. The alternative, a collapse of Australia's second largest airline with major disruption to businesses and the tourism sector, would likely be even more damaging to the economy.

Stakeholders will now nervously await the outcome of Ansett's business review in the hope that a sustainable solution can be found to prevent the grounding of one of Australia's most iconic brands. After years of struggles, Ansett faces yet another battle to overcome mounting losses and maintain its position as a key player in Australia's aviation market.
