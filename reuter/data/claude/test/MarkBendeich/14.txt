Victoria Announces Nation's Biggest Gas Privatisation, Selling Gas Monopoly Gascor for A$4bn 

The Victorian government today announced the sale of the state-owned gas utility Gascor to a private consortium for A$4 billion, making it the largest privatisation of gas assets in Australia's history. Gascor is Victoria's monopoly distributor of natural gas, owning and operating over 20,000 kilometers of gas pipelines and supplying gas to over 2.5 million homes and businesses across the state.

Treasurer Tim Pallas said the sale represents “an outstanding outcome for Victorian taxpayers” that will strengthen the state's finances. The private consortium, including QIC, REST, and APA Group, will take full ownership and control of Gascor's extensive gas distribution network from January 1 next year. 

The sale comes amid a broader movement to privatise government-owned energy assets around Australia. New South Wales completed the controversial sale of their electricity "poles and wires" in recent years, while the Northern Territory and Tasmania have also privatised their major energy utilities. 

Proponents argue privatisation introduces greater efficiency, investment, and competition into utility sectors that have traditionally been government monopolies. However, critics argue it can lead to higher prices for consumers and lower service standards as companies prioritise profits over the public interest. 

Mark Smith, CEO of Gascor, said the business is now in a strong position for the transition to new private owners. "We have invested significantly in recent years to build a safe, reliable and efficient gas network that will continue powering Victoria for generations to come," Mr Smith said.

The government will pass legislation to support the sale, including price controls and service standards to protect consumers for an initial period. The proceeds from the sale will be used to fund new infrastructure projects across Victoria including level crossing removals and road upgrades.

While the sale was broadly applauded by the business community, it received a lukewarm reaction from consumer groups and the opposition. Opposition leader Robert Watts questioned whether now was the right time to be "selling off the farm", arguing the funds could be better spent investing to aid Victoria's economic recovery from COVID-19.

The sale of Gascor is expected to be completed on December 31, 2020. The new owners will officially take control of Victoria's vital gas infrastructure from the start of 2021.
