Comalco’s smelting division turns a profit, major expansion work pays off  

Comalco, the Australian subsidiary of Anglo-Swiss multinational Rio Tinto, reported today that its aluminium smelting division has returned to profitability after several years of losses. The division earned a net profit of $127 million in the 2018 financial year, a significant turnaround from the $423 million loss reported last year. 

The strong results were attributed to the completion of the company’s massive modernization and expansion project at its Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania. The $2.8 billion upgrade, completed in mid-2017, increased the smelter’s production capacity by 60 percent to 460,000 tonnes of aluminium per year. Improved efficiencies from the new equipment and technology, as well as higher aluminium prices on global markets, have driven the division’s return to profit.

‘This is an outstanding result that shows the huge benefits of our sustained investment in this business,’ said Diane Grady, chairwoman of Comalco. ‘The Bell Bay smelter is now one of the most cost-competitive, eco-friendly smelters in the world, putting us in a great position to capitalize on growing aluminium demand.’

The smelting division’s performance helped boost Comalco’s total net profit by 63 percent to $317 million. Group revenue rose by 12 percent to $12.5 billion, with strong demand and prices for aluminium and bauxite, Comalco’s other main product. The company increased its final dividend for shareholders by 5 cents to 60 cents per share.

While the smelting upgrade encountered significant delays and cost overruns, investors have welcomed the turnaround in the division’s fortunes. ‘There were some doubts about the huge scale of investment in the smelter, but today’s results show that it is paying off,’ said Michael Blogg, resources analyst at brokerage firm Monomax. However, he warned that the division’s profitability remained exposed to potentially fluctuating commodity prices and the health of the global economy.
