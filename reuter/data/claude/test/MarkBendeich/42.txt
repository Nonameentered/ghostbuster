Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board to Investigate Axa-UAP's Move into China, Insisting on Ownership by Australian Subsidiary

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) of Australia announced today that it will conduct an in-depth review of the French insurer Axa's acquisition of China's largest health insurance provider, UnionAsia Pacific Insurance (UAP). The AUD $19 billion deal, announced last month, would give Axa control of UAP and a major foothold in China's fast-growing health insurance market. However, the FIRB is insisting that UAP must remain wholly-owned by an Australian subsidiary to ensure that ownership and control of the company remains in Australian hands. 

Axa currently owns 33% of Australia's largest health insurer, Medibank. As part of the UAP acquisition, Axa proposed folding Medibank into UAP, which would effectively give the French company control over Medibank's Australian operations. The FIRB objected to this aspect of the deal, arguing that Medibank must remain a stand-alone company under Australian ownership. The review board has the authority to block any foreign investment in Australia that is deemed contrary to the national interest.

The FIRB's decision is a blow to Axa, which views China as a key growth market for its health insurance business. However, analysts say that Axa will likely agree to the conditions set by the FIRB in order to complete the UAP acquisition. "Axa has pursued UAP for over a decade and will not want this opportunity to slip through its fingers," said Jenny Wu, an insurance analyst at Macquarie Bank. "Accepting the FIRB's requirements, even if they are not ideal, is Axa's only path forward if it wants to establish itself in China's private health insurance market."

Established in 2015, UAP has already become China's top health insurer, with over 5 million customers and an annual growth rate of nearly 40% per year. Private health insurance in China is still in its infancy but is expanding rapidly due to rising incomes, longer lifespans, and more health risks from environmental pollution and unhealthy lifestyles. If approved, Axa's acquisition of UAP would make it the leader in what many view as the world's most promising health insurance market.
