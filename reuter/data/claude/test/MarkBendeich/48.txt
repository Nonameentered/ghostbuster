Shell Australia Seeks to Integrate North West Shelf and Gorgon Gas Projects Off Northwest Australia 

Shell Australia, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, announced plans today to integrate operations of its North West Shelf liquefied natural gas (LNG) venture and Gorgon LNG project off the northwest coast of Australia. The proposed integration aims to cut costs through synergies in infrastructure and resource sharing between the neighboring projects.

The North West Shelf project began producing LNG in 1989 and is Australia’s longest-running LNG venture. It is operated by Woodside Petroleum and has partners including Shell, BP, Chevron, and Mitsui. The North West Shelf project comprises offshore gas fields with a two-train onshore LNG processing facility near Karratha in Western Australia. 

The Gorgon LNG project, operated by Chevron, began production in 2016 and is located on nearby Barrow Island. The $54 billion project is Australia’s largest single resource development. The Gorgon partners include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Osaka Gas, and affiliates of PetroChina and Jera. The project has three LNG trains and a domestic gas plant.

Shell, a 25% stakeholder in both LNG projects, believes that greater coordination and connectivity between the neighboring ventures can generate significant cost savings and extend the operating life of infrastructure. According to Shell Australia Chair Zoe Yujnovich, “By working together, the North West Shelf and Gorgon can remain globally competitive for decades to come while also delivering greater benefits for Western Australia.”

The proposed integration would enable the joint use of infrastructure like loading and unloading facilities, storage tanks, tugboats, and maintenance resources. Combining some corporate and support functions could also reduce costs. However, the ventures would continue to operate separately with their unique upstream gas fields and LNG processing trains. Regulatory approval will be required from various government agencies before the projects can be integrated.
