Trust Bank of Australia Seeks Strategic Equity Partner for Expansion Beyond Tasmania  

The Trust Bank of Australia announced today that it is seeking a strategic equity partner to help fund its expansion plans beyond its home state of Tasmania. The mid-sized bank has ambitious growth targets to open new branches and increase lending in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland over the next 3-5 years. However, it requires an injection of capital to meets its targets while maintaining prudent capital ratios.  

Established in 1958, Trust Bank of Australia currently has 42 branches across Tasmania with over 500,000 customers. It is the second largest bank in Tasmania, with a 18% market share of deposits and loans. Despite a strong market position in its home state, the bank has struggled to expand its presence in the highly competitive mainland banking market. Several previous interstate expansion attempts in the 1990s and 2000s yielded mixed results.

The Managing Director of Trust Bank, Rebecca Smith, said “We believe the time is now right to pursue expansion opportunities in selected regional and metropolitan areas on the mainland. However, we want to ensure we have a strong capital base to fund this expansion in a sustainable manner. A strategic equity partnership is the most viable option to secure additional capital while allowing our existing shareholders to continue to own a majority stake in the bank.” 

Trust Bank will consider offers from major Australian banks, insurance companies, superannuation funds as well as private equity firms. The successful bidder will gain a shareholding of between 25 to 49 percent in Trust Bank, depending on the amount invested. Ms Smith said the capital raising and selection of an equity partner would take 6-9 months to complete. With additional capital and a strategic partner on board, Trust Bank aims to launch its interstate expansion strategy by early 2020.
