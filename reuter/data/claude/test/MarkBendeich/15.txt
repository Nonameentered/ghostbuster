Pacific Dunlop Ltd Expected to Report Heavy Annual Net Profit Fall with Possible Red Ink Bottom Line  

Pacific Dunlop Ltd, the Australian conglomerate, is expected to announce a sharp decline in annual net profit for the fiscal year ending June 30. According to analysts, the company could plunge into loss due to heavy restructuring costs and lackluster sales.

Pacific Dunlop has been reorganizing its business to focus on core operations. However, the restructuring has been costly. The company announced that it would book pre-tax charges of $200 million in asset write-downs and redundancies this year. The charges are expected to push the company into a sizable net loss, its first in over a decade.  

The drop in net profit is also due to weak demand across Pacific Dunlop’s main divisions. Its clothing and apparel unit has suffered from sluggish retail conditions. The company’s bedding and linen business is battling competition from lower-priced imported products. Meanwhile, Pacific Dunlop’s sprawling engineering and building products divisions have been hit by a sharp downturn in Australia’s construction industry.

Given the poor outlook, analysts forecast Pacific Dunlop’s net profit could plunge over 90% to about $10 million, from $122 million last year. Most analysts expect the charges and weak trading conditions to push the company into a net loss of approximately $50 million. The red ink and restructuring costs have taken a heavy toll on Pacific Dunlop’s share price which has dropped more than 30% over the past year.

Pacific Dunlop conceded that trading conditions have been "difficult" in many of its markets. However, the company said its restructuring program is on track and will position it for improved performance once economies pick up. Investors will be hoping for signs of a turnaround when Pacific Dunlop announces its full-year results at the end of the month.
