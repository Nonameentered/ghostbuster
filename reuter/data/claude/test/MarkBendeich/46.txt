Australian biotech firm creates unique salmonella vaccine for chickens and eyes cattle market 

An Australian biotechnology company has developed an innovative vaccine that protects chickens from salmonella infection. Melbourne-based Avaxia Biologics announced this week that field trials of its vaccine achieved a 100% success rate in preventing salmonella colonization in chickens.

The vaccine takes a novel approach by targeting a key protein required for salmonella to infect chickens. Salmonella bacteria require certain proteins to attach to and infect cells in the chicken's gut. Avaxia's vaccine stimulates the chicken's immune system to produce antibodies against one of these key proteins, known as MisL, effectively blocking the salmonella from infecting the birds.

"This is the world's first vaccine to target the MisL protein and it is showing tremendous potential to help stamp out salmonella in poultry flocks," said Dr. Heather Brookes, Avaxia's chief scientist. "The double-blind field trials showed complete protection against salmonella colonization in chickens."

Salmonella contamination of chicken meat and eggs causes over 2 million cases of food poisoning in humans each year in Australia alone, according to health department estimates. By preventing salmonella at the source in chicken flocks, the new vaccine could have a major impact on public health.

"This vaccine provides lifelong protection for chickens against salmonella and could be an important tool for farmers to improve food safety as well as animal health and welfare," said Dr. Brookes.

Avaxia is now gearing up production of the vaccine for commercial use in Australia and looking to gain regulatory approval in other markets, including the European Union and United States. The company is also investigating whether the vaccine could be effective for protecting cattle against salmonella, opening up an even larger market for the product.   

"We're extremely excited about the prospects of this unique vaccine, which has the potential to provide lifelong protection against a disease that has a major impact on chicken farmers, food producers, and public health around the world," said Avaxia CEO Dr. Tobin Meikle.
