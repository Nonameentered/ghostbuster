Dalai Lama urges Australia to pressure China for talks on Tibet's future

The Dalai Lama called on Australia to put pressure on China to negotiate with Tibetan leaders over the region's future during a speech in Sydney today. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader said China should feel "encouraged or compelled" to begin talks on granting meaningful autonomy to Tibet.

 In a wide-ranging speech delivered to members of Australia's parliament, the Dalai Lama said China needed to change its "hardline policy" in Tibet and recognize that Tibetans have a distinct language, culture and spiritual tradition from the rest of China. "The Chinese government considers us as splittists but in reality we are not seeking independence," the Dalai Lama said. "We are seeking a mutually acceptable solution to the issue of Tibet."

The Chinese government took control of Tibet in 1950 and considers it a province of China. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet during an anti-Chinese uprising in 1959 and established a government in exile in India. For decades, the Dalai Lama has called for devolving political authority from Beijing to Tibetans while keeping Tibet formally within China.

The Chinese government rejects any suggestion of Tibetan autonomy and accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking to split Tibet from China. It has criticized foreign leaders for meeting with him. The Dalai Lama's call for Australian intervention is likely to anger Beijing, which considers Tibet an internal issue.

 In his speech, the Dalai Lama thanked Australia for accepting Tibetan refugees and for its long-standing support for Tibetan rights and culture. But he said that as a close ally and major trading partner of China, Australia was in a unique position to have a strong influence. "You have leverage," he told members of parliament. The Dalai Lama is in Australia for a series of public lectures and meetings with lawmakers during an 11-day visit, despite strong objections from China.
