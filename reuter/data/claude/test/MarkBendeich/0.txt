Mayne Nickless Ltd aims to sell Optus stake worth A$1 billion by July

Mayne Nickless Ltd, the Australian logistics and healthcare company, is seeking to sell its minority stake in Optus, the country's second largest telecommunications company, by July this year. Mayne Nickless holds a 10.1% ownership interest in Optus that was acquired in 2001 as part of a broader A$1.5 billion deal. The stake is now valued at approximately A$1 billion.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Mayne Nickless has hired investment banks UBS and Macquarie Group to advise on the sale of the Optus holdings. The company is looking to sell the shares to institutional investors in a block trade, which is a sale of a large number of shares at once. The sale would provide funds for Mayne Nickless to pay down debt and reinvest in its core logistics and healthcare businesses.

Optus is 23% owned by Singapore's Singtel, with the remainder owned by institutional and retail shareholders in Australia. Singtel has held majority ownership of Optus since 2001 but there is speculation in the market that Singtel may be interested in buying additional shares to gain greater control and access to Optus' strong cash flows and profits. However, Singtel has not yet commented on its potential interest in the Mayne Nickless stake.

The sale comes as Mayne Nickless posted strong profits and revenue growth in 2018, driven in part by acquisitions in its logistics division and healthcare clinics. However, Mayne Nickless also carries high debt levels from past acquisitions, with net debt of A$1.6 billion at the end of 2018. Proceeds from the sale of the Optus holdings would significantly reduce Mayne Nickless' debt levels and interest costs. 

Mayne Nickless' board believes the company can achieve better returns by focusing on its core divisions rather than holding a minority stake in Optus. The company aims to double the size of its logistics operations over the next five years through new acquisitions and contracts. It is also expanding its network of medical clinics and pathology centers to capture growing healthcare demand in Australia. Selling the Optus shares will provide capital to fund these growth initiatives, which Mayne Nickless expects will generate higher shareholder returns in the long run relative to its stake in Optus.

The planned Optus share sale is subject to market conditions but Mayne Nickless is confident, given Optus' strong commercial and financial performance, that it can achieve an attractive price for its holdings that will benefit both companies. If successful, the block trade would be one of the largest placements of shares in Australia this year.
