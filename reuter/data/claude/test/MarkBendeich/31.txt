Coles Myer hopes for a cold, wet winter to boost struggling apparel business

Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailer, is hoping for cold and rainy weather this winter to help boost sales in its struggling apparel division. The company reported lackluster third quarter apparel sales today, citing unseasonably warm weather as a key factor in the poor performance. 

Coles Myer CEO Ian McLeod said cooler temperatures are critical to driving customer demand for winter clothing and footwear. "When the weather is mild, people simply don't need to update their winter wardrobes, and that impacts our sales," McLeod said. "We've planned our inventory and promotions around normal winter weather patterns, so we need the temperatures to drop to unlock that demand."

The apparel division, which includes brands like Kmart, Target, and Country Road, reported a 2.3% drop in comparable store sales in the third quarter. The division accounts for about 25% of Coles Myer's total revenue, so weak apparel sales weighed on the company's overall sales growth. Total comparable store sales grew just 0.1% in the quarter.

The poor apparel result offset stronger sales in Coles Myer's grocery, liquor, and convenience divisions. Comparable sales at Coles supermarkets rose 2.7%, while liquor sales at First Choice Liquor and Liquorland grew 5.9%. Coles Express convenience stores also reported a 4.1% lift in comparable store sales. 

"Our food and liquor divisions continue to perform well, but unseasonably warm weather has been a real drag on our apparel sales this quarter," McLeod said. "If winter arrives soon, we expect those sales to rebound and support stronger growth overall."

Weather data confirms that Australia's winter got off to a slow start this year. Maximum and minimum temperatures were well above average in May and early June across the country. However, forecasts point to cooler weather over the next few weeks, which could drive customers to stores for jackets, coats, and other winter essentials.
