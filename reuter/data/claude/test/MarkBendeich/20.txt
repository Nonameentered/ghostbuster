Consortium Minimizes U.S. Dollar-Component of Loy Yang A Power Station Deal  

A consortium of Australian and international investors announced today that its planned acquisition of the Loy Yang A coal-fired power station in Victoria, Australia will proceed with a significantly reduced U.S. dollar-denominated component. The consortium, which includes Macquarie Group, Aware Super, HESTA, and Thai-based RATCH Group, reached an agreement to purchase Loy Yang A for a reported A$993 million last December.  

Concerns over currency risk and exchange rate uncertainty due to global economic turmoil were cited as the key drivers behind restructuring the deal to limit its exposure to the U.S. dollar. Under the original terms, 35-40% of the funding was expected to be in U.S. dollars, but the consortium revealed it has secured commitments to fund nearly 85% of the deal in Australian dollars from domestic banks and institutional investors.

Simon Taylor, Managing Director at HESTA, said “In this time of increased unpredictability, ensuring the lowest risk profile achievable was our top priority in revisiting the funding mix for this transaction. Locking in the vast majority of capital in Australian dollars gives us much more stability and certainty.”

The Loy Yang A power station is Victoria's largest power station, supplying approximately 30% of the state's energy needs. The consortium has indicated its intention to upgrade and extend the life of the asset to continue providing affordable and reliable base-load power to Victorians for decades to come. 

In a joint statement, the consortium partners said, "We believe in the critical role that coal-fired generation must continue to play to ensure energy security and affordability in Victoria. Our goal is for Loy Yang A to remain the backbone of Victoria's energy system, and we will invest significant capital to modernize plant equipment, improve environmental performance, and deliver greater efficiency and lower emissions.”

The transaction is expected to be complete by the end of June, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals. While the final ownership stakes have not yet been made public, Macquarie Group and Aware Super are anticipated to hold the majority joint controlling interest in the consortium.
