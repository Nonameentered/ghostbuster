Coles Myer Ltd Reports 41% Surge in Half-Year Earnings 

Coles Myer Ltd, Australia's second largest retailer, announced a 41% increase in half-year earnings today driven by cost cutting and improved sales. Net profit rose to A$441 million in the six months ending December 31, up from A$312 million a year earlier.

The results beat market expectations and were achieved despite sluggish consumer spending over the Christmas season. Same-store sales, which exclude newly opened stores, increased 1.7% over the half. Coles Myer attributed the improved performance to more efficient operations, higher margins, and the success of its customer loyalty programs.

"Our half-year results demonstrate the benefits of our five-year turnaround strategy," said CEO Ian McLeod. "We have taken costs out, improved merchandise ranges, and provided better value and service to customers. Although the retail environment remains challenging, we are well positioned for continued earnings growth."

The company said it expects full-year net profit to rise by up to 23% from last year's A$665 million. The forecast excludes costs from the proposed merger with rival retailer Woolworths, announced last month. If approved, the A$22 billion merger would create an Australian retailing powerhouse with over 3,000 stores and A$60 billion in annual revenue.

McLeod said the merger with Woolworths would generate further cost savings and allow the combined group to compete more effectively against entrants like German retailers Aldi and Lidl. But the proposal faces scrutiny from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over its potential impact on shoppers. A final decision is expected in the coming months.

Coles Myer operates over 2,400 stores across Australia and New Zealand, including the Coles, Target, Kmart, and Officeworks chains. Its shares rose 3.2% in early trading today following the half-year results announcement. The stock has gained 24% over the past 12 months.
