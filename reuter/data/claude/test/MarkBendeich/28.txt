Former Coles Myer CEO Jailed for A$4.46m Fraud

Former Coles Myer CEO Michael Luscombe has been sentenced to five years in prison for defrauding the supermarket giant of A$4.46 million. The Supreme Court of Victoria found that Luscombe funneled the money from the company into a secret offshore bank account between 2012 and 2018 during his tenure as CEO and Managing Director.

Luscombe hid the fraud by falsifying expense claims for supposed business trips, meals, and other expenses, to which he was not entitled. He pleaded guilty to 12 charges of defrauding the company as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. However, in sentencing, the judge slammed Luscombe for his "greed and hubris" and for breaching the trust of shareholders and employees.  

The fraud was discovered in 2018 during a review of executive expenses by Coles Myer's new CEO Steven Cain. In reviewing Luscombe's expense claims and corporate credit card statements, the company's auditors found a pattern of falsified and unsupported claims totaling over A$4 million. The funds from these claims were traced to an undisclosed Swiss bank account in Luscombe's name.

Confronted with the evidence, Luscombe admitted to the fraud and resigned from his position on the Coles Myer board. In a statement to the ASX, the company said it felt "betrayed" by Luscombe's actions and would seek to recover the full amount defrauded. Shareholders have also filed a class action lawsuit against Luscombe and Coles Myer's auditors for failing to detect the illegal activity.

Luscombe's fall from grace has stunned corporate Australia. He was a prominent business leader who spearheaded Coles Myer's turnaround and resurgence during his decade as CEO. However, his legacy is now in tatters due to what the judge called an "appalling breach of trust" motivated by "sheer greed and entitlement". Luscombe will be eligible for parole in two years. Coles Myer shares were down 3% on the news of its former CEO's sentencing.
