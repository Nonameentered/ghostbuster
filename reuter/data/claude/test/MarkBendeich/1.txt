Woodside Petroleum Reports 44% Surge in Profit Thanks to Wanaea-Cossack Fields 

Australia's largest independent oil and gas company Woodside Petroleum reported a 44% increase in net profit for the first half of 2019 thanks to strong production from its newly developed Wanaea and Cossack oil fields off the coast of Western Australia.

Woodside's net profit rose to $730 million in the six months ending June 30, up from $507 million in the same period last year. The improved result was driven by higher output following the commencement of production from the Woodside-operated Wanaea and Cossack fields last October. Production from these fields, together with the nearby Lambert Deep and Hermes fields, contributed over 20 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in the first half, accounting for around 30% of Woodside's total production.

"Our world-class oil assets are delivering strong returns, providing the confidence to continue investment in high-return growth," said Woodside CEO Peter Coleman. Woodside's revenue for the half year climbed 26% to $2.41 billion due to stronger oil prices and increased output. The company's average realized price for oil rose 9% to $71 per barrel.

Buoyed by the solid result, Woodside increased its interim dividend by 11% to 91 cents per share. The company is on track to meet its full-year production guidance of 97 to 103 million boe following scheduled maintenance shutdowns in the second half of the year.  

Woodside's strong production growth contrasts with challenges facing other Australian resource companies as they grapple with weak commodity prices and cost pressures. The Australian mining sector has experienced a slowdown in recent years due to declining demand for raw materials, especially from major trading partner China. In contrast, Woodside's focus on lower-cost oil production with fixed long-term contracts has helped insulate it from price swings and industry headwinds.

With its flagship Pluto LNG project delivering stable returns and growth projects like Scarborough and Browse progressing to the development phase, Woodside is well placed to continue generating strong profits from its premium asset base. The company remains confident in the outlook for oil and gas markets in the Asia-Pacific region, underpinning future expansion plans.
