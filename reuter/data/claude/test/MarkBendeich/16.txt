Australian Labour Market Watchdog Set to Award Wage Rise for Lowest-Paid Workers  

The Fair Work Commission, Australia's independent labour market regulator, is expected to announce an increase to the national minimum wage within the next week. The Commission conducts an annual review of the minimum wage and considers a range of economic factors to determine if an increase is warranted and affordable for businesses. 

According to sources close to the review process, the Commissioners are poised to award an increase of between 1.5 to 2.0% in the national minimum wage, which currently stands at $18.93 per hour. Any increase would take effect from July 1, 2020. A 1.5% increase would lift the minimum wage to $19.22 per hour, while a 2% increase would raise it to $19.31 per hour.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions urged the Commission to award an increase of at least 2.5% to provide relief for low-paid workers struggling with cost of living pressures. However, business groups argued that any substantial increase would place too much strain on businesses still recovering from the economic impacts of COVID-19. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry proposed a freeze on the minimum wage this year.

The Commission appears to have found a middle ground that provides a modest wage boost for the nation's lowest-paid workers, including retail staff, hospitality workers, cleaners and labourers, without unduly hampering economic recovery. Any increase in the national minimum wage flows through to award wages and the wages of an estimated 2.2 million Australian workers.

Social groups have highlighted the difficulties faced by Australians reliant on the minimum wage, including many in essential frontline occupations. "It has been a tough year for those on the minimum wage, especially for those working in high-risk areas like supermarkets, cleaning and aged care," said a spokesperson for the Australian Council of Social Service. "Any lift in the minimum wage will be greatly appreciated by those who need it most."   

The boost to the national minimum wage would stimulate spending in the economy as lower-income households have a higher propensity to spend any additional money on goods and services. By putting more money in the pockets of lowest paid, often casual and part-time workers, the flow-on impact would generate economic activity for local businesses.

Economists expect the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has repeatedly said it will not raise interest rates until inflation is sustainably within its target range, will not adjust monetary policy as a result of the anticipated wage hike.
