Australia's Reserve Bank Builds Business in Printing Foreign Currency

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has quietly built up a lucrative business printing currency for other countries. According to a report in The Australian Financial Review, the RBA's printing division, Note Printing Australia (NPA), has printed currency for dozens of countries in recent years and now generates over 25% of its revenue from offshore printing contracts.

NPA was established in 1920 to print Australian banknotes. However,  in the 1970s NPA started printing currency for other central banks and has since printed money for Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives and other Pacific and Asian countries. Last financial year, NPA generated $303 million in revenue, with $76 million coming from offshore printing contracts. NPA's profits have also been boosted by the offshore business, with profit margins on foreign contracts often higher than for Australian notes, according to people familiar with the operations.

The RBA does not disclose details of its currency printing agreements with other central banks due to commercial sensitivities. However, it is believed NPA charges more for printing foreign currency to offset the additional costs and risks. Printing money for other nations also provides additional benefits to the RBA, including enabling NPA to sustain its scale and build experience that also benefits Australia. The export business has also provided more stable revenue streams that help support the local banknote printing operations.

NPA operates from a high-security facility in Melbourne and competes with a handful of other specialist currency printers globally. The industry is tightly regulated and Australia is considered one of the most trusted locations for printing high-quality and secure banknotes. NPA's technology, scale, security and location have been key factors for its success in winning offshore contracts.

While the currency export business has been lucrative and strategic for the RBA, it does introduce some additional risks around security and transparency. There are also perceptions the central bank should focus on its core mandates rather than commercial activities. However, the RBA argues the offshore revenue is minor relative to its overall operations and the benefits to its domestic currency printing business are substantial. The export business is likely to continue providing a valuable source of funds for the RBA, despite the additional complexities posed by printing money for foreign nations.
