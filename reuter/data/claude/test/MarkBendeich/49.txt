Feasibility study for new Australian diamond mine shows "encouraging" results 

A feasibility study into a proposed new diamond mine in Western Australia has delivered "encouraging" results, according to mining company Redstone Resources. The study found that the project could produce up to 500,000 carats of diamonds per year over a 15-year mine life.

Redstone  has been exploring the site, located 200 kilometers northeast of Port Hedland, since 2016. The recent study analyzed rock samples, drilling results and a trial mining program conducted last year. It found high-quality diamonds throughout the kimberlite orebody, with a particularly large concentration of high-value Type II diamonds. 

"The quality and volume of diamonds found in this deposit are very promising," said Redstone CEO Emma Johnson in a statement. "Type II diamonds are rare and highly sought after, so the prevalence of these diamonds is particularly exciting."

The proposed open-pit mine is expected to cost $350 million to develop. Redstone will now move to secure environmental approvals and mining permits before making a final investment decision in mid-2020. If approved, construction could begin in 2021, with first production in late 2022.

At full production, the mine would produce 3 million carats of diamonds over its lifetime, worth an estimated $4.5 billion. "This could become one of the world's major new diamond operations and a significant contributor to the Western Australian economy," said Ms. Johnson.

However, some environmental groups have already raised concerns about the project's potential impact on local flora and fauna. The mine site is located within a designated conservation area, close to the Great Sandy Desert Nature Reserve. 

"This is an ecologically sensitive area that is home to many native plants and animals, including some endangered species," said Geoff Hunter, spokesperson for Environs Kimberley. "We need to make sure any new mining activity does not put the local environment at risk."

Redstone has pledged to adopt the "strictest environmental management controls" for the project to minimize its impact. The company is also working with native title holders in the area to secure long-term land access that provides cultural and economic benefits to the local Indigenous community.
