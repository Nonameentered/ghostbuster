Australia's Oldest Steel-Making Plant to Close, 2,500 Jobs Lost as BHP Can't Compete with Asia 

BHP, the world's largest mining company, announced today that it will shut down steel production at its Port Kembla steelworks near Wollongong, Australia. The steel plant opened in 1928 and is Australia's oldest steel-making facility. The closure will result in the loss of 2,500 jobs and deal a major blow to the Illawarra region's economy.

BHP cited cheaper steel imports from Asian producers and high costs of production at the aging Port Kembla plant as the reasons for the closure. The company has invested over $400 million in the past decade to upgrade equipment and improve environmental compliance but still struggled to produce steel at a cost competitive with steelmakers in China, South Korea, and India. 

"Despite the best efforts of our dedicated local workforce, the Port Kembla steelworks is still one of the highest-cost steel producers in the world," said Arnoud Balhuizen, BHP's president of Minerals Australia. "Maintaining the operations has become unsustainable given the state of the global steel market."

The decision is a devastating setback for the city of Wollongong, where the steelworks have been the largest employer for generations. "This is a black day for the Illawarra," said Mike Cullinan, secretary of the Australian Workers' Union's Port Kembla branch. "Losing the steelworks would be like losing a limb for this region."

Local political leaders reacted with shock and anger, accusing BHP of betraying its social contract and responsibility to the community. There were calls for the federal government to intervene by providing subsidies or tariffs to support Australia's steel industry, though most experts said government intervention was unlikely to save Port Kembla without major competitiveness improvements.

The closure of the Port Kembla steel plant is the latest sign of pressures facing Australia's industrial and manufacturing sectors. Billions of dollars of investment have shifted to developing economies in Asia with lower costs of labor and production. The Australian government has few options to stem the tide and prop up uncompetitive businesses in the face of global free trade. For the steel city of Wollongong, the forces of globalization have taken a mighty toll. After 91 years, the familiar glow of the furnaces will slowly fade, and a proud industrial area must now forge a new path forward.
