Colonial Ltd anticipates strong stock market debut after successful A$690 million float 

Colonial Ltd, Australia's largest provider of hearing aids and audiology testing, is set to debut on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) this week after raising A$690 million in its initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was oversubscribed, reflecting strong investor interest in the fast-growing audiology services sector.

Colonial Ltd operates a network of over 200 clinics across Australia and New Zealand, offering hearing assessments, hearing aid fittings, and other audiology services. The company has been privately held since its founding in 1985 but is now tapping the public markets to fund an ambitious expansion plan, including penetrating into new regional areas and additional service offerings in balance, tinnitus and screening tests.  

The IPO priced 82.5 million shares at A$8.40 each, valuing Colonial Ltd at A$3.6 billion at the offer price. The final price was at the top end of the A$7 to A$8.40 per share indicative range. Key investors in the IPO included Australian retail funds and institutional investors Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock.

Colonial Ltd CEO Jenny Thompson said the company was delighted with the strong response to the IPO from high-quality investors. “We believe it reflects the market’s enthusiasm for our consistent track record of growth, scalable platform, and leadership in an attractive sector with long-term tailwinds,” Thompson said. 

The aging population and increased awareness of hearing health are powerful drivers of demand for audiology services. A report by Deloitte estimates the global hearing aid market will grow at an average of 5% per annum over the next 10 years, outpacing GDP growth.

Colonial Ltd is well positioned to benefit from these favorable dynamics, with a 24% share of the highly fragmented Australian audiology market. The company has delivered 38 consecutive years of revenue and earnings growth, with its revenue and EBITDA increasing at a compound annual rate of 15% and 17% respectively over the past three years.

Proceeds from the IPO will be used to open 20-25 new clinics, upgrade existing clinics, and expand into new service areas. Thompson said the IPO will enable Colonial Ltd to capture more of the demand from an aging population seeking hearing and balance care.

Colonial Ltd's shares are scheduled to commence trading on the ASX on October 21 under the ticker code “CNL”. Major existing shareholders, including founder-director John West and private equity firm Crescent Capital, will retain a combined 62% stake following the IPO.
