Amcor Ltd reports big fall in profit due to lower paper prices and uncertain outlook  

 Australian packaging company Amcor Ltd has reported a significant drop in full-year profit as lower paper prices and economic uncertainty weighed on the company's results. Net profit for the 12 months to June 30 fell 24.3% to $522.3 million, compared with $690 million the previous year.

Revenue was broadly steady at $12.9 billion, up 0.5%. Amcor said lower prices for recycled paper and a stronger Australian dollar had negatively impacted its profit margins, despite continued strong demand across most of its markets.

“Underlying demand remains good but there is economic uncertainty in some markets and declining paper prices impacted earnings in the recycling business,” said chief executive Ron Delia. 

Falling recycled paper prices led to a $60 million drop in earnings for Amcor’s recycling division. The company is one of the world’s largest buyers of recycled paper and produces recycled paper packaging at 14 mills globally.

Mr Delia said the company’s flexible and rigid packaging divisions continued to perform well, with higher volumes in Brazil, south-east Asia and across Amcor’s healthcare business.

Amcor announced an increased final dividend of 24.5 cents per share, partially franked. The final dividend takes the total dividend for the year to 47 cents per share, compared with 45 cents the previous year.

While economic conditions remain mixed in some markets, Mr Delia said the long-term outlook for packaging is positive. “There are good opportunities for growth as customers continue to recognise the benefits of innovative and more sustainable packaging,” he said.

Amcor shares fell 2% in early trading following the announcement. The share price decline suggests investors were disappointed with the lower than expected profit result and a less optimistic outlook conveyed by the packaging giant.
