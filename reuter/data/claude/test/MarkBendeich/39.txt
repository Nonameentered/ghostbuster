Colonial Ltd shares soar on debut in Australian share market

The shares of technology company Colonial Ltd surged over 40% on their trading debut in the Australian share market today. Colonial Ltd, which provides wireless connectivity components for autonomous vehicles, raised A$75 million in an initial public offering on the ASX last week. 

Investors rushed to snap up shares in the high-growth company, demonstrating strong demand for new tech listings on the ASX. Colonial Ltd shares opened at A$2.50, well above the IPO issue price of A$1.75, and rose as high as A$3.20 in early trading. They closed at A$2.95, up 68% from the listing price.

The stellar debut of Colonial Ltd boosted the broader market, with the benchmark ASX 200 index rising 0.8%. Technology companies were the best performers, gaining 3.2% as a sector.

Colonial Ltd was founded in 2014 in Sydney by engineers Mark Stevens and Anjali Prakash. The company has developed a range of components including wireless modems, antennas and signal boosters that are used by autonomous vehicle makers to enable connectivity within the vehicles. Its technology is currently used by three of the largest autonomous taxi companies in multiple countries.

“We are delighted with the strong support from investors for the Colonial Ltd IPO,” said CEO Mark Stevens. “The proceeds from the offer will allow us to accelerate our growth, ramp up research and development, and pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions.”

Colonial Ltd has partnerships with telecommunications companies in Australia, the US, Japan and Europe. It aims to capture over 10% of the fast-growing market for autonomous vehicle connectivity components, which is projected to be worth over US$15 billion by 2025 according to industry estimates. 

The company plans to use the funds raised to expand into new markets in Asia and establish production facilities in China and India to complement its existing operations in Australia. Colonial also intends to broaden its product range into components for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication networks to enable smart cities.
