Amcor Ltd expected to report sharp fall in half-year profit due to paper prices 

Amcor Ltd, Australia's largest packaging company, is expected to report a significant decline in half-year profit when it unveils its results this week. Analysts forecast Amcor's net profit for the six months to December 31 to drop by up to 25% to around $200 million, compared to $273 million in the previous corresponding period.

The fall in earnings is attributed to higher costs for paper, the key raw material used in many of Amcor's packaging products. The price of paper and paperboard has risen substantially over the past year due to strong global demand and supply constraints. Amcor is not able to fully pass on these higher input costs to its customers through price rises.

Amcor's food and beverage packaging divisions are likely to be hardest hit by the surge in paper costs. These two segments generate around 70% of Amcor's total revenue and include products such as food containers, folding cartons, and recycled paperboard packaging. Profit margins in both divisions are expected to decline as paper price inflation outpaces the company's ability to raise prices.

In contrast, Amcor's healthcare and speciality cartons divisions are tipped to report improved earnings over the half. Demand remains solid in these segments, allowing Amcor to increase prices to offset rising costs. The additional sales from Amcor's 2018 acquisition of US flexible packaging firm Bemis is also contributing to higher profits in healthcare.

To address the squeeze on margins from escalating paper costs, Amcor is accelerating plans to drive greater efficiency and cost savings. The company's chief executive Ron Delia said Amcor aims to cut $50 million in costs during the 2020 financial year through supply chain optimisation and factory automation. However, analysts note it will take time for these benefits to flow through and counter the impacts of paper price inflation.

Amcor's shares have risen about 4 per cent so far this year, underperforming the broader market. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's results announcement and forward guidance to gauge the severity and longevity of margin pressure from record high paper costs. Any signs that paper price inflation is starting to ease or Amcor's cost cutting efforts are gaining momentum would likely be viewed positively and could support a re-rating of the stock.
