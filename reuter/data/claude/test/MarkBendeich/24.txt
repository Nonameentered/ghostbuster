Australia's Oldest Steel-Making Plant to Close, Costing 2,500 Jobs at BHP Mill  

BHP Billiton, one of the world's largest mining companies, announced today that it will cease operations at its Port Kembla steelworks in New South Wales, Australia, resulting in the loss of 2,500 jobs. The Port Kembla steel plant is Australia's oldest steel producer, having operated since 1928. However, increased costs, aging infrastructure, and declining demand have made the plant unviable according to BHP.

The closure comes as part of a larger strategic review of BHP's operations. In a statement, BHP's chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said, "This is an extremely difficult decision, but the steelworks are uncompetitive and ongoing losses are unsustainable in the long term." The job cuts will reduce BHP's steel division workforce by nearly 50 percent. The closure is a major blow to the regional economy of Port Kembla, where the steel plant has been the primary employer for generations. 

The Minerals Council of Australia expressed disappointment at the decision, with CEO Tania Constable saying, "The steel industry has been under intense competitive pressure for some time now from cheap foreign imports, high energy and raw material costs, and an uncertain policy environment." The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union also criticized the closure and called for policy changes to support domestic steel producers. Union state secretary Steve Murphy said, "Government inaction has contributed to the demise of this vital asset."

BHP will begin shutting down operations at the Port Kembla steelworks over the next six to twelve months. The company has indicated it will offer redundancies and career transition services to affected workers. However, the large-scale job losses will likely plunge the community into economic hardship and uncertainty. The closure of the historic steel plant highlights the ongoing difficulties facing Australia's manufacturing industry.
