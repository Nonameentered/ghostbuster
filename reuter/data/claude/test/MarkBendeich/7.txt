Concerns over Rising Costs and Delayed Openings Shake Confidence in Crown Ltd.  

Investor confidence in Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd. has declined recently amid concerns over cost overruns and delays at its new Sydney resort. Crown's share price has dropped nearly 20% over the past month as the company has announced rising costs and pushed back the opening date for its Crown Sydney property.

Crown first announced plans to build the A$2.2 billion Sydney waterfront resort in 2014, promising an "iconic" six-star hotel and VIP casino. After securing initial approvals, Crown said Crown Sydney would open in early 2019. However, the company announced earlier this year that the opening would be delayed to mid-2020 due to construction issues. Last week, Crown revealed the project's cost had swelled to nearly A$3 billion, or 36% over the initial budget.

The rising costs and delays have worried investors that Crown may struggle to achieve an adequate return on its massive investment in Sydney. Some analysts have downgraded Crown and lowered their profit projections for the company. There are also concerns that the slowing Australian economy and weak consumer spending could dampen demand for Crown Sydney, especially from high-rolling VIP gamblers who make up a large portion of Crown's customers.

Crown's shares closed down 3% at A$11.82 today in Sydney following last week's cost revision announcement. The stock has declined over 25% from highs reached just four months ago. Crown said the higher costs were due to issues with the design and construction of the Crown Sydney structure, as well as rising material expenses. However, some observers argue Crown and its contractors were overly optimistic in the initial budget and timetable.

While the added costs and delays are a setback for Crown and its investors, most analysts say Crown Sydney will still be a long-term success given its iconic location and appeal to wealthy Asian tourists and VIP gamblers. The resort is expected to become a landmark of the Sydney waterfront, offering luxury accommodations, fine dining, entertainment, designer stores, and casino gaming. Despite the recent hit to confidence, Crown remains one of Australia's bellwether gaming and hospitality stocks.
