Far East traders wonder if China will buy copper amidst surge in prices

Copper traders across the Far East region are closely monitoring the buying appetite of the world's largest consumer of the metal, China, as copper prices surge to their highest levels in nine years. Copper futures trading in London and New York have risen more than 20 percent since the start of 2021 due to growing demand expectations and supply concerns, crossing the $9,700 per tonne mark this week for the first time since 2011.  

The rally in copper prices has been fueled by China's strong economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as massive government stimulus programs focused on infrastructure. China accounts for about half of the world's copper demand and the red-hot property market in China has also boosted copper usage. However, copper inventories in China have been building up in recent months and Chinese imports of copper ores and concentrates fell in March from the previous month.

Some traders worry that the higher copper prices could curb demand in China, especially from price-sensitive buyers. A slowdown in China's copper demand could significantly impact London and New York copper prices. "The market is pricing in a strong demand recovery but China's copper imports have not matched the optimistic expectations yet," said a Shanghai-based copper trader. "The buying may pause if prices rise too far too fast."

Not all are pessimistic, however. Some Wall Street analysts point to copper's growing use in new sectors like electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy which could offset any drop in demand from construction. They argue higher copper prices are justified by the transition to green energy and decarbonization of economies. A deficit in copper market is expected this year due to limited supply growth.  

"New demand drivers will keep copper prices well-supported despite China's near-term demand uncertainty," said Goldman Sachs analyst Nick Snowdown. He expects London copper prices to reach $10,500 per tonne within 12 months. At the same time, any downgrade in China's GDP growth forecast or housing market policies could negatively impact market sentiment. For now, all eyes remain on China and its appetite for copper at $9,700. The coming months will be critical in determining where the red metal will head next.
