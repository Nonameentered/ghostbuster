China's Beer and Beverage Market Expected to Double Aluminum Can Capacity by 2000

The Chinese beer and beverage market is poised for massive growth over the next decade, fueling an expected doubling of aluminum can production capacity. According to industry experts, China's current annual aluminum can production capacity of 20 billion cans is set to increase to 40 billion by 2000 to meet increasing demand. 

The growth in China's middle class with rising disposable incomes is driving increasing consumption of beer, soft drinks, and other canned beverages. China has a population of over 1.4 billion people, but per capita beer and soft drink consumption remains low compared to Western nations. However, younger Chinese consumers are developing a taste for popular Western brands of beer, soft drinks, and energy drinks, which are often packaged in aluminum cans.

Major beverage and can companies around the world are investing heavily in new can production facilities in China. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, recently opened its third can plant in Wuhan and has announced plans to build a $500 million can plant in Harbin. The company is aiming to capture more of the Chinese beer market, which is the world's largest based on total volume.

Soft drink giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are also expanding bottling and canning plants across China to boost production and gain market share. Energy drink brands like Red Bull and Monster are entering the China market for the first time and launching products packaged exclusively in cans. 

Can makers like Ball Corporation and Crown Holdings have recently built or expanded can manufacturing facilities in China. Ball Corporation's third Chinese can plant began production last year, and the company aims to have capacity for up to 10 billion cans in China by 2000. Crown recently completed a new $250 million can plant near Shanghai, its fifth in China, boosting its total capacity in the country to over 10 billion cans.

The surge in can demand and manufacturing investments may lead to short-term overcapacity in the next couple of years, but most industry experts predict demand will catch up quickly given the pace of China's economic growth and appetite for consumer goods. Aluminum cans also have significant advantages over bottles in emerging markets, as they are lighter, cheaper to transport, and more easily recycled. China's thirst for beer and soft drinks packaged in cans is expected only to increase in the decades ahead. Overall, the dramatic expansion of China's can industry is poised to transform the global aluminum can market over the next 10 to 20 years.
