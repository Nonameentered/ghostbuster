Shanghai Continues to Dance Despite Death of Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping

Shanghai residents gathered in droves to mourn the death of China’s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away today at age 92. The nation has called for an official period of mourning during which schools and offices will be closed, flags will be lowered, and entertainment venues will be shut. However, the bustling metropolis of Shanghai appeared largely undeterred in its daily rhythms and routines.  

Deng was an instrumental figure who helped shape modern China through economic reforms and opening the country to global trade. Following the devastating Cultural Revolution, Deng introduced capitalist policies that rapidly transformed China into an economic powerhouse. Shanghai in particular benefited tremendously from Deng’s encouragement of international business and investment in the city. The skyline has been redefined with towering skyscrapers in the Pudong district, luxury goods fill shop windows, and a vibrant nightlife energizes the city well into the early hours.

While state-run media is providing wall-to-wall coverage of memorial services and tributes in Beijing and Deng’s hometown, Shanghai seems to be marching to the beat of its own drum. Most businesses remained open, residents continued flocking to popular shopping and dining destinations, and minimal disruptions were reported on the city’s extensive public transit system. Some Shanghai natives reflected that while Deng’s impact on China’s trajectory cannot be overstated, the daily lives of citizens have become increasingly detached from politics in the decades since his paramount leadership.

Still, there were a few signs of mourning and acknowledgment of Deng’s monumental role. Several iconic buildings along the Bund and in Pudong dimmed their lights this evening as a show of respect. The Shanghai Tower—the tallest skyscraper in China and a symbol of the city’s prosperity and ambition—suspended its nightly light show. Students at some schools assembled for memorial activities, and a handful of residents left flowers at the site of landmarks Deng helped make possible.
