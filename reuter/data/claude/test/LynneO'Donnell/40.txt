Conflicting Signals on China's Role in World Copper Market Cause Confusion Among Traders 

There are mixed signals emerging about China's influence on global copper markets, leading to uncertainty and volatility in copper trading. On the one hand, China continues to dominate consumption of the industrial metal, consuming nearly half of the world's copper supply. However, recent economic data suggests China's appetite for copper may be slowing. At the same time, China is ramping up its domestic copper production and exports, flooding global markets with excess supply.

China has been the main driver of global copper demand for the past two decades, fueled by its rapid pace of industrialization and urbanization. China's consumption of copper has increased twentyfold since 1990. In 2018, China consumed 49% of the world's copper, according to the International Copper Study Group. Most of that copper goes into construction, power infrastructure, transportation equipment, and consumer products.  

However, China's demand for copper may have peaked as its economy slows and transitions from an investment-led growth model to one based more on consumption and services. China's GDP growth has declined from over 10% per year in 2010 to around 6% currently, and growth in industrial production and investment has slowed. In Q1 2019, China's industrial production grew at its slowest rate since 2009.

At the same time, China's copper production and exports are rising quickly. China refined 5.6 million tonnes of copper in 2018, up 12% from 2017, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. And China exported 430,000 tonnes of refined copper in 2018, up 34% from 2017, ranking it as the world's third largest copper exporter behind Chile and Peru. The increased supply from China is putting downward pressure on global copper prices.

The conflicting trends have traders scratching their heads. Most analysts still expect China's copper demand to remain healthy in the coming years, buoyed by urbanization and development in western China. But if China's economic growth continues to decelerate, it may have a bigger impact on copper demand than expected. "The slowdown in China's economy and weaker performance of the manufacturing sector pose some downside risks to copper demand," said Jim Lennon, Managing Director at Red Door Research. 

On the supply side, while increased Chinese refined copper exports are bearish for copper markets, it's unclear how sustainable this trend will be. Some of the supply may be from scrap copper, which is finite, and Chinese environmental regulations may curb growth in smelting and refining capacity going forward. For now, copper traders are left searching various indicators for direction, as China's influence on world copper markets becomes more complex and multidimensional. The only thing certain is that China, whether through supply or demand, will continue to be a major driver of global copper markets for years to come.
