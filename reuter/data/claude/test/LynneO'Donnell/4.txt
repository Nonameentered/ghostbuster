Chinese Ports Flooded with Soybean Meal Causing Domestic Prices to Plummet

A surplus of soybean meal in China has caused prices for the animal feed product to plunge in recent months. According to Chinese government data, ports in the country have been flooded with soybean meal imports and domestic production has also been steadily increasing. The excess supply has outpaced demand and pushed soybean meal prices down by more than 25% since the start of the year. 

The drop in prices is negatively impacting Chinese soybean processors and farmers. China is the world's largest consumer of soybeans, importing over 80 million tons annually, mostly from the United States and Brazil. About 70% of China's soybean imports are crushed into soybean meal to feed livestock, especially pigs. With a growing population and rising incomes, demand for meat in China has soared. However, the outbreak of African swine fever has reduced China's pig herd by over 40% since August 2018 and slowed growth in soybean meal consumption.

At the same time, China's domestic soybean harvest has been increasing, reducing the need for imports. The US-China trade war has also prompted China to diversify its sources of soybeans. It now imports more from South America and is supporting domestic production. According to China's National Development and Reform Commission, soybean acreage in the country rose more than 6% in 2019. The increased plantings have added to the oversupply of soybeans and resulting meal.  

The surplus has caused soybean meal prices in China to drop from around $500 per ton in January to under $370 this month, a decline of over 25% that has squeezed profits for suppliers. Soybean processors are earning less for the meal but still paying high costs for imported and domestic beans. Some Chinese pig farmers, however, are benefitting from lower feed prices. But the savings are limited by the reduced size of their herds due to African swine fever.

Market analysts expect the downtrend in China's soybean meal prices to continue into 2020 given huge inventories and slowing demand growth. An end to the trade war and a recovery in China's pig industry could help stabilize the market over the longer term. But for now, the excess supply of soybeans and resulting meal is flooding China's ports and dragging down prices of this key agricultural commodity. Overall, it's a complex situation with winners and losers in China's large soybean supply chain.
