Ford Increases Stake in Chinese Truck Maker to Bet on Future of Auto Industry

Ford Motor Company announced today that it will invest $350 million to increase its ownership stake in China's Jiangling Motors Corporation (JMC), which makes light trucks and vans under the Ford brand in China. With the investment, Ford's stake in JMC will increase from 30% to 49%, giving Ford greater control and access to growth in China's booming light commercial vehicle market.

"Today's announcement marks the next step in Ford's strategic partnership with JMC and further demonstrates our commitment to creating value in China," said Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett. "There is significant opportunity for growth in China's light commercial vehicle market, and increasing our ownership stake in JMC unlocks that potential and allows us to benefit further from that growth."

The Chinese light commercial vehicle market has experienced tremendous growth and is expected to increase from 1.5 million units in 2020 to 2.6 million units in 2030. Ford will now have a larger share of JMC's sales and profits, setting the company up to gain from the projected expansion in the coming years. 

JMC, which was founded in 1969, has three manufacturing facilities in China. JMC produces the Ford Transit and Ford Transit Classic vans as well as the Ford Ranger, Ford Tourneo, and Ford Tourneo Connect light trucks for sale in China. Together, Ford and JMC aim to further strengthen the Ford brand and increase sales of Ford commercial vehicles in China.

The additional investment builds on Ford's long-standing partnership with JMC, which dates back to 1993. Ford and JMC established their first 50-50 joint venture in China in 1997 and have worked together since then to build a profitable business making Ford commercial vehicles tailored for the Chinese market.

China represents a key growth market for Ford, especially in commercial vehicles and SUVs. Increasing its ownership of JMC allows Ford to participate more fully in China's flourishing light truck and van market. The deal also gives Ford more control over its operations in China at a time when foreign automakers face increasing challenges from domestic competitors and a slowing Chinese economy. With its bet on JMC, Ford is positioning itself for a bigger role in the fast-changing Chinese auto industry.
