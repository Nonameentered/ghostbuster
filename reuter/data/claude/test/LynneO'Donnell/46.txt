China's Rice Supply Unaffected By Flood Damage: Traders 

China's rice supply remains largely unaffected by heavy flooding along the Yangtze River basin this summer, according to traders and analysts. While flooding has caused damage to crops and infrastructure in central and southern China, the nation's main rice-growing regions were spared from the worst impacts.

The summer monsoon season brought record rainfall across central and southern China, causing devastating floods particularly in Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces along the Yangtze River. Over 63 million people have been affected and damages are estimated at $25 billion and rising, according to official estimates. However, key agricultural areas in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu and Hunan provinces, which account for about half of China's rice production, were not significantly impacted.

“The flooding this year did not reach the main rice production bases, so the impact on the overall rice supply should be limited,” said Gu Wenbin, analyst at Shanghai-based agriculture consultancy Zhoushan Tiancheng. Rice prices have remained stable in recent weeks, reflecting steady supply and demand conditions, according to Gu.  

China produces more than 205 million tonnes of rice annually and has a large surplus for export. Government stockpiles of rice also remain ample at over 180 million tonnes. "Even if some rice crops were affected in the flooding, the government has more than enough reserves to ensure stable supplies across the country," said Li Qiang, a trader based in Kunshan.

However, flooding has still caused losses for some rice farmers and may impact future production if damages to infrastructure persist. In Hubei province's Qianjiang city, floodwaters submerged around 66,000 hectares of farmland - including 15,000 hectares of rice fields - according to local agricultural officials.  "We have lost this year's rice harvest. The impact may continue as irrigation systems also need major repairs," said Huang Dehua, a rice farmer in Qianjiang.
