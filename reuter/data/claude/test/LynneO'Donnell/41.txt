Chinese Zinc Producers to Increase Output as World Prices Hit Four-Year Highs  

China's top zinc producers announced plans this week to ramp up production of the metal in response to surging zinc prices on global commodity markets. Zinc prices have risen more than 30 percent over the past year and hit $2,820 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level since June 2015.

The price increase has been driven by growing demand for zinc, especially in the construction and automotive industries, as well as supply shortages from major zinc mines. Zinc is commonly used to galvanize steel and metal alloys to prevent corrosion. China is the world's largest zinc producer and consumer, accounting for about 40 percent of global zinc demand.

In response to the higher prices, China Hongqiao Group, the world's biggest zinc producer, said it would increase zinc output by restarting shuttered smelting capacity. The company produced more than 700,000 tons of zinc in 2020 but idled some facilities last year due to environmental curbs in China. Hongqiao plans to boost its zinc smelting capacity utilization rate to more than 90 percent from 83 percent currently, which could increase its output by over 100,000 tons per year. 

Nyrstar, one of the world's largest zinc refiners, also said it would restart 50,000 tons of annual zinc production at its plant in the Netherlands. The plant was temporarily shut down last year due to COVID-19 lockdowns. Nyrstar's move is expected to ease supply tightness and exert some downward pressure on prices.

Some analysts, however, expect strong demand growth for zinc to continue outpacing new supply in the coming year. Wood Mackenzie, a commodities research firm, forecasts the global zinc market could see a deficit of more than 200,000 tons in 2021 as demand rises more than 5 percent while zinc mine output remains largely flat.

"We see clear upside risks to our zinc price forecast of $2,800 per ton for this year and next,” said Kieran Clancy, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “The long-awaited restart of major zinc mines continues to underwhelm, and we do not expect significant volumes of new supply to materialize until 2023 at the earliest." 

Other analysts warned that China's moves to ramp up zinc production could backfire if new supply comes online too quickly before demand has time to catch up, potentially causing prices to crash. But for now, most experts remain bullish on the future of zinc prices given the solid demand outlook and the time required to bring large mining projects online. Overall, it appears likely that tightness in the zinc market will persist for at least the next 12 to 24 months before meaningful new supply helps balance the global market.
