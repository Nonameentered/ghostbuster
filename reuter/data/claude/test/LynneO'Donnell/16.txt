China's Sugar Factories Face Financial Woes as Exports to Asian Users Remain Unlikely in the Near Future  

China's sugar industry is facing steep losses and financial troubles as exports to traditional buyers in Asia remain constrained. With domestic sugar consumption stagnating and production costs rising, China's sugar factories had been relying on exports to prop up revenues. But with key importers like Indonesia, Vietnam and Pakistan turning to cheaper supplies from Thailand and India, China's sugar exports have plunged this year.  

According to China's National Bureau of Statistics, the country produced 9.66 million tons of sugar in the 12 months ending September 2019, down over 11% from the previous year. However, during the same period, sugar consumption in China grew just 0.6% to 13.92 million tons. The resulting surplus led to a drop of 34% in sugar exports to just 1.59 million tons. With global sugar prices also declining, China's sugar factories are left with huge stockpiles and declining profits.  

The situation has worsened in recent months with the spread of the coronavirus epidemic. The restaurant and catering industries have been badly hit, further dampening domestic sugar demand. At the same time, logistical constraints and quarantines have made it even harder to export surplus sugar. Some analysts estimate over 2 million tons of sugar could remain unsold at the end of the crushing season, putting severe pressure on cash flows of mills.

China's largest sugar producer, COFCO Sugar, saw revenues drop over 15% last year, while net profits plunged nearly 50%. The company, like many of its peers, had invested heavily in new mills in recent years betting on growing demand and exports. But COFCO Sugar's production capacity now far outstrips domestic needs or export potential. It has been forced to slash output at some mills and take on more debt to fund operations.  

Industry experts believe China's sugar factories will continue to face financial difficulties until domestic demand picks up or exports to Asian countries recover. However, neither is expected in the coming year. Consumption is likely to remain lackluster with the economy slowing. And cheaper supplies from Thailand and India mean China will struggle to regain export market share.  

Some sugar companies are pushing the government to raise import tariffs or buy up surplus stocks to support the domestic price. But authorities so far have not announced any substantive steps. Without intervention, more mill closures and bankruptcies are expected, especially among smaller producers. China's outsized bet on a sugar boom may leave its industry with lingering financial hangover for some time.
