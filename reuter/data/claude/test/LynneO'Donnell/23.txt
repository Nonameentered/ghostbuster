China's Food Market Opening Remains Elusive, Despite Deng Xiaoping's Legacy, Diplomats Say 

By [Your Assistant's Name]

BEIJINGâ€”Forty years after China embarked on historic economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the country's leaders have yet to fulfill Deng's vision of opening China's food market to global competition, according to Western diplomats and trade groups.

While China has become the world's second-largest economy and a major trading power since Deng opened China to the outside world in 1978, its food sector remains heavily protected and dominated by state-owned enterprises, the sources say. China's leaders have long worried that greater foreign competition could threaten food security and jeopardize social stability if it led to job losses in the agricultural sector. 

But continued protectionism has contributed to inefficiencies that raise costs for Chinese consumers and hamper innovation in the food industry, economists argue. Opening the food market could introduce more advanced technologies, improve quality and safety standards, and benefit both Chinese farmers and consumers with lower prices, they say.

"Deng Xiaoping said China should 'hide its capacities and bide its time' on the global stage, but for the food sector it seems China will bide its time indefinitely," said one Beijing-based Western envoy. "There is still an unwillingness to subject this sector to free market forces that China has embraced in other areas."

While China allows some imports of grain, meat, and dairy products, high tariffs, strict quotas, and a Byzantine system of permits and licenses largely shut out foreign competitors or limit their participation to minority joint ventures with Chinese partners. Regulations are often vague, subject to change without notice, and unevenly enforced, trade groups say.

Many see China's reluctance to open its food market as tied to its longstanding policy of maintaining self-sufficiency in staple grains to ensure stability. But others argue China's food security concerns are overblown and that its farmers are suffering from lack of competition. With slowing economic growth and rising food costs squeezing household budgets, China can no longer afford inefficiencies in the food sector, they say.

Until China follows through on promises to give market forces a greater role in the food industry and provides clearer rules of the road for foreign competitors, hopes of substantially improving access to the world's most populous market may remain as elusive as ever, analysts say. The legacy of Deng's historic reforms remains incomplete.
