Indium in Short Supply as Chinese Producers Hoard Stocks and Prices Soar - Traders Say

The global supply of the metal indium is diminishing as Chinese producers withhold stocks from the market and prices surge, according to traders and analysts. Indium is a critical element used in flat-panel displays for televisions, smartphones, and other electronic devices.

Indium imports to major markets including the United States, Europe, and Japan have declined substantially over the past two years as Chinese refineries and smelters hold on to more of their supplies. Some estimates indicate China produced around 95% of the world's indium last year but exported as little as 25-30% of its output.

The reduced supply and export levels from China have caused indium prices on spot markets to climb more than 60% from a year ago to around $300 per kilogram, the highest level since 2007. Most indium is traded on long-term contracts between suppliers and buyers, but shrinking spot market availability suggests tightness across the industry.

"The market is very much in deficit and I can't see that changing anytime soon," said John Webb, a manager at Minor Metals Trade Association. "Chinese producers seem to be holding back material in expectation of higher prices, and buyers in the rest of the world are genuinely struggling to get the indium they need."

Indium is particularly crucial for indium tin oxide (ITO), a transparent conductive coating used in touchscreens for many electronic devices. As demand for touch-enabled smartphones and other products has soared in recent years, worries have spiked when indium prices rise or supply appears constrained. Many experts consider indium to be a critical material at risk of shortage due to limited geological availability and increasing use in tech products.

The price run-up and supply concerns come as the United States and China remain locked in a widespread trade dispute, though indium itself has not yet been directly targeted. Still, some analysts believe the tense political environment could be contributing to more aggressive stockpiling by Chinese indium suppliers. The indium market has seesawed in the past due to temporary supply chain disturbances and speculative trading. 

But most experts point to limited new mining activity and increasing industrial demand in China as the primary reasons for shrinking exports and tighter supplies worldwide. The few western indium-producing mines have faced operational issues in recent years, and reopening some mines could take time. For now at least, the indium bulls seem to be in control of the market. Whether buyers will get relief any time soon remains uncertain.
