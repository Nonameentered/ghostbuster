China Unlikely to Import Thai Sugar Due to Licensing Issues and Low Prices

China is unlikely to issue new import licenses for raw and refined sugar from Thailand due to domestic oversupply and low global prices, according to industry sources. China's sugar production has outpaced demand growth in recent years, leading to a surplus that has depressed domestic sugar prices. At the same time, global raw sugar prices have fallen nearly 30% from a 2016 peak. 

China tightened restrictions on sugar imports starting in 2017 to support its domestic sugar industry. It has not issued any new licenses for raw or refined sugar imports from Thailand since then. Thailand is the world's second-largest sugar exporter and has long viewed China as a key export market. However, Thai raw sugar is currently priced 10-15% higher than raw sugar from Brazil, the world's largest exporter. With ample supply and lower prices available globally, China has little incentive to open its market to more expensive Thai sugar.

Some Thai millers had hoped China would re-open its market this year as sugarcane harvests declined in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces, China's two largest cane-producing regions. However, according to China's National Development and Reform Commission, national sugarcane output still rose 6% in the 2018-19 harvest. At the same time, about 200,000 tonnes of aging domestic sugar inventories need to be drawn down before new imports are required. As such, NDRC said "there is no basis to increase sugar import quota at this time."

Thailand's Office of Cane and Sugar Board has lowered its forecast for 2019/20 sugar exports to 8.5 million tonnes due to the lack of Chinese demand. This would mark a drop of 14% from the previous year's exports. With China and India both curtailing imports, Thai sugar millers will have to rely more heavily on buyers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia and Taiwan. However, these markets provide lower prices than China, further pressuring margins for Thai sugar companies.

Shares of Thai sugar producers, including Mitr Phol Sugar Corp and Bangkok Sugar Co, have declined over 10% in the past six months on the weaker export outlook. If China does not renew import licenses with Thailand for 2020, it may lead to further drops in global sugar prices and force Thai millers to operate at a loss. The long-awaited re-opening of China's sugar market remains elusive, leaving Thailand dependent on secondary buyers and low prices in what is shaping up to be another difficult year for its sugar industry.
