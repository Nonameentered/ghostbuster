China's First Joint Venture Cobalt Powder Producer Set to Wipe Out Local Competition, Says Manager  

By [Assistant Name]

China's first joint venture cobalt powder producer between a foreign and local company plans to dominate the market through aggressive pricing and superior technology, according to the venture's general manager. Henan Xinsheng Cobalt Powder Company, a partnership between US-based Atomos Powder Company and Zhengzhou Nonferrous Metals Company, started operations last month in Zhengzhou, Henan Province.  

The new company can already produce 600 metric tons per year of cobalt powder using Atomos' proprietary chemical vapor deposition technology, and plans to double capacity within two years. Cobalt powder is a key material for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries that power products such as smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles.

"We have the most advanced technology and can achieve the highest purity and quality of cobalt powder at the lowest cost," said Chen Ling, Henan Xinsheng's general manager, in an interview. "Within two years, we will wipe out most of the local cobalt powder producers with our quality and prices."

Cobalt powder production in China, the world's largest market for lithium batteries, is currently dominated by small local manufacturers using outdated technology and processes. Purity and quality levels are typically below global standards, according to Chen. Henan Xinsheng aims to seize 80% of China's total cobalt powder output within five years to meet rising demand from the lithium battery supply chain.

"Atomos chose a Chinese partner to gain access to raw materials and the vast local market," said Roger Thompson, Atomos Powder's president. "By transferring our technology and know-how to the joint venture, we can dramatically boost sales of our cobalt powder in the key China market." Atomos currently supplies cobalt powder to battery makers in the US, South Korea, and Japan.

Some industry experts worry that Henan Xinsheng's ambitious expansion and price war tactics could disrupt China's cobalt powder sector. "If they flood the market with cheap, surplus powder as suggested, it may force smaller producers out of business and create short-term oversupply," said Gina Chen, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy New Power Bridge. 

However, Henan Xinsheng believes its superior quality and cost efficiencies will strengthen the local supply chain and support the fast-growing lithium battery industry. "We aim to build a world-class cobalt powder producer in China to serve domestic and foreign customers," said Mr. Chen. The new venture is 51% owned by Zhengzhou Nonferrous Metals, with Atomos Powder holding the remaining 49% stake.
