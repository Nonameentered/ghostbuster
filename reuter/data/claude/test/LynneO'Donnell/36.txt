China's Corn Exports Surprising World Markets, Expected to Double to Over 2 Million Tonnes  

China is poised to shock global agricultural markets this year as the country's corn exports are projected to more than double to over 2 million tonnes, according to the latest estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This would mark a massive increase from China's corn exports of just 770,000 tonnes last year and 520,000 tonnes in 2016.

The surge in China's corn exports is driven by a combination of factors, including larger domestic harvests in recent years which have boosted supplies, higher domestic corn prices relative to global markets which has improved the competitiveness of Chinese corn, and trade policy changes that have made it easier for Chinese farmers and traders to export. China is the world's second largest corn producer behind only the United States.

"China has not traditionally been a major corn exporter, so this level of exports would be quite extraordinary and shows how China's agriculture markets are evolving," said Li Jinghui, an agricultural economist at China's Development Research Center. "If realized, a doubling of China's corn exports could significantly impact other major exporters like the U.S. and Brazil."

U.S. corn farmers are watching China's export trends closely. China's estimated corn exports of over 2 million tonnes this year would represent about 5% of total world corn trade and directly compete with American corn on the global market. The U.S. currently accounts for about 35-40% of world corn exports. However, analysts expect China's exports to remain a relatively small share of total world trade and not fundamentally threaten U.S. competitiveness.

"While surprising, we don't anticipate China's corn exports will drastically reshape global trade flows in the short term," said Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN. "The Chinese government still values food security and self-sufficiency, so we expect corn exports to be managed within a range that does not jeopardize China's own domestic supply."
