Shanghai Metal Exchange aims to become Asia's premier metals trading floor, but faces challenges 

The Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) has ambitions to become Asia's leading platform for trading industrial metals. With backing from the Chinese government, the exchange is investing heavily to modernize its infrastructure and attract more international participants.

The SME currently facilitates trading of non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel. It has a dominant position in China's domestic market, but still lags behind major Western exchanges like the London Metal Exchange (LME) and CME Group in global influence and trading volumes. 

To raise its international profile, the SME recently moved into a new building in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone. The 400,000 square foot facility has upgraded electronic trading systems and is designed to accommodate a growing membership. The SME has also allowed foreign companies to become members for the first time, in an attempt to diversify its participant base.

Some key challenges remain, however. Most trading on the SME is still conducted via open outcry, rather than electronic matching. Trading hours are also limited to daytime in China, whereas the LME offers nearly 24-hour trading. The SME's contract specifications and settlement processes would also need changes to fully align with Western exchanges.

There are concerns about China's control over the metals market as well. China dominates both the demand and supply side of commodities like copper and steel. Some argue the SME is vulnerable to manipulation, especially as the Chinese government maintains significant influence. There is a long-held suspicion that China could use its sway over the exchange to impact commodity prices for its own benefit.

Others counter that increased transparency and regulation have mitigated risks of interference. They say the SME provides valuable price discovery for global markets and its data can offer important insights into China's vast metal sectors. The exchange generates $7 billion in annual trading revenues and provides an outlet for price speculation and risk management by a wide range of participants.

The SME has set a target to exceed $10 billion in daily trading volumes by 2021. Reaching that goal would require a massive influx of new members and contracts. While China's metals market has huge potential, the Shanghai exchange still needs to implement significant reforms and open its doors wider to foreign entities in order to truly develop into a global trading powerhouse. With government support, a modern trading venue and diverse international interest, the SME may be on a path to successâ€”but it remains to be seen whether it can fully overcome long-held doubts and create an exchange platform that leads all of Asia.
