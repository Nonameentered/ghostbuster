China Resumes Corn Exports, Sparking Price War Among Global Producers

China announced today that it would resume exports of corn for the first time in over a decade, a move that is expected to trigger a global price war in the billion-dollar corn market. China has been rebuilding its corn stockpiles and domestic production has soared, giving the country a surplus of grain it now looks to sell on the global market. The timing of the move caught analysts by surprise and threatens to disrupt the corn trade worldwide.

For years, China was the world's largest corn importer as its growing population and expanding middle class boosted domestic demand. The country relied heavily on corn imports, particularly from the United States, to meet demand. But China's farmers have been expanding corn plantings over the past decade as the government subsidized larger crop areas and new hybrid seeds boosted yields. This expansion in domestic production eliminated China's dependence on corn imports.

In the last crop cycle, China reported a harvest of 257 million tonnes of corn, its largest ever.With demand leveling off at around 220-230 million tonnes per year, China is now left with a surplus it needs to eliminate. Selling off some of its massive stockpiles on the global market is an ideal solution to this surplus, but risks flooding the market and hurting other producers.

The timing and scale of Chinese exports remain uncertain, though analysts say exports could range from 3 to 8 million tonnes per year, a sizeable amount in the 100 million tonne global corn trade.This has caused corn futures prices to drop sharply on commodities exchanges in anticipation of larger world corn supplies. Corn producers in the U.S., Brazil and Ukraine are worried the Chinese corn exports could weigh heavily on prices for the next several years. Farm groups are pressuring their governments to take action to protect domestic corn producers. A full-blown trade fight could also flare up between China and these competing exporters.
