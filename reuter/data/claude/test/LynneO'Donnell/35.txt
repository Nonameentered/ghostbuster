London Metal Exchange zinc prices hit 4-1/2 year high, but Chinese exports to Japan, not flooding the market 

Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange surged to their highest level in four and a half years this week, fueled by concerns over potential supply shortages. However, analysts say the price move is not due to Chinese producers flooding global markets with excess zinc.

LME zinc rose 2.7% on Tuesday to reach $2,960 per metric ton, the highest level since January 2015. The rally extends zinc's gains this year to 28% and reflects worries that major mine closures and project delays will lead to market deficits. Glencore, one of the world's top zinc producers, cut its global output forecast for this year by 100,000 tons due to problems at its Lady Loretta mine in Australia.

At the same time, demand for the metal used to galvanize steel is expected to pick up as major economies continue to recover from the pandemic downturn. Construction and transportation projects are consuming more steel, which in turn requires more zinc. 

While the price move occurred as new data showed a surge in Chinese zinc exports, analysts say the destination of those shipments suggests they are not the primary driver of LME zinc's advance. According to trade data, nearly 90% of China's zinc exports so far this month were bound for Japan. These shipments are largely comprised of special high grade zinc used to produce high-quality steel rather than for galvanizing steel.

"The exports to Japan do not reflect a push by Chinese producers to offload excess supplies into global markets," said Xiao Fu, head of commodity market analysis at Bank of China International. "It looks to be more demand-driven to meet specific needs in Japan's steel sector."

Total global zinc demand is projected to rise 5.5% to 14.5 million tons this year, while supply grows just 2% to 14.2 million tons, according to CRU Group. The forecast market deficit of around 300,000 tons will help keep LME zinc prices elevated in the coming months.

"We remain bullish on the zinc price due to the structural issues within the concentrate and metal sectors," Goldman Sachs said in a research note this week. The Wall Street bank has a 12-month target of $3,200 for LME zinc.

Continued demand recovery combined with supply shortfalls could push LME zinc to new multi-year highs, but a flood of Chinese exports is unlikely to be the catalyst behind further sharp price gains, analysts conclude. As Xiao put it, "The price move this week is a reflection more of strong fundamentals in the broader global market rather than excess volumes from China."
