China Could Increase Soybean Oil Imports as Traders Move Away From Palm Oil

China is expected to ramp up imports of soybean oil as food producers and traders shift away from palm oil, according to industry analysts. Palm oil has faced environmental concerns in recent years due to deforestation linked to palm oil plantations. In contrast, soybean oil is seen as a more sustainable alternative by many consumers and brands.

"We expect soybean oil imports to rise by at least 15-20% over the next few years as more Chinese buyers opt for it over palm oil," said James Zhou, China director at grains consultancy Zenith Agro. "Sustainability is becoming a bigger factor in purchasing decisions and soybean oil ticks more boxes for environmentally-conscious buyers."

China is already the world's biggest importer of soybeans, bringing in 83 million metric tons last year, mainly from the United States and Brazil. Most of those beans are crushed domestically to produce soybean meal for animal feed, but the oil is also used extensively in food products like snacks, instant noodles, and salad dressings. Palm oil currently still dominates China's edible oil market, but its market share is slipping. 

The move away from palm oil got a boost last year when major brands including Nestle, PepsiCo, and Unilever pledged to cut use of the controversial oil. China's government has also launched a nationwide "green food" certification program that promotes the use of sustainably-sourced ingredients. Soybean oil is expected to be a major beneficiary of these trends.

However, the transition will take time in a market as massive as China's. Palm oil consumption still grew by 2% last year and it remains popular with many food manufacturers and consumers due to its high yield and low cost. Restricting palm oil too quickly could also hurt farmers and economies in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

"Palm oil will continue to have a role, but probably a declining one, in China's edible oils market over the next decade," said Ivy Chu, analyst at grain market analysts Farms & Markets Advisory. "Soybean oil and other alternatives like canola and sunflower oil are poised to grab a bigger slice of the pie. It will be a slow evolution, not a quick switch."  

The shifting dynamics of China's edible oil market are set to boost demand for alternative oils and the crops that produce them. For soybean farmers and exporters already targeting China, this trend highlights another exciting growth avenue in the coming years.
