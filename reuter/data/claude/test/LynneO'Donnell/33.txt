Chinese Copper Producers Rush to Sell Amidst Fears of Future Price Correction

Major copper producers in China have accelerated their sales volumes in recent weeks amidst concerns that copper prices may face a correction in the coming months. Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have surged over 70% from their March lows to over $7,000 per metric ton, as China's economic activity has rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year. However, some analysts warn the price rise is not supported by fundamentals and Chinese producers are keen to lock in high prices before a potential drop. 

Three of China's largest copper producers—Jiangxi Copper, Tongling Nonferrous Metals, and China Daye Non-Ferrous Metals—have reportedly sold between 10 to 20% more copper cathode in September compared to August. Traders note the producers are selling not just current production but also tapping into stockpiled inventories to take advantage of the price spike. The rush to sell comes as copper inventories in China have been building over the past month, indicating supply is outpacing demand and higher prices are not sustainable.

"The fundamentals do not justify copper at $7,000/tonne," said Jon Lamb, metals analyst at Adamas Intelligence. "Yes, demand has recovered but inventories are rising and supply is not as tight as prices imply." The China Smelters Purchase Team, an industry group, noted that "smelters are producing at nearly full capacity but demand from downstream sectors has not caught up yet."

"For the dominant Chinese producers, the government has their back, so they can take a view to maximize profits today rather than hold out for even higher, uncertain prices down the road," said Nick Adams, senior commodities analyst at Starlight Investments. 

However, other producers and traders, especially in the rest of the world, are hesitant
