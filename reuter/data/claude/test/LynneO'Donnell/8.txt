Chinese Zinc Producers to Export More, Causing Possible Supply Squeeze and Higher Prices at Home, say Far East Metal Traders  

Major Chinese zinc producers are stepping up exports of the base metal this year in an effort to capitalize on robust demand and higher London Metals Exchange (LME) prices overseas. However, some traders and industry analysts in China warn the increased flow of zinc supplies out of China could lead to tighter domestic availability of zinc and possibly higher local prices.

According to trade data, China exported 195,000 tonnes of zinc and zinc alloy products in the first five months of this year, up 37% from the same period a year ago. The notable rise in exports comes amid a recovery in global demand for the metal used to galvanize steel, especially with infrastructure and construction projects picking up in the U.S. and Europe following pandemic-related shutdowns last year. At the same time, LME zinc prices have rallied over 25% since late last year to their highest levels since mid-2018.

The higher LME prices and demand abroad have incentivized China's large zinc smelters to sell more metal into overseas markets. Zhu Changlin, a zinc analyst at Beijing Antaike Information, said if exports remain strong through the rest of this year, it could reduce the supply of zinc available for domestic buyers in China. "There is a possibility local zinc prices may face upward pressure due to the tightening in supply," he said. 

However, some industry executives note China's zinc market remains well supplied overall. The country is by far the world's largest zinc producer, mining about 5.5 million tonnes last year. While exports rose sharply in the first five months of 2021, total shipments abroad were still equivalent to only about 7% of China's total zinc output over that period.

"Even with the increase we've seen so far, the percentage of Chinese zinc production being exported is still very small," said Chen Xing, a manager at a mid-sized smelter in central China. "The domestic market here won't be significantly affected unless we see exports really skyrocket from current levels, which is unlikely given the huge amounts of zinc China normally consumes internally every year."

Still, China's zinc exports are closely monitored because changes in flows can impact supply and prices both domestically and internationally.
