China's 1997 budget targets met with praise but debt-ridden SOEs and high unemployment remain concerns

BEIJING - China's economic policymakers received praise this week after meeting growth targets set for 1997. In his annual work report, Premier Li Peng announced that China achieved its goal of 8% GDP growth, holding inflation below 5% for the year. The budget deficit did not exceed the targeted 3% of GDP.

However, Li cautioned that significant challenges remain for the Chinese economy. Chief among those are the staggering levels of debt accumulated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and stubbornly high unemployment. The inefficient SOEs employ over 100 million people but rely heavily on government subsidies and loans to stay afloat. Their poor performance has been a drag on economic growth and jobs.

Meanwhile, China's official unemployment rate remains at 6.1%, but most analysts consider the real rate to be significantly higher, perhaps as much as 10-15% in urban areas. The employment challenges are putting pressure on China's leadership to accelerate economic reforms, further open China's economy to foreign investment, and overhaul the state sector. 

Li announced new measures to address both problems in his report. The government will close unviable SOEs, promote mergers and privatizations, increase manager accountability, and stop subsidizing chronically unprofitable enterprises. Over the next three years, China aims to reduce SOE employment by 40 million. The goal is to make remaining SOEs more competitive and profit-driven.   

To boost job growth, China will invest in vocational training programs, provide tax incentives and loans for private businesses, and increase foreign investment access in more areas of the economy, especially the growing service sector. The country is also investing heavily in infrastructure to stimulate economic growth and job creation.

While the policy goals are clear, implementing the changes will be challenging. SOE reform risks significant job losses and social unrest if not handled properly. Expanding the private sector is difficult in the face of bureaucratic hurdles and preferential treatment for state-backed companies.
