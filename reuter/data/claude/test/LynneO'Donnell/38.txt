China's Ample Copper Supplies Could Eliminate Need to Buy on World Market, Traders Say 

China, the world's largest consumer of copper, may not need to buy any copper on the global market this year thanks to ample domestic supplies, according to some traders. China's copper imports have plunged this year as the country's smelters boosted production and as weaker economic growth depressed demand.

China's refined copper output jumped 9.5% in June from a year earlier to a record 856,000 metric tons. For the first half of 2020, China's copper production rose 8.7% from a year earlier. At the same time, China's unwrought copper and copper product imports fell 26% from a year earlier in the first five months of the year.

If that trend continues in the second half, China may produce more copper than it consumes this year, eliminating the need for imports for the first time. Some traders said China could become a small net exporter of copper if the supply and demand dynamics remain the same in the coming months.

A swing into surplus would be a blow to copper prices and producers around the world that rely on China's huge appetite for the metal. Copper futures in Shanghai and on the Comex market in New York fell at the start of the week's trading on concerns about slowing demand growth in China and more broadly.  

The weaker global economy and U.S.-China trade tensions have weighed on China's copper imports, but the main reasons for the sharp slowdown are high domestic supply and slower construction activity. China's fixed-asset investment grew at the weakest pace on record in the first half of the year, putting a damper on copper-intensive construction and infrastructure projects.

China's domestic copper supply, meanwhile, has surged thanks to investment in production capacity as well as restarts of smelters that were shut down last year for maintenance and environmental controls. New sustainable copper sources coming online from recyclers have also boosted supply.  

One Beijing trader said he expected China to produce at least 1.7 million metric tons of refined copper this year, while consumption may fall below 9 million tons. That would leave China with a surplus of more than 100,000 tons, eliminating any need for imports, he said. Some other traders also forecast small net exports from China this year, a big reversal from last year's net imports of more than 600,000 tons.

To be sure, some analysts are skeptical China can turn into a significant net exporter and expect imports to rebound to more normal levels later this year. An economic recovery in China and globally could revive construction activity and boost copper demand. And global copper mine supply is forecast to fall this year, which may eventually tighten the market and lift prices.  

But for now, China's huge domestic copper supplies appear more than adequate to meet demand, according to traders. And that bearish dynamic is taking the shine off the price of copper.
