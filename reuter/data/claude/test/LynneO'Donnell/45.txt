Chinese Copper Buyers Purchase in Small Lots, High Prices Prevent Significant Buying in Short Term  

Chinese copper importers made modest purchases of the red metal this week, buying in small volumes as high prices deterred major restocking. Purchases were made at a premium of about $130 per metric ton over the London Metal Exchange's cash settlement price.

Copper prices have rallied more than 30% from their March lows on prospects of improving demand as major economies emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. However, prices remain elevated for Chinese buyers, limiting their ability to make large-scale purchases, according to traders. The most-active copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange hit a two-year high this week. 

Some buyers took the opportunity to make small restocking purchases to meet short-term needs, purchasing around 5,000 to 10,000 tons of imported copper. But most Chinese buyers remain on the sidelines, adopting a wait-and-see approach to see if prices decline from current levels. Major buying is unlikely until prices drop another 5% to 10%, according to importers.

“Purchases are very light. Most people still think the price is too high and are unwilling to buy at this level,” said a copper importer based in eastern China. “The high price has held back many small private consumers from replenishing stocks.”

Copper stocks in exchange and bonded warehouses in China have declined in recent weeks but remain at healthy levels, reducing the urgency for buyers to make large-scale purchases. Inventories should remain stable at current levels if imports stay limited in the coming weeks, according to analysts.  

Some industry participants expect copper demand in China will weaken in the third quarter compared with the second as the initial boost in orders from easing lockdowns fades. Property construction, which consumes around half of China's copper, is also expected to slow as Beijing limits real-estate speculation.

“Demand in China is tapering off after an initial rebound,” said a trader at an international metals trading firm. “The pace of recovery appears uneven, and a double-dip recession is still possible if there's another wave of virus cases.”

While a global economic rebound should support copper prices in the longer run, over the short-term demand uncertainty and steady supply are likely to cap major price gains. For Chinese buyers, lower prices are needed before significant new orders for imported copper are placed, traders and analysts said.
