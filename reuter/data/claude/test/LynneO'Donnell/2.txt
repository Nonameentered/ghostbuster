Chinese Demand for Soymeal Imports Drops as Prices Soar Above $320 a Tonne C&F  

Chinese soymeal import demand has declined significantly in recent weeks as prices have surged above $320 a tonne cost and freight, according to trade sources. The higher prices are squeezing crush margins for China’s soybean processors and reducing appetite for overseas cargoes.  

China is the world’s top importer of soybeans, which it crushes to make soymeal to feed livestock and soyoil for cooking. But domestic soybean prices in China have jumped more than 25% since January to record highs, fueled by strong demand and some logistics delays. The rally has outpaced gains in hog feed demand, reducing crush margins for China’s soy processors.  

 “Demand for imports has slowed a lot, crushers are not making much money and are hesitating to take beans at these prices,” said a Singapore-based soymeal trader. “The buying interest today is very limited as people expect bean prices to come off.”

Chinese soybean futures prices hit an all-time record of 6,393 yuan ($997) per tonne on Wednesday. Soymeal futures were at record high of 5,750 yuan per tonne, up more than 30% since January.  

The drop in import demand has coincided with a seasonal lull in China’s soybean demand after the first quarter. But crushers say business remains lackluster even for this time of year, with many plants losing money due to the high bean costs.

“The (soybean) rally has been so fast that crushers are unwilling to crush beans now. They are not profitable,” said a manager at a major crusher in southern China.

China imports about 100 million tonnes of soybeans each year, with the bulk of shipments arriving during the October to February period. Adverse weather has at times disrupted logistics in recent months, exacerbating supply tightness. But crushers say stocks at ports and crushing plants are adequate currently, and the main factor behind high prices is speculation and strong underlying demand for meals as hog feed. 

 China has also bought large volumes from the United States as part of the Phase 1 trade deal. Additional U.S. exports have not fully reached China yet, adding to near-term supply pressures. But crushers expect margins to improve once more U.S. beans arrive and domestic demand slows in spring.

“Crush margins are expected to continue to drop in the next 1-2 months before stabilizing,” said the crusher manager. “It is likely to bottom in early May.”

Until then, China’s imports are set to slow from record volumes in the first quarter of around 23.5 million tonnes, according to trade estimates. April imports may fall to around 5.5 million to 7 million tonnes, with demand from state buyers also curbed by high prices. But some pick-up is expected ahead of the South American harvest from May.

“There are still some sales being done at $320-325 a tonne cfr, but volumes are limited,” said another Singapore-based trader. “I expect some more business once prices come down to $310 or below.”  

Barring any weather shocks, China’s high bean prices are expected to ease in the coming months with South America’s peak harvesting and as domestic demand eases into summer. Crush margins should then start to recover, potentially boosting import appetite once again in the world’s top soy buyer.
