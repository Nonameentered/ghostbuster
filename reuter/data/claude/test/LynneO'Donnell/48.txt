Australian Prime Minister Works to Improve Relationship with China

CANBERRA, Australia—Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced today that strengthening Australia's relationship with China would be one of his top foreign policy priorities. The announcement signals a shift from previous Australian governments which have taken a more cautious approach to China in recent years. 

Speaking at the National Press Club, Morrison emphasized China's importance as a key economic partner for Australia. "China's rise means Australia has to succeed and prosper in a global environment shaped by China's growing influence," Morrison said. "We want to build trusted relationships, not just transactional ones."

The move comes amid ongoing trade tensions with China, which has placed restrictions on some Australian exports like coal, wine, and barley. Morrison hopes to reset the relationship by promoting cooperation and collaboration between the two countries. The Prime Minister will travel to Beijing later this year to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking the first official visit by an Australian Prime Minister since 2016.

Morrison outlined several areas where Australia and China could work together more closely, including trade, tourism, education, and renewable energy. "By further opening our markets and encouraging two-way investment, Australia and China can achieve mutual economic benefit and prosperity," Morrison said. However, Morrison also acknowledged key differences between the two countries on issues like human rights, intellectual property protection, and the South China Sea. 

Not all Australian politicians support Morrison's push for closer China ties. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese urged caution, saying "Australia's national interest must always come first in our international relationships." Some fear becoming too economically dependent on China and urge diversifying trade partners. But analysts argue Australia has little choice but to engage its largest trading partner if it wants its economy to continue growing.

The move towards cooperation has been welcomed by Chinese officials. China's Ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, praised Morrison's "vision and courage" and looked forward to working together on trade, culture, tourism, and other issues. If executed well, improved ties between Australia and China could signal a new chapter in the sometimes delicate but crucial relationship between the two sides. Overall, many see this tentative détente as a positive sign, even as uncertainties remain.
