Far East Copper and Zinc Traders Focus on Lunar New Year Celebrations and Tight Supply Fundamentals 

Copper and zinc traders in China and across the Far East are focused on the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays in February and tightening supply fundamentals, according to analysts and sources surveyed by Metal Bulletin.

The Lunar New Year festival, also known as Spring Festival, will result in closures of major industrial companies and supply chain disruptions in China for at least a week in mid-February. Demand for copper and zinc is expected to drop during this period, which could weigh on prices. However, any price dips may be temporary given the supply constraints in concentrates and concern over mine closures.  

“The market is boring right now due to the holidays but when everyone comes back, the focus will return to the concentrate shortages and potential mine closures,” a copper trader in Shanghai said. “The supply issues haven’t gone away.”

Copper concentrate markets remain tight due to chronic underperformance at major mines in Chile and Peru. Zinc concentrate supply is even more precarious with major mines facing depletion and few new projects coming online. Glencore’s Brunswick lead-zinc mine in Canada is set to close in 2022 and India’s Rampura Agucha zinc mine is struggling with ore grades declining more quickly than expected.

Complicating matters are worker strikes at major mines threatening supply security. For example, BHP’s union workers at Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, voted to reject the company’s offer for a new collective deal and could now indulge in a strike, a member of the union said. A protracted work stoppage at the Escondida mine could take out 1-4% of global copper production in the coming months. 

Investment bank Goldman Sachs said it expects copper prices to rally to $9,000/tonne within three months and zinc to reach $4,000/tonne due to the “perspectively perilous” supply conditions. ANZ Bank said it is “cautiously optimistic” on copper given demand from renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors in addition to supply challenges. 

Against this backdrop, many market participants in Asia expect copper and zinc prices to find support and remain at elevated levels for the first few months of 2020 despite the usual slowdown over the Lunar New Year. The supply issues faced by copper and zinc producers the world over mean demand-supply balances are likely to remain delicate even as China emerges from the Spring Festival. The upcoming holiday appears to be a mere hiccup in what promises to be an eventful year for base metals markets fraught with supply anxiety.
