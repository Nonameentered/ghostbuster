MIM Holdings to Halve Zinc Supplies to Europe, LME Traders Await Reaction

MIM Holdings, the world's largest zinc producer, announced today that it will cut its zinc concentrate shipments to European smelters by 50% in the third quarter of this year. The move is in response to high treatment and refining charges  imposed by European smelters that have significantly reduced MIM's profit margins. 

The cuts are the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute over zinc treatment charges between major miners and European smelters. Treatment charges are fees paid by miners to smelters to process raw zinc concentrates into refined metal. Smelters argue they need to increase charges to account for environmental regulations and lower zinc prices. Miners counter that the hikes are excessive and threaten their operations.

MIM Holdings ships over 3 million tonnes of zinc in concentrate annually from its mines in Australia, South America and North America. Europe receives about 20% of MIM's total shipments, so a 50% cut will remove around 300,000 tonnes of supply from European smelters in the third quarter. The shortfall could put major pressure on European smelters already dealing with stagnant demand and overcapacity.

Traders on the London Metal Exchange are awaiting reaction to the announcement. Prices for high-grade zinc rose 2.3% following the news. However, further gains may be limited as MIM’s cuts are only for three months and the market remains well supplied overall. The zinc price is down 15% from its February high due to a slowdown in China's manufacturing sector.  

The dispute highlights the power imbalance in the zinc supply chain. Miners have struggled in recent years with a long-term decline in commodity prices, while smelters have more flexibility to pass on costs due to their monopolies over processing capacity.
 
Some analysts view MIM's move as a negotiating tactic to pressure European smelters before annual supply contracts are settled for 2020. A 50% cut is substantial enough to severely impact smelters’ operations but short enough to avoid permanently damaging business relationships. Both sides need to reach a compromise to ensure stable zinc flows going forward.  The outcome of the negotiations will significantly impact profitability for both miners and smelters next year.

In conclusion, MIM Holding's decision to cut half its zinc supplies to Europe for a quarter sparks fresh tensions in an ongoing battle over treatment charges with smelters. The shortfall could hamper European smelters but is unlikely to roil the broader market given excess supplies and weak demand. Attention now turns to crucial contract talks to see whether MIM's warning shot leads to lower treatment charges next year or merely hardens each side's stance. Overall, the discord within the zinc supply chain poses challenges for profitable production growth looking ahead.
