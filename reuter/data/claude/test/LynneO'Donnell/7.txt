Chinese Zinc Producers to Export Amid High International Prices leading to Domestic Supply Squeeze and Higher Prices at Home, say Far East Metal Traders 

Chinese zinc producers are likely to increase exports of zinc ingots and zinc concentrates to take advantage of strong international prices, according to metal traders in Asia. The London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc price surged to a 5-year high of $3,800 per tonne this week amid bullish sentiment and supply tightness.

Traders said some Chinese zinc smelters have restarted capacity to boost production. "Smelters have restarted some idled capacity as the current zinc price means even higher-cost smelters can operate profitably," said a trader in Singapore. China's zinc smelting capacity utilization rate has increased to around 70% now from around 60% earlier this year.  

The higher exports from China, which produces nearly half of the world's zinc, are likely to ease tightness in the international market and weigh on LME zinc prices going forward. However, it may also lead to a supply squeeze in the Chinese domestic market and push Shanghai zinc prices even higher.

Shanghai zinc prices have been at a premium of $150-250 per tonne over LME zinc in recent months due to supply tightness within China. The premium is likely to widen further if more material is exported. "There will be less zinc available for the Chinese spot market if exports rise, and this should support Shanghai zinc prices," a Beijing-based trader said.

China's net zinc exports rose to 50,000 tonnes in March, the highest in six months, from 35,000 tonnes in February, according to customs data. For the first quarter, China exported 135,000 tonnes of zinc, up 60% from a year earlier. "We expect higher growth in China's zinc exports in the coming months as the arbitrage window is open," an analyst at CRU Group said. 

China exported around 1 million tonnes of refined zinc in 2019 but the tonnage declined to 400,000 tonnes last year. Analysts expect exports to rebound to over 500,000 tonnes this year given the wider price spread between LME and Shanghai zinc prices and restarts of some smelting capacity.

While the prospect of higher Chinese zinc exports is bearish for LME zinc, some analysts warn that the arbitrage opportunity may not last long. "Zinc fundamentals remain tight globally with mine supply under pressure and demand recovering. Higher exports from China could be short-lived," an analyst at Macquarie said in a note. LME on-warrant zinc inventories are at their lowest in decades at under 60,000 tonnes which provides price support, analysts added.
