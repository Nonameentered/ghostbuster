Chinese Sugar Processors Hoarding Supplies in Anticipation of Improved Prices After Lunar New Year Holiday

Sugar processors and merchants in China have been holding on to record amounts of raw sugar and refined sugar inventories in recent weeks, betting that sugar prices will rise after the Lunar New Year holidays conclude in early February. According to industry data, raw sugar stocks have reached 900,000 tons while refined sugar inventories are at 1.2 million tons—the highest levels seen in over five years.

The price of raw sugar and white sugar has declined steadily since October due to an oversupply in the global market and decreased demand in China. However, many in China’s sugar industry expect the downward trend to reverse after the 15-day Lunar New Year festival. Millions of Chinese will shop and consume more sugar-containing foods and drinks during and after the holiday. At the same time, sugar supply may tighten as Brazil’s sugar mills slow down crushing in the coming months. 

“We think sugar prices are at or near the bottom, so we are holding on to as much inventory as possible until demand picks up again after the New Year holiday,” said a manager at a sugar trading company based in Guangdong province. “If prices rise as expected, we can sell at higher profits.”

The hoarding activity has contributed to a slowdown in sugar imports into China, the world’s biggest sugar importer. China’s 2019 raw sugar import quotas were fully used up in December, but actual sugar deliveries and customs clearances have dropped noticeably. Some traders have deferred shipments that were scheduled to arrive during January and February.

While the strategy to stock up at low prices may pay off if the market moves in China’s sugar industry’s favor, it is not without risks. If global sugar prices continue to decline or stay depressed for a prolonged period, the value of accumulated inventories will drop significantly. Moreover, storage and financing costs will mount over time. Some analysts argue current prices already reflect expected demand changes and the hoarding may not produce the desired outcome.

Whether China’s sugar processors have outmaneuvered the market will become clear over the coming months. For now, huge stockpiles are being closely guarded in anticipation of possible gains. After the New Year, all eyes will be on price movements and inventory levels in the world’s top sugar market.
