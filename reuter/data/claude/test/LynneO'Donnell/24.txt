Far East traders speculate on China's copper buying amidst LME rally

Copper traders in Asia are closely watching the London Metal Exchange (LME), where copper futures crossed the $6,000 per tonne mark this week for the first time in over two years. The recent rally in copper prices has fueled speculation that Chinese buyers may step in to replenish inventories and support further price gains.  

Copper is up nearly 15% so far this year due to solid demand from China and supply disruptions in Chile, the world's largest copper producer. The reopening of economies as COVID-19 restrictions ease has boosted demand for the industrial metal used in everything from construction to electronics. Tightening supply from Chile, where some major mines have faced temporary closures due to accidents, has also supported the price surge.

"The stars have aligned for copper with demand accelerating at the same time that supply has disappointed,” said commodities analyst John Meyer. “The recent price strength may entice Chinese buyers back into the market after staying on the sidelines for most of this year."

Chinese copper importers have held off on large purchases so far in 2021 as they saw limited short-term upside for prices and already had sufficient inventories. However, with the rally gaining momentum and supply remaining tight, market participants expect the buyers to return. “At some point, the Chinese will have to come in and restock,” a Singapore-based copper trader said. “Demand is picking up, and they can't rely on their existing inventories forever.”

If China makes substantial new purchases, it would provide a strong boost to copper prices and the overall bullish sentiment for copper. While some analysts warn the rally could run out of steam if China fails to step up its buying or if Chilean supply bounces back, the traders in Singapore and Hong Kong seem willing to bet on even higher prices in the coming months.   

“We broke through several technical resistance levels this week, and the bulls are in full control,” a metals broker in Hong Kong said. “If the Chinese actually do come in chasing prices here, we could see copper make a run at the $6,500 level. There's a lot of momentum right now, so stay long and enjoy the ride.”

The speculative mood in the Far East trading hubs demonstrate the outsized role China plays in base metals markets. As the world's largest importer and consumer of copper, China has an unparalleled ability to influence global prices with a sudden surge or drop in its buying. For now, copper traders across Asia eagerly await China's next move.
