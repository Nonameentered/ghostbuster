Chinese consultancy predicts short-lived rise in copper prices due to lack of fundamentals 

Copper prices have risen over the past month on optimism about improving demand from China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal. However, Chinese commodities consultancy Beijing Antaike predicts the rally will be short-lived due to a lack of strong fundamentals to support a sustained increase in prices.

Copper futures on the London Metal Exchange rose to a 28-month high of $7,348 per tonne last week. The price increase comes amid hopes that China’s manufacturing sector is rebounding from the slowdown caused by trade tensions with the United States. Recent data shows China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index rising for the third straight month in October.

However, Beijing Antaike said in a note that the recent optimism is misplaced. According to the consultancy, China’s copper demand growth is set to slow to less than 1% this year from 2% in 2018. Weakness in the property and appliance sectors, which account for about 50-60% of copper consumption, will weigh heavily on demand. Beijing Antaike expects China to see a copper surplus of 200,000 tonnes this year and says the recent price rally does not match the bearish fundamentals.

“The strong price rise over the past month is largely owing to speculative funds betting on an economic recovery and restocking demand, not owing to a real recovery in downstream demand or tightness in supply and demand,” Beijing Antaike said in the note. The consultancy recommended that investors take profits and avoid chasing copper prices higher.

Beijing Antaike’s view contrasts with some major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Citi, which expect copper prices to continue rising into next year due to an anticipated recovery in demand following recent economic stimulus measures in China. The banks forecast multi-year supply deficits due to a lack of new projects coming online.  

However, Beijing Antaike argued that China’s stimulus policies will only have a limited effect on copper demand. The consultancy said infrastructure investment growth is slowing in China, while the residential property market remains weak. Power infrastructure investment, which relies heavily on copper, is also slowing.  

On the supply side, Beijing Antaike noted that copper mine production continues to grow steadily and there are few indications of major mine disruptions. The consultancy said copper production in China, the world’s largest producer, rose 5.7% in the first nine months of 2019.  

Given its bearish view, Beijing Antaike recommended that copper producers and traders should avoid expanding output blindly. The consultancy said it is unlikely the recent price gains can be sustained without a significant change in the weak demand situation in China. According to Beijing Antaike, a return to more robust demand growth will require wider economic recovery and success in trade negotiations with the U.S.
