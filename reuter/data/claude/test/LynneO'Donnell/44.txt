Millions of Rotting Corn in China Threaten Local Supplies and Force Prices Up

A record amount of China's corn crops have gone unharvested and left to rot in the fields this summer due to weak demand from the livestock sector, disease, and hot and humid weather. As much as 18 million tons of corn, or about 20 percent of China's national harvest last year, have spoiled, according to industry experts. The large crop losses are threatening to tighten local supplies and push up corn prices in China, the world's second largest corn consumer. 

China typically produces around 200-220 million tons of corn each year, mostly used as feedstock for the country's massive pork and poultry industries. However, a deadly pig disease has significantly reduced China's hog herd over the past year, cutting demand for corn feed. At the same time, heavy rains and hot weather have led to the spread of fungi and other crop diseases, damaging cornfields across China's key producing regions in the northeast and central plains.

The damaged and unharvested crops represent a major loss for China's corn farmers and threaten to impact many who rely on corn as a staple food. Corn prices in China have already risen more than 15 percent since June due to concerns over tightening supplies. If a large portion of the damaged crops cannot be salvaged and processed for animal feed or industrial use, corn prices could increase further and result in higher meat and poultry prices across China.

To ensure sufficient supplies and stabilize prices, the Chinese government has announced it will release corn from its state reserves and also increase imports of corn and alternative grains like barley or sorghum, which can be used as substitutes for corn feed. However, the government only holds limited reserves and increased imports may not fully make up for the large crop losses. Some livestock farmers may face feed shortages and higher costs, forcing them to cull more of their herds.

The amount of spoiled crops this year highlights the urgency for China to reform its agricultural sector, experts say. China's corn farming remains dominated by small farms that lack advanced technology or risk management techniques to effectively deal with disease outbreaks and extreme weather. Government subsidies have also encouraged farmers to plant more corn than is actually needed. Improving agricultural productivity, encouraging more sustainable plantings, and building a more robust supply chain could help China reduce vast amounts of wasted food in the coming years. But reforming the system will require major investments and shifts that may take decades to fully realize.
