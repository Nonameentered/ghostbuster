Chinese Copper Trading Sources Predict Liquidation-Related Correction for Sky-High World Copper Prices  

Copper prices on global commodity markets have surged over 50% from their March 2020 lows to reach multi-year highs, fueled by economic recovery optimism and liquidity-driven investment flows. However, sources within the Chinese copper trading community predict this rally may soon reverse course. They anticipate a correction of 10-15% in international copper prices over the coming weeks due to a slowdown in the blistering pace of new investment into commodity index funds and the potential unwinding of highly leveraged copper long positions.

The recent copper price rally to over $10,000 per metric ton has been predominantly driven by investor interest rather than a significant uptick in real-world copper demand according to Chinese copper traders. "The industrial demand recovery is still gradual, but financial money has poured into copper on growth hopes and in search of yield," noted a Shanghai-based copper trader. New investment into commodity index funds that buy copper reached record highs earlier in 2021, but this pace of new inflows has started to slow in recent weeks based on industry data.  

At the same time, a number of hedge funds and other institutional investors built up large long positions in copper using high leverage over the past year in anticipation of a commodity supercycle. However, the slowdown in new investment inflows raises the risk of position liquidation by some of these leveraged long investors, especially those facing margin calls. "If a few big funds have to unwind longs due to margin calls, it could trigger a cascade of stop-loss selling and take copper down very quickly," warned a copper broker in Beijing.  

While a 10-15% correction would still leave copper prices substantially higher year-to-date, it illustrates the shaky foundations of the recent copper rally according to the Chinese copper trading sources. They argue fundamentals do not support continued strong price gains at this juncture. In their view, copper prices are likely to enter a more prolonged consolidation phase pending concrete signs of improving industrial demand and physical tightness in the global copper market. The next few weeks could be volatile if leveraged position unwinding materializes, but the medium-term trend is for rangebound and choppy copper price action rather than a charge to new multi-year highs according to sources in China's copper trading hub.
