Death of Deng Xiaoping Unlikely to Affect Shanghai Gang's Grip on Power, Say Analysts  

The death of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is unlikely to significantly impact the political influence of the so-called Shanghai Gang, a powerful faction within the Chinese Communist Party leadership, according to most China analysts. Deng, who served as China's paramount leader from 1978 to 1992, passed away on February 19 at the age of 92.

Deng had been ill for some time and had not played an active role in politics for over two years. His death, while symbolic, is seen as largely inevitable and is not expected to alter the balance of power within elite CCP circles. The Shanghai Gang, led by former president Jiang Zemin, has dominated Chinese politics for the past decade and still controls many levers of power, including influential positions in the military and state security apparatus. 

"Deng's death closes a chapter in China's history but the Shanghai Gang remains firmly in control," said Arthur Wang, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They have spent years consolidating power and sidelining potential rivals. They are now positioned to choose Deng's successor on their own terms."

Deng's allies and protégés, like current president Hu Jintao, had hoped Deng would live long enough to act as a counterweight to the Shanghai Gang's influence. With Deng now gone, the Shanghai Gang has a freer hand to promote its own candidates for top leadership positions at the Communist Party Congress next year. 

However, some analysts argue that the Shanghai Gang's grip on power could face challenges from other factions within the next few years. Their policies have exacerbated China's economic inequality and the lavish lifestyles of some CCP officials have sparked public resentment. There are also signs of a growing split between the Shanghai Gang and Communist Youth League factions.

"The post-Deng power transition will not be straightforward," said Victor Shih, associate professor at Northwestern University. "There are undercurrents of dissatisfaction with the Shanghai Gang that could eventually coalesce into a serious threat. But for now, they remain firmly in control and Deng's death is unlikely to change that."

Deng was instrumental in launching China's economic reforms in the late 1970s and spearheading its transition from a planned to market economy. His bold policies ushered in an era of rapid economic growth that transformed China into a major global economic powerhouse. Deng's legacy as the architect of China's reform and opening up is expected to cement his status as a towering figure in China's modern history.
