Shanghai pays tribute to late leader Deng Xiaoping in quiet ceremony

Shanghai government officials and residents paid tribute to late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on the 25th anniversary of his death Tuesday in a quiet ceremony in the city. 

Deng, who served as the paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992, passed away on February 19, 1997 at the age of 92. He was widely regarded as the architect of China's reform and opening-up policies, pioneering the transformation of China into a global economic powerhouse.

A memorial ceremony was held at Deng's former residence in Shanghai, where he lived in the 1920s. Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Li Qiang and other senior officials laid flowers in front of a bronze statue of Deng. 

The city government said the low-key event was held to follow guidance on avoiding large public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. "Deng Xiaoping Theory" research and publicity campaigns have also been carried out in local universities and government agencies to commemorate Deng.

Deng was born in 1904 in Sichuan province. He served as China's paramount leader following Mao Zedong's death in 1976, enacting far-reaching market-economy reforms. He dismantled Mao's communist economic system and opened China to foreign investment and trade.

Under Deng's leadership, China achieved substantial improvements in agricultural production, standards of living, and industrial capacity. China's GDP grew at an average annual rate of over 9.5% during the 1980s. Deng's policies lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and led to the resumption of diplomatic relations with Western nations.

Deng's legacy as a transformative leader who set China on the path of sustained economic development and prosperity lives on today. His pioneering role in shaping China's future through "reform and opening up" and socialist modernization laid the groundwork for the "Shanghai model" of development. The metropolis has now become a symbol of China's reform and opening up success.
