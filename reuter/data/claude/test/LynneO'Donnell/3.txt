Chinese soybean and soybean meal imports surge as soyoil resales continue 

China's imports of soybeans and soybean meal surged in October, according to the latest customs data released this week. Soybean imports rose 12% from a year ago to 7.92 million tonnes, hitting the highest level since March. Soybean meal imports jumped 51% from last year to 2.6 million tonnes.

The increases come as Chinese companies continue to resell soyoil cargoes that they had contracted earlier this year. The resales have boosted demand for raw materials like soybeans and soybean meal to produce more soyoil for domestic use and exports. 

Soyoil prices in China have risen due to tight supplies and strong demand. The price increase has made it profitable for companies to resell their previously contracted soyoil cargoes and replace them with new production. Chinese companies are also exporting more soyoil to meet demand in other Asian markets, especially India and Pakistan.

The higher soybean imports are in line with market expectations, according to analysts. Tight supplies in China had triggered a surge in soybean purchases from the U.S. in September. The October imports show that crushers in China are continuing to ramp up operations to meet demand for meal and oil, although margins have started to decline from very high levels.

Going forward, China's soybean and soy product imports are expected to remain strong in coming months due to resilient demand and as crushers fulfill previously contracted purchases. The U.S.-China trade deal has also set a target for China to buy at least $12.5 billion more in agricultural goods from the U.S. this year, including soybeans, compared with 2017.

However, growth may slow from the high levels in October and September. Crush margins in China have narrowed due to the price rise in raw materials and are approaching break-even levels for some crushers. There are also risks that a further increase in COVID-19 cases in China may curtail domestic demand if additional lockdowns are imposed, although officials are keen to avoid another nation-wide shutdown.

Overall, while October's import figures reflect China's strong demand for soybeans and soybean meal currently, the outlook is more uncertain going into 2021 as crush margins weaken and macroeconomic conditions remain fragile due to the pandemic. The coming months will test if China's solid imports of U.S. farm goods are sustainable as stipulated in the trade deal.
