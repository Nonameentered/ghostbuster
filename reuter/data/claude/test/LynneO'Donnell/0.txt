Chinese Interest in Soymeal Imports Drops as Prices Surge Above $320 a Tonne C&F

Chinese soymeal buyers have pulled back from the global market as prices surged above $320 a tonne C&F (cost and freight) into China, the world's largest importer. Soymeal prices have climbed over 20% since the start of 2017 due to strong demand and diminishing old-crop supplies. The price surge has reduced China's appetite for imported soymeal and prompted some buyers to switch to alternative feeds like dried distillers grains.  

"At over $320 a tonne, imported soymeal isn’t competitive for Chinese feed mills compared to alternative protein sources,” said a China-based feed buyer. Old-crop soymeal supplies from top exporters Argentina and Brazil are depleting, supporting global prices. But the higher costs are making soymeal a less attractive feed option for price-sensitive Chinese buyers. Some are substituting 30-50% of soymeal in feed rations with cheaper alternatives like palm kernel meal and rapeseed meal.

Chinese soymeal demand and imports were strong in the first quarter but have slowed recently. First-quarter Chinese soymeal imports jumped over 40% from last year to 4.2 million tonnes, according to customs data. However, April imports fell 19% from March to 1.4 million tonnes. Some Chinese buyers have delayed cargoes or cut volumes under existing contracts. A drop in China's pig prices and margins at commercial farms has also reduced demand for protein-rich soymeal used in hog feed.  

Global soymeal exporters in South America are hoping demand from other markets like Europe and Southeast Asia will offset the drop in Chinese interest. But a slower export pace could pressure prices, analysts said. Some forecast China's soymeal imports this year may be lower than the 2016 record of 24 million tones. China's decision on whether or not to sell state soymeal reserves could also influence demand for imported beans and meal in coming months.
