Summer Flooding Cuts Tin Production at Major Chinese Mine, But Impact Limited by Lacklustre Market  

Heavy rainfall and flooding over the summer months have disrupted operations at China's largest tin mine, leading to a drop in production that is likely to cut global tin supply this year. However, weak demand and low tin prices mean the impact on the overall market is expected to be limited.

The Dachang tin mine in Guangxi province produced around 45,000 tonnes of tin in concentrate last year, accounting for more than 10% of global tin mine production. Operations at the mine and associated processing facilities were halted for almost two weeks in July and August due to severe flooding in the region. Owner China Minmetals has not provided specific details on production losses, but industry analysts estimate output may have dropped by at least 5,000 tonnes, equivalent to more than 1% of worldwide tin supply. 

"The flooding has definitely curtailed production from Dachang over the last couple of months and they are playing catch-up now to reach their target for the year," said James Willoughby, analyst at commodity research firm CRU Group. "But with the tin price still quite depressed, the overall revenue loss may be mitigated to some extent."

Tin prices on the London Metal Exchange have fallen around 25% over the last year and currently stand at just under $19,000 per tonne, their lowest level since 2016. Willoughby said weak demand from electronics companies, the largest end-users of tin, has weighed heavily on the market. 

Solder is the largest application for tin, used ubiquitously in circuit boards and other electronic components. However, sales of consumer electronics have stagnated recently amid a softer global economy and trade tensions between the US and China. This has filtered through to tin demand and prices.

While supply disruptions would typically drive commodity prices higher, in the current lacklustre environment additional tonnages from other producers may be enough to fill the gap left by Dachang. Indonesia's large tin smelting industries are running well below capacity and could likely boost supply if required. 

China Minmetals is aiming to restart full operations at Dachang over the coming weeks as the flood waters have now receded. However, production for the full year may still undershoot the target of 50,000 tonnes set at the start of 2019. The company will be hoping for a recovery in tin prices and electronics demand in the last few months of the year to offset any lingering impacts from the summer disruptions. But a turnaround on either front appears uncertain at this juncture, pointing to a challenging short term outlook for China's giant tin miner.
