Far East traders eye 1997 for soybean imports as China's domestic crop falls by up to a million tonnes 

Traders in China and across Asia are bracing for increased soybean imports in 1997 following news that China's domestic soybean harvest could be down by up to one million tonnes this year. The shortfall is expected to drive China, already the world's largest soybean importer, to source additional supplies from major exporters like the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.

China's National Grain and Oils Information Centre reported last week that unusually dry weather in key growing regions has stunted the country's soybean crop. The center estimated China's soybean output may fall to between 13 million and 14 million tonnes, down from 15 million tonnes last year. The shortfall could be the largest in over 30 years and see China's self-sufficiency in soybeans drop below 50% for the first time.

The news has sent soybean prices surging on commodity markets in recent days. January soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose almost 5% following the report from Beijing. Prices for Brazilian soybeans, which make up more than half of China's imports, have also risen sharply on expectations of higher Chinese demand.

Traders in China have already started booking more South American and US cargoes for early 1997 shipment in anticipation of greater import volumes. "There are definitely more vessels lined up for the first quarter than usual," said Wang Chen, a soybean trader at COFCO in Tianjin. "If the crop forecasts are right, China will need a lot more beans from overseas." 

Some analysts expect China's soybean imports could jump by 3 to 5 million tonnes next year to make up for the reduced domestic crop. That would potentially push China's total imports above 20 million tonnes for the first time. The increase is also likely to cement China's position as the top destination for US and Brazilian soybean shipments.

However, other observers warn it is too early to determine the full impact of the diminished harvest with accuracy. "A lot will depend on how much is left in storage and how demand shapes up over the next few months," said Li Wu, an independent agribusiness analyst based in Shanghai. "There are many uncertainties still, so we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves on import volumes just yet."
 
Much will also depend on the development of China's domestic soybean crushing industry, which has been expanding rapidly to meet rising animal feed demand and now accounts for some 60-70% of the country's soybean usage. Any slowdown in crushing rates could lessen import requirements despite lower production.

While there are still unknowns, most experts agree China's dependence on imported soybeans will only continue to grow over the long term. "Even with normal weather, China's soybean production cannot keep up with demand," said Li. "Imports are essential and that is not going to change."
