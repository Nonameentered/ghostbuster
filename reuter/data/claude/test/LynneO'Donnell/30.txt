China's aluminium can makers struggle with surging metal prices and slow domestic demand 

China's aluminium can manufacturers are facing significant headwinds this year as high aluminium prices and slowing domestic demand squeeze their profit margins. The companies, which supply beverage giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, are struggling to pass on higher raw material costs to customers.

Aluminium prices have surged more than 35% over the past year on the London Metal Exchange, driven by a recovery in global manufacturing activity and concerns about supply. The rally has pushed up costs for can makers who rely on primary aluminium as their main input. However, canned beverage consumption in China has been lacklustre due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. China's per capita consumption of canned drinks was around 97 cans in 2020, lower than the 2017 peak.  

The mismatch between costs and demand has hit the profitability of companies like ORG Packaging, China's largest beverage can producer. The company's net profit slumped 47% in the first half of 2021 compared with a year earlier. Its profit margins were squeezed to just 2.4% from 4.6% even as revenues rose on higher aluminium prices. ORG and its peers have been unable to fully pass on the higher costs to beverage companies concerned about the impact of price rises on consumer demand. 

Industry experts say most can makers have raised prices for beverage companies by around 5-10% this year but aluminium prices are up at least 20-25% over the same period. The squeeze on margins has led companies to cut costs, increase automation, and diversify into cans for food products and aerosols. However, their bargaining power remains limited given the dominance of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, who are also grappling with weaker consumer demand.

Continued cost pressures and uncertain demand prospects will remain a challenge for China's can manufacturers even as aluminium prices start to stabilise. Stricter environmental regulations are also forcing companies to upgrade facilities, adding to costs. While diversification into other can types and overseas markets can partly offset domestic headwinds, China's can makers are expected to face a multi-year margin recovery amid a subdued consumer outlook. Overall, for an industry that supplies critical packaging to leading beverage brands, the road ahead looks set to remain bumpy.
