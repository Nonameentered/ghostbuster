China's Steel Market Flooded with Cheap Imports Driving Down Prices, Executives Warn of Pessimistic Outlook 

China's steel industry is facing significant headwinds as cheap imports flood the domestic market and drive down prices. At the China Iron and Steel Association's annual conference this week, executives from major steel producers warned of oversupply, weak demand, and a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year.

China produces more than half of the world's steel but demand growth in the country has slowed as its economy has cooled. At the same time, China's trade partners have slapped retaliatory tariffs on Chinese steel exports, limiting overseas markets for Chinese producers. The result has been a glut of steel within China that is now being sold at rock-bottom prices, hurting the profitability of domestic steelmakers.

Wu Jiangxiong, head of Shanghai Baosteel Group, China's second-largest steel producer, said the company's steel mills were running at just 70 percent of capacity due to lack of demand. He warned that steel prices would remain low for the foreseeable future. “The whole industry will face a cold winter in the next few years,” Wu said. 

Private steel producers, lured by fat profit margins during the steel boom years, ramped up production and now account for nearly 50 percent of China's steel output. However, many of these smaller mills produce low-quality steel and have higher costs, so they have been hit the hardest by the price declines. Dozens of private steel companies have already gone bankrupt, and executives say more shutdowns are likely.

“Excess capacity is the number one problem for China's steel sector,” said Luo Tiejun, vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association. He said China's steel capacity stands at 1.2 billion tons, far exceeding the 800 million tons consumed domestically each year. “Supply exceeds demand, and low-end products are flooding the market,” Luo said.

To address oversupply, the government plans to eliminate 150 million tons of steel capacity over the next 3-5 years and introduce policies to curb exports and cheap imports. However, critics argue more aggressive action is needed, including improved technology and environmental standards to push outdated mills out of the market. 

China's struggles with overcapacity extend beyond steel into other heavy industries like cement, aluminum, and chemicals. Tackling excess supply and transitioning China's economy away from heavy industry onto a more sustainable footing is one of the top economic priorities for the government. However, reform has been slow, and cheap imports and depressed prices suggest the problem will persist, at least in the near term. Overall, China's steel executives expressed a gloomy outlook and called on the government to do more to save China's important but troubled steel sector.
