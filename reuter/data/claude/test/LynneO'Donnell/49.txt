China Likely to Avoid Large Copper Purchases Before High Consumption Season, Far East Traders Say 

Copper traders in Asia expect China to avoid major purchases of the industrial metal in the coming weeks ahead of the peak consumption season in the autumn. China, the world's largest copper consumer, typically increases buying from August to meet higher demand from sectors like construction and power infrastructure. However, copper inventories in China are currently at multi-year highs due to weak demand in the first half of the year amid a slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade war.

“The high copper stocks and uncertain demand outlook will likely keep Chinese buyers out of the spot market for now,” said a Shanghai-based copper trader. “They will probably wait until August before making big purchases again.”

Copper stocks monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange are near 500,000 tonnes, the highest since early 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity in China remained weak in June, suggesting lackluster copper demand. The official Purchasing Managers’ Index was flat at 50.6, just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.  

The soft demand in China has weighed on copper prices this year. London Metal Exchange copper has dropped nearly 10% from its 2019 peak in April to around $5,850 a tonne. The price is still higher than the December low of $5,510, but market participants don’t expect a major rebound soon without stronger Chinese buying.

“The downside risks for copper prices remain given high inventories, a weaker yuan and the trade war,” said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong. “A seasonal pickup in China’s manufacturing activity in the third quarter should provide some support but may not be enough for a sustained rally.”  

She expects copper prices to trade in a range of $5,700 to $6,200 over the next few months. A potential escalation in the U.S.-China trade war could push prices to the lower end of that range, Lau added. The tit-for-tat tariff spat between the two economic giants has heightened concerns about global growth and metal demand.

Not all analysts are pessimistic, however. Some traders point out that copper prices at current levels should spur more buying interest in China, especially if the government rolls out further stimulus measures to boost the economy. There is also speculation that China and the U.S. may reach a trade truce at the G20 meeting this month, which could boost business confidence and metal demand.  

“The downside for copper is limited from here,” said a trader in Singapore. “Demand hasn't collapsed and once the trade tensions improve, we expect buying to resume in China." Whether copper traders' more optimistic scenario plays out may become clearer once China's consumption season kicks into higher gear later in the summer. For now, though, the outlook remains subdued.
