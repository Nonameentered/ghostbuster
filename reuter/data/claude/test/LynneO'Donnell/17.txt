Far East Metal Traders Expect Increased Demand for Chinese Base Metals Post-Spring Festival Holiday 

Metal traders across the Far East are anticipating a surge in demand for base metals from China following the week-long Lunar New Year celebrations. The Spring Festival holiday, which began on January 25th, led to factory closures across China and a slowdown in manufacturing activity. However, with workers returning after the break, industrial production is set to ramp up rapidly.

According to industry experts, the holiday period typically results in a drop in metal prices due to lower demand and activity. But prices often rebound quickly once factories reopen and resume operations. "After Chinese New Year, people return to work and start producing and manufacturing again at full speed,” said Jia Zheng, a Shanghai-based copper trader. “We usually see a fast recovery in prices as demand for raw materials returns.”

In particular, prices for metals such as copper, aluminum, nickel, and zinc are expected to increase in the coming weeks. These industrial metals are widely used in construction, automobile manufacturing, electronics, and other sectors in China. Although overall economic growth in China has slowed, the country's manufacturing industry continues to expand at a steady pace, underpinning demand for base metals.

The spring festival holiday is a busy travel season in China, with millions of people visiting family members across the country. Many factories shut down completely or operate with limited staff during this period. Purchasing managers' indexes, which measure manufacturing activity, typically drop substantially in January and February before rebounding in March.  

Some leading producers like Jiangxi Copper and Zijin Mining curtailed production at certain mine sites ahead of the festival. Market analysts said this could further tighten supply for some metals in the short term and support higher prices. “Mine shutdowns over the holiday will mean we have to catch up to meet demand when activity picks up again,” said a spokesman for Zijin Mining, China's largest gold producer.
