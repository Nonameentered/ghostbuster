Author Exposes Truth About Japanese War Atrocities in China With New Exhibition and Book

A new book and photographic exhibition reveals the haunting truth about some of the worst atrocities committed by Japanese forces in China during World War 2. The exhibition, called “The Forgotten Victims: A Record of Japanese Brutality in Wartime China,” opened this week at the National Museum of Modern Chinese History in Beijing. It features over 200 photographs documenting the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-38 and the experimental biological warfare program Unit 731. 

The exhibition is based on the research of author Na Wei, a Chinese historian who spent over 20 years uncovering accounts of victims and locating long-lost records and photos. Her new book, “The Mark of Suffering: A History of Atrocity in the Second Sino-Japanese War,” provides comprehensive evidence and accounts of the immense suffering of Chinese civilians under the Japanese military. Speaking at the exhibition opening, Na Wei said, “The world knows of the Holocaust and the immense tragedy of that period of history. But there is another Holocaust that remains largely hidden and forgotten. It is time to shed light on the atrocities that China suffered and give voice to the millions of victims.”

The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, saw tens of thousands of civilians killed and tens of thousands of women raped over a 6-week period. Na Wei’s research has uncovered new evidence that the death toll was likely much higher than the commonly cited figure of 300,000. The Unit 731 program involved forced human experimentation on Chinese prisoners of war and civilians, including vivisection without anesthesia and the amputation and reattachment of limbs. Na Wei located former members of Unit 731 willing to speak on record about the war crimes they committed.
