Tung Chee-hwa unveils new Confucian-led office with stunning waterfall view as Hong Kong prepares for Chinese rule 

Hong Kong's first post-handover leader Tung Chee-hwa today unveiled his new office, symbolically combining modern architecture with traditional Confucian elements as the city prepares for Chinese rule on July 1.

The $50 million office complex sits atop Victoria Peak with panoramic views of Victoria Harbour. However, its focal point is a man-made 50-foot waterfall flanked by bamboo gardens, inspired by ancient Chinese aesthetics. 

"The flowing waterfall represents the constant renewal of life and the enduring power of moral virtue," said Tung at the opening ceremony attended by Chinese and local officials. "It reminds us of the timeless wisdom of Confucian values such as righteousness, propriety and harmony."

Tung pledged to govern Hong Kong with "benevolence, integrity and righteousness" when he assumes office in less than a month. His new headquarters conveys this vision through emblematic touches like the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism engraved on a wall and a statue of Confucius at the entrance.

The 13-story building's exterior, however, boasts a sleek metallic fa√ßade to signify Hong Kong's status as a modern global hub. Some critics argue the mishmash of styles is inconsistent, but Tung said it reflects "the fusion of Chinese and Western culture" in Hong Kong.

On the top floor, Tung's office provides a panoramic view of the territory he will soon govern. The Kowloon skyline is framed on one side by the jagged spires of the Dragonback Mountain range, named because its ridgeline resembles a dragon's spine.

Tung pledged to work "wholeheartedly for the well-being of our citizens and to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition" to Chinese sovereignty, addressing an audience that included local tycoons and politicians as well as senior Chinese officials.

After 155 years of British rule, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of China with the promise that its capitalist system and way of life will remain unchanged for 50 years under the "one country, two systems" principle.

Tung's office design aims to reassure residents and global investors that Hong Kong's core values will be preserved while highlighting its cultural affinity with the mainland. However, its potent mix of natural and political symbols also serves to underline that there will be no doubt who is ultimately in charge come July 1.
