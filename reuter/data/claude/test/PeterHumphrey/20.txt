China's PLA Plans to Use Hong Kong Presence to Shed Bad Image, Reveals Future Garrison Commander 

The commander of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Hong Kong has revealed plans to use the army's presence in the city to improve its image and counter its reputation as a force mainly used to crack down on dissent. 

In an interview with state media, Major General Chen Daoxiang said the PLA aims to show a "friendly and open image" in Hong Kong. "We will fully display the image of the people's military as a mighty, civilized and peaceful force," Chen said. He took over as commander of the Hong Kong garrison this month.

The PLA maintains a garrison of up to 10,000 troops in Hong Kong. Under the "one country, two systems" arrangement, the PLA is not usually deployed in Hong Kong. But in 2019, the army was criticized for helping the Hong Kong police to crack down on pro-democracy protests.

Chen said the PLA will be "proactively participating" in public events to showcase its military culture and facilitate exchanges with Hong Kong society. "The Hong Kong Garrison will give full play to the role of the contact and liaison team to actively contact all sectors of Hong Kong society, understand and respond to Hong Kong compatriots' concerns about the garrison, and deepen Hong Kong society's understanding of the military," he said.

Analysts say the strategy is an attempt to counter the view that the PLA is a threat to Hong Kong's civil liberties and autonomy. But pro-democracy activists argue that closely cooperating with Hong Kong authorities risks compromising the "one country, two systems" principle.

"No amount of PR stunts can hide the fact that the PLA exists in Hong Kong to protect the authoritarian interests of the Communist Party, not the interests of Hong Kong people," said pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo. 

The PLA's new soft power drive also comes as Beijing tightens its control over Hong Kong, introducing a national security law, overhauling the electoral system, and orchestrating changes to the city's education curriculum to foster greater patriotism among youth. Some analysts worry that the PLA's increased public presence could be a prelude to it playing a more active role in Hong Kong's internal affairs.

Chen dismissed such concerns, saying "the Hong Kong garrison will strictly abide by the Basic Law and fully respect and protect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents." But given Beijing's moves to quash dissent and assert greater control, questions remain over whether the PLA's charm offensive can really overcome concerns about its presence in the city.
