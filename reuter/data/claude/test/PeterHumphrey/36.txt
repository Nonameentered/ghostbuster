Hong Kong Human Rights Group Sceptical of China's Pledge to Subscribe to UN Human Rights Convention 

China has pledged to sign and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), raising hopes for improvement in human rights protection. However, activists in Hong Kong remain sceptical about China's commitment to implementing the covenant.

China announced its plan to sign and ratify the ICCPR last week during its Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council. The covenant protects key civil and political rights like freedom of speech, assembly and political participation. 168 countries including the UK and Australia have ratified the treaty but China has long refused to do so despite signing it in 1998.

"By ratifying the ICCPR, China would formally commit to protecting and promoting all the civil and political rights enshrined in the covenant, including freedom of speech, assembly, and political participation as well as fair trial rights," said Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. However, she added that China's poor human rights record suggests its words may not lead to meaningful changes. 

In Hong Kong, human rights groups are particularly wary about China's pledge. "The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of breaking promises on human rights and refusing to follow international standards," said Lee Cheuk-yan, chairperson of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. 

He pointed out that China has failed to implement key rights and freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong's Basic Law since regaining sovereignty over the city from Britain in 1997. "Freedoms of assembly and expression have been severely curtailed. There is no real universal suffrage. Political dissent and challenges to one-party rule are not tolerated," he said. 

"China's promise to ratify the ICCPR should not be taken at face value given its bleak human rights record," Lee argued. He said China's ratification of the covenant must be accompanied by concrete legal and policy reforms to have any meaning. But the likelihood of China upholding civil and political rights seems low, especially as President Xi Jinping has intensified crackdowns on dissent and civil society.

The scepticism from Hong Kong underscores the wide gulf in fundamental freedoms existing between Hong Kong and mainland China. Activists contend that lack of human rights protection poses an existential threat to Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic aspirations. Until China demonstrates real commitment to human rights reforms, its pledge to ratify the ICCPR may ring hollow.
