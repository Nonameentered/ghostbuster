China Moves Forward with Plan to Roll Back Civil Rights and Democracy in Hong Kong Despite Protests 

The Chinese government is pushing ahead with controversial new laws that critics say will severely roll back civil rights and democracy in Hong Kong, despite widespread protests in the territory.

On Thursday, China's legislature approved a plan to draft new laws banning secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. The move is aimed at quashing the pro-democracy movement that has disrupted the territory for years. But activists and Western governments say it will strip Hong Kong of the civil liberties and political freedoms that set it apart from mainland China.

The decision was made by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which met this week to discuss policy changes as China's annual legislative meetings got underway. The new laws will likely take effect in Hong Kong by the end of the summer, posing the biggest threat to the territory's autonomy since Britain handed control to China in 1997.

Under the "one country, two systems" agreement established then, Beijing promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its own political and economic systems for 50 years. But China has grown increasingly unwilling to tolerate dissent in Hong Kong, a financial hub. The new laws are meant to prevent the territory from becoming what Beijing sees as a hotbed of anti-mainland antagonism.

The move immediately set off protests in Hong Kong, as thousands of people gathered Wednesday evening chanting pro-democracy slogans. The demonstrations grew tense at times, with protesters throwing objects at riot police, starting small fires and chanting slogans such as “Hong Kong independence, the only way out.” Police officers used pepper spray and made more than 300 arrests. 

More protests were planned for the coming days, as activists vowed to continue fighting the legislation. But China appears unlikely to back down, and has the power to push through the new laws despite the opposition.

The proposal for new legislation comes after Hong Kong was paralyzed by anti-government protests for much of last year. The protests started in response to a proposed extradition bill but grew into a broad pro-democracy movement, with demands for direct elections of Hong Kong's leaders and an investigation into police conduct during the unrest. 

The months of protests dealt a blows to Hong Kong's tourism- and trade-dependent economy. Supporters say new laws are necessary to restore stability, but critics argue they will only further stifle dissent and undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.

The Trump administration has warned that China's actions could threaten Hong Kong's standing as a global financial hub. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the US is "watching developments closely and with deep concern" as Beijing moves to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms. Other Western nations have also criticized the plans, saying they violate China's promise to grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047.

China's foreign ministry spokesman urged the international community to "stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs." But with Beijing poised to tighten its grip, the future of Hong Kong's democratic hopes appear increasingly grim. The territory's 7.5 million residents face an uncertain future as China barges in to seize power.
