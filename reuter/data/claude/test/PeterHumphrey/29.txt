Hong Kong's Finance Chief Stresses Fiscal Independence in Final Budget Under British Rule Despite Pressure from China 

Hong Kong’s financial secretary stressed the city’s fiscal independence in his budget speech today, the last one under British rule before the handover to China on July 1. Despite pressure from China to align Hong Kong’s tax rates and economic policies with the mainland’s, the financial secretary insisted “nothing will change” after the handover.

Financial Secretary Donald Tsang presented a balanced HK$235 billion budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, foreseeing a surplus of about HK$500 million. Tsang said the budget “fully reflects Hong Kong people's expectations for continuity, stability and prosperity” after the handover. 

“Some people worry there may be sudden changes to Hong Kong's taxation and public finance system after July 1,” Tsang said in his budget speech. “I wish to reiterate that nothing will change in this regard...The basic policy of simple and low taxation will remain unchanged.”

Tsang’s pledge of fiscal continuity is aimed at calming worries in the business community that Hong Kong's low tax regime and economic freedoms might be compromised after the handover. China has pressed Hong Kong to eliminate some tax breaks and incentives that make the city an attractive offshore business center. But Tsang said any changes would depend on the city’s own needs and not outside interference.

The budget showed Hong Kong remains in robust financial health despite global economic headwinds. Tsang forecast economic growth of 5% this year and medium-term growth of about 4-5% annually. Inflation should remain moderate at about 5%, and the unemployment rate is projected to stay under 3%, indicating a tight labor market with job opportunities aplenty.  

The budget pledged new funds for education, the environment and affordable housing. But Tsang also warned of long-term challenges from an aging population and income inequality. He said the overall fiscal surplus and fiscal reserves remain healthy and will provide a cushion against future shocks.  

Pro-China politicians expressed support for Tsang's emphasis on continuity but pro-democracy lawmakers argued the budget should have done more to address livelihood and welfare concerns. Activists staged a small protest outside the legislative building, demanding more spending on healthcare, education and poverty alleviation.

Tsang’s budget was seen as a balanced and populist effort with targeted measures to appease key interest groups. Business groups in particular welcomed Tsang’s message of continuity and protection of Hong Kong’s competitiveness. But some observers worry sizeable budget surpluses show Tsang remains too prudent, risking underinvestment in human capital and quality of life issues crucial to Hong Kong’s long term development.    With the handover looming, many wonder how long Hong Kong's fiscal independence and stability can endure under Chinese rule with China chomping at the bit for more control.
