Tiananmen Square leader predicts no similar crackdowns, but pressure to conform in China and Hong Kong 

Thirty years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, Wu'er Kaixi, one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests, does not foresee another violent crackdown on dissent like the one that crushed the student-led movement on June 4. However, he believes the Chinese Communist Party has effectively enforced conformity and obedience through more subtle means in mainland China and Hong Kong.

Speaking via video conference from Taiwan where he now lives in exile, Wu'er Kaixi told reporters that Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the Communist Party have “learned the lesson” that a mass protest put down with lethal force would be too damaging internationally. “There will not be another June 4,” he said. “They will not use tanks and machine guns on people ever again.”

Instead, Wu'er Kaixi said the party relies on a pervasive security apparatus, strict censorship, and enforced “patriotic education” to suppress challenges to its rule. In Hong Kong, a city promised certain democratic freedoms when Britain handed it back to China in 1997, Wu'er Kaixi pointed to the disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers, the imprisonment of activists, and the stifling of an independent press and judiciary as evidence the mainland’s authoritarian model is being imposed. 

“What they are doing is making an example out of Hong Kong,” Wu'er Kaixi said. “It is to set an example for the rest of the country that this is what happens if you even have a slight dissent against the Communist Party.” He lamented Hong Kong had gone from a “role model” for democratic reform in China to just another Chinese city under Beijing’s tight control.

Wu'er Kaixi was a 21-year-old student at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University when he emerged as a leader of the Tiananmen protests. After the crackdown, Wu'er Kaixi escaped China and was at the top of the government's wanted list. He has lived in exile in Western countries and Taiwan ever since.

Thirty years on, Wu'er Kaixi said he has come to terms with the fact he may never return home and sees little prospect of political reform in China without a change in leadership. Still, looking at the sacrifices of fellow Tiananmen activists who remain imprisoned in China to this day, Wu'er Kaixi said he continues to advocate for democracy and human rights because "somebody has to do it."
