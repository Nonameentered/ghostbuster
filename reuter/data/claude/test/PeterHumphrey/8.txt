Hong Kong’s Chief Judge Under Pressure to Quit Judiciary after Declaring Candidacy for Territory’s Leader  

The Chief Judge of Hong Kong’s highest court is facing intensifying calls to resign from the judiciary after announcing his intention to run for Chief Executive, the top political leadership role, in next year’s election.

Mr. Justice Kenneth Chan, 64, who has served as Chief Judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 2018, declared on Tuesday that he will be a candidate to replace the current Chief Executive Carrie Lam when her term ends in 2022. His surprise announcement was met with a mix of excitement and condemnation from political analysts and legal experts in Hong Kong.

Supporters argue that Justice Chan, a moderate viewed as sympathetic to democracy, could help heal divisions in the territory and prevent further erosion of civil liberties by Beijing. But critics contend that judges should remain apolitical and that his candidacy compromises the independence and integrity of the judiciary. There are now widespread demands that Justice Chan step down as Chief Judge immediately to avoid undermining public trust in the courts.

Mrs. Lam criticized Justice Chan’s decision in a statement, saying that judges should avoid “engaging in political activities” to uphold principles of judicial independence and neutrality. Pro-Beijing politicians were more strident, accusing Justice Chan of violating his oath of office and calling for his impeachment if he refuses to resign.

Justice Chan has not commented since announcing his plans to seek the leadership role. Under Hong Kong law, he is not required to resign from the bench to run for elected office, but there is an unwritten convention that senior judges avoid political entanglements. Friends and allies say Justice Chan has become increasingly worried over the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong but felt compelled to act as fears grow that Beijing will further tighten control.
