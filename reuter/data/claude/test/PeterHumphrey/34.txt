Chinese Officials Signal Positive Future Handling of Hong Kong, VIP Guest List Agreed with UK for Handover Party  

High-ranking Chinese government officials today struck an optimistic tone regarding Beijing's future governance of Hong Kong after its handover from the British on July 1st. In a press conference, China's Foreign Minister signaled that China intends to honor the "one country, two systems" principle that has governed Hong Kong's special status. 

"Hong Kong has flourished as a free port and global financial hub under the wise governance of China for the past century and a half," the Foreign Minister said. "China fully intends to uphold the policies that have made Hong Kong prosperous and that were guaranteed as part of our agreement with the United Kingdom."

The Foreign Minister's comments come just weeks before the British hand over sovereignty of Hong Kong after 150 years of colonial rule. China and the UK have been negotiating details of the handover for the past two years, including the all-important "Joint Declaration" that will guide Hong Kong's governance and protect certain civil liberties and economic freedoms of its residents.

"We look forward to attending the handover celebrations in Hong Kong on July 1st," the Foreign Minister continued. "A list of VIP guests has been agreed upon by both China and the UK, including dignitaries and officials who have helped shepherd this historic transition." Sources indicate the VIP list includes former UK Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who initialed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as well as pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong who pushed for guarantees of free speech and political opposition under Chinese rule.

The handover of Hong Kong marks the end of an era and the start of an uncertain future. While China's leadership has formally promised to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties, some Hong Kong residents remain skeptical. "We cannot know what the next 50 years will bring under Chinese control," said Lee Cheuk-Yan, a pro-democracy leader in Hong Kong. "But we will continue to advocate for the democratic values and freedoms that have defined Hong Kong's character for decades. We hope China lives up to its word, but we must be watchful."

With the eyes of the international community fixed on Hong Kong this July 1st, China has strong incentives to handle the handover and its immediate aftermath judiciously and avoid heavy-handed actions that would threaten Hong Kong's democratic institutions. But Beijing's longer-term intentions remain unclear and worrisome to pro-democracy leaders. The grand ceremonies around the handover may capture one historic moment, but the real test of "one country, two systems" has only just begun.
