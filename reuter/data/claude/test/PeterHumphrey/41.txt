Hong Kong's Democratic Party welcomes pledge to preserve basic freedoms after handover, but activists disrupt public consultation on proposed curbs  

Hong Kong’s Democratic Party today welcomed Beijing’s pledge to preserve the city’s basic freedoms after its handover from Britain to China on July 1, but pro-democracy activists disrupted the start of a public consultation on proposed legislation that critics say will curb civil liberties.

Chinese and Hong Kong officials have promised that the handover will not end the freedoms and rule of law that the city has enjoyed. But a new bill proposed by the Hong Kong government would ban “seditious” speech and allow security forces to intercept communications. The public consultation on the bill began today amid protests.

Leaders of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, the largest pro-democracy group, met with senior Chinese officials in Beijing yesterday. The officials promised to uphold the “one country, two systems” principle that guarantees Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and basic rights like free speech. The party’s leader said they are cautiously optimistic based on the pledges. “If implemented faithfully, ‘one country, two systems’ can succeed,” he told reporters.

However, other activists are skeptical of Beijing’s promises and argue that the proposed legislation threatens Hong Kongers’ freedoms. A group of pro-democracy leaders staged a protest at the launch of the public consultation on the bill today, chanting slogans and holding signs criticizing the legislation. The protest disrupted presentations by government officials and led to tense confrontations.

The new bill would make it a crime to engage in “seditious” or “subversive” speech against Beijing or the Hong Kong government. It would also allow security agencies to intercept communications and conduct covert surveillance without court approval in a wide range of circumstances. Critics argue this undermines the city’s rule of law and autonomy.

But Hong Kong's security chief argued that the city needs the legislation to prevent threats from groups seeking independence or political violence. He said the bill contains sufficient oversight mechanisms and insisted civil liberties will not be impacted for most Hong Kongers. "Only those threatening our security and sovereignty need worry," he said.

The public now has 60 days to submit opinions on the bill. But pro-democracy lawmakers say that is not enough time and called for more extensive consultations. They also threatened legal challenges against what they call "draconian law that reeks of the fascist regimes of old." The controversy is the latest test of nerves in Hong Kong as the handover approaches and fears spread over Beijing's influence in the city after the transition.
