UK and US warn China to respect liberty pledge in Hong Kong handover 

The UK and US have warned China to uphold civil liberties in Hong Kong as the former British colony marks 25 years since its handover to Beijing. In a rare diplomatic rebuke, officials criticized China for tightening control over Hong Kong and eroding the freedoms guaranteed when it was returned to China in 1997.

In a statement, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK expected China to honor its obligations to protect the rights and freedoms enshrined in the joint declaration that paved the way for the handover. "The preservation of Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' framework are fundamental to its future success," said Raab.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the world was watching to see if Beijing would allow Hong Kong to continue to stand as a "bastion of freedom." Blinken condemned China's actions to undermine protected rights and democratic processes as breaking international commitments. The coordinated statements show the US and UK presenting a united front against what they see as Beijing's abuse of power over Hong Kong.

The warnings come ahead of the July 1 anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China. In recent years, Beijing has clamped down on civil society in Hong Kong, barred pro-democracy candidates from standing for office and imposed a wide-ranging national security law. Activists have accused China of reneging on its pledge to maintain Hong Kong's liberal traditions for 50 years after the handover.

China hit back, accusing the Western allies of "gross interference" in its domestic affairs. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London said Hong Kong was China's internal affair and foreign countries should respect China's sovereignty. However, others argue China made legally-binding promises in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and should be held to account. With tensions rising, the future of Hong Kong's cherished freedoms looks increasingly uncertain after 25 years under Chinese rule.
