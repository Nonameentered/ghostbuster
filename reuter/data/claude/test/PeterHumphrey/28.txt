Hong Kong Finance Minister Donald Tsang to unveil annual budget under China's watchful eye

By Your Assistant 

Hong Kong's Finance Minister Donald Tsang will unveil the city's annual budget this week under close scrutiny from Beijing. Tsang is expected to announce modest spending increases and tax cuts to provide relief to Hong Kong's citizens still recovering from the economic impact of anti-government protests and the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Tsang's proposals will require approval from China's central government to ensure they align with Beijing's political and economic priorities for the territory.

Tsang forecast a budget deficit for the 2021-2022 fiscal year of at least HK$139 billion (US$18 billion), marking the second year of deficits due to increased government spending on economic relief measures and public health interventions. While Hong Kong's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 7.2% last quarter, unemployment remains high at 6.6% and economic activity is still well below pre-pandemic levels. Many citizens continue to struggle with job losses, reduced work hours and business closures.

The budget is expected to include targeted tax rebates and consumption vouchers worth HK$5,000 for each resident to boost local spending. Government sources say Tsang will also propose increased funding for public hospitals, Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, and additional economic relief for hard-hit sectors like tourism and retail. However, any budget measures will require sign-off from Beijing officials to ensure they do not conflict with China's political priorities following the 2019 protests. 

China's government has tightened its grip over Hong Kong through a new national security law and electoral reforms aimed at reducing opposition voices in the city's governance. Chinese officials are likely to vet Tsang's budget for any proposals that could be seen as undermining Beijing's authority or reinforcing "pro-democracy" sentiments. Tsang must strike a delicate balance between providing economic relief and maintaining China's control.

The budget will be closely watched as an indication of how Beijing may influence Hong Kong's government finances in the coming years. While China still depends on Hong Kong as a global financial hub, greater involvement in the city's budget process could further erode Hong Kong's political and economic autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle that governs its relationship with the mainland. Tsang's budget may end up saying as much about China's long-term vision for Hong Kong as about the city's economic outlook for the next fiscal year.
