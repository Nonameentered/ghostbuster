China Plans to Roll Back Political Freedoms in Hong Kong Despite Opposition   

The Chinese government announced plans this week to impose new security laws in Hong Kong that critics say will curtail political freedoms and undermine the semi-autonomous territory's democratic values. 

The proposed laws would ban secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference in Hong Kong. Chinese officials argue the laws are necessary to bring stability and order back to the city after months of sometimes violent anti-government protests. However, pro-democracy activists and Western nations fear the laws will be used to crack down on dissent and political opposition.

The announcement signals a major shift in China's policy toward Hong Kong and reneges on promises to grant the city a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after Britain handed control to China in 1997. Under the "one country, two systems" framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed civil liberties like freedom of speech and press freedom that are absent in mainland China. The proposed security laws raise concerns those freedoms could now be limited.

"Beijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers’ critical voices with force and fear," said Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China. Critics argue China is exploiting the cover of the coronavirus pandemic to push through laws it has long wanted.

The move sets up another showdown over democratic values in the Asian financial hub. Protesters took to the streets in opposition, despite social distancing restrictions, while China made clear it would tolerate no dissent. “We will act without hesitation when our country's sovereignty, security and development interests are at stake,” said Zhang Xiaoming, China’s top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs. 

How China intends to enact the laws remains unclear but it could sidestep Hong Kong's own legislative process. The proposal is set to be discussed at China's National People's Congress meeting this week and imposed by decree, circumventing Hong Kong's democratically elected lawmakers. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive, said her administration would “fully cooperate” in enacting the proposed legislation.

The laws follow nearly a year of anti-government protests in Hong Kong that often descended into violence. Chinese officials claim “radical separatists” stoked unrest and the security laws will curtail their influence. However, the proposed legislation risks further inflaming tensions by provoking more protests and international condemnation.

The White House has strongly criticized the proposed laws, saying they would undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic values. Other Western nations are also voicing concern in a development poised to intensify already strained relations with Beijing. For Hong Kong, the announcement represents the biggest threat to its democratic way of life since the handover in 1997. More uncertain and tumultuous times appear ahead for the city at the crossroads of democratic ideals and authoritarian China's tightening grip.
