Hong Kong's Democracy Movement Likens Beijing's Plans to Curb Civil Liberties to China's Cultural Revolution 

The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong issued a strong condemnation today of Beijing’s plans to pass a new national security law limiting civil liberties in the territory. Leaders of the movement said the new law aims to crush political dissent and free speech in Hong Kong, much like Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution did in mainland China decades ago.

The national security law was proposed during the annual meeting of China’s National People’s Congress in Beijing this week. The law would ban secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. However, critics argue those broad categories could be used to target pro-democracy activists and erode Hong Kong’s political freedoms that are guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” arrangement in place since the 1997 handover from British rule.

“Beijing is launching a new Cultural Revolution in Hong Kong, but this time not with Red Guards but with a national security law that will allow the authorities to lock up anyone who peacefully disagrees with them,” said Bonnie Leung, a leader of Hong Kong’s Civil Human Rights Front. Leung said the law aims to "terrorize Hong Kongers for fear of the loss of freedom of speech and rule of law.”

The original Cultural Revolution in China from 1966 to 1976 was Mao Zedong’s attempt to reimpose his authority over the Communist Party. Mao used students and workers to target political rivals and intellectuals in a decade of violence and chaos that caused tremendous damage to Chinese society. Critics argue the excesses of the Cultural Revolution are being revived in Beijing’s efforts to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong today.

The Hong Kong government sought to reassure citizens that the new national security law would not undermine the city’s civil liberties. “The legislation will target very few people and will have no impact on the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents,” said a government spokesperson. However, given Beijing’s history of abusing vague national security laws to crush dissent, activists remain deeply concerned the law will be used to severely curtail freedoms in Hong Kong. The unanimous passage of the proposal in Beijing makes it all but certain the national security law will soon become reality in Hong Kong despite any local opposition.

The pro-democracy movement promised to continue their fight against what they see as the increasing erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. But with Beijing continuing to tighten its grip, the future of Hong Kong’s democracy hangs in the balance with an uncertain future ahead.
