Britain and US issue stern warnings to China over proposed scrapping of civil liberties in Hong Kong 

The British and US governments have issued forceful warnings to China over proposed new national security laws that critics say will severely curtail civil liberties in Hong Kong. The laws are aimed at banning secession, subversion and foreign interference in Hong Kong but pro-democracy activists fear they will be used to crack down on dissent.

In a statement, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the proposed laws are "in direct conflict" with China's previous commitments to Britain over Hong Kong's freedoms. He said they risk "undermining the principle of 'one country, two systems' under which Hong Kong has thrived." Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under an agreement meant to guarantee certain freedoms for the city over the next 50 years.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US is "gravely concerned" the new laws would undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. "Any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong would be highly destabilizing, and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community," Pompeo said.

The warnings came as Beijing unveiled details of the planned laws that will go before China's parliament, the National People's Congress, starting Friday. The laws would ban treason, secession, sedition and foreign interference in Hong Kong. But critics argue they are so broad and loosely defined that they could be used to prosecute a wide range of political opposition and dissent. 

Several prominent pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong warned the laws could spell the end of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. Activist Joshua Wong said: "Beijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers' critical voices with force and fear." Media tycoon Jimmy Lai said the laws were a "death knell" for Hong Kong. "Beijing is trying to rule Hong Kong with fear of force," he added.

Pro-Beijing lawmakers and politicians in Hong Kong welcomed the legislation and said the laws are necessary to safeguard national security. Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said: "There are so many acts of violence and foreign interference ... so at this moment this sort of legislation is necessary."

The issue looks set to escalate diplomatic tensions between Western nations and Beijing as all eyes now turn to how exactly the laws are formulated and how they will reshape Hong Kong's political and legal landscape. The next few days will prove critical.
