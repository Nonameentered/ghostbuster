Hong Kong mourns the death of Deng Xiaoping, but grief pales in comparison to that for Mao Zedong

HONG KONG — Crowds gathered in central Hong Kong today to memorialize the death of Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader of China who died on February 19 at the age of 92. While Deng led China out of its Maoist era and spearheaded economic reforms that opened the country to the world, public mourning in Hong Kong has been more muted compared to the outpouring of grief seen when Mao Zedong died in 1976. 

Outside government headquarters in Hong Kong, some citizens laid flowers and bowed in respect for Deng. But the crowds were modest, numbering only in the hundreds. “Deng made life better for many Chinese by reforming the economy, but he was still part of an authoritarian system,” said James Wong, a businessman in Hong Kong. “I respect him for improving China, but he was no democrat.”

Deng took control of China's leadership in 1978 after the death of Mao Zedong, the communist revolutionary who had ruled China for nearly 30 years. Deng began dismantling Mao's socialist policies and instituted capitalist market reforms that lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty and transformed China into an economic powerhouse. However, Deng also ordered violent crackdowns on pro-democracy protests, including the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square.

In contrast, nearly 2 million people flooded the streets of Hong Kong when Mao died in 1976, sobbing openly and demonstrating a mass outpouring of genuine grief. Mao remains a polarizing figure, but for those in Hong Kong old enough to remember, Mao was a symbolic figure who represented China's rise on the global stage after years of hardship. 

"When Mao died, it really felt like we lost a father figure,” said Wong Chu, an elderly Hong Kong native. "He was a hero to us who made China strong again. Deng made life better, but he did not inspire in the same way.”

The more subdued reaction to Deng's death reflects the complex legacy he has left in Hong Kong. While China has prospered economically under policies he implemented, Deng also oversaw Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" framework which promised the city a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. 

"I worry China will tighten control before 2047,” said David Chan, a pro-democracy activist, referring to the year when Hong Kong's separate system of governance is slated to end. "Deng set the path for China to become globally influential, but he also made it clear that Beijing is in charge.”
 
For the people of Hong Kong, Deng's death and complicated legacy underscores the city’s uncertain future as it navigates its relationship with an increasingly powerful but authoritarian China. While Deng will be remembered as one of China's most significant leaders, in Hong Kong grief over his death is mixed with no small amount of apprehension and unease over the road ahead.
