Hong Kong democracy advocate urges new leader to match words with deeds on civil liberties plan

A leading Hong Kong democracy advocate has urged the city's new leader John Lee to follow through on pledges to uphold civil liberties and political freedoms. Lee, a former security chief, was selected as chief executive last week by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing figures.

In his first public comments since the selection, activist and founder of the Civic Party Audrey Eu warned Lee against curtailing civil liberties. "There have been a lot of nice words from Mr. Lee about upholding Hong Kong's core values of freedom of speech and political expression," Eu said. "But we have heard these words before. What really matters are deeds, not words."  

Eu said Lee's track record as the city's security chief for five years suggested he favored tighter control over political dissent and opposition. "When in office, Lee consistently advocated in favor of national security legislation that threatened freedom of expression and imposed undue restrictions on political activity," Eu said. She cited his support for legislation prohibiting insult of the Chinese national anthem as an example of unwarranted restrictions on speech.

A spokesperson for Lee rejected the criticisms, saying the new leader was committed to protecting rights and freedoms enshrined in Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, as well as the city's mini-constitution. "The principle of 'one country, two systems' stipulates that Hong Kong people shall rule Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy," the spokesperson said. "The SAR government will continue to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Hong Kong people."

Eu said pro-democracy figures would be closely monitoring Lee's actions in the coming months. "If we see policies or bills introduced that further erode civil liberties or step up restrictions on political activity and speech, that will confirm our worst fears,‚Äù she said. Lee is due to take office on July 1, replacing the city's current leader Carrie Lam. 

Lam's tenure was marked by massive pro-democracy protests in 2019 and the imposition of a sweeping national security law by Beijing last year. The law banned subversion, secession and collusion with foreign forces, and Hong Kong authorities have since used it to crack down on dissent and opposition.

Lee's selection has raised fears that Hong Kong's limited democratic freedoms are under further threat. All candidates in the leadership race were vetted for their patriotism and loyalty to Beijing. Lee will be the sole candidate confirmed for the role when a committee votes next month. The 1,500-member committee includes banks, business leaders and trade groups but few pro-democracy figures.
