U.S. signs air services agreement with Hong Kong, but voices concern over rising landing fees  

The United States and Hong Kong signed an updated air services agreement this week to continue allowing flights between the two regions. However, U.S. officials expressed concern over rising landing fees and charges at Hong Kong International Airport, one of the busiest aviation hubs in the world.

The new agreement will allow airlines from both sides to add flights and destinations to better serve travelers, according to a joint statement from the U.S. Department of Transportation and Hong Kong's Transport and  Housing Bureau. “This new bilateral agreement strengthens the economic and cultural ties between the United States and Hong Kong by expanding opportunities for travel and trade," U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said.

While the agreement maintains the "open skies" relationship and expands opportunities for passenger and cargo air services, the U.S. government noted its concerns over the rising costs of operating flights at Hong Kong's airport. Landing fees and other charges at Hong Kong International Airport have increased 400% over the last decade, putting pressure on airlines, according to a letter from Chao to Hong Kong's Transport Secretary. 

The higher costs "are not economically justified and threaten the viability of air services between our two economies," Chao wrote. U.S. airlines and cargo carriers like United, Delta, and FedEx have long complained about the increasing charges by the airport operator, saying they are much higher than airports in other leading Asian hubs like Singapore, Tokyo, and Shanghai.

In response, Hong Kong's government said it has ensured airport charges remain competitive and noted that charges make up a small fraction of airlines’ total operating costs. However, Hong Kong International Airport is pursuing a $13 billion expansion plan to increase its capacity, and airlines worry charges will rise further to pay for the costly project.
