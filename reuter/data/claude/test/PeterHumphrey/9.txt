Governor Patten urges China to allow journalists to write without fear ahead of Hong Kong handover  

Hong Kong’s last British governor Chris Patten urged China today to allow journalists in Hong Kong to continue to write freely after the handover of the territory on July 1st. In a speech delivered to the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong, Patten said press freedom is crucial to Hong Kong’s way of life and future prosperity.

“A free press is not some bourgeois luxury to be cast aside whenever inconvenient. It is the very lifeblood of an open society,” Patten said. “If Hong Kong is to be a success after the handover, if prosperity and stability are to be maintained, there must be no erosion of liberty and that must include freedom of the press.”

His remarks come at a time of uncertainty surrounding the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong after Britain hands over control of the colony to China after more than 150 years of rule. China has guaranteed Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” for 50 years after the handover under the “one country, two systems” policy agreed with Britain. But pro-democracy activists and the media fear creeping interference from Beijing that could undermine Hong Kong's liberal traditions.  

In his speech, Patten recalled speeches by former Chinese leaders like Deng Xiaoping guaranteeing press freedom in Hong Kong. But he said recent events have fueled anxieties that "the rug is being pulled from under Hong Kong's freedoms." He cited the case of outspoken Hong Kong publisher and bookseller Lee Bo, who disappeared at the end of last year and surfaced in mainland China. Lee's colleagues suspect he was abducted by Chinese agents for publishing books critical of Chinese leaders.

"The unsolved mystery surrounding Lee Bo and his Mighty Current publishing house has been deeply alarming,” Patten said. He urged China to respect the separation of powers between Hong Kong and mainland government, as well as the freedom of the press, after the handover. "A free press, like an independent judiciary, is a check on government, not an officious meddler in its activities,” Patten said. “At a time of transition, the need for checks and balances on power are especially strong.”
