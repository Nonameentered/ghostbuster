Chinese Military to Send Advance Party to Hong Kong Before Sovereignty Transfer

The Chinese military will send an advance party to Hong Kong in the coming weeks to prepare for the transfer of sovereignty on July 1, military officials said today. The advance team will finalize logistical details for the move of Chinese troops into Hong Kong to replace the British military forces that have been stationed in the colony since 1841.

The move demonstrates China's eagerness to assert control over the city after 156 years of British rule. However, China has agreed to keep its military presence in Hong Kong to a minimum under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. According to the agreement, China will station no more than 6000 troops in the city after the handover, and they will have no power of enforcement. The British military currently has about 4000 personnel stationed in Hong Kong.

"The advance party will make preparations for the move-in of the Chinese military," said Qin Gang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry. "They will coordinate the handover of facilities and make sure everything is ready. But Chinese troops will not officially take over control from the British until after midnight on June 30." Britain is scheduled to formally return Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30, ending its colonial rule of the city.

The presence of Chinese troops in Hong Kong has been a controversial issue. Many Hong Kong residents fear that it could undermine their political and economic freedoms. As part of the handover deal, China agreed to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system and way of life unchanged for 50 years under a policy known as "one country, two systems." However, some critics argue that military control could compromise Hong Kong's autonomy.
