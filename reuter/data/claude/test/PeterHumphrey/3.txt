China Axes Hong Kong's Democratic and Human Rights Safeguards Ahead of Reversion to Chinese Rule

In a swift and secretive final act, China's parliament passed a new security law for Hong Kong late Thursday consolidating Beijing's control over the former British colony just hours before it returns to Chinese rule. The law, passed unanimously by China's rubber-stamp legislature, introduces new crimes against state security with penalties of up to life in prison. It signals the start of sweeping changes to Hong Kong's liberal way of life ahead of the handover from Britain to China as promised under a "one country, two systems" agreement.

The law was drafted and passed behind closed doors, without any public consultation in Hong Kong. Critics say it severely curtails civil liberties and judicial independence in Hong Kong. Legal experts warn the vague provisions give the authorities wide-ranging power to crack down on dissent and criticism of China's Communist government. The new crimes include splitting the country, subverting state power, terrorism, and "collusion with foreign countries or external elements to endanger national security." The law takes direct aim at the pro-democracy movement that led mass protests last year against a now-withdrawn extradition bill. 

Hong Kong officials said they had no choice but to accept the law. The Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a statement the law will “only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law or endangered national security.” But pro-democracy activists argue it marks the end of Hong Kong's unique status that was meant to be protected for 50 years after Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997. "Make no mistake, this is the end of Hong Kong" activist Joshua Wong posted on social media. "The promises of autonomy and freedoms we were given are now officially erased."

The new security law is set to take effect at 11 p.m. Wednesday, as Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty after 156 years of British rule. In a last act of defiance, activists plan to protest the law on Wednesday despite warnings from authorities banning the rally citing coronavirus social distancing measures.  The sweeping and rushed changes to Hong Kong's freedoms have prompted warnings from Western nations and shows China's determination to bring the city under its authoritarian control despite international condemnation. The sudden move has dashed hopes that China would moderate its stance on Hong Kong after a year of protests as critics warn Beijing's crackdown is only just beginning.
