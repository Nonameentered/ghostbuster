American Businessman Plans to Revolutionize Hospitality Sector with Serviced Apartments for US Pioneers in China Market

Shanghai, China - John Smith, a real estate entrepreneur from New York, announced plans to launch a serviced apartment company targeting American businesspeople expanding into China. The company, called USChina Suites, will provide fully-furnished apartments with hotel-like services for American expatriates living in Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen. 

“There are over 600 US companies operating in China, and many newcomers struggle with challenges like language barriers, visa issues, and finding suitable housing,” said Smith. “USChina Suites will make the transition much easier with apartments stocked and staffed like an extended-stay hotel, but with more living space and independence than a traditional hotel.”

Serviced apartments, which offer amenities like housekeeping, laundry, and concierge assistance, have become popular for long-term business travel and foreign assignments. USChina Suites aims to tailor its offerings specifically to American executives and their families with English-speaking staff, US-sourced furnishings and grocery items, and programs to connect guests with expatriate communities. 

“The serviced apartment model is a major travel trend, but existing options in China don’t always meet the needs of Western guests. USChina Suites will provide an unparalleled level of comfort, convenience and customer service for American business leaders seeking a true ‘home away from home’ during their time in China,” said Smith. 

While trade tensions have escalated between the US and China, business ties remain strong. According to Rhodium Group, a research firm, US foreign direct investment in China grew 6% to $8.6 billion in 2018, and US-based companies invested more in China than Chinese companies invested in the US. The growth reflects opportunities in China's huge market despite geopolitical uncertainty.

USChina Suites has planned an initial launch of 200 apartments across three cities, with potential to scale up to 1,000 apartments over the next five years if there is sufficient demand. The company is currently raising $50 million in venture capital to fund the first phase of growth. Smith believes USChina Suites can achieve $100 million in annual revenue within three years, capitalizing on the fast-growing serviced apartment industry in China and the lack of tailored options for American business travelers.

“While the US and China do have a complex relationship, trade and investment between the two nations remains substantial and mutually beneficial,” said Smith. “USChina Suites will make it easier for a new generation of US pioneers to thrive in China.” The company’s first apartments are slated to open in Shanghai by mid-2020.
