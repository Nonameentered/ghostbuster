Hong Kong's Democratic Party Launches Mission to the West to Brief on China Takeover 

The Democratic Party of Hong Kong has embarked on a multi-country tour of Western nations this week to brief lawmakers and government officials on what they say are alarming moves by China to exert more control over the semi-autonomous territory. A delegation of party leaders is visiting officials in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canada to warn them that China is "aggressively dismantling" Hong Kong's democratic institutions and freedoms.

The tour comes amid growing concerns that China's central government in Beijing is tightening its grip on Hong Kong and chipping away at the "one country, two systems" principle that has governed Hong Kong since the 1997 handover from Britain. "We are witnessing a rapid decline in freedom of speech, freedom of press, and rule of law in Hong Kong," said Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the Democratic Party, in an interview. "The city is quickly losing the autonomy and democratic values that make it unique. The international community has a stake in Hong Kong's future and we are here to sound the alarm."

The trip includes meetings with members of the U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C., Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in London, and European Commission officials in Brussels. They will point to the recent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, the postponement of legislative council elections, the imposition of a repressive national security law, and the disqualification of pro-democracy candidates from running for office as signs that "one country, two systems" is being dismantled. The party is urging Western governments to impose sanctions or restrictions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials believed to be responsible for eroding freedoms in the city.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned the Democratic Party's mission as "gross interference" in China's internal affairs. Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters that Hong Kong's affairs were a matter of Chinese sovereignty and "no external forces can stop China's determination and will to safeguard national security and interests." However, Wu argued that the political crisis in Hong Kong had ramifications beyond China's borders and deserved international scrutiny.  "Hong Kong has been a gateway to China for the rest of the world," he said. "If Hong Kong's unique status disappears, it bodes ill for cross-cultural exchange and trade relationships with China."

With only a few months left in the term of Hong Kong's current Beijing-backed chief executive Carrie Lam, the Democratic Party tour sought to deliver a message to key international partners about the need to defend democratic values before the next leadership election. "There is still a window of opportunity here to change course and allow Hong Kong to continue to function as a liberal enclave in Asia," Wu said. "But that window is quickly closing."
