China's Overture to Hong Kong's Democratic Party Could Result in Split, Analysts Warn  

Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement faced new challenges this week as Beijing reached out to moderate factions within the Democratic Party in what analysts say is an attempt to sow divisions. Multiple members of the Democratic Party's leadership confirmed they were approached by intermediaries linked to the Chinese government who suggested closer cooperation and coordination.

The overtures come as Beijing ramps up efforts to exert more control over Hong Kong and crack down on dissent. A national security law imposed by Beijing last year has been used to arrest dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians. But Beijing's hardline approach also risks further alienating Hong Kongers and fueling unrest. The outreach to the Democratic Party appears aimed at peeling away more moderate pro-democracy figures in hopes of weakening the movement.

"Beijing is trying to divide and conquer the pro-democracy camp by courting certain elements they see as more amenable to cooperation," said Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party chairwoman. The Democratic Party has been Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy political party for decades but has faced criticism that its moderate stance has failed to counter Beijing's overreach. "Some people will be tempted by Beijing's offer to have a seat at the table, but those who truly believe in democracy will not be taken in so easily,‚Äù Lau said.

The Democratic Party's leadership rejected Beijing's overtures for now but the episode has revealed divisions within the party, analysts said. Younger activists within the organization tend to take a more confrontational stance against Beijing while older politicians are more inclined to favor dialogue. "The diverging approaches to dealing with Beijing could prove an existential challenge for the Democratic Party," said Alvin Yeung, leader of Hong Kong's Civic Party. "It will be a test of the party leadership to keep its members united behind the pro-democracy goals they have always stood for."

Party leaders downplayed suggestions of a split, emphasizing that they rejected Beijing's outreach. "The Democratic Party's position has not changed. We remain opposed to the authoritarian policies of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments," said Lo Kin-hei, chairman of the Democratic Party. But analysts warned the episode foreshadows more concerted efforts by Beijing to influence Hong Kong's political landscape by deepening divisions within the pro-democracy movement. "Beijing is playing the long game," said Brian Leung, a professor at the University of Hong Kong. "Their goal is to slowly weaken political opposition until it reaches a point where it is no longer a threat. Overtures to the moderates today could pave the way for more aggressive moves tomorrow."
