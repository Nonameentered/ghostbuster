Hong Kong's Chief Judge Under Pressure to Resign After Declaring Bid for Territory's Leadership 

The Chief Judge of Hong Kong's highest court is facing calls to resign after announcing his intention to run in the upcoming election for Chief Executive, the top leadership post in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

Chan Tai-ming, who has served as Chief Justice of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal since 2015, declared over the weekend that he will stand as a candidate in the 2023 election to become Chief Executive. The announcement has sparked an immediate backlash from politicians and legal experts who argue that the roles of Chief Judge and Chief Executive are incompatible.

Opposition politicians in Hong Kong's Legislative Council have submitted a motion calling on Chan to resign from his position as Chief Justice, arguing that his candidacy jeopardizes the independence and political neutrality of the judiciary. Chan's bid also appears to violate guidelines issued by Hong Kong's Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission, which state that judges should avoid political involvement and activities that may compromise their impartiality.

Chan has defended his decision, arguing that there are no laws prohibiting a judge from running for public office. In a statement, Chan said that if elected Chief Executive he would resign as Chief Justice to avoid any conflict of interest. However, critics argue that by declaring his candidacy and campaigning for the role, Chan has already compromised his position and the integrity of the judiciary. 

The controversy adds to concerns that Beijing is tightening its grip over Hong Kong and eroding the independence of the territory's institutions and freedoms. Since the anti-government protests of 2019, China has imposed a controversial new security law and undertaken electoral reforms that give Beijing more direct control over Hong Kong's political system.

Chan's candidacy is also a breach of convention, as senior judges have not previously run for such a prominently political role. Former Chief Justice Andrew Li said that judges "should not enter into the political arena" and warned that Chan's move could damage Hong Kong's reputation as a center for the rule of law. The Hong Kong Bar Association similarly argued that the offices of Chief Justice and Chief Executive have such different functions and responsibilities that one person should not take on both roles.

However, Chan's supporters argue that his legal background and experience make him a strong candidate for the position. As Chief Justice, Chan has overseen several important cases, including challenges to the government's coronavirus restrictions and protest-related prosecutions. If elected, Chan has pledged to uphold Hong Kong's common law system and protect the city's autonomy. The election for Chief Executive will be held in March 2023, with the winner taking office on July 1.
