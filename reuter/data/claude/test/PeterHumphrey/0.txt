Hong Kong's Catholic community treads cautiously ahead of Chinese rule, says Vatican 

The Catholic Church in Hong Kong is approaching the future handover of power from Britain to China with caution, according to Vatican officials. Hong Kong is set to return to Chinese control on July 1, 1997, ending more than 150 years of British rule. The Vatican lost control of mainland China to the Communist Party in 1951 and the Chinese government established its own Catholic organization independent of the Vatican.  

The Vatican remains concerned about China's record on religious freedom and human rights. Chinese authorities require churches and their priests to register with the government-sanctioned Catholic body, which refuses to recognize the Vatican's authority. Those who refuse to comply face penalties including imprisonment or house arrest. The Vatican wants to maintain influence over Hong Kong's Catholic Church after the handover and avoid a repeat of the mainland situation.

Bishop Joseph Zen, an outspoken advocate for democracy and religious freedom in Hong Kong, shares the Vatican's concerns. "After 1997, many things may change," said Zen. "We don't have confidence that the Chinese government will respect our religious freedom." Hong Kong's special status allows civil liberties like freedom of speech and religion that are not enjoyed in mainland China. But some worry this autonomy could erode under Chinese rule.

The Vatican has urged the Chinese government to guarantee religious freedom and allow priests to swear allegiance to the Pope after the handover. But China rejected the requests, saying Hong Kong's affairs will be handled under the "one country, two systems" policy laid out in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. 

Still, the Vatican remains open to improving ties with Beijing and sees Hong Kong as a chance to build goodwill. Pope John Paul II has made diplomatic overtures to China, though formal relations were cut in 1951. The Vatican's foreign minister recently visited Hong Kong and China, raising hopes of a warming in relations. There are also calls for the Pope to visit Hong Kong after 1997 to show solidarity with the Catholic community.

With only months until the handover, Hong Kong's Catholics remain staunch yet anxious. At a festival last week, worshippers prayed for religious freedom but also a smooth transition to Chinese rule. While Vatican officials express uncertainty about Hong Kong's future as a Catholic hub, the city's faithful remain devoted as ever â€“ even if China's shadow looms large. The next few years will prove pivotal in shaping Hong Kong's Catholic landscape for generations to come.
