Human Rights Watchdog Warns of China's Increasing Ability to Crush Dissent in Hong Kong 

The international human rights group Human Rights Watch warned in a report released today that the Chinese government is gaining sweeping powers to crack down on dissent and opposition groups in Hong Kong. The report comes just weeks before the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China, highlighting China's tightening grip over the territory and its erosion of the civil and political liberties Hong Kong was guaranteed for 50 years under the “one country, two systems” framework.

The report details how in recent years China's government has purged pro-democracy lawmakers, barred activists from standing in local elections, and overhauled Hong Kong's education system to instil greater "patriotism" in students. China's parliament, the National People's Congress, imposed a national security law last year that gives Beijing broad powers to target opposition leaders and restrict civil society organizations. Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters have been arrested under the new law, and the government has banned an activist group and a teachers' union.

"The Chinese government, not content with chipping away at Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law, is now wielding a sledgehammer," said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of the report.  "Democracy advocates, journalists, and academics in Hong Kong now live in fear of persecution and imprisonment under China's repressive policies.”

Human Rights Watch called on the international community to pressure China to uphold the rights and freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law. However, China and pro-Beijing officials in Hong Kong argue that critics are exaggerating or misrepresenting the changes, and that Hong Kong's rights and freedoms remain intact.They say China has simply strengthened its oversight to prevent unrest and limit foreign interference in Hong Kong.

With Beijing now firmly in control, the future of democracy and dissent in Hong Kong appears increasingly bleak. The city has long stood out in China for its vibrant civil society and freedoms of speech. But under Xi Jinping's hardline leadership, China seems determined to rein in Hong Kong and demand unflinching loyalty. The democratic vision of protesters who filled Hong Kong's streets in 2019 is fading, as China overpowers the territory with an authoritarian model of governance that brooks no political dissent or challenge to its control.
