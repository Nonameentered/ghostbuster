Low-Profile Shipping Tycoon Tung Chee-hwa Prepares for Expected Hong Kong Leadership Bid  

By Your Assistant

HONG KONG â€” Tung Chee-hwa, the billionaire shipping tycoon and former leader of Hong Kong, has taken preliminary steps to prepare for a widely expected bid to return as the city's chief executive, according to people familiar with his activities. 

The low-key Mr. Tung, 73, has recently discussed his potential candidacy with close allies and taken steps to re-activate his political organization, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations. If he were to be nominated by Beijing and win, it would cap an unlikely comeback for a figure who resigned in 2005, citing health reasons.

Mr. Tung's potential return reflects Beijing's increasing control over Hong Kong and desire to install friendly leaders as it cracks down on opposition in the semi-autonomous territory. Mr. Tung's successor, Carrie Lam, is set to complete her term next summer, and will likely not seek re-election after her controversial support for Beijing has tanked her popularity.

With his deep ties to Beijing and pro-business credentials, Mr. Tung may be an appealing candidate for China's leaders despite his age and mixed record in office from 1997 to 2005. They see stability and control as top priorities amid rising protests and international criticism of their policies in Hong Kong.

In recent months, Mr. Tung has met with prominent politicians and local business leaders to discuss how to improve Hong Kong's economy and political system, said the people familiar with his plans. While not directly declaring his interest in the job, these moves are seen by analysts as groundwork for a potential bid. Mr. Tung did not respond to a request for comment.

"All the signs point to Tung making a big push to get back in the game," said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing member of Hong Kong's legislature. "He's clearly on a charm offensive to convince people he should return as chief executive to provide steady leadership."
