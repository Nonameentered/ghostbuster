Chinese Flags Fly High in Hong Kong Ahead of Handover 

The streets and skyscrapers of Hong Kong are awash in red this week as China's flag is prominently displayed throughout the city ahead of the 25th anniversary of Britain handing over control of the former colony on July 1. 

The handover in 1997 marked the end of more than 150 years of British colonial rule. Under the "one country, two systems" agreement, Hong Kong maintained a high degree of political and economic autonomy for 50 years. However, in recent years, Beijing has exerted more influence and control over the semi-autonomous region, raising concerns about the erosion of political and civil freedoms.

The display of national pride through the flying of Chinese flags is seen by pro-Beijing politicians and activists as a symbolic representation of Hong Kong's unity and allegiance with mainland China. Legislator Junius Ho said, “Raising the national flag is a concrete expression of patriotism. I hope that the whole of society can unite and that Hong Kong and the motherland can move forward together under the wisdom of ‘one country, two systems.'”

Critics argue that compulsory flag-raising ceremonies and other demonstrations of patriotism undermine Hong Kong's political autonomy and liberal values. Student leader Keith Fong said, " 'One country, two systems' is about tolerance for different political opinions and ideologies. But the more mainland China and the Hong Kong government push ahead with patriotic and nationalistic campaigns, the less space is left for alternative voices.”

The handover anniversary comes at a time of rising tensions between pro-democracy supporters and the Hong Kong government backed by Beijing. In 2019, mass protests erupted over an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Although the bill was eventually withdrawn, it highlighted wider fears that Hong Kong's political and legal freedoms were being eroded. The 2020 implementation of a new national security law also gave Beijing more direct control and led to the arrests of prominent pro-democracy activists.
