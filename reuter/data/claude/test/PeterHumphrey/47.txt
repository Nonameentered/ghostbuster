Rights groups warn of threats to freedom in Hong Kong ahead of Chinese rule takeover 

Hong Kong is preparing to pass from British to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, but human rights groups warn the transition threatens vital civil liberties and freedoms in the prosperous territory.

After 155 years of British rule, Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region under China in less than a month. However, China's authoritarian government has a poor human rights record and suppresses political dissent and criticism. There are fears China will erode the rule of law, freedom of speech and other civil liberties that make Hong Kong a bastion of freedom in Asia.

In a new report, Amnesty International warned "there are already signs that civil and political rights are under threat" in Hong Kong. The group said Hong Kong police have questioned or detained increasing numbers of peaceful protesters, journalists and opposition activists. Amnesty said such actions were "ominous for the future protection of human rights in Hong Kong."

The fate of Hong Kong has been a concern since the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration set the terms of the handover. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong is guaranteed a "high degree of autonomy" except in foreign and defense affairs. But activists say China has been tightening control and meddling in Hong Kong affairs.

"How the Chinese government chooses to exercise its authority over Hong Kong will shape whether 'one country, two systems' becomes a viable model for protected freedoms or a broken promise," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. The group called on China to honor its commitments to uphold civil liberties, judicial independence and press freedom in Hong Kong.

Not all share these concerns. Some business leaders argue China will not jeopardize the free market system that makes Hong Kong an economic powerhouse and conduit for foreign investment in China. Chinese officials have also said they will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life. However, the communist leadership sees foreign influence and political dissent as threats to its control. After the handover, China will have the power to pass laws and approve candidates that shape the city's destiny.  

The future remains uncertain, but rights groups argue now is the time to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society in Hong Kong to withstand pressure from Beijing. How much freedom and autonomy Hong Kong retains after the handover could serve as a litmus test for China's rise as a global superpower in the 21st century.
