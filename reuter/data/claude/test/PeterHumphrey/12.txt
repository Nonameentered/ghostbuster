Pro-China party leader Tsang Yok-Sing shaped by his involvement in Hong Kong's 1967 riots 

Tsang Yok-Sing, the current leader of the pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong, DAB, has had a long career shaped in part by his experiences during the 1967 anti-colonial riots in Hong Kong. As a young student activist at the time, Tsang was arrested for assisting the rioters and spent over a year in prison. His time behind bars and involvement with the leftist movements of the era helped cement his political beliefs and set him on a path to becoming a leader in Hong Kong's pro-Beijing circles.

The 1967 riots were a pivotal moment in Hong Kong's history under British colonial rule. Labor disputes and resentment over poor living conditions led to violent clashes between protesters and police that lasted for over six months. Tsang, then a 20-year-old history student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, joined the demonstrations to show his support for the workers and anti-colonial sentiments. He was eventually arrested for distributing supplies and propaganda to those involved in the riots. 

Tsang's year in prison during 1967 and 1968 proved formative for his political views. He connected with other left-leaning activists and developed a strong sense of Hong Kong's Chinese national identity and opposition to British rule. Upon his release, Tsang became further involved in activist circles and Marxist organizations. He joined the Hong Kong and Kowloon Committee for Anti-Hong Kong British Persecution Struggle, a radical group that advocated for Hong Kong's return to China.

In the following decades, Tsang traded his revolutionary zeal for a leadership role in the establishment pro-Beijing political apparatus of Hong Kong. He helped found the DAB, now Hong Kong's largest pro-establishment party, in 1991 and has led the party since 2008. Under Tsang's leadership, the DAB has supported tighter integration between Hong Kong and mainland China and backed Beijing's increasing influence over Hong Kong's political system. 

Tsang's journey from student radical to establishment figure illustrates the complex political transformations of Hong Kong since the 1967 riots. While the colonial authority of five decades ago may see Tsang as a thorn in their side turned compliant politician, Tsang likely views himself as continuing the same mission of strengthening Hong Kong's Chinese identity that first drove him to activism over 50 years ago. His time in prison in 1967 gave Tsang conviction in his cause that has endured to this day.  

 The 1967 riots were a formative time for Tsang and Hong Kong itself. Whether Tsang's vision of Hong Kong's future under China would align with the hopes and demands of those protesters over half a century ago is an open question. Yet there is no doubting the pivotal role that era played in shaping Tsang's own role as a leader in Hong Kong's fraught political landscape.
