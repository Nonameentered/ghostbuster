Anti-Japanese Sentiment Surfaces in Hong Kong Amidst South China Sea Island Dispute and Rising Nationalism in China

Hong Kong has long been a bastion of liberal values and openness in Asia. However, recent tensions between China and Japan over disputed islands in the South China Sea have provoked a surge of nationalist sentiment in the special administrative region. Anti-Japanese protests erupted in Hong Kong last weekend, a worrying sign of the spread of  mainland China's increasingly aggressive nationalism.

On Saturday, over 1,000 protesters gathered outside the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong, waving Chinese flags and condemning Japan's claims to the Senkaku Islands, uninhabited islets known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. The protesters chanted "Diaoyu Islands belong to China!" and "Little Japan, get out of China!" Riot police were deployed to prevent the crowd from storming the consulate building. Minor scuffles broke out, though no injuries were reported.

The demonstration was organized by Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing political party, the Hong Kong Victorious Union. Party officials condemned Japan's "theft" of the islands and called on Hong Kong citizens to stand up against Japan to "protect the motherland's sovereignty." The protest underscores how deeply China's stance on the island dispute and antagonism toward Japan have permeated Hong Kong.

Tensions over the Senkaku Islands have simmered for years but intensified this month when China established a new territorial baseline around the islands, essentially annexing the disputed territory. Japan vigorously condemned the move. The United States also criticized China's actions and affirmed that the Senkaku Islands fall within the scope of the U.S.-Japan mutual defense treaty.

The rising turmoil comes as Hong Kong voters get set to choose a new Legislative Council in September. Some analysts worry pro-Beijing forces will stoke nationalist passions during the election to bolster support for their candidates. Hong Kong's democratic opposition candidates fear that inflaming anti-Japanese anger will further polarize society and undermine Hong Kong's traditions of tolerance. A free, open, and pluralistic Hong Kong is increasingly at risk, they argue, from the authoritarian ideology taking hold across the border.

The outbreak of anti-Japan protests in Hong Kong is a warning sign that the political and social fault lines dividing Hong Kong and mainland China may be deepening. With tensions rising in the region and nationalism on the ascent across East Asia, this contest of territorial claims and identities is likely to shape politics in Hong Kong for years to come. For now, the Senkaku Islands that lie at the heart of the dispute remain unwitting lightning rods for a larger geopolitical storm brewing on China's periphery.
