Chinese Troops to Enter Hong Kong for First Time Ever as Britain Marches Out 

Hong Kong is set to witness a historic moment on July 1, 1997 as Chinese troops enter the territory for the first time, marking the end of British rule. After more than 150 years of colonial governance, Britain will hand over control of Hong Kong to China in a ceremony tonight, ending one era and starting another.

The march of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops across the border into Hong Kong will symbolize China's resumption of sovereignty over the territory after a 99-year lease held by Britain expired. Up to 1000 PLA soldiers will participate in the handover ceremony and parade, but most troops will remain stationed in bases in mainland China. 

The arrival of Chinese troops has stoked anxiety among some Hong Kong residents who worry that it may erode the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China. Under this principle, Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy and separation of powers for 50 years after the handover. The territory will become a special administrative region under Chinese sovereignty but retain its own political and economic system.

"There is a mix of excitement, anxiety, and apathy among Hong Kong people toward the handover and PLA troops entering the city," said Lawrence Ho, a 23-year-old Hong Kong university student. "Some see it as a symbolic milestone in Hong Kong's return to the motherland, but others worry China may tighten its grip and chip away at our freedoms over time."

The elaborate handover ceremony, attended by Chinese and British dignitaries, will take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre tonight. The last British Governor Chris Patten will leave Hong Kong on the Royal Yacht Britannia, and the territory's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa will pledge to uphold the city's laws and way of life.

Fireworks, cultural performances and other celebratory events have been lined up across the territory to mark the occasion. But pro-democracy activists also plan protests over China's clampdown on civil liberties and its handling of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Some worry China will steer Hong Kong away from openness and democracy but and erode human rights. 

Britain first took control of Hong Kong island in 1841 and later gained control of Kowloon and the New Territories, expanding the colony to the mainland. Hong Kong grew into a global financial hub under British rule and way of life and civil liberties. China's resumption of control has raised concerns over the erosion of those freedoms. All eyes will be on how much - or how little - China interferes in Hong Kong affairs in the coming weeks, months and years. The arrival of PLA troops is a symbolic turning point in Hong Kong's complex history with Britain and China. What happens next will shape the city's future as a fusion of East and West for generations to come.
