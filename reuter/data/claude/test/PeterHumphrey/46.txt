Hong Kong's Provisional Legislature Cancels Session Due to Staff Shortage Ahead of Handover to China

The provisional legislature of Hong Kong was forced to cancel its session today due to a shortage of staff ahead of the handover of the territory from Britain to China on July 1. There were reportedly up to 30 administrative staff away due to sickness or vacations at the time of the scheduled session. This was deemed too few to properly assist the 60 members of the legislature, and so the session was cancelled.

The last-minute cancellation has raised questions about governance during this transitional period. Hong Kong will return to Chinese rule next month after more than 150 years as a British colony. The provisional legislature was established by Beijing to handle administration of the territory in the months leading up to the handover. It is comprised of members selected by Beijing and pro-China politicians and business leaders in Hong Kong. 

Critics argue the cancellation shows the provisional body lacks enough depth and experience to properly govern Hong Kong. They point out that established legislative bodies have procedures in place to continue functioning even with some staff away. Supporters counter that it was a prudent move to cancel to ensure proper support to legislators and that it is too early to make a judgment about the provisional legislatureâ€™s competence.

The handover of Hong Kong to China is a complex process, with many administrative and logistical details still being finalized and coordinated between British and Chinese officials. The provisional legislature is meant to handle more routine governance matters during this transition period. But its authority is limited, as it will dissolve once the handover is complete and a new legislature is elected in the special administrative region.

The last session of the provisional legislature was meant to debate several policies related to public housing, social welfare programs, and development projects ahead of the handover. These will now be delayed until the next session, currently scheduled for early June. The cancellation has also fueled speculation that some legislators may try to stall or obstruct debate of certain controversial bills in the limited time remaining, as a way of frustrating Chinese control post-handover.

In a statement, the provisional legislature apologized for the inconvenience caused by the cancellation. It said the well-being and safety of legislators and staff was the top priority in this " period of intense activity and long hours" leading up to July 1. The legislature promised to release a revised schedule for the remaining sessions as soon as possible to ensure all necessary legislative work is completed before the handover.
