Hong Kong's Democrats Vow to Fight Beijing's Plan to Limit Civil Rights Before Sovereignty Change

By The Assistant

HONG KONG - Pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in Hong Kong vowed on Tuesday to fight a Chinese government plan that would limit civil liberties in the territory, raising fears that Beijing is tightening its grip even before regaining sovereignty over the semiautonomous region in 2047. 

A day after Chinese officials introduced a proposal requiring "patriotism" in Hong Kong's governance, pro-democracy legislators warned it could strip away the civil rights and freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from mainland China. The proposal from Beijing has not yet been written into law, but it reflects the ambitions of Communist Party leaders to exert more control over the former British colony.

The Democrats, a pro-democracy party, condemned the proposal, calling it an attempt to "completely destroy" Hong Kong's civil society and democratic reforms. Claudia Mo, a longtime pro-democracy lawmaker, said the plan showed Chinese leaders wanted "to reign in Hong Kong much sooner."

"Beijing is effectively scrapping its promise to keep Hong Kong's existing freedoms and autonomy intact for 50 years, that's 'one country, two systems,'" said Ms. Mo, referring to the arrangement under which Britain agreed to hand over Hong Kong in 1997. "They are now making their moves, five years before the 50-year deadline."

Democracy advocates in Hong Kong have long feared that China would eventually renege on its commitments to preserve the city's freedoms, which include an independent judiciary, freedom of speech and assembly, and an open internet increasingly restricted on the mainland. Those fears intensified on Monday when an official from China's top legislative body provided more details on a plan to require that public officeholders prove their patriotism and loyalty to Beijing. 

Wang Chen, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said in a speech that governance over Hong Kong must be placed in the "hands of patriots," raising fears that pro-democracy legislators and activists could be barred from office. The plan is expected to be adopted at a meeting of the congress next week and could take effect as soon as next year.

The proposal threatens to further polarize Hong Kong and deepen distrust in Beijing, at a time when China is already facing international criticism over its crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and other human rights issues. Western nations have condemned the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists like Joshua Wong and Jimmy Lai, the owner of a newspaper critical of China. The erosion of liberties in Hong Kong could also jeopardize its status as a global financial hub.

"This so-called 'patriotism' is not for safeguarding the rights of the Hong Kong people, but for eliminating dissent and destroying pluralism," said Alvin Yeung, the leader of Hong Kong's Civic Party. "All Hong Kong people who love Hong Kong and cherish freedom will stand up and fight."

Beijing has defended the plan as necessary to promoting stability and prosperity in Hong Kong after huge pro-democracy protests in 2019 plunged the territory into its deepest crisis since the 1997 handover.Chinese officials argue that existing laws already call for governance by "patriots" and that disloyalty among public servants threatens national security. Still, the new proposal appears to give Beijing more leeway to disqualify anyone deemed "unpatriotic" from participating in Hong Kong's political system.
