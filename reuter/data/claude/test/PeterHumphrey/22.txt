Hong Kong Legislator Demands Clarity on Communist Party's Role in the Territory After Handover 

A pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong has called on China's Communist Party to clarify its role in the territory's governance after the 1997 handover from British rule. Legislator Claudia Mo questioned whether the "one country, two systems" principle that guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy for 50 years after the handover is still intact.

Mo pointed to recent comments by Zhang Xiaoming, the head of the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, suggesting that the Communist Party has "comprehensive jurisdiction" over Hong Kong. His remarks seemed to contradict the "one country, two systems" principle which states that Hong Kong will retain its own political and economic system separate from mainland China for 50 years after the handover.

"We need clarification on what they mean by the Communist Party exercising jurisdiction in Hong Kong, as that would violate one country, two systems," Mo said. She urged the territory's political leaders to demand clarification on what Zhang meant by "comprehensive jurisdiction." 

Mo said the central government plans to increasingly exert control in Hong Kong via the stationing of Chinese military personnel at a new base and greater power to select chief executive candidates. These moves threaten Hong Kong's democratic system and freedoms, she said. In recent years, pro-democracy activists have voiced concerns that China is reneging on its commitment to maintain Hong Kong's political autonomy as enshrined in the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984.   

A spokesman for the Hong Kong government refused to comment on Zhang's remarks and said the "one country, two systems" principle remains unchanged. Analysts said Beijing prefers vague and contradictory language surrounding its role in Hong Kong's affairs to expand its power and contain dissent. Calls for greater democracy have intensified in Hong Kong in recent years, posing a challenge to Beijing's control.

Clarifying the Communist Party's role in Hong Kong's governance could reignite tensions with pro-democracy activists pushing back against China's tightening grip. The dispute highlights the precarious foundations of the "one country, two systems" principle as anxieties over Hong Kong's future persist, 22 years after the handover from British rule.
