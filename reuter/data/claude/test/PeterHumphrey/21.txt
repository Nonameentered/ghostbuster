Experts say Moslem unrest in China's far-west does not threaten the country's territorial integrity

Recent unrest and violence by members of China's Muslim population in the country's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is unlikely to pose any serious threat to the territorial integrity of China, according to experts. Multiple protests and attacks over the past year by ethnic Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority group indigenous to Xinjiang, have left dozens dead and prompted a crackdown by Chinese authorities. However, analysts argue that despite periodic flare-ups, the Uighur opposition remains fragmented and lacks the popular support and organization required to challenge Chinese control of the region.   

Xinjiang, China's largest province, occupies roughly one-sixth of China's territory. The nomadic Uighur people have lived predominantly in Xinjiang for centuries and became part of Chinese territorial control starting in the 18th century. In recent decades, the Chinese government has encouraged the migration of Han Chinese into Xinjiang. The influx of outside residents and economic pressures have exacerbated ethnic tensions and resentment of Chinese rule among Uighur groups seeking greater political and cultural autonomy. 

The past year has seen a sharp increase in Uighur protests and attacks. Notable incidents include riots in Urumqi in July that killed nearly 200 people and bombings in Aksu last month. However, experts argue that the unrest appears random and uncoordinated. "There is no evidence that these incidents reflect any overall Uighur strategy or the actions of any particular group," said Rachel Kagan, an expert on ethnic politics in China at Princeton University. "While concerning, the violence seems localized and lacking direction."

The Chinese government has responded forcefully by flooding the region with security forces and clamping down on Uighur civil society groups. The heavy-handed response, while criticized as exacerbating local tensions, demonstrates China's determination to assert control, according to observers. The vast majority of Uighurs remain peaceful and continue to co-exist with Han Chinese, and experts say there are no signs China's territorial control is genuinely at risk. 

"There is frustration with certain policies, but simply no appetite among Uighurs and their leaders for outright separatism," said Jonathan Chang, an analyst with the European Institute of Chinese Studies. "The resources, organization and popular will for a broad separatist movement just aren't there. China will likely improve its security practices over time, but Xinjiang will remain firmly Chinese for the foreseeable future."
