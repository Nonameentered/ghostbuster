Hong Kong's Democratic Party welcomes pledge to protect basic freedoms after China takeover, but activists disrupt meeting  

The Democratic Party of Hong Kong welcomed assurances from China's leaders that basic civil liberties and political freedoms will be protected when the city transitions from British to Chinese rule in 1997. However, a meeting of party leaders was disrupted by pro-democracy activists who said the promises did not go far enough.

In a speech marking the start of negotiations on the transfer of sovereignty, Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said Hong Kong's capitalist system and way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years after the handover under the "one country, two systems" formula. However, he added that China would not tolerate challenges to its sovereignty. The Democratic Party leaders said they were encouraged by the pledges but some activists argue that without political reform and the right to universal suffrage, civil liberties could not be guaranteed long-term.  

The Democratic Party meeting was interrupted by a dozen activists from the group Turn Right, who stormed the stage carrying banners demanding full democracy immediately. The protesters said the party leaders had "sold out" Hong Kong people by accepting China's rule without securing the right to choose their leaders through free elections from the start. "Why should we wait 50 years to have the rights and freedoms we deserve today?" asked one activist. In tense scenes, the protesters scuffled with party members trying to evict them before police were called to clear the meeting. Two protesters were taken to hospital with minor injuries.

 Democratic Party leader Martin Lee urged protestors to have faith that basic rights could be achieved in agreement with China. “We share the desire for democracy and we are pressing for political reform,” he said. “However, we must build trust with Beijing and proceed gradually through cooperation, not confrontation.” His plea failed to satisfy the protesters who vowed to disrupt any events with pro-China politicians. 

The scenes highlighted the polarization and divisions within Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement ahead of the transfer of power. While Britain prepares to end its 156-year rule over the territory, activists fear losing rights and freedoms not typically found in mainland China once the handover is complete on July 1, 1997. China has promised to respect Hong Kong's quasi-democratic system of government for at least 50 years under the Joint Declaration signed in 1984. However, democracy advocates remain skeptical about whether authorities in Beijing will tolerate dissent and allow real competition for power over the longer term.   

Pro-China lawmakers condemned the disruption of the Democratic Party meeting, calling the protesters "extremists" trying to destabilize Hong Kong as it enters a new era. "These hotheads do not represent the majority view," said one legislator. "Most people support the peaceful transition to Chinese rule under the one country, two systems principle." However, a recent poll found that only 37 percent of Hong Kong people trust China's promises to uphold civil liberties — indicating anxieties remain over what the handover will mean in reality. The coming months promise to be a testing time as Hong Kong navigates between defending its freedoms and integrating with an authoritarian Chinese system on the horizon.
