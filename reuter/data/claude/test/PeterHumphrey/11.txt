Western Countries Secretly Plan to Grant Asylum to Chinese Dissidents Living in Exile in Hong Kong

Western governments are working on a secret agreement to grant political asylum to select Chinese dissidents currently living in exile in Hong Kong, according to classified documents reviewed by this news organization. The plan aims to provide refuge for up to 200 activists, human rights lawyers, and pro-democracy leaders who fled mainland China in recent years amid a widespread crackdown on dissent.

The documents outline a joint operation across several Western democracies, including the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, and some EU countries. The dissidents would be granted political asylum and path to citizenship based on risks of persecution if they returned to mainland China. The plan has been developing for over a year but slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, with travel restrictions easing, operation is ramping up again with the goal of secretly flying the dissidents out of Hong Kong over the next six to twelve months.

Hong Kong has been a safe haven for many Chinese dissidents who fled authoritarian rule. But since China imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong last year, many now fear their protected status is at risk and they could face extradition to mainland China. Western officials worry Beijing is poised to further erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the dissidents would face severe punishment if returned to Chinese authorities.

"These brave activists stood up for fundamental freedoms and human rights in China, and we have a moral duty to protect them now that their security in Hong Kong is increasingly imperiled," said one Western official familiar with the plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "This operation aims to save lives by providing these dissidents refuge before it's too late." 

China's Foreign Ministry and officials in Hong Kong did not respond to requests for comment. Government critics say China has failed to uphold its promise of "One Country, Two Systems" to maintain Hong Kong's freedom after the 1997 handover from British rule. The new security law gives authorities sweeping powers to target activists, journalists, and others seen as threats to Chinese control.

The secret asylum plan is a delicate operation, the documents reveal, requiring utmost stealth to avoid provoking Chinese authorities and endangering the dissidents until they can be safely extracted. Each country is settling on specific individuals granted asylum, with an emphasis on those most at risk and closest to Western embassies or consulates in Hong Kong. How the operation unfold over the coming year could significantly test Western alliances with pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong as China seeks to tighten its authoritarian control over the city.
