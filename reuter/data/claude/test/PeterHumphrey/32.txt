Hong Kong witnessed an extravagant spectacle on July 1, 1997 as Britain formally handed sovereignty of the colony over to China after more than 150 years of rule. The “party of the century,” as many have dubbed the lavish event, featured banquets, fireworks, and an official flag-changing ceremony to mark the transfer of power.

The festivities began the night before the handover with dazzling fireworks displays over Victoria Harbor. An estimated crowd of over a million people lined the harbor to watch the colorful pyrotechnics show. The thunderous fireworks were visible for miles across Hong Kong and served as a dramatic start to the historic occasion.

The next morning, Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin presided over the official handover ceremony. At midnight local time, the Union Jack was lowered for the last time, replaced by the red flag of the People's Republic of China as the Chinese military took control. Prince Charles bade a wistful farewell to Britain’s last major colony. “We shall not forget you,” he said, “and we wish you well.” President Jiang proclaimed, “From this day onward, Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland marks a successful conclusion of the settlement of China's historical grievances by foreign powers in modern times.”

 Lavish banquets, receptions and parties followed the flag-changing ceremony. No expense was spared, with many government officials and business leaders hosting extravagant bashes and pouring expensive champagne and cognac. The palatial banquet at the Hong Kong convention center featured everything from caviar to abalone. Others enjoyed a decadent “last hurrah” at private clubs like the exclusive Hong Kong Jockey Club.

For most ordinary Hong Kongers, the handover brought anxiety as much as celebration. While many enjoyed the fireworks shows and festivals, uncertainty remains about Hong Kong’s future under Chinese rule. China has pledged to govern Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” principle, allowing it to keep its capitalist system and civil liberties. But some fear erosion of political and economic freedoms over time. July 1 marked the start of a new era with both hope and unease for the people of Hong Kong.
