Busy Chinese praise Deng Xiaoping's economic miracles but point out social ills on the day after his passing  

Beijing, China - The day after former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping passed away at the age of 92, many Chinese citizens praised his economic reforms that propelled China's rapid growth but also noted the social problems that came with breakneck economic development.

Deng, who served as China's paramount leader from 1978 to 1997, launched sweeping market reforms that opened up China to global trade and investment, unleashed private business, and lifted millions out of poverty. China's GDP grew an average of 9.5% annually during Deng's time in power, according to government statistics. 

On the bustling streets of Beijing, many Chinese credited Deng with transforming China into an economic powerhouse and raising living standards. "Without Deng Xiaoping, China would not be what it is today," said Wang Cheng, a 45-year-old shopkeeper. "He made us prosperous."

However, others pointed out the social ills that accompanied Deng's reforms like rising inequality, damage to the environment, and erosion of the social welfare system. "Deng Xiaoping's policies created winners and losers in society," said Li Mei, a 32-year-old accountant. "The poor have been left behind while the rich got richer."

During the Deng era, China dismantled its cradle-to-grave welfare system and many state-owned enterprises laid off millions of workers. The private sector grew rapidly but labor protections remained weak. Today, China has over 600 million migrant workers with few social protections. Income inequality has also risen sharply - China's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has increased from 0.30 in 1980 to over 0.46 today, according to the World Bank.

Environmental damage has also been severe. Lax regulations and breakneck growth led to heavy pollution of air, water and soil. "The environment has been the biggest victim of Deng's reforms," said Jiang Wen, an environmental activist. "Short-term growth at all costs has brought us to the brink of ecological disaster."  ...

While Deng will be remembered as the leader who reinvigorated China's economy, citizens hope China's leaders today can promote more balanced policies that distribute the gains of growth more evenly and sustainably. As Beijing cab driver Wang Xuebing put it, "Deng gave us prosperity but now we need leaders who can give us clean air, good healthcare, safe food and a fairer society." For many Chinese, that is the unfinished business of Deng Xiaoping's era.
