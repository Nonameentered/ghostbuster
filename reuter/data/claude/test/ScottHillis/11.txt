Curfew Imposed in Xinjiang Town After Deadly Separatist Riot 

The western Chinese region of Xinjiang has imposed restrictions including an overnight curfew in a town where at least three people were killed in clashes with police. Regional authorities announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Keriya county starting Saturday evening, following what they called a "terrorist attack" in the townâ€™s prefectural seat of Nilqa. 

The Xinjiang government press office said in a statement Sunday that a group of "thugs" armed with knives and axes attacked government offices and police stations in Nilqa on Saturday morning. Police shot dead three of the attackers and captured another, the statement said. Local residents said the attackers were Muslim ethnic Uighurs, and that the violence stemmed from anger over heavy security crackdowns in Xinjiang and discrimination against the Uighur minority. 

The Nilqa unrest follows months of intensifying security in Xinjiang, including police raids of Uighur households, restrictions on Islamic practices, and public campaigns discouraging unauthorized prayer or Quran study groups. Saturday's clashes are the deadliest violence in Xinjiang since a suicide bombing last April killed 16 people at a train station.

Xinjiang is home to about 10 million Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority. In recent years, violence has risen in the region, with Uighur separatists conducting bombings and knife attacks against government targets. Beijing blames the violence on Islamist radicals and separatists, who it says are aided by overseas Uighur groups. However, human rights groups argue the violence is largely a response to repressive policies that restrict religious and cultural rights. 

The Xinjiang government said local officials will tighten security measures in Keriya, including patrols of neighborhoods and vehicle inspections. "We will conduct targeted sweeps as needed. We will not allow any threat to social stability," said a government spokesman. Residents contacted by phone Sunday said the town remained tense, with many shops still shuttered. 

A 43-year-old fruit seller named Tursunniyaz said people dared not go outside unless necessary under the curfew. "We must obey the order to stay in, but we worry police will come knocking to take people away," he said. Uighur sources outside China said local religious schools and pro-independence activists had circulated leaflets in recent weeks calling for a "holy war" against Chinese forces. 

Chinese officials blame such radicals and "foreign forces" for orchestrating violence. Yet experts say the government's policies risk further alienating Uighurs and breeding extremism. "Xinjiang authorities seem locked into a vicious cycle of tightening controls and provoking more resentment," said James Millward, a Xinjiang expert at Georgetown University. "Beijing's refusal to consider political reforms and ease restrictions threatens to make terrorism a self-fulfilling prophecy."
