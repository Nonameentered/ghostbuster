Deng Xiaoping's Death Sparks Little Emotion in China, Signaling a Nation Changed by His Policies 

Deng Xiaoping, the former Communist leader who opened China to sweeping economic reforms and the global economy, died today at the age of 92. His death was announced on state television but met with little visible emotion on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai.

Mr. Deng led China from 1978 to 1992, spearheading a transformation that dismantled collective farming, welcomed foreign investment, and unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people. His free market-oriented changes lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and turned China into an economic powerhouse.

However, Mr. Deng's death elicited little public mourning, highlighting how deeply China has changed from the era in which he came to power. "People today are focused on making and spending money, not politics," said Wang Jun, a 31-year-old real estate agent in Beijing. "Deng made all this possible, but now China has moved on."

China's youth in particular have little connection to the era Mr. Deng inherited, when Mao Zedong's disastrous policy failures had plunged the nation into isolation and poverty. "The Cultural Revolution ended when I was a baby, so I only know China as a global economic superpower," said Wu Xiaomei, a 24-year-old retail shop owner in Shanghai. 

Mr. Deng saw China through a generation of growth that averaged about 10 percent annually, vaulting the country past Japan as the world's second largest economy behind only the United States. Hundreds of millions of Chinese were lifted out of extreme poverty, and a middle class began to emerge in major cities. 

Mr. Deng opened the door to foreign investment, technology, and education. He visited the United States in 1979 and met with President Jimmy Carter, signaling China's willingness to rejoin the global community. Mr. Deng sent thousands of Chinese students abroad and imported Western technical expertise and equipment.

However, Mr. Deng's China remained an authoritarian nation with severe limits on political dissent and free speech. His crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 resulted in a massive outpouring of condemnation from the international community. 

Mr. Deng stepped down as leader in 1992, leaving China a very different nation than the one he had inherited on the brink of collapse. His death today highlights that in today's thoroughly modern China, now more concerned with commerce than politics, Mr. Deng has become a distant figure from an era that shaped a new global superpower but has largely faded into memory.
