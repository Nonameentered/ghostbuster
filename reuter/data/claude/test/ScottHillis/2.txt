China's Largest Zinc Producer Struggles With Water Fluctuations Affecting Production Lines 

China's largest zinc producer, Zhuzhou Smelter Group, is facing significant challenges to operations due to water shortages and flooding impacting its production facilities in Hunan province. The state-owned company operates six zinc smelters in the region that have a combined production capacity of more than 600,000 tonnes per year, accounting for approximately 15 percent of the world's zinc supply.

Water levels in nearby rivers and reservoirs have dropped substantially this year due to below-average rainfall. The water shortages have made it difficult for Zhuzhou Smelter Group to generate enough hydropower to run its smelting operations and have also impacted the supply of water used directly in the zinc production process. In a statement, the company said production at two of its smelters has been cut by at least 30 percent due to the drought conditions. Meanwhile, operations at another facility were halted for several days recently due to flash flooding, which inundated the site with more water than equipment could handle. 

The water issues are threatening China's ambitions to dominate global zinc markets. China currently produces nearly half of the world's zinc, a commodity used to galvanize steel and essential for manufacturing cars, appliances, and construction materials. Disruptions to Chinese zinc output could ripple through economies worldwide. 

Analysts expect Zhuzhou Smelter Group's zinc production this year may fall 10 to 15 percent below the company's target of 630,000 tonnes. The Chinese government is taking emergency measures to increase water flows to the region, including diverting water from the Yangtze River and releasing more water from reservoirs. Officials are also expediting a water infrastructure project initially planned for 2025 to increase water storage capacity. However, initial government efforts have not been enough to address the severity of the situation.

Zhuzhou Smelter Group's challenges highlight the risks of China's dependence on water-intensive industries and the threats posed by climate change. According to Greenpeace East Asia, about 74 percent of China's electricity comes from coal and hydropower. As rainfall patterns change, many of China's dams and reservoirs may not have enough water to meet energy demands, especially during drought seasons. The impacts are poised to ripple through China's economy, increasing costs for businesses and reducing economic output. With water levels dropping in many of China's rivers, including the Yangtze, Yellow and Mekong rivers, due to environmental degradation and climate change, China's water security woes may be a sign of greater troubles ahead. Overall, China's largest zinc producer will likely face more water fluctuations in the coming years that continue to test its operations.
