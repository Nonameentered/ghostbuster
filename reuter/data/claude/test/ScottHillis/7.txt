U.S. Plans to Sponsor U.N. Resolution Condemning Beijing Unless Progress Made on Human Rights, Say Diplomats

The United States government is planning to sponsor a United Nations resolution condemning China over its treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang unless Beijing shows “concrete progress” on human rights, according to Western diplomats.

The U.S. has spent months lobbying allies to support a resolution on Xinjiang, where China has detained more than one million Uighurs and other Muslims in camps, according to human rights groups. The resolution would be a strong rebuke of China's policies if passed by the U.N. Human Rights Council. 

However, the U.S. prefers a negotiated solution and wants to see meaningful improvements in Xinjiang before moving forward with a resolution, the diplomats said. “The goal is progress, not punishment,” said one Western envoy. “But there must be real, concrete progress – not just rhetoric and promises with no follow through.”

China has denied all charges of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying the camps are “vocational training centers” aimed at de-radicalizing segments of the Muslim population. Beijing has said the measures are necessary to ensure national security following a rise in Islamist extremism and terrorist attacks in the region.

Despite China’s denials, former detainees have described the camps as virtual prisons where they were forced to pledge loyalty to the Communist Party and renounce Islam. Allegations of torture and political indoctrination are widespread.

The U.S. and its allies are demanding unfettered access to Xinjiang for human rights monitors and the closure of the camps. “Access and transparency will be a key test of China’s sincerity,” the Western diplomat said. Another diplomat cautioned that China may make token gestures, like allowing a few carefully choreographed tours, to defuse criticism while keeping the internment system largely intact.

Continued resistance from China could damage its relations with Western nations and spur more countries to join future criticism of its policies in Xinjiang, as well as Hong Kong. China’s crackdown on dissent and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong has also angered politicians in the U.S. and Europe.  

With no solution in sight, the clock is ticking for China to take action before the next session of the Human Rights Council in June. “The U.S. and others have bent over backwards to engage China on this,” the diplomat said. “But patience is running out.”
