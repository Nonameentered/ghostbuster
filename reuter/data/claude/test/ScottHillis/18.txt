China Negotiates Fate of North Korean Defector with South Korea amid Standoff

China is negotiating with South Korea over the fate of a high-ranking North Korean defector amid a weeks-long standoff, according to officials briefed on the discussions. China has detained the defector, believed to be a senior North Korean military official, since he crossed the border into China at the end of November. China has not confirmed the defector’s identity or rank but has indicated he will be repatriated to North Korea in line with the countries’ longstanding extradition agreement. 

South Korea has urged China not to send the defector back to North Korea, where he would likely face severe punishment for attempting to defect. Repatriating defectors to North Korea violates international law and human rights standards given the likelihood of imprisonment, torture, and public execution. South Korea has offered to resettle the defector instead, promising an anonymous new life in exchange for valuable intelligence on the inner workings of Kim Jong Un’s regime. 

The standoff highlights China’s complicated role in facing North Korean defections. China adheres to a policy of repatriating North Korean defectors in order to maintain stable relations with its ally. However, China has grown increasingly frustrated with North Korea’s provocative behavior and has sought to build warmer ties with South Korea. The fate of this high-profile defector may point to which direction China wants to move its relationships on the Korean peninsula.

According to officials, China was caught by surprise when the defector crossed into China in late November. China placed the defector under guard in a secret location as it weighed its options. Repatriating him to certain punishment in North Korea would undermine China’s image but allowing him to defect to South Korea could damage its strategic partnership with North Korea. China has proposed sending the defector to a third country as a compromise, but South Korea has insisted it will only accept him directly.
