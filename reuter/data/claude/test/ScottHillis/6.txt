US and China engage in last-ditch talks for textile accord and market access deal  

Trade officials from the United States and China met in Washington this week for critical talks ahead of proposed import tariffs set to take effect next week. The two sides are negotiating an agreement on textiles, market access and intellectual property that could forestall $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.  

The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports if the two sides cannot reach an agreement by next Monday. China has said it will retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion of US goods. The additional tariffs would bring the total amount of Chinese goods facing tariffs to over $250 billion, roughly half of China's exports to the US.

Textiles have been a particular point of contention in the ongoing trade war. The US wants China to curb subsidies in its textile sector, especially for synthetic fibers and yarns. US textile manufacturers argue these subsidies make Chinese products unfairly cheap and have contributed to a declining domestic textile industry. China has countered that US demands violate WTO rules.  

Market access for US firms in China is another priority for the US. Administration officials want China to ease restrictions on cloud computing, e-commerce and payments sectors, where US firms have a technological advantage. Foreign companies have long complained of uneven market access in China. 

Negotiators are also aiming for an accord on protecting intellectual property like trademarks, patents and copyrights. China has pledged to crack down on IP violations that have cost US companies billions but the US wants to see concrete improvement. Enforcement mechanisms and consequences are reportedly part of the closed-door talks.

With less than a week until the tariffs take effect, time is running out for another round of talks. Neither side has indicated willingness to postpone the tariff deadline, raising the stakes for the negotiators. If no deal is reached, the US is expected to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods spanning thousands of products including many household goods like furniture, appliances and food products. The additional tariffs and subsequent retaliation would significantly escalate the trade war between the economic superpowers. All eyes remain on the negotiators to see if they can find common ground.
