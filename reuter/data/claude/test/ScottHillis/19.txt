North Korea Warns of Forceful Response If Defector is Compelled to Go to Seoul  

North Korea warned Tuesday it would take "forceful" actions if South Korea attempts to forcibly return 12 North Korean restaurant workers who defected to the South last year. North Korea's state media accused Seoul of holding the North Koreans against their will and said any attempt to repatriate them would be met with "various countermeasures." 

The 12 North Koreans who worked as waitresses overseas fled to South Korea in April 2016 in a rare group defection. South Korean officials say the defection was voluntary and they are now under government protection. But North Korea claims the waitresses were kidnapped by South Korean spies while working in Ningxia, China.

In a statement carried by its official Korean Central News Agency, the North said it was concerned for the safety of the waitresses - their identity was revealed in South Korean media upon defection - and that Seoul was "viciously bent on escalation of confrontation." The North described the women as victims of "group abduction" who were now being detained against their will.

"If they are returned against their desire, we will take a forceful follow-up measure," the statement warned, urging Seoul to "prudently ponder" the situation. Analysts say the warning is typical North Korean rhetoric meant to intimidate the South, and taking military action would be unlikely. But the North may step up gray zone tactics like cyberattacks to spite the South without risking an all-out conflict.

For South Korea, the case highlights the precarious situation of many North Koreans living clandestinely overseas, often forced to work long hours for little pay while under the close scrutiny of minders. The risk of abduction by North Korean agents is also real for high-profile defectors in the South. But analysts say Seoul's shielding of the waitresses was necessary and within legal bounds, as they flew to freedom willingly and would face harsh punishment if returned.

The waitresses, all in their 20s and 30s, told South Korean officials they had endured long work hours and physical abuse, and earned only a fraction of the money they made for the restaurant. After fleeing the restaurant, they took a long detour to Thailand before boarding a flight to Seoul to avoid being caught by North Korean agents, according to South Korean media reports.

Their defection was seen as a slap in the face for North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, who has placed greater emphasis on earning foreign currency in recent years. Estimates say tens of thousands of North Koreans work overseas, mainly in China and Russia, to earn foreign currency for the regime. The restaurants, in particular, are meant to project an image of North Korea as a normal country and earn cash from foreigners. There are about 130 North Korean restaurants abroad, mostly in China and Southeast Asia, run by a Workers' Party organization called Office 39.
