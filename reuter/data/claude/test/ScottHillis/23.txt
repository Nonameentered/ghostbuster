China urges solution to North Korean official's refuge in Seoul mission

China has called for a resolution to the diplomatic standoff caused by the defection of a senior North Korean trade official to South Korea. Ri Pyong-chol, North Korea's trade representative in China, entered South Korea's trade mission in Beijing late last week and has refused to leave, seeking asylum.

Ri's defection comes at a sensitive time, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un planning to visit China this month to meet President Xi Jinping. The unannounced visit by Ri to the South Korean trade mission has caused embarrassment for China and tensions with North Korea, its longtime ally. 

South Korea's foreign ministry confirmed that Ri had entered the trade mission and applied for asylum to avoid persecution by the North Korean regime. However, South Korea faces a dilemma over whether to grant asylum and risk angering China, or repatriate Ri to face punishment in North Korea. China insists countries should respect each other's sovereignty, in an implicit warning not to grant asylum.

Ri's position as trade representative gave him insights into the vast smuggling networks North Korea relies on to circumvent sanctions and access foreign currency and goods. His defection suggests Kim's brutal crackdowns and frequent purges are creating further instability within the regime.

According to sources, Ri entered the South Korean trade mission at night and has refused to leave the premises. South Korean officials have not been able to communicate directly with him but said he appeared to be in a desperate state. His wife and children are thought to still be in North Korea, raising concerns over their safety and possible retaliation by the regime.

China's foreign ministry urged both sides to handle the issue "appropriately so as not to affect the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations." However, China's options appear limited given it cannot forcibly remove Ri from the trade mission without causing a serious rift with South Korea. The standoff looks set to continue as officials from both sides hold tense negotiations over Ri's fate.
