Jiang Zemin Assumes Power in China Following Deng Xiaoping's Death

Beijing, China - Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China for over a decade, passed away today at the age of 92. Deng had been the de facto leader of China since the late 1970s, overseeing China's economic reforms and transition from a planned economy to a market-based economy. With Deng's passing, Jiang Zemin has moved swiftly to consolidate his position as Deng's successor. 

Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China since 1989, called for a period of national mourning in honor of Deng's legacy. In a televised address, Jiang praised Deng as "a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, (and) a long-tested Communist fighter." Jiang affirmed that China would continue the policy of economic reform and opening up that Deng had championed.

The path to succession has not always been smooth for Jiang. He was promoted to the party's top post following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the dismissal of Zhao Ziyang. However, Deng remained the dominant figure in Chinese politics through the early 1990s. At times, Deng seemed to undermine Jiang's authority, forcing Jiang to scramble to please both political factions allied with Deng and those allied with now-disgraced party leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. 

In recent years, however, Deng's health had deteriorated and he appeared increasingly rarely in public. Jiang had already taken on many of the responsibilities and duties associated with China's leadership. With Deng's death, Jiang is now the preeminent leader of the Communist Party and will steer China into the 21st century. Jiang is expected to continue the broad outlines of Deng's economic reforms, but also tackle challenges like China's accession to the World Trade Organization, uncertainties in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and demands for political reforms.

Jiang faces a delicate balancing act in the aftermath of Deng's death. He must honor Deng's legacy but also establish his own authority over the Communist Party. He will have to navigate the various political factions in Beijing and craft his own vision for China's future. All of China mourns the passing of Deng, but with the succession of power now complete, all eyes will be on Jiang Zemin as he takes the helm in a new era of leadership in China.
