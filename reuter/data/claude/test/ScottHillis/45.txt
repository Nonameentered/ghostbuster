China hints at ethnic unrest in Xinjiang following separatist bomb attacks 

Beijing, China - The Chinese government indicated there may be further ethnic unrest in the western region of Xinjiang following two bomb attacks that killed at least 18 people over the weekend. The attacks appear to have been carried out by separatists from the Uighur Muslim minority group, according to state media reports.

In a rare move, the Chinese foreign ministry warned citizens about travel to Xinjiang due to “frequent terrorist attacks as well as ethnic and religious tensions in that region.” Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said “recent terrorist attacks show that these terrorist and extremist groups are premeditating and planning to cause violent and extreme events meant to further spread extremist ideologies.”

Xinjiang, a vast region in western China that borders Central Asia, has long been of strategic importance to China due to its natural resources and role in President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road global infrastructure initiative. However, the nominally autonomous region has seen periodic bouts of ethnic unrest pitting the Uighur population against Han Chinese migrants. The Chinese government has implemented increasingly restrictive policies to monitor and assimilate the Uighur population, with reports of “re-education camps” holding hundreds of thousands of people.

The latest attacks took place in the city of Kashgar and began with a bombing at a night market on Saturday evening that killed three people. Hours later, two attackers drove a vehicle into a group of pedestrians and then detonated explosive devices that killed an additional 15 people. Chinese authorities killed the attackers and blamed the violence on “separatists and extremists.” However, no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

Uighur exile groups argue that China violently suppresses peaceful dissent and political protests by Uighurs. The government counters that it is fighting extremism and terrorism. The diplomatic warning and acknowledgment of “ethnic tensions” by Chinese authorities suggests the government believes further unrest may be likely as Uighur groups seek to counter increasingly oppressive Chinese policies in Xinjiang. The violence also threatens to undermine Xi Jinping's vision of a unified China that serves as a harmonious center of global infrastructure and trade. The situation in Xinjiang will likely remain tense as long as the root causes of Uighur unrest remain unaddressed.
