Curfew Imposed on Xinjiang Town After Deadly Separatist Riot

Chinese authorities have announced an indefinite curfew on the northwestern town of Kashgar after violence broke out between security forces and a group of suspected Uyghur separatists. According to state media, ethnic Uyghur militants attacked a police station with knives and bombs, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens more.  In response, officials declared a curfew, deployed more troops, and launched a dragnet search for suspects.

Kashgar, a city of more than 3 million in China's Xinjiang region, has long been at the center of tensions between Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group, and the Han Chinese majority. The Uyghurs have complained of economic and political marginalization along with restrictions on their cultural and religious traditions under Chinese rule. Sporadic violence has plagued the region for years, with some Uyghurs carrying out attacks on government targets they accuse of oppression. The central government denies repressing Uyghurs and says it is combating militants bent on establishing an independent state.

According to broadcasts on state television, a group of knife- and bomb-wielding assailants launched a coordinated assault on a Kashgar police station around midnight. They set vehicles on fire, detonated explosives, and stabbed several officers while trying to break into the compound. Police opened fire and shot dead most of the attackers after two hours of clashes. The remaining militants then fled into surrounding neighborhoods. Authorities are conducting a search for suspects and have placed much of the city under lockdown.

The regional government released a statement blaming the attack on "separatists fueled by extremism." But activists in exile disputed that characterization. "The reported scale of the attack and weapons used don't match the typical style of separatists," said Adil Muhemet, a Uyghur rights advocate based in Amsterdam. "We fear this could be used as an excuse for a new crackdown." Communications in Kashgar are difficult to verify due to heavy government controls.

The violence comes amid heightened tensions as Chinese authorities enact increasingly tough measures to curb expressions of Uyghur identity. The government has banned beard growing, fasting during Ramadan, and other Islamic practices in parts of Xinjiang. The policy has fueled resentment that analysts say contributes to radicalization among some Uyghurs. But China insists its actions support economic growth and social cohesion. Tuesday's riot will likely lead to even tighter security, potentially escalating the cycle of unrest gripping Xinjiang and threatening Beijing's control.
