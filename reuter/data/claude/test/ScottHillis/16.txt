Valentine's Day Sales Blooming in China's Flower Industry  

China's cut flower industry is blossoming around Valentine's Day. The country's vast flower markets are filled with roses, tulips, orchids and lilies as vendors prepare for a spike in sales ahead of February 14th.  According to China's Ministry of Agriculture, flower sales volume grew over 15% in 2020 and is expected to increase another 10% this Valentine's Day. 

The growth is fueled by China's expanding middle class and rising disposable incomes. As people have more money to spend, flowers have become an increasingly popular gift. "Flower giving is seen as a way to express your feelings and show you care," said Lin Wei, a florist at the Kunming International Flower Auction Trading Center. "Valentine's Day is the biggest day of the year for us, even bigger than Chinese New Year."

While red roses remain the most popular flower for Valentine's Day, there is growing interest in other flowers, especially orchids, lilies and gerberas. Orchids are seen as an exotic and luxurious choice, while brightly colored gerberas and lilies appeal to younger customers. "Flowers make a perfect gift because they are beautiful but also fleeting," said Wang Jun, who shops at the Shanghai Flower Port Market. "They capture the temporary nature of romance."

Farmers and florists are gearing up for the demand. Roses and orchids are flown in from around the country and the world. According to Alibaba, the largest e-commerce company in China, flower sales on its platforms jumped 50% on Valentine's Day last year. This year, Alibaba expects a 30-40% increase in flower sales in the week leading up to February 14th. 

The booming flower business reflects China's growing appreciation for Western cultural traditions and holidays. "Valentine's Day is popular especially with young people," said Jia Long, a flower wholesaler in Beijing. "They see it as a chance to express their love in a romantic way." Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Jia expects this Valentine's Day to be the best one yet. "Flowers can connect people even when we have to be physically apart," she said. "So they make the perfect gift for this special time."

Overall, China's Valentine's Day flower craze highlights how blossoming middle-class spending power is driving the growth of discretionary industries like floristry. As more Chinese embrace Western traditions and cultural practices, the flower industry is likely to continue flourishing.
