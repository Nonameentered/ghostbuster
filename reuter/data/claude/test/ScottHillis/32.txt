South Korean Flag Flies Half-Mast in Beijing as Talks on Defector Hwang's Fate Stall

The South Korean embassy in Beijing flew its national flag at half-mast today as talks between Chinese and South Korean officials regarding the fate of North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop stalled. Hwang, the highest-ranking North Korean official to defect to South Korea, passed away on Sunday at the age of 87 while under heavy police guard in Seoul. 

South Korea had requested that Hwang's remains be returned for a state funeral and burial in his homeland. However, North Korea demanded the return of Hwang's body to Pyongyang, calling him a "traitor" for defecting in 1997. China, as North Korea's closest ally, has backed Pyongyang's claims and refused Seoul's request to transport Hwang's remains through Chinese territory.

The flag gesture at the South Korean embassy signifies the somber mood in Seoul as the government grapples with the logistical and geopolitical challenges of laying a former North Korean official to rest. A South Korean foreign ministry official expressed "deep regret" that Hwang would likely not receive a state funeral. "We are disappointed by the stance of the Chinese government, which goes against humanitarian values and human decency," the unnamed official said.

For decades, Hwang was a close confidant of former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung and occupied top posts including Workers' Party secretary for propaganda. His defection dealt a major blow to the personality cult surrounding the Kim family regime. In his later years, Hwang gave speeches worldwide condemning the North Korean government and called for the end of the regime.

Experts said the state funeral request reflects South Korea's intent to uphold Hwang as a symbol of democratic values and send a signal to other high-level defectors. "A state funeral for Hwang would highlight the moral victory of his defection, showing the world that condemning the evils of tyranny and embracing freedom are noble acts," said Kim Young-jun, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification.

However, North Korea remains determined to block such a symbolic win for its rival and gain custody of Hwang's body at all costs. "Hwang betrayed the motherland and sold national secrets, so he must be returned for punishment even after death," said an editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party. 

With China unwilling to budge from its support for North Korea on the matter, South Korea has few options left to honor Hwang's final wishes of a homecoming on national soil. The half-mast flag in Beijing signaled the gloom settling over supporters who had hoped for a more dignified ending for the life of a man who gave up everything to expose the truth about the North Korean regime to the world.
