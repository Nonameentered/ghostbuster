Actor who played Deng Xiaoping wants to avoid being typecast in iconic role following Chinese patriarch's death 

Beijing, China - Lan Tianye, the veteran Chinese actor best known for portraying former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in multiple films and TV shows, said today he hopes to avoid being typecast following Deng's death this week at the age of 92.

Lan has played Deng, who spearheaded China's economic reforms starting in the late 1970s, in six different productions over his 40-year career. His nuanced and memorable performances as the diminutive yet influential leader earned him widespread acclaim and several acting awards. However, Lan said he fears that with Deng's passing, directors and audiences will have trouble seeing him in other roles.

"Deng Xiaoping had an enormous impact on China and defined an era, so it was a privilege and honor for me to help share his story," Lan said in an interview. "But as an actor, I don't want to play the same part over and over. I have a range of life experiences and abilities that I wish to convey on screen and stage."

Lan said being so closely associated with such an iconic figure has made some directors reluctant to cast him as other characters, worrying that audiences won't be able to separate the actor from the role that made him famous. Younger generations of moviegoers, in particular, have grown up knowing Lan primarily as Deng Xiaoping.

"I understand the challenges, but I hope that audiences and directors will give me the opportunity to transform myself into new roles that showcase different facets of my craft," Lan said. "Actors should never stop evolving and stretching themselves. Like all human beings, we are complex and multi-dimensional."

Lan's breakthrough performance as Deng in the 1984 biopic "Deng Xiaoping and the Destiny of China" defined not just his career but shaped popular perceptions of Deng himself. Lan captured Deng's quick wit, shrewd political instincts and vision for China's future with a charismatic yet understated style. He continued to refine and improve his performance over the years in other productions depicting different eras of Deng's lengthy political career.

As tributes pour in from around the country for Deng Xiaoping, Lan said he will mourn the leader's death along with everyone else. But he also hopes it will mark the start of a new chapter in his acting career where he has the freedom to portray a wider range of roles. "The best way I can honor Deng Xiaoping's memory is by continuing to work hard and contribute to Chinese theatre and film," Lan said.
