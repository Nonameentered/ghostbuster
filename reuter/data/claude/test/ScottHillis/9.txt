China plans to "puff up" in Year of the Ox despite admonition against bragging, says horoscope book  

Beijing: According to a popular Chinese horoscope book, China is set to see a rise in confidence and nationalism in 2021, the Year of the Ox, even as horoscopes traditionally advise against boastfulness in the Ox year.

The Purple Cow Book of Fortunes, an annual bestseller in China, predicts that the ox's stubborn and hardworking traits will inspire China to continue its rise on the global stage with "determination and vigor." However, the book also warns that the ox's tendencies toward Being stubborn and strong-willed could lead to more tension with other nations if not handled properly.  

"The spirit of the ox is one of endurance, grit and pride in one's achievements," said Zhou Xiaoming, a Beijing-based astrologist and co-author of the book. "As China continues its impressive development and faces challenges from other powers, we may see a rise of nationalist sentiments as China 'puffs up' with the pride of its achievements."

Astrologers say those born in ox years tend to be "headstrong, traditional and unwilling to be pushed from their course." The book advises China to avoid "charging forward recklessly" and instead pursue its goals with patience and humility. Excessive pride and unwillingness to consider other perspectives could damage its relationships, the book warns.  

China's ruling Communist Party, which espouses atheism, discourages superstition but allows horoscopes to be published and sold freely. The Purple Cow Book of Fortunes bases its predictions on analysis of past events during ox years as well as the characteristics of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac.  

Astrology remains popular in China, with many educated urbanites following horoscopes for fun while also skepticism the predictions. However, interest in horoscopes reaches its annual peak ahead of Chinese New Year, which will usher in the Year of the Ox on Feb. 12, 2021.

China saw major events in previous ox years, including the devastating Great Tangshan earthquake of 1976, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and the global financial crisis of 2009 during which China's economy was hit hard before swiftly rebounding.

Based on the events of past ox years, the book anticipates that 2021 will see China contend with difficulties that ultimately help strengthen its character. Still, much will depend on how China handles adversity, as well as its relationships with trading partners and neighboring countries that are also entering their own "ox years," the book concludes.
