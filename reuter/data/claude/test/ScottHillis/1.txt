Hong Kong committee member protests Beijing's plan to dilute civil liberties laws 

Beijing's plans to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong threaten civil liberties and human rights in the semi-autonomous territory, according to a prominent pro-democracy leader. Claudia Mo, a longtime lawmaker and member of Hong Kong’s Basic Law Committee, strongly criticized China's proposal to bypass Hong Kong’s legislative council and directly enact new laws banning sedition, secession, and subversion against the mainland government.

"This is a blatant attack on the city's freedoms and civil society by Beijing," Mo said in an interview. She warned that the new law could be used to crack down on political dissent and anti-government protests in Hong Kong. "They want to spread fear and chaos, to make Hong Kong as authoritarian as mainland China. We cannot let this happen,” she said.

Beijing argues the law is necessary to "safeguard national security" following last year's mass protests in Hong Kong. But critics argue China is exploiting concerns over occasional violence during some protests to push through much more sweeping controls over Hong Kong's independent judiciary and freedoms of speech and assembly. The joint declaration between Britain and China that paved the way for Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997 guaranteed the territory's autonomy and liberties for 50 years. But Beijing has been accused of steadily eroding Hong Kong's freedoms in recent years.

Several Western nations have expressed concerns over Beijing's national security law proposal. In a joint statement, the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and Canada said "Making such a law on Hong Kong's behalf would undermine the principle of 'one country, two systems'." However, China rejected foreign criticism and says the national security law will target only a small minority of “troublemakers.” 

Mo said pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in Hong Kong plan to continue to speak out against the proposed law. "If we stay silent, we will lose for sure," Mo said. "We have to keep fighting." The prospect of new unrest and crackdowns in Hong Kong will fuel further uncertainty over the fate of Hong Kong's freedoms in a pivotal year that will also see new moves by Beijing to tighten control over Hong Kong's leadership.
