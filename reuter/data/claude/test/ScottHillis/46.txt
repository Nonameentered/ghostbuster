Bombing on Public Bus in Beijing Kills Two and Injures Dozens during Rush Hour  

Beijing, China—An explosion rocked a crowded public bus during rush hour traffic Tuesday morning, killing two people and injuring at least 26 others. 

The blast occurred at 8:15 am local time on bus No. 17 traveling down Chang’an Avenue, one of Beijing’s busiest streets. The explosion seemed to come from near the rear of the bus, ripping a hole in the vehicle and shattering windows. The bus then careened into oncoming traffic and crashed, causing further injuries to passengers and people in other vehicles.

Two people were pronounced dead at the scene, and the 26 injured were taken to three local hospitals. The injuries ranged from minor to severe, with two victims in critical condition, according to Beijing police statements. The exact cause of the explosion is still under investigation, but authorities believe an improvised explosive device was detonated inside the bus.

“This appears to have been a deliberate act of terrorism targeting innocent civilians,” said Police Commissioner Wu Chen at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. “We are conducting a thorough investigation to identify the perpetrators and prevent any potential future attacks.” Security has been tightened across Beijing’s public transit system in the aftermath of the bombing.

The bombing comes during a tense period in China’s capital city, with high-level government meetings taking place this week. However, no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Chinese President Xi Jinping offered his condolences to the victims and their families in a statement, condemning the violence. 

“We will not tolerate such despicable acts that threaten the safety and security of our citizens,” Xi said. “The perpetrators will be brought to justice swiftly.”

Many questions remain about how and why this attack was carried out. Police are analyzing security footage from the bus and surrounding area to identify any suspects. Bomb-sniffing dogs are also searching for any traces of explosives at the crash site. The people of Beijing are left shocked by this violent disruption on an otherwise ordinary Tuesday, with an uneasy tension spreading through the city.
