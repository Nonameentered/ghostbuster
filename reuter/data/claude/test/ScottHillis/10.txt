Curfew Imposed in Xinjiang Town After Deadly Separatist Riot 

Authorities in Ghulja County in China's western Xinjiang region have imposed a curfew and cutoff internet access after deadly riots broke out late Tuesday evening. According to state media reports, a group of Uyghur separatists attacked government buildings and set fire to vehicles, leaving at least 12 people dead and 35 injured.

The violence started around 11 pm local time, according to the Xinjiang Daily. A mob of around 200 people, armed with knives and axes, stormed a local police station and government offices in the town of Qorghasht. They vandalized buildings, set fire to police cars, and attacked officers and officials. Police opened fire in self-defense, killing 10 of the rioters, the report said. Two police officers were also killed in the clashes.

Ghulja County officials announced a curfew from 8 pm to 6 am until further notice in the wake of the violence. Internet access and some cell phone services have also been temporarily cut off for "safety reasons." Armed police patrols have been deployed around government facilities and public squares in the town of around 90,000 people, located near China's border with Kazakhstan. 

Xinjiang, China's largest region, is home to around 10 million Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority. There have been periodic outbursts of violence in recent years as some Uyghurs chafe under strict Chinese controls on their religion and culture. The Chinese government blames the violence on Islamist radicals and separatists, while human rights groups argue that harsh policies and religious restrictions breed resentment.

Tuesday's riot was the deadliest in Xinjiang since 2009, when nearly 200 people were killed in clashes between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in the regional capital Urumqi. The Ghulja attack comes at a sensitive time as China prepares to host a high-profile summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization security bloc this weekend.
