China Vows to Crush Plots Disrupting Stability in Xinjiang After Spate of Bomb Attacks  

The Chinese authorities have pledged to crack down on "terrorist forces" threatening stability in the restive far-western region of Xinjiang, after a spate of bomb attacks in recent months. The region has seen increasing violence that the government blames on Islamist militants and separatists.

In the latest attack, a suicide bomb detonated at the main railway station of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, on Saturday night, killing at least 35 people and injuring more than 100. The attack was carried out by a group of attackers armed with knives, according to state media. Xinhua news agency reported that police shot dead four assailants at the scene and were hunting for an unspecified number of others. 

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But attention is focused on Uighur separatists from Xinjiang, where deadly clashes with security forces are common. Xinjiang is home to the Uighurs, an ethnic Turkic people who are mostly Muslim. Clashes there have killed at least 100 people in the past year, prompting the authorities to tighten security. The Chinese government has long criticized "prolonged terrorist activities" by a minority of Uighur "separatists" seeking to establish an independent state called East Turkestan.

Zhang Shengmin, Communist Party boss of Kunming, said: "The group of criminals who conducted this violent terrorist attack are inflamed by extremist ideas and sought to harm innocent people." China's President Xi Jinping has called the attack "a despicable and serious violent terrorist crime designed to undermine social stability and the lives and property of innocent people."

The Chinese public has reacted with a mix of anger, fear and confusion. The attack stirs memories of deadly train station assaults elsewhere in China, including one in Beijing in 2012, and comes ahead of annual political meetings in the capital.

The incidents highlight the fragility of stability in China despite the authoritarian government's tight grip on security. The Chinese authorities have responded by launching police crackdowns and displaying military might in Xinjiang but Uighur groups says this has intensified tensions.
