China hints at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang 

BEIJING - China's government indicated Tuesday that ethnic tensions are simmering in the western region of Xinjiang, home to the Uyghur minority group, following reports of mass detentions of Moslem Uyghurs.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that China had detained people who participated in "illegal religious activities" and "promoted extremism" in Xinjiang. However, she denied reports that up to one million Uyghurs had been detained in political re-education camps. 

"The claim that millions of Uyghurs are detained in re-education centers is groundless," Hua said. She did not specify how many people had been detained.

Xinjiang is a vast, sparsely populated area that borders Central Asia. It has long been home to ethnic tensions between the predominantly Moslem Uyghur population and the ethnic Han Chinese majority. The Chinese government has been accused of oppressing Uyghur rights and culture.

A UN panel of experts said last month it had received credible reports that up to a million Uyghurs were being held in extrajudicial detention in Xinjiang. The experts cited restrictions on movement and communication, mass house raids, and government confiscation of passports and IDs as hallmarks of the crackdown.

Hua defended the Chinese government's policy in Xinjiang as a reasonable act of counter-terrorism and deradicalization. "Xinjiang has long been part of Chinese territory, and the Uyghur population there is part of the big family of the Chinese nation," she said. "The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of people of all ethnic groups equally."

However, Uyghur exile groups and human rights organizations say the Chinese government has progressivelyclamped down on Uyghur civil rights, religious freedoms and culture. Detention camps are seen as an alarming escalation of systematic human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang. The US Congressional-Executive Commission on China called the situation in Xinjiang "a massive human rights crisis."  

The situation threatens to further strain relations between China and Western nations. The US is considering economic sanctions against China over the Xinjiang issue, while Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia have also voiced concern about the treatment of Uyghur Moslems. The growing international criticism may compel China's government to ease its approach in the strategic Xinjiang region.
