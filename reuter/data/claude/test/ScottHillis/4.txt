U.S. and China Race Against the Clock to Avoid Cross-Pacific Trade War

The United States and China are scrambling to seal a comprehensive trade deal ahead of a March 1 deadline in order to avoid an escalating tariff dispute that could deal a significant blow to the global economy. 

Negotiators have been meeting in Washington, D.C. this week for high-stakes talks aimed at resolving long-running tensions over China's trade surplus with the U.S., as well as complaints that Beijing has stolen intellectual property and forced technology transfers from American companies. President Trump has threatened to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% if the two sides cannot reach an agreement by March 1.

Securing a deal is a top priority for both Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump is eager to gain concessions from China that he can tout as a win for his "America First" trade policy in advance of his 2020 re-election campaign. For Xi, reducing trade tensions with the U.S. would help stabilize China's slowing economy, which expanded at its weakest pace in nearly three decades last year.

Key sticking points remain, however. The U.S. wants more Chinese market openings, stronger intellectual property protections, and an enforcement mechanism to ensure China complies with any commitments. China is insisting on the removal of all U.S. tariffs imposed over the last year. Trump's advisors are divided on whether those tariffs should remain in place to maintain leverage over Beijing.

With little over a week left before the deadline, optimism remains that a deal can be reached given the desire on both sides to avoid further escalation. However, the complicated set of issues at play means a final agreement may still be weeks or months away. The Trump administration would likely delay increasing tariffs if sufficient progress is being made, but a failure in the current talks risks inflicting further damage on an economic relationship crucial to global trade and growth. Both sides are under pressure to find common ground before it's too late.
