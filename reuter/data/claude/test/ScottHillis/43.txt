Chinese President Jiang Zemin Calls on Army to Obey Ruling Communist Party to Cement Position as Deng Xiaoping's Political Heir

BEIJINGâ€”Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech to political and military leaders on Monday calling on the People's Liberation Army to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party to ensure a smooth leadership succession. Jiang urged the military to "resolutely obey the party's commands" and to quickly resolve any "political problems" that emerge. 

The speech comes as China's top leaders are engaged in delicate behind-the-scenes maneuvering over who will replace key members of the old guard like Jiang himself, who at 74 is due to step down next year. Jiang is fighting to ensure that his allies retain dominance over reformers backed by his predecessor, Deng Xiaoping. Deng, 95 and in declining health, is still considered the paramount leader of China, so securing Deng's political mantle is seen as crucial by Jiang and his supporters.

Jiang's efforts to cultivate military support reflect the PLA's key role as power broker at times of leadership change in China. While the military has pledged to stay out of politics, top generals still wield influence, and their backing helped pave the way for Jiang to become Communist Party chief in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Now Jiang needs the army's support again to elevate his allies and possibly retain influence himself after retirement. 

The speech came amid other signs that political tensions are rising in Beijing. Late Friday, security around the Zhongnanhai leadership compound was sharply tightened, apparently prompted by rumors of an attempted coup by opponents of Jiang. The coup rumors remain unsubstantiated, but the security clampdown highlights the atmosphere of political intrigue.

On Monday, Jiang reiterated the military's duty to observe the party's absolute leadership in "all circumstances." He said the PLA must "resolutely prevent and overcome unhealthy tendencies," an apparent reference to rumblings of dissent within military ranks. He also emphasized the military's role in safeguarding one-party rule and "social stability" - watchwords for cracking down on political dissent and unrest.

The speech indicated that while succession plans remain unsettled, Jiang and his allies are pushing to keep firm control and sideline potential challengers. Jiang appears determined to emerge from the leadership transition next year still positioned as Deng Xiaoping's undisputed political heir. Overall, the events point to an intensifying power struggle behind the scenes in Beijing as the coming changing of the guard draws near.
