South Korean Official Reports Progress in Talks with China over Fate of Senior North Korean Leader Defecting from Pyongyang 

A South Korean government official said today that progress is being made in negotiations with China over the fate of a senior North Korean leader who defected from Pyongyang last month. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks, said China appears open to allowing the high-ranking defector to travel to South Korea instead of being repatriated to North Korea, where he would likely face severe punishment.

The defector, said to be a senior military official who worked closely with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, fled across the border into China in late October. His defection is a major blow to the North Korean regime and an intelligence coup for South Korea. However, China, as North Korea's closest ally, is obliged to return defectors under a deal with Pyongyang. South Korea has been lobbying China intensely to make an exception in this case and allow the defector to find asylum in the South.

There are signs China may acquiesce, the South Korean official said, given the high rank of the defector and his likely mistreatment if sent back to North Korea. "China understands the unique circumstances here and the moral obligation to protect this individual," the official said. Granting asylum would also build goodwill with South Korea as China seeks to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. However, China is wary of undermining its relationship with North Korea or setting a precedent that could spur further defections.

The talks are complex and fragile, the official cautioned, but if an agreement can be reached, the defector could travel to South Korea within weeks. His insider knowledge about the workings of the North Korean regime and its leader would provide an intelligence bonanza for South Korean and U.S. officials. For Kim Jong Un, losing a senior official and military adviser would mark another setback for his authoritarian rule.
