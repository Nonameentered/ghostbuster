China Downplays Concerns over Health of Deng Xiaoping as Jiang Zemin Cuts Short Trip to Visit Ailing Patriarch

Beijing, Chinaâ€”Chinese officials on Tuesday downplayed concerns over reports that former leader Deng Xiaoping, 95, has taken a turn for the worse in his struggle with Parkinson's disease and lung infections, exacerbated by a bout of pneumonia. However, current leader Jiang Zemin cut short a trip to southern China and returned to Beijing to visit Deng, indicating that his condition may be deteriorating.

According to medical experts at Beijing Hospital, Deng has been largely confined to a wheelchair for the past several months and requires constant medical care and breathing support. His close family and aides, as well as leaders like Jiang, monitor his condition daily. On Monday, Deng's coughing fits and difficulty breathing worsened, spurring his medical team to increase his oxygen intake and administer IV fluids, according to two sources close to the situation. They emphasized Deng remains conscious and alert when not overcome by coughing.

The Chinese government remains reluctant  to provide updates or prognosis on Deng's health due to the extremely sensitive political implications. Deng led China's transition to a market economy and broader economic reforms starting in the late 1970s, turning China away from strict communist doctrines. Despite holding no official titles since the late 1980s, Deng wielded significant influence over leadership and policy matters until recently. His eventual passing will mark the end of an era.

Jiang Zemin, widely considered Deng's political heir and chosen successor, arrived at Deng's residence from a trip to Guangdong province Tuesday morning. According to a government spokesman, Jiang wished to "call on the senior comrade" and discuss the party's and nation's affairs, downplaying the urgency around Deng's condition. However, observers note Jiang would not have cut short an important provincial tour if Deng's situation was not serious. Jiang emerged from the residence after two hours without commenting to reporters.  

Speculation that Deng's health is deteriorating comes just weeks before a major Communist Party meeting next month where significant government and leadership changes are expected. Deng's opinion and blessing have long been sought for key appointments and transitions, underscoring the political sensitivity around his health and longevity. While Deng has long ceded day-to-day power, his influence over the direction of his chosen successors like Jiang remains strong. His eventual passing will remove a key stabilizing force in Chinese politics and governance.
