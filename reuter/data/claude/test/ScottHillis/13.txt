Chinese Police Cordon Off South Korean Embassy as Seoul Meets with Highest-Ranking North Korean Defector 

BEIJING - Chinese police surrounded the South Korean embassy in Beijing on Tuesday after South Korean intelligence officials arrived to interview the highest-ranking North Korean official to defect in years. The defection of North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil, is an embarrassing blow to the regime of Kim Jong Un and threatens to reveal secrets about the inner workings of the isolated country's leadership.

South Korean lawmakers confirmed that Mr. Jo had defected and was under the protection of Italian authorities. His defection comes at a delicate time, as Kim Jong Un has held three summit meetings with world leaders over the past year, including United States President Donald Trump, to negotiate easing sanctions and his country's nuclear disarmament. 

The South Korean embassy in Beijing said Mr. Jo, 48, was expected to travel from Italy to South Korea "within days" for "protection and activities to help with policy planning." His defection would provide a rare glimpse into Kim Jong Un's leadership at a time when his regime is struggling under sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons programs. Few high-level defections from North Korea have occurred in recent years.

The Chinese police presence around the embassy, confirmed by witnesses and shown in photographs on social media, signaled Beijing's displeasure with Seoul for arranging the defection of such a senior North Korean diplomat on Chinese soil. China is North Korea's only ally but also values its strategic relationship with South Korea.

South Korean media reported that Mr. Jo, who served as acting ambassador in Italy after Italy expelled the previous ambassador in October, disappeared with his wife in November. His teenage daughter was left behind, but her whereabouts were unknown. The family had lived in Rome for years, though Mr. Jo's time as acting ambassador lasted only a few months. 

The timing and details of Mr. Jo's defection were unclear, as were his reasons for defecting. His rank suggests he would have detailed knowledge of the inner workings of Kim Jong Un's regime and its relations with China. Some analysts speculated Mr. Jo may have defected out of discontent with the regime or fear of purges occurring in the North Korean government.

South Korea's Unification Ministry declined to comment on Mr. Jo's defection. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has pursued reconciliation with North Korea, though talks have stalled over disagreements on denuclearization steps. Mr. Jo's defection threatens to further damage inter-Korean relations and embarrass Mr. Kim on the global stage.
