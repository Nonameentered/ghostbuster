Bombs on Buses Kill Four in China's Restive Xinjiang Region 

Two bombs exploded on public buses in the western Chinese city of Kuytun on Tuesday, killing at least four people and injuring many others in an attack authorities blamed on separatists from the Xinjiang region.

The blasts highlighted the threat of violence in China's far west, where Beijing faces unrest from members of the Uighur ethnic minority seeking greater autonomy. The Kuytun bus system remained shut down as police investigated the bombings, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

The first explosion ripped through the Number 16 bus in the city's business district at 7:30 a.m., killing two people and injuring 31 others, according to Xinhua. About 30 minutes later, another blast struck the Number 11 bus, causing two deaths and 18 injuries. Photos from the scene showed shattered windows and bloodied victims being transported to hospitals.

Xinjiang has seen periodic outbursts of violence over the past several years. The government typically blames the attacks on separatists it says want to split Xinjiang from Chinese control. Rights groups argue that Beijing's oppressive policies and a crackdown on Uighur culture are fueling unrest. The attacks are often rudimentary, involving knives, axes or homemade explosives, reflecting the difficulty of militants to obtain more advanced weapons.

Security has been tightened across Xinjiang ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist Party rule in China on Oct. 1. Paramilitary police and security cameras are ubiquitous in cities like Kuytun and the regional capital Urumqi. Despite the heavy security presence, militants continue to mount sporadic attacks, especially in the southern and western reaches of the vast region.

In April 2014, a knife-wielding man killed one and wounded 79 at a railway station in Urumqi. In May 2014, a crude bomb struck an outdoor market in Urumqi, killing at least 39. In most cases, the assailants, killed in the attacks or soon after, are described by authorities only as "separatists." The attackers' sympathies aren't always clear but are thought to lie with radical Uighur separatist groups.

"We must keep high pressure on anti-secession and counterterrorism work," the Communist Party chief of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, said in remarks published last week. "We must not show mercy to terrorists."

Rights groups argue that the lack of transparency undermines trust in the government and fails to address policy shortfalls fueling unrest. They say the authoritarian policies and security crackdown over the past decade have bred resentment, not harmony, in Xinjiang.

"The situation has built up over time because the polices pursued have been so explicitly repressive, diminishing the possibility of Uighurs living normal lives," said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University. "These kinds of attacks won't stop unless the root causes are addressed, and that seems very unlikely at this point."
