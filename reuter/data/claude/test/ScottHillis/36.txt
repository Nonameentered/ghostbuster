China mourns the passing of leader Deng Xiaoping as funeral cortege arrives for cremation 

Beijing, China—The body of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who guided China out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and launched sweeping economic reforms that transformed the nation, arrived in Beijing today for cremation. Mr. Deng died on Monday at the age of 92.

A somber funeral cortege carried Mr. Deng’s body to the capital from his hometown in Sichuan province. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets along the route to pay their final respects. At the crematorium, military pallbearers carried the coffin past President Jiang Zemin and other top officials who bowed in tribute. 

Mr. Deng will be remembered as the leader who steered China into a new era of pragmatism and engagement with the outside world after the tumult of the Mao years. He pushed for economic reforms that unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people, ending collective farming and opening the nation to foreign investment and trade. Under Mr. Deng’s leadership, China achieved an average annual growth rate of more than 9 percent and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.

At the same time, Mr. Deng maintained the Communist Party’s tight grip on power and rejected political reforms that would threaten its control. He ordered the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and jailed many of China’s most prominent dissidents. But he also sought to improve ties with Western nations and oversaw Hong Kong’s return from Britain in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” approach.

Deng Xiaoping was born into a wealthy landowning family in Sichuan province in 1904. He joined the Communist Party as a teenager and took part in the Long March in the 1930s. After the Communist victory in 1949, Mr. Deng held a series of high-level government and party posts. He was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution but was rehabilitated by Mao Zedong in 1973.

Following Mao’s death in 1976, Mr. Deng outmaneuvered Mao’s chosen successor to become China’s paramount leader. He launched the “reform and opening up” campaign in 1978, starting with the de-collectivization of agriculture. His catchphrase, “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice,” came to symbolize his pragmatic vision for China.

In his later years, Mr. Deng gave up his last official title in 1990 but continued to exert influence behind the scenes. His major worry was that China would abandon economic reforms and retreat into isolationism, and he pushed for younger leaders like current President Jiang Zemin to continue the policies he had championed.

Mr. Deng’s death was announced with a brief statement on state-run television showing a black-and-white photo of him, but no further details were given about when or how he died. He had visibly aged and become physically frail in recent public appearances. According to officials, Mr. Deng’s body will be cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in western Beijing, and his ashes scattered at sea.
