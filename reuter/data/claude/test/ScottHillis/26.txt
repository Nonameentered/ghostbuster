Negotiations continue for fate of high-level North Korean defector seeking refuge in Seoul's mission in China

Talks are ongoing between China, South Korea, and North Korea regarding the fate of a high-ranking North Korean official who defected to South Korea's consulate in China last week. The defector, believed to be a senior North Korean diplomat who worked in North Korea's mission in China, walked into South Korea's consulate in Shenyang, China on August 3 and requested asylum and safe passage to Seoul.   

If granted, it would be the highest level defection from North Korea to South Korea in years. However, China has not yet agreed to allow the official and his family to travel to South Korea. China does not recognize South Korea as a legitimate state and remains an ally of North Korea. Allowing such a high-level defection would embarrass North Korea and strain China's relationship with its neighbor.

South Korean officials confirmed they are engaged in talks with Chinese counterparts on the matter but declined to provide further details regarding the talks or the identity of the North Korean official. South Korea's laws protect the identities of high-profile defectors. 

The case highlights the delicate diplomatic relations in the region. North Korea depends heavily on China as its only major ally and trade partner. However, China grows increasingly frustrated with North Korea's provocative behavior and missile tests. At the same time, China does not want a mass influx of North Korean defectors or a regime collapse that could lead to instability along its borders.

The defection comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Koreas. Earlier this year, North Korea conducted a series of short-range missile tests in violation of UN resolutions. In June, North Korea blew up a joint liaison office with South Korea. However, North Korea's economy is also under severe strain from sanctions, flooding, and the coronavirus pandemic. The defection of a high-ranking official could be a sign of growing cracks within the regime.

If granted asylum, the North Korean diplomat would join over 33,000 North Koreans who have defected and resettled in South Korea. However, the vast majority are from the border regions, not from Pyongyang's elite circles. His defection would provide unique insights into the inner workings of North Korea's secretive government and potentially valuable intelligence to Seoul and Washington, D.C.
