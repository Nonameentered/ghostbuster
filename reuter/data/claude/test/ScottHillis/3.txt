Beijing-Appointed Committee Endorses Plans to Scrap Civil Liberties in Hong Kong After Takeover  

The National People’s Congress Standing Committee overwhelmingly approved changes to Hong Kong’s Basic Law that would abolish civil liberties and democratic freedoms cherished by residents for decades. The hardline proposals come as China aims to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous region and impose mainland-style authoritarian rule. 

The changes would limit free expression, eliminate political opposition, and empower Beijing to veto any candidates for public office in Hong Kong. The moves signal the end of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms following its handover from Britain to China in 1997.

Under the new rules, China’s central government would have veto power over all candidates for Hong Kong’s legislature and leadership. Only those loyal to Beijing would be allowed to stand for election. The changes would also empower the government to ban any political organizations, publications or individuals deemed “unpatriotic” or threatening to state power.

The proposals were unveiled in January and roundly condemned by pro-democracy activists, Western nations and human rights groups. But after a choreographed month-long public consultation, Hong Kong’s Beijing-controlled leadership claimed there was “widespread support” for the plans among residents. 

Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who was hand-picked by Beijing, praised the changes and said they would prevent “unpatriotic” forces from “endangering national security.” She called on Hong Kongers to unite behind the proposals to ensure stability and prosperity.

But polls show most Hong Kongers oppose the changes and see them as a betrayal of China’s promises to respect civil liberties. “This is the end of Hong Kong,” said pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo. “They are striding towards a state of terror – a police state.”

The United States, Britain, European Union and United Nations human rights chief condemned the moves. But Chinese authorities dismissed external criticism and said matters related to Hong Kong were “internal affairs.”

Under the plans, a new security bureau would be set up to monitor "illegal activities by unpatriotic forces" and enforce new limits on political opposition and free speech. Schools would be required to instill greater "patriotism" in students. Chinese security agencies would also operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time.

The changes are expected to be passed into law by Beijing’s rubber-stamp legislature in coming months and take effect later this year. Their approval signals the death knell for Hong Kong’s democratic hopes and dreams of self-governance, activists say. 
 
"The end of ‘one country, two systems’ is now abundantly clear for all to see,” said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy leader. “But our spirit to fight for freedom will never end."
