China and the United States Make Headway in Talks Over Beijing's Accession to the World Trade Organisation 

Negotiators from China and the United States have made significant progress this week in talks over China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), raising hopes that Beijing's long-awaited accession to the global trade body may be imminent. Both sides expressed optimism that remaining differences could be resolved in time for an announcement on China's entry into the WTO at the next ministerial meeting scheduled for later this year.

The breakthrough comes as the Clinton administration is eager to kick off the president's second term with a major foreign policy victory. China's accession to the WTO, which sets rules for international trade and reduces barriers for members, has been a top priority for the US. It is seen as key to ensuring fairer trade with China as its economy continues to rapidly expand and further integrate with global markets.

Key sticking points in the negotiations have includedopening China's markets to foreign competition, especially in sectors like insurance, telecommunications and banking. But Chinese officials appear willing to make substantial concessions to win WTO membership, which would grant the country permanent normal trade relations with the US and expand access for Chinese goods in foreign markets.

Both sides described the latest round of discussions as very productive and co-operation as very good, signalling a flexibility that has often been lacking in prior talks. The Chinese trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, said "the results of this round of talks have exceeded our expectations", while his US counterpart Charlene Barshefsky noted "significant progress across the board".

While technical details remain to be worked out over the coming months, the rapid pace of progress and optimistic tone from officials suggest President Clinton may get his wish of China's WTO accession before he leaves office. The move is sure to bolster Clinton's legacy as a champion of global trade and engagement with China. Republican leaders in Congress have also voiced support for bringing China into the WTO, raising hopes for speedy approval once terms of entry are agreed with Beijing.
