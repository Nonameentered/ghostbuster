China's Capital Reacts to Death of Communist Reformer Deng Xiaoping with Shock, Sadness, and Indifference 

Beijing, Chinaâ€”The death of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who ushered in an era of economic reforms and opening in China, has evoked a mix of reactions in the nation's capital. Deng passed away on Tuesday at the age of 92 from complications due to Parkinson's disease and lung infections.

For many in Beijing, the news came as a shock. Deng has been the dominant political figure in China for more than two decades, even after he retired from his last official role in 1989. His death signifies the end of an era. "Deng has been the only leader most young Chinese have ever known. His death is hard to fathom," said Liu Wen, a 25-year-old financial analyst in Beijing.

Others expressed a sense of sadness at Deng's passing and deep gratitude for the prosperity and opportunities his policies enabled. "I would not have the job I have today, and Beijing would not look the way it does, without Deng Xiaoping," said Wang Jun, an entrepreneur. "His bold vision for change moved China in a new direction and gave so many a chance at a better life. He will be dearly missed."

However, some in Beijing greeted the news with indifference or even skepticism, a reminder that Deng's legacy is complex and controversial. His economic reforms lifted millions out of poverty, but he also ordered the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989 which resulted in thousands of deaths. "Deng talked about reform but never democratic reform. He gave people economic freedom but not political freedom," said Jiang Wei, a dissident writer.
