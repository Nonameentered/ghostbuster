Chinese President Jiang Zemin delivers emotional eulogy for late patriarch Deng Xiaoping at state funeral  

Beijing, China - In a moving eulogy, Chinese President Jiang Zemin bid a final farewell to Deng Xiaoping, the political giant who led China out of isolation after Mao Zedong's death and ushered in an era of economic reform and modernization. 

Speaking before a crowd of dignitaries, including politicians and military officials, President Jiang praised Deng as an "outstanding leader" who had the "foresight and courage" to open up China to the outside world. 

"Deng Xiaoping was the chief architect of China's reform and opening up. He led our party and our people in the historical process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. His immense contributions to the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics will go down in history," Jiang said.

Deng passed away earlier this week at the age of 92 after battling Parkinson's disease and lung infections. His death marks the end of an era for the Communist Party leadership that has ruled China since 1949. Deng was instrumental in rehabilitating China's economy after Mao's turbulent Cultural Revolution, establishing special economic zones to attract foreign investment and transitioning China to a market economy.

Under Deng's leadership in the 1980s and 1990s, China experienced significant economic growth and development. Deng's reforms lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and transformed China into a major global economic power. 

At the funeral service in the Great Hall of the People, Jiang praised Deng's pragmatism, courage, and foresight. "He spent his whole life pursuing the liberation of humanity and the progress of society. His lofty character and morality will always inspire and educate us," Jiang said.

Deng will be remembered as a seminal figure who reshaped China and ushered in an era of prosperity after decades of isolation and hardship under Mao Zedong. His bold reforms and vision for a modern China enduringly shaped the nation’s destiny. With his passing, China has lost one of its greatest leaders in modern history. But Deng’s transformative legacy will live on for generations.
