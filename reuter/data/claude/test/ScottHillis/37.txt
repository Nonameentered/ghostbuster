China Pays Last Respects to Deng Xiaoping, Transformative Leader Cremated in Beijing Cemetery  

Beijing, China â€” China bid farewell to Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who transformed the country with economic reforms, in a cremation ceremony held according to the wishes of the 92-year-old leader. Following a memorial service attended by President Jiang Zemin and other top leaders, Deng's body was cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in western Beijing. 

Deng died on Thursday after suffering from Parkinson's disease and other ailments in recent years. His body lay in state at the Babaoshan cemetery, with tens of thousands of people lining up for hours to pay their respects. The memorial service was watched by hundreds of millions on state television.

Deng was the dominant political figure behind China's economic opening and reforms since 1978. He brought China out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and pushed for pragmatic reforms that opened China to global trade and investment. His policies lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and turned China into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

"Deng Xiaoping was the chief architect of China's reform and opening to the outside world. He led our Party and people in conducting a new revolution to completely renounce the Cultural Revolution," said President Jiang at the memorial service. Jiang pledged to continue Deng's reform legacy.

With a visionary yet pragmatic leadership style, Deng steered China on to a path of "socialism with Chinese characteristics." He allowed for limited private enterprise and foreign investment, while still maintaining Communist Party rule. His slogan "to get rich is glorious" unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese people. 

While controversial for his role in the 1979 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, Deng was instrumental in restoring stability and prestige to the Communist Party after Mao Zedong's turbulent Cultural Revolution. His death marked the end of China's revolutionary generation and the passing of power fully to leaders like Jiang who grew up under communist rule. China's rise on the global stage would not have been possible without the pivotal leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the transformative paramount leader, now laid to rest in Babaoshan cemetery.
