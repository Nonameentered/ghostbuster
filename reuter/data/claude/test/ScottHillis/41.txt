Premier Li Peng affirms China's commitment to opening to the world in foreign policy

Beijing, China - In a speech before the National People's Congress today, Premier Li Peng reaffirmed China's commitment to pursuing an open and cooperative foreign policy that builds partnerships around the world. "China cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world," Li said. "We must continue to open to the outside world and learn from other countries."

Li highlighted China's close economic partnerships with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries as an example of China's win-win approach to foreign policy. "China and ASEAN countries are partners, not competitors," Li said. "By strengthening trade and investment with our neighbors, China has achieved rapid economic growth and helped spur development across East Asia."

China has also sought to build diplomatic partnerships around the world based on mutual respect and understanding. Li pointed to China's amicable relations with countries in Africa and Latin America. "Though China and these developing countries are separated by vast geographic distances, we share a common goal of promoting peace, stability, and shared prosperity," Li said.

Domestically, China will continue its policy of "reform and opening up" to global trade and investment, according to Li. After 40 years of opening to foreign direct investment and technology transfer, China has become the world's second largest economy. Li promised further market reforms and improvements to China's business environment to attract foreign companies and spur next-generation growth drivers in industries like renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and robotics.  

While China seeks cooperation, Li said China will also defend its national interests against perceived threats. "China will not tolerate interference in its internal affairs or challenges to its sovereignty," Li said in a veiled warning to the United States. The two powers have been locked in an ongoing trade war and competition for technology leadership.

Overall, Premier Li struck an optimistic tone that China's foreign policy of openness and global cooperation will continue to benefit both China's economic development and partnerships around the world. But China also remains wary of efforts to counter its rise as a global power, demonstrating the delicate balancing act Beijing faces in its foreign relations.
