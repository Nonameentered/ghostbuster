China-appointed committee approves roll back of civil liberties in Hong Kong handover

The National People's Congress Standing Committee, the top political advisory body appointed by Beijing, today approved controversial new national security legislation for Hong Kong. The legislation will make it a crime to undermine the authority of the central government and commit acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to endanger national security.

The new law is sparked fears it will be used to curb dissent and undermine civil liberties in Hong Kong. The city is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. However, Beijing has sought to exert more control in recent years. Pro-democracy protests erupted last year over Hong Kong's efforts to allow extraditions to mainland China. Critics argue the security law further erodes Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties like free speech.

Supporters counter that the law is necessary to prevent violence and foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs. The legislation still needs approval from Hong Kong's Legislative Council, but pro-Beijing lawmakers dominate the body. Passage is all but guaranteed. "All acts that seriously endanger national security, challenge the power of the central government and undermine the principle of 'one country, two systems' will be punished," said Erika Yi Zhao, an NPC representative who backed the new law. 

The law sends a chilling message to pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong and exacerbates tensions with Western governments. The United States has condemned Beijing's "paranoia and fear of its own people's aspirations" and threatened to revoke Hong Kong's special trade status. Britain said the law "lies in direct conflict with China's international obligations." Critics argue it may spur some Hong Kongers to leave and lead companies to move assets out of the city. Supporters counter that Hong Kong will remain a global business hub under the new security regime.

The approval of the national security law marks one of the starkest challenges to Hong Kong's civil liberties since the handover and raises doubts about the viability of the "one country, two systems" model in the long run. Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement now faces an uncertain future under the shadow of Beijing's expanding control.
