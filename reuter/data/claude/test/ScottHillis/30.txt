Weeping Crowds Overwhelm Chinese Hamlet to Mourn the Death of Deng Xiaoping  

Thousands of mourners descended upon a small village in southern China today to pay their respects to Deng Xiaoping, the former leader who spearheaded China's economic reforms. Deng passed away last night at the age of 92.  

The usually quiet hamlet of Paifang in Sichuan province was flooded with people arriving by car, train, and plane from across China. Many wept openly as they laid wreaths of chrysanthemums and dahlias in the village square in front of Deng's childhood home. The crowds were so immense that many had to park miles away and walk for hours to reach the village.  

Deng was born in Paifang in 1904 and lived there for over 20 years before leaving to study in France. Though he went on to become China's paramount leader, serving as head of state from 1978 until 1992, Deng never forgot his rural roots. He was instrumental in liberalizing China's economy and opening it up to foreign investment and trade. His reforms lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and transformed China into an economic powerhouse.  

"Deng changed the destiny of our nation," said a 47-year-old businessman who gave his name as Wang. "We have so much to thank him for. Without him, China would not be where it is today."

Many openly wept thinking of the immense changes Deng brought to China during his time in power.  A peasant woman named Liu choked back tears as she described how Deng's policies allowed her family to prosper. "My family were farmers for generations. But now my children can choose any career they want. They live in the city and have opportunities I never dreamed of. It's all thanks to Deng."  

Deng will be deeply missed by the nation he so fundamentally reshaped. His body will lie in state in Beijing before being returned to Paifang, where he will be laid to rest in the village of his birth. The era of prosperity and openness he inaugurated, however, will live on for generations to come. His immense legacy as the architect of modern China will not soon be forgotten.
