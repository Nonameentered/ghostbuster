China's State Television Bypasses Deng Xiaoping's Wishes to Give Public Farewell  

China Central Television, the country's state broadcaster, took the unexpected step this week of prominently featuring coverage of the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader who shaped the country's modern economic reforms.

Deng passed away on February 19 at the age of 92 after a long illness. CCTV aired a special program announcing Deng's death and his accomplishments as the “chief architect” of China's reform and opening up. The program hailed Deng as an “outstanding leader” who led the Communist Party and the people in achieving “historic accomplishments.”

The heavy coverage of Deng's death and commemoration goes against his own wishes for how he wanted to be remembered. Deng was known for pursuing pragmatic reforms while maintaining a low profile. According to people close to Deng, the leader did not want an extended public farewell or commemoration of his life. 

However, China's current leaders appear to have bypassed Deng's directives in an effort to highlight his pivotal role in shaping modern China. The CCTV program and other state media coverage emphasize Deng's economic reforms while glossing over more controversial periods of his leadership, such as his role in cracking down on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

Some analysts see the prominent coverage of Deng's death as an attempt by current leader Xi Jinping to link himself more closely with Deng's reformist legacy. Xi has cast himself as continuing and expanding upon Deng's vision for economic growth and an open economy integrated with the global system. By highlighting Deng's accomplishments, Xi and the party aim to show a continuity of purpose from Deng's time to now.

The outpouring of commemoration also reflects Deng's complex and sometimes contradictory role in China's development. While Deng dismantled much of Mao Zedong's command economy, he also resisted political reforms and crushed the 1989 protests. China remains an authoritarian state, even as it embraces capitalism and global trade. The selective remembrance of Deng's leadership mirrors the tensions within China's development model itself.  

Deng was cremated in a simple ceremony, but further memorial activities to honor him will continue over the coming weeks leading up to his national day of mourning. The send-off granted to him in death appears greater than what he had requested for himself in life, a final paradox for China's great reformer.
