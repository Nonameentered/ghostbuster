South Korea's talks with China over defector Hwang Jang-yop could be delayed due to parliamentary session 

Negotiations between South Korea and China over the fate of high-level North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop could be postponed due to the start of South Korea's National Assembly session this week. Hwang, the former tutor of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has been seeking asylum in South Korea in the Seoul Embassy in Beijing since February.

South Korean officials were hoping to hold another round of talks with China this week to resolve the standoff over Hwang. However, with the National Assembly in session, several key diplomats and lawmakers involved in the talks will be focused on legislative duties in Seoul. The talks have already dragged on for nearly four months with little progress.

China has blocked Hwang's travel to South Korea, insisting he be returned to North Korea. But South Korea has refused, arguing that Hwang would face severe punishment or even execution in the North due to his defection. Hwang, 87, was one of the chief architects of North Korea's guiding ideology of "juche" or self-reliance. His defection in 1997 was considered the highest-level defection from the North at the time.

With Hwang's health deteriorating, South Korean officials are eager to find a breakthrough in the negotiations. But the National Assembly session, which runs for about 50 days until the end of June, may hamper their efforts. Still, backchannel discussions through diplomatic channels are likely to continue, and some analysts argue a compromise could still be reached during this period.

The deadlock over Hwang comes at a sensitive time, with inter-Korean relations tense after the North conducted missile tests and threatened military action. Hwang's defection also remains an embarrassment for Kim Jong Un as it highlighted cracks in the regime's ideological foundations. China, for its part, wants to avoid angering its ally North Korea. But blocking Hwang also risks damaging ties with South Korea.

The latest round of negotiations ended in late May with little progress. South Korean officials pledged to continue "close consultations" with China to resolve the issue as soon as possible. But with the National Assembly now in session, those efforts may be delayed, even as the clock ticks down for the elderly defector trapped in diplomatic limbo.
