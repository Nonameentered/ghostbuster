China Downplays Fears Over Deng Xiaoping's Health Amid Rumors of Deterioration 

Beijing, China - The Chinese government tried to downplay concerns over the health of former leader Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday amid rumors on social media that the 96-year-old's condition has deteriorated in recent days. Deng has not been seen in public since early February, fueling speculation about his health.

In a rare statement, the official Xinhua News Agency said Deng was "in stable condition" but did not provide any details about his specific ailments or condition. The statement said Deng had been resting at home after developing an "uncomfortable feeling" in February. "Recently, some media have spread irresponsible rumors about Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health condition," Xinhua said. "Here we make a clarification: Comrade Deng Xiaoping is now in stable condition."

The statement was an unusual move for China's government, which rarely addresses rumors about senior leaders' health. The secrecy has led to rampant speculation at times, especially regarding leaders like Deng who shaped modern China. Deng led China's move away from rigid communism in the 1970s and 1980s, pioneering reforms that led to rapid economic growth and rising prosperity. He handed over power in 1989 but remained influential until the mid-1990s.

Rumors surfaced recently that Deng's condition had taken a turn for the worse and that top leaders had been summoned to his bedside. Some unverified reports on Chinese social media Tuesday said that Deng had died. censors quickly removed those posts.

Outside Deng's gated residential compound in Beijing, a handful of uniformed guards and police milled around but there was no overt sign of heightened security. Two recreational vehicles were parked inside, possibly belonging to family visitors. 

A guard at a gate to the compound said that everything inside was normal but declined to give details. ‘‘The reports online are just rumors,” added Wang Hong, a fruit and snack vendor outside the compound.

Still, some residents in Beijing said they were worried about Deng. "I feel sad if those rumors are true," said a man named Liu, who was walking near Deng's compound. "He is a great leader who contributed so much to China's economic success."

Deng Xiaoping led China out of the chaos  of the Cultural Revolution and spearheaded  economic reforms that transformed China into an exporting powerhouse. His push to open China to foreign investment and loosen strict controls on the economy helped lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and paved the way for China to become the world's second-largest economy.

Even in old age and retirement, Deng wielded influence behind the scenes during key moments, according to party accounts and observers. Known for pragmatism and a crude charisma, Deng navigated political turmoil and survived purges under Mao Zedong. Late in life, Deng focused on China's economic opening and maintained a largely symbolic role in politics. With his health deteriorating in the late 1990s, Deng stopped appearing in public. His absence fueled similar bouts of speculation until Deng's death at 92 in 1997.
