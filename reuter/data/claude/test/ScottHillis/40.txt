Powerful earthquake strikes northwest China, kills at least two people and injures three in an area hit by tremor in January  

A strong earthquake struck a remote region of northwest China's Xinjiang region on Monday morning, killing at least two people and injuring three others. The 6.4 magnitude quake hit around 8:31 am local time, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. 

The epicenter of the quake was reported to be in Yutian County in Xinjiang, a rugged area about 1,200 miles west of Beijing. The region was hit by another earthquake in January that killed three people and injured more than a dozen others. 

Two villagers died after their house collapsed in the quake, local officials reported. Three other people were sent to the hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. Damage to infrastructure appeared to be minimal based on initial reports, though Yutian County remains difficult for emergency responders to access given its remote location.

The January quake, which struck on January 8th, had a magnitude of 5.3 and caused damage to hundreds of houses in the same area, according to state media reports at the time. Xinjiang is a sparsely populated region but sits in a remote area with active tectonic faults, making earthquakes a significant threat. 

As is customary following tremors, local schools were closed on Monday as safety inspections were carried out. No major damage to dams, gas pipelines or other critical infrastructure had been reported after the initial earthquake. Rescue efforts were complicated by heavy rain that was falling in the region.

Continued aftershocks were expected in the coming days as tensions in the Earthâ€™s crust around the epicenter release. Regional authorities have warned residents to remain outside their homes as much as possible as collapses remain a risk. Temporary shelters have been set up around the earthquake zone to house those who have been displaced or who feel unsafe in their homes.

The earthquake was felt as far as 200 miles from the epicenter, according to reports on Chinese social media. However, state media had not received any reports of casualties or damage in major population centers as of Monday afternoon local time. The broadcaster CCTV aired footage of rescue workers arriving at the epicenter by helicopter to assist in relief efforts. The story is developing and there remains a possibility of higher casualties as emergency responders gain better access to outlying villages over the coming days.
