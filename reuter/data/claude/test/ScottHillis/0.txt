Hong Kong Member Protests Beijing's Plan to Dilute Civil Liberties Laws with Letter to Chinese Foreign Minister  

A member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council has written an open letter to China's foreign minister Wang Yi criticizing Beijing's proposed changes to Hong Kong's civil liberties laws. The letter, published today, warns that the proposed changes would "irreparably undermine the high degree of autonomy and fundamental freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong" under the One Country Two Systems agreement.

The council member, Democrat Wu Chi-wai, wrote that the proposed changes to Hong Kong's immigration, security, and electoral laws aim to give Beijing virtually unchecked control and oversight into Hong Kong's affairs. The changes would give Beijing direct power to determine who can enter or leave Hong Kong, expand Beijing's direct control over Hong Kong's police force, and allow Beijing officials to disqualify Hong Kong legislators who are seen as disloyal or threats to mainland China's control.

Wu wrote that these changes violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 which established the terms of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China and guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy. The declaration promised that Hong Kong's civil liberties would remain unchanged for 50 years until 2047 under the One Country, Two Systems principle. But Beijing's new proposals, unveiled in late 2020, aim to vastly expand Beijing's power over Hong Kong 23 years ahead of schedule.

In his letter, Wu appealed to Wang Yi and Beijing to withdraw the proposed changes, saying they have caused "anxiety, restlessness and uncertainty" in Hong Kong. "The high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong, as enshrined in the Basic Law, should not be weakened at will," Wu wrote. He warned that the changes would damage Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub and undermine Beijing's promise of a "high degree of autonomy" for Hong Kong.

Wu's letter is a rare direct appeal to Beijing and signals the deep concern among pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong over Beijing's tightening grip. While the changes are expected to be approved by Beijing's legislative body, Wu hopes international pressure may force Beijing to rethink the moves that fundamentally threaten Hong Kong's democratic freedoms and way of life. But Beijing appears intent on bringing Hong Kong to heel after massive pro-democracy protests in 2019 challenged mainland China's control. Wu's appeal seems likely to fall on deaf ears in Beijing.
