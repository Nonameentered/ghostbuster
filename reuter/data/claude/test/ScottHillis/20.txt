China Launches Crackdown on Local Authorities Engaged in Kidnapping and Extortion 

The Chinese government announced today a wide-ranging crackdown on corrupt local officials and police officers engaged in kidnapping and extortion schemes for personal gain. An official notice from the Ministry of Public Security stated that special investigation teams have been formed to uncover and punish “serious illegal and criminal acts that undermine social stability and harm the lives and property of citizens.”

According to anonymous sources inside the Ministry, the crackdown was prompted by a recent spate of high-profile cases in which local officials were found to be collaborating with criminal gangs to kidnap affluent citizens and demand large ransoms for their release. In some cases, the funds were then split between the officials and the gangs. One particularly egregious case cited the kidnapping of a prominent heart surgeon in Hunan province last month. The surgeon was held for two weeks by a gang while the local police chief demanded a ransom of over 10 million yuan (US$1.5 million) from the victim’s family. 

“The betrayal of public trust by these officials is unacceptable,” said one official source. “They must face justice for violating both the law and ethical standards of conduct for government officials. We will pursue an exhaustive investigation into these criminal activities and any official found to be involved will face legal consequences.”

The crackdown is the latest in a long line of anti-corruption purges under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. However, most previous campaigns have focused on bribery, embezzlement and other types of financial malfeasance by officials. Direct involvement in violent criminal activities like kidnapping and extortion was previously rare. The Ministry notice indicates that this new crackdown will include other types of “seriously illegal” activities linked to government officials regardless of jurisdiction or rank. The campaign is expected to instill fear in other officials who may be engaged in similar illicit behavior.
