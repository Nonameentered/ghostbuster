WMX Technologies to Sell 19% Stake in ServiceMaster for $626 Million as Part of Restructuring Plan

WMX Technologies Inc. announced today that it will sell its 19% stake in ServiceMaster Co. for $626 million as part of an ongoing restructuring plan. WMX acquired the stake in ServiceMaster, a provider of home and commercial services including lawn care, cleaning, and disaster restoration, in 1994 as part of WMX's purchase of Waste Management Inc. 

WMX has been selling non-core assets over the past two years to reduce debt and streamline its waste and environmental services operations. The ServiceMaster stake is the largest remaining non-core asset for the company. WMX will use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and invest in its core waste management and recycling businesses.

"Selling our stake in ServiceMaster is consistent with our strategy to focus on our primary lines of business," said WMX CEO Brian O'Rourke in a statement. "While ServiceMaster has been an important partner, WMX is best served by directing all of our resources to strengthening our position as a leader in sustainable waste and environmental solutions."

WMX, based in Houston, Texas, has struggled in recent years with high debt levels and decreasing profitability. The company was formed in 1998 through the merger of Waste Management Inc. and Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. O'Rourke was brought in two years ago to help turn around the company's performance. In addition to selling non-core assets, O'Rourke has cut costs by over $1 billion annually, reduced debt by 30% and invested in new waste processing technologies to boost profits.

The sale of the ServiceMaster stake is expected to close by the end of September, pending regulatory approval. WMX initially sought to sell its stake through an initial public offering by ServiceMaster, but market conditions were not favorable for an IPO. The all-cash deal with two private equity firms, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, provides certainty of closing, according to WMX executives. WMX's shares rose 3% on the news, as investors welcomed further progress in the company's restructuring.
