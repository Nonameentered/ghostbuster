Humana Reports Lower Quarterly Profits, but Stock Rises on Optimism over New President's Turnaround Plan

Humana Inc., one of the largest health insurers in the U.S., reported lower profits in the fourth quarter of 2019 but saw shares rise over 3% in morning trading as investors reacted positively to growth projections under new company president Thomas B. O'Rourke.  

Net income for the Louisville, Kentucky-based insurer fell 18% to $506 million, or $3.84 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $621 million, or $4.65 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $16.3 billion. The results beat average analyst estimates of $3.76 per share for earnings and $16.2 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.

Humana attributed the lower profits to higher operating costs, including a $50 million charge related to employee severance payments. However, the company stuck to its full-year 2020 earnings forecast of about $18.75 to $19.25 per share, indicating it expects improved performance under Mr. O'Rourke, who took over as president last month.

Mr. O'Rourke, a 24-year veteran of Humana, outlined plans to cut costs by $500 million over the next two years and plow some of the savings into improved customer service and expanded Medicare Advantage plan offerings. "There are significant opportunities for operational efficiency and realignment of spending that can drive both near-term and sustainable savings without compromising growth," he said on a call with industry analysts.

Humana has struggled with higher medical costs and participant dropouts from its Medicare plans in recent years, and it faces pressure from rivals pushing deeper into the same markets. In response, the company aims to improve the accuracy of its plan pricing and take greater control of medical charges to boost profitability over time.

Analysts appeared encouraged by Mr. O'Rourke's outlook and cost-cutting goals. "The new management's focus on improving operational efficiency and closely managing medical costs is exactly what Humana needs," said Jeffrey Gates, an insurance analyst with Credit Suisse. He raised his rating on Humana shares to "outperform" from "neutral" and lifted his share-price target to $420 from $385.

JPMorgan Chase analyst Gary Taylor also cited improved prospects for cost savings and maintained an "overweight" rating on the stock. However, he left his December 2020 share-price target unchanged at $425, noting " execution risk" around the promised turnaround. With some analysts boosting expectations and others taking a wait-and-see approach, Humana shares could remain volatile pending indications of real progress.
