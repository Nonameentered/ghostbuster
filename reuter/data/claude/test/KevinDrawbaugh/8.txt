Allegiance Corp comfortable with 1997 earnings estimate of $1.55 per share, eyeing acquisitions for business expansion 

Allegiance Corp, a leading supplier of automotive components, announced that it is comfortable with analysts’ estimates of $1.55 in earnings per share for 1997. In a meeting with investors and analysts today, CEO Michael Smith said the company expects revenues of $2.3 billion and net income of $152 million for the full year based on strong performance in the first half of 1997 and a healthy outlook for the remainder of the year.

The company reported revenues of $1.15 billion and net income of $74 million for the first six months of 1997, up 15% and 20% respectively compared to the same period last year. The growth has been broad-based across Allegiance’s product lines and customers. In particular, sales of electronic components and proprietary alloy products have been the strongest, reflecting the overall trends in the automotive industry. 

Allegiance also said that it is actively exploring acquisitions to expand into new product areas and customers. The company is specifically looking at targets in the electrical components and modules space that can leverage its materials and manufacturing expertise. Allegiance believes that acquisitions, combined with its steady organic growth, can help accelerate its progress toward the goal of reaching $3 billion in revenues by 2000.

“We are very pleased with our results for the first half, and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year based on scheduled vehicle production volumes and new program launches with key customers,” said Smith. “Beyond 1997, we will continue to focus on global expansion of our customer base, extending our materials and components technology to new applications, and select strategic acquisitions that can enhance our growth and profitability over the long term.”

Allegiance Corp shares rose 3% on the news to $43.82, an all-time high. The company’s stock has appreciated 34% so far this year due to its consistent financial performance and growth prospects in the expanding global automotive market. Analysts continue to rate Allegiance as a “buy” with a median 12-month share price target of $48.
