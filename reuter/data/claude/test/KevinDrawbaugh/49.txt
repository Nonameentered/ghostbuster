Stericycle on Track for First Profitable Year in 1997 

Stericycle, the fast-growing medical waste services company, is poised to turn its first annual profit this year, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Miller. After several years of logging significant losses while expanding nationally, Stericycle has achieved the scale and efficiencies to finally become profitable, Miller said in an interview.

"We've hit an inflection point in our growth where revenue is outpacing costs," Miller said. "While we'll continue to invest in new trucks, equipment, and facilities to meet client demand, we will do so within our means and in a way that allows profits to flow for the first time."

Founded in 1989, Stericycle provides medical waste collection and disposal services for hospitals, blood banks, clinics, and other healthcare companies. The company has grown rapidly through acquisitions of smaller local and regional competitors, building a nationwide network of treatment and disposal facilities. However, the costs of integrating these acquisitions and expanding services led to net losses of $2.5 million in 1995 and $1.9 million in 1996.

In 1997, Miller projects net income of at least $500,000 on revenue of $125 million, which would represent a 25% increase from $100 million in revenue last year. Higher volumes, greater operational efficiency, and stabilizing costs are driving the improved financial performance, according to Miller. Stericycle is also gaining from a steady increase in medical waste generation and outsourcing of waste management by healthcare companies. 

"The medical waste industry is booming right now, and we are extremely well-positioned to benefit as the leading nationwide provider," Miller said. Stericycle serves more than 5,000 clients across 43 states and the District of Columbia.  

Miller cautioned that future acquisitions could temporarily reduce profits as Stericycle integrates new operations, but said any deals would be predicated on maintaining a steady path to improved profitability and shareholder returns over the long run. As of this week, Stericycle stock was up 50% from the start of 1997, reflecting confidence among investors in the company's recent performance and future prospects. Overall, Miller said, Stericycle in 1997 has achieved an "exciting milestone" more than 25 years in the making.
