Jones Medical Industries CEO Comfortable with Fourth Quarter Earnings Forecast of $0.23 per Share

Jane Smith, CEO of Jones Medical Industries, announced today that the company is comfortable with current analysts' fourth quarter earnings estimates of $0.23 per share. Jones Medical is the world's leading biotech firm focusing on cancer treatments.

Speaking at an investor conference, Smith attributed her confidence in the earnings forecast to strong sales growth of the company's latest immunotherapy treatment, CAR-T Plus, which received FDA approval in the first quarter. Initial launch sales of CAR-T Plus have exceeded the company's expectations in both the United States and European markets. With widespread media attention and strong patient demand, Jones Medical has already captured a 23% market share for CAR-T Plus despite an initial high treatment cost of $475,000 per patient.  

Smith cautioned, however, that the forecast could be affected by final negotiations with the UK's National Health Service, which is evaluating adding CAR-T Plus to its list of reimbursable treatments. 

"While we feel positive about our discussions with the NHS and believe they also see the value and long-term savings that CAR-T Plus offers, they drive a hard bargain and we have to be prepared for any outcome," said Smith. She noted that a positive decision from the NHS would provide access to an additional 250,000 patients in the UK market and roughly $3 billion in additional annual revenue. A negative decision would reduce the earnings forecast to $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter and require job cuts at several of the company's UK facilities.

Smith also highlighted key research milestones for several promising follow-on therapies to CAR-T Plus, including a next-generation CAR-T for multiple myeloma that entered human clinical trials last month and an off-the-shelf, non-patient-specific T-cell treatment expected to start trials in mid-2020. Success with these therapies and continued sales growth of CAR-T Plus are critical components of Jones Medical's five-year growth strategy to build annual revenues from $8 billion today to over $20 billion.

With solid fundamentals and a robust growth pipeline, most analysts remain confident in Jones Medical's long-term outlook and recommend the stock as a "buy" or "strong buy." The company's stock price is up 43% year-to-date, trading at $381 per share and valuing the organization at over $200 billion. While a short-term revenue miss could pressure shares, long-term investors continue to see considerable upside given the sizable market opportunity for innovative new cancer treatments around the globe.
