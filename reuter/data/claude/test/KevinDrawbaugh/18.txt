Patterson Dental Co Expects Strong Fiscal Third-Quarter Earnings, Beating Analyst Estimates 

Patterson Dental Co, a leading distributor of dental supplies and equipment, announced today that it expects earnings for the fiscal third quarter ending April 30 to significantly exceed analyst estimates. The company said earnings per share are projected to be between $0.58 and $0.60, compared with average analyst estimates of $0.52 per share.

“We have seen stronger than expected sales growth in our dental equipment and consumables divisions this quarter, especially related to digital dentistry products and services,” said Patterson Dental CEO Mark Walchirk. “Dentists continue to invest in technology and tools to improve practice efficiency and the patient experience.”

Total sales for the third quarter are expected to increase 7% to 8% from the same quarter a year ago. The company said sales of basic dental supplies and preventative products remained robust, while sales of specialized products used in cosmetic dentistry procedures also contributed to growth. International sales, especially in Europe and China, exceeded forecasts and were up 12% for the quarter.

Patterson Dental has benefited from broader trends impacting the dental industry, including an aging population, increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry, and more dentists opening their own practices. The company has also expanded its range of exclusive private label products, which have higher profit margins. These proprietary products now make up over 25% of total sales.

“Our private label strategy has been very successful, and we will continue expanding our product lines going forward,” Walchirk said. “We are optimistic about continued solid growth and strong performance for the remainder of our fiscal year.”

Patterson Dental is scheduled to report official third quarter fiscal 2020 results on May 21. The company will also provide updated guidance for the full fiscal year, which analysts expect to be raised based on the preliminary third quarter results. Patterson Dental shares rose over 7% in early trading on the earnings forecast news.
