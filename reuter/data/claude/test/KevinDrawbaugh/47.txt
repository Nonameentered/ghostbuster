Quaker Oats Sells Struggling Snapple Unit to Triarc for $300 Million

The Quaker Oats Company announced today that it has agreed to sell its beleaguered Snapple Beverage Group subsidiary to Triarc Companies, a New York-based holding company focused on the beverage industry, for $300 million in cash. The sale marks the end of Quaker's troubled 5-year ownership of Snapple, which has struggled despite multiple attempts at revitalization. 

Quaker Oats acquired Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 at the height of Snapple's popularity as an upstart alternative to bigger beverage companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However, soon after the acquisition, Snapple's revenues began to slump as its new quirky advertising campaigns and product innovations fell flat. Quaker was unable to stem the decline, and Snapple's sales and market share plunged. Last year, Snapple posted sales of $500 million, down from over $700 million in 1997, resulting in losses of $90 million for Quaker.

The sale to Triarc will provide Quaker Oats, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, an opportunity to exit an unsuccessful investment and bolster its balance sheet. "While we worked hard to turn around Snapple, it became increasingly clear that it would take more time and resources than originally anticipated," said Robert Morrison, Quaker's CEO. The proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down debt and repurchase shares, according to the company.

For Triarc, which already owns RC Cola and Shasta, the acquisition of Snapple will expand its portfolio of non-cola beverage brands and position it as a more formidable competitor to industry leaders Coke and Pepsi. "Snapple is an iconic brand that still has a lot of potential for growth," said Nelson Peltz, CEO of Triarc. "We believe we can succeed where Quaker struggled by focusing on product quality, effective marketing, and building stronger distributor relationships." Triarc hopes to revitalize Snapple by improving its distribution, introducing innovative new products, and launching a $50 million ad campaign.

The sale is expected to close within 6 months, pending regulatory approval. Quaker's shares rose $2.25 to $52.75 on the news, while Triarc's stock price increased 12% to $23.50 a share on heavy trading volume. Whether Triarc can succeed in restoring Snapple to its former glory and overcome years of mismanagement remains to be seen. But at the very least, Quaker Oats was likely ecstatic to unload its problem child for any price after this long and frustrating ordeal.
