WMX Technologies Inc. Board Backs CEO Following Attack by Major Stockholder  

The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. today reaffirmed its support for CEO Jane Smith following a public demand by activist investor William Johnson for her ouster. 

In a letter yesterday, Johnson, who owns 12% of WMX shares, criticized Smith’s leadership and called for her removal. He claimed Smith has failed to boost the company’s stock price and has a “flawed vision” for WMX’s future.

WMX’s shares have declined 15% over the past year, compared with a 3% gain in the broader tech sector. Sales growth has also slowed for two straight quarters.

However, the board said in a statement that it “fully supports” Smith and her strategic plan. The board highlighted Smith’s “proven track record” in her five years as CEO, including a successful expansion into new product areas and double-digit revenue growth three out of the past four years.

“WMX has a compelling strategy focused on long-term growth, and Jane Smith is the right leader to execute on that strategy,” said WMX board chairman Michael Thompson. “The board has full confidence in Jane and her vision for driving innovation and shareholder value.”

In an interview, Smith defended her record and touted new products WMX plans to release next year. “Change takes time, but we have ambitious goals and I’m confident we will achieve them,” she said. Smith said she has not spoken with Johnson and has no plans to step down.

WMX was founded 25 years ago as a maker of wireless communication components. Under Smith, the company has moved into higher-growth areas like sensors, autonomous systems and cloud data management. However, the new ventures have yet to generate major sales, frustrating some investors.

Johnson argued in his letter that Smith’s “repeated missteps and failed promises of a turnaround” have erased more than $2 billion in shareholder value. He said the board should launch a search for a new CEO with experience in WMX’s new markets.
