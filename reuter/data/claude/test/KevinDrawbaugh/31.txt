Biogen Inc Set to Launch Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Drug in Europe Within 30 Days, Expects Sales to Match U.S. Levels, Says COO James Tobin  

Biogen Inc, the Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that it expects to launch its Avonex multiple sclerosis drug in major European markets within the next 30 days. James Tobin, Chief Operating Officer of Biogen, said the company anticipates Avonex sales in Europe will match the $1.7 billion in annual revenue the drug currently generates in the U.S. market.

Avonex is a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the most prescribed treatment for MS worldwide. It is currently approved in more than 55 countries globally, with primary markets in the U.S. and Canada. European approval of Avonex was granted earlier this month by the European Medicines Agency.   

“We are poised to bring the proven benefits of Avonex to MS patients in Europe, providing a new treatment option to neurologists across the continent,” said Tobin. “Given the strong brand equity Avonex has established in North America, we expect European adoption to be robust. Our manufacturing operations are ready to meet anticipated demand.”

Avonex is an interferon beta-1a injection administered once a week to help reduce the number of relapses in people with certain forms of multiple sclerosis. It works by modifying the body's natural immune system responses. Interferon beta-1a is made from human proteins and is meant to mimic natural interferon-beta, a protein believed to help regulate the immune system.

Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Biogen has a portfolio of potential MS therapies including Tecfidera, Plegridy, and Zinbryta. The company has leading positions in neurology, immunology, and biosimilars with additional programs in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, lupus, and other autoimmune disorders.

“The launch of Avonex in Europe is an important step in establishing Biogen as the partner of choice for neurologists and MS patients across major global markets,” said Tobin. “We will continue to advance innovative new treatment options to improve the lives of all those affected by MS and other neurological diseases.”
