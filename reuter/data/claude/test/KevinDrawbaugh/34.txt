MGI Pharma Reorients Salagen Marketing Strategy While Still Struggling to Turn a Profit 

MGI Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of medicines for the treatment of neurological disorders, recently announced new marketing initiatives for its sole commercial product Salagen, an oral medication used to treat dry mouth. The company hopes the new strategy will help boost lackluster sales and move the company closer to profitability.

Salagen was first approved by the FDA in 1998 to treat dry mouth associated with Sjogren's syndrome and head and neck cancer radiation therapy. However, the drug has struggled to gain significant market share and acceptance by physicians. MGI Pharma has reported net losses each year since Salagen's launch, despite multiple efforts to grow sales through marketing campaigns, sales force expansion, and price increases. 

The new marketing strategy focuses on expanding the potential use of Salagen to treat dry mouth associated with other conditions and diseases. The company will target physicians specializing in areas like rheumatology, pulmonology, and geriatrics. "By broadening the range of physicians we call on and the potential uses they consider for Salagen, we aim to significantly increase both prescriptions and revenue over the next two years," said MGI Pharma CEO Tim Breitner in a statement.

However, some analysts are skeptical the new marketing push will be enough to make MGI Pharma profitable and turn around the company's financials in the short term. "While the strategy is aiming to expand the market for Salagen, the drug still faces the same adoption challenges that have plagued it for over 20 years," said biotech analyst Mark Busby. "MGI Pharma needs a pipeline of new drugs, not just repackaging an old one, to drive real growth and profit potential."

MGI Pharma continues to work on building its drug pipeline, though no candidates are expected to be commercially available for at least three to five years. For now, the future of the company rests squarely on the shoulders of Salagen. The new marketing campaign is set to launch nationwide next month, with the company hoping the reoriented strategy and physician targets will be the key to unlocking Salagen's potential and turning the first profit in MGI Pharma's history.
