Market Confidence Supports Stocks in St. Jude Medical and Ventritex Despite Uncertainty over Acquisition Deal

Shares of St. Jude Medical and smaller rival Ventritex rose today on investor optimism that St. Jude's proposed $1.3 billion acquisition of Ventritex will go through despite uncertainty over regulatory approval. St. Jude's stock price increased 2.3% while Ventritex's stock jumped 7.2% in mid-day trading.

St. Jude, a medical device maker, announced plans in December to acquire Ventritex, a manufacturer of implantable defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization devices. The deal would allow St. Jude to expand its presence in the cardiac rhythm management market. However, the acquisition is contingent on approval from antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe, who are reviewing the competitive effects of industry consolidation.

Some analysts note that the medical device market has seen increasing merger activity in recent years as companies seek cost savings and efficiencies through acquisitions and combinations. Large players like St. Jude, Medtronic, and Boston Scientific already make up about 85% of the market for implantable defibrillators according to industry estimates. The Ventritex deal has raised concerns that further concentration could reduce competition and innovation, leading to higher costs and less choice for consumers.

Despite regulatory uncertainty, St. Jude's management expressed confidence today that the Ventritex acquisition would proceed as planned. “We expect to receive the necessary approvals within the anticipated timeframe to close the deal before the end of the quarter,” said CEO Michael T. Rousseau in a statement. Investors appear to share this optimism, betting on the strategic benefits of the deal for St. Jude and future growth opportunities, especially as people live longer with heart conditions.
