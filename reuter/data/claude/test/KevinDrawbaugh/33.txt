Eli Lilly Denies Reports of Problems with New Antipsychotic Drug, Zyprexa  

Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is rejecting claims from critics that its new blockbuster antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa, leads to dangerous side effects in some patients. The drug, introduced in 1996, is approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has quickly become the company’s top-selling drug, bringing in $5 billion in revenue last year.  

Consumer advocates and some psychiatrists have reported over 500 cases of adverse effects from Zyprexa use, including severe weight gain, high blood sugar levels, and brain impairment leading to memory lapses and confusion in some elderly dementia patients. They argue the Food and Drug Administration should require stronger warnings about these potential side effects for doctors and patients.  

In a statement, an Eli Lilly spokesperson said, “Zyprexa is safe and effective when used as directed to treat the serious mental illnesses it is approved for. Extensive clinical studies involving over 6,000 patients demonstrated that side effects were mostly mild to moderate. As with all medications, there are some risks, but the benefits of Zyprexa far outweigh the risks when prescribed responsibly by doctors and taken as directed by patients.” 

Some psychiatrists disagree. Dr. David Healy, an expert in psychopharmacology at Bangor University in Wales, has long warned about issues with Zyprexa. “While Zyprexa does help many people suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it clearly has a problematic side effect profile for a subset of the population, especially older patients with dementia.  The company’s refusal to recognize this issue and strengthen warnings puts vulnerable people at risk,” he said.

Healy points to studies showing up to 3% of elderly patients on Zyprexa had severe cognitive impairment and sedation. “With millions of people taking this drug worldwide, that is a huge number of individuals potentially impacted,” he added. 

Advocacy groups are continuing to put pressure on the FDA to investigate Zyprexa's long term effects more closely and require Eli Lilly to communicate the risks in their marketing and physician materials. They argue that without adequate warnings, vulnerable populations face increased dangers from the drug. However, Eli Lilly stands by their safety claims for Zyprexa and will likely continue promoting its benefits when used responsibly under medical guidance. The company does not appear likely to change its marketing stance unless FDA requires label changes or new warnings about the disputed side effects.
