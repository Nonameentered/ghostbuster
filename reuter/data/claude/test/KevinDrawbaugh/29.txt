North American Garbage Companies Continue Asset Pick Over as Industry Restructures and Consolidates

The North American waste management industry is in the midst of consolidation as companies buy up smaller rivals and assets to gain scale and efficiencies. Some of the industry's largest players including Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections have been actively acquiring hauling routes, landfills, recycling facilities and other assets from smaller companies. 

Just last week, Waste Management announced two acquisitions that will expand its operations in the Midwest and Northeast United States. The company purchased select assets from Ark Wrecking, a Michigan-based demolition and waste services company, including several hauling routes and a recycling facility. Waste Management also announced an agreement to acquire Gordon’s Inc., a trash collection and recycling company operating in eastern Pennsylvania.   

 "These acquisitions are a strategic fit and will broaden our market presence and enhance service in several regions," said Jim Freeman, chief strategy officer for Waste Management. The company has acquired more than a dozen solid waste and recycling companies since 2018 as part of its efforts to boost growth and cut costs.

Republic Services, the second-largest garbage hauler in North America, made three acquisitions in 2019 for a total of $225 million. The deals included a construction and demolition recycling company, a transportation logistics provider, and a waste collection company, adding over $90 million in annual revenue. Republic Services aims to generate $500 million in acquisitions revenue in 2020, according to CEO Donald Slager.

Meanwhile, Waste Connections closed six acquisitions in 2019 valued at $355 million in total, expanding into new markets in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maine. The company's growth strategy centers on acquiring privately-held haulers and waste companies in exclusive or secondary markets, consolidating the market in the process.  

The wave of mergers and acquisitions in the waste industry comes as companies seek to gain advantages from increasing scale. Larger companies can leverage their size to reduce costs through operational efficiencies, investing in sustainability and technology improvements. They also have more financial flexibility to acquire new equipment and expand into more locations.  

"Size and scale have become increasingly important in the waste industry. The larger companies benefit from route density, greater operational efficiency and strong pricing power," said Kyle Evans, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who focuses on environmental services and equipment. “Consolidation in a slow-growth industry is the most viable path to boosting profits and maintaining market share.”

However, some critics argue that ongoing consolidation reduces competition and could lead to higher prices for residential garbage pickup and waste services over time. For now, though, the solid waste sector continues its decade-long trend of consolidation as major players gobble up smaller competitors to fuel their expansion. The acquisition spree is likely to continue in the coming years even as the pace of deals may start to slow. Overall, consolidation remains vital to success in an industry where scale and efficiency are paramount.
