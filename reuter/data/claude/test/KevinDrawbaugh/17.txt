Merger and Acquisition Activity Expected to Increase in the Struggling U.S. Nursing Home Industry

The U.S. nursing home industry has faced significant financial challenges in recent years due to declining occupancy rates, lower Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and increasing costs to operate facilities. These economic pressures are expected to drive an increase in merger and acquisition activity as weaker players look to exit the market or combine forces with stronger partners.  

According to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC), the occupancy rate for skilled nursing facilities in the U.S. fell to 82.1% in the first quarter of 2019. This represents the lowest occupancy rate since NIC began tracking the data in 2000. At the same time, the median price charged for a private room in a nursing home rose 2.6% to $253 per day. For nursing home companies that rely heavily on Medicaid and Medicare payments, the declining occupancy and rising costs have squeezed already tight profit margins.

“The headwinds facing the nursing home industry are gathering strength, and for some operators, the financial pressures have become too difficult to overcome alone,” said Beth Burnham Mace, Chief Economist at NIC. “We expect merger and acquisition activity in the sector to accelerate as a result.”

There have already been several prominent examples of consolidation in the industry. In June 2019, shareholders approved a $740 million acquisition of troubled nursing home operator Milestone Healthcare by financial services company Omega Healthcare Investors. Genesis Healthcare, one of the largest nursing home companies in the U.S. with over 500 locations across 26 states, has also been mentioned as an acquisition target. According to analysts, a private equity firm or real estate investment trust could emerge as a potential buyer for Genesis.
