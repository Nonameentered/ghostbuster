Vencor Inc. to Acquire Health Care Service Provider Theratx Inc. in $354 Million Deal 

Vencor Inc., a leading provider of health care services, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Theratx Inc., a company that offers rehabilitation and physical therapy services, for $354 million in cash and stock. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.

The acquisition of Theratx will allow Vencor to expand into the growing rehabilitation services market and complement its existing services like skilled nursing, assisted living, and home health care. Theratx operates over 200 outpatient rehabilitation clinics across 30 states, providing physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to patients. 

"This acquisition is a strategic move that will strengthen our offering of post-acute health care services," said John Smith, CEO of Vencor. "Theratx has a proven track record of providing high-quality rehabilitation care and aligns well with our mission to help patients recover and regain independence after illness or injury."

Theratx will continue to operate under its own name as a subsidiary of Vencor. All Theratx employees, including CEO Elizabeth Thompson, are expected to remain in their current roles. 

"We are thrilled to join the Vencor family and continue expanding access to rehabilitation services across the country," said Thompson. "Vencor shares our commitment to helping patients live their fullest lives, and together we will have a bigger impact on the health care industry."

The deal is expected to generate significant cost savings for Vencor and add to its earnings per share immediately after closing. Vencor plans to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. The company's shares rose 3% on news of the deal, indicating that investors view the move positively.

The acquisition of Theratx is the latest in a series of deals as large health care providers seek to gain scale and cut costs. The health care services market continues to grow due to aging populations, increased rates of chronic disease, and a shift to outpatient and home-based care. Vencor and Theratx appear poised to capitalize on these long-term trends under the combined company.
