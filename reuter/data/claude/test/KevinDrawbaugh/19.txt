Consolidation in Nursing Home and Sub-Acute Medical Care Services Industry Accelerates with Two Major Mergers

The nursing home and sub-acute medical care services industry continues to consolidate as two major deals were announced this week. Genesis Healthcare, one of the largest post-acute care providers in the U.S., will acquire Kindred Healthcare for $6.9 billion, creating a company with nearly 1,500 facilities across 46 states. Genesis operates 450 skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living communities while Kindred operates 60 long-term acute care hospitals and nearly 250 skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities.

The combination of these two large companies will reshape the landscape in the post-acute care market, estimated to be worth over $300 billion annually in the U.S. The increased scale is intended to reduce costs and enhance the services and care options available for patients recovering from illnesses, injuries and hospitalizations. "By joining together, we can better meet the needs of our patients, employees and healthcare partners while accelerating our transformation to a more sustainable care delivery model," said Bruce Mackey, Genesis CEO.  

Meanwhile, Brookdale Senior Living, the largest owner and operator of senior living communities in the U.S., has announced a $325 million takeover of its smaller rival Passport Senior Living. The deal will add 24 retirement communities in nine states to Brookdaleâ€™s existing portfolio of over 1,100 communities. Brookdale has been under financial pressure recently with declining occupancy rates in its assisted living facilities. The Passport acquisition provides Brookdale with 4,000 new senior housing units and opportunity for improved operational efficiencies.

With 10,000 Americans turning 65 every day, the demand for skilled nursing, long-term acute care, and senior housing continues to grow. However, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates have not kept up with the rising costs of providing care. Many smaller operators are finding it difficult to achieve scale and profitability. Analysts expect more merger and acquisition activity in the coming years, especially in regional and local markets. The Genesis-Kindred and Brookdale-Passport deals this week are likely a sign of more large-scale changes ahead in the post-acute and senior care market.
