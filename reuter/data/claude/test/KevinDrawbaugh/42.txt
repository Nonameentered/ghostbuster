Eli Lilly Fights to Keep Details of Prozac Case Settlement Under Wraps in Kentucky Courtroom Battle  

Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is attempting to prevent the unsealing of records related to a decades-old legal case involving its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac. In a courtroom battle unfolding this week in Louisville, Kentucky, multiple news organizations are fighting to make public secret documents from a 1989 settlement between Lilly and a Kentucky man who committed violent acts after taking Prozac.  

The case centers around Joseph Wesbecker, who went on a shooting rampage in 1989 at his workplace, killing eight people before taking his own life. Wesbecker had been prescribed Prozac prior to the attacks, and his surviving family members sued Eli Lilly, claiming the drug provoked his violence. The case was settled in 1994 on undisclosed terms. Ever since, Eli Lilly has fought to keep the records sealed, arguing that disclosure could reveal “confidential business information” and discourage future settlements.

In a Louisville courtroom this week, attorneys for The Courier-Journal newspaper and the Lexington Herald-Leader argued that the public has a right to know the details of the settlement, given Prozac’s status as a blockbuster and controversial drug. Prozac, approved in 1987, became one of the first major selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. It has been used by over 40 million people worldwide but has also faced lawsuits over links to violence, suicide, and other behavioral changes. 

Lawyers for the newspapers argue that unsealing the records “could help shed light on a matter of significant public interest.” They dispute Eli Lilly’s claims that the information is commercially sensitive given Prozac’s age. An attorney for the newspapers said in court, “Prozac is not really a commercial issue anymore. It’s really now a historical issue.”

Attorneys for Eli Lilly counter that the passage of time does not reduce the potential commercial harm. At the hearing, a Lilly lawyer said that divulging the details of the settlement could still discourage future litigants from settling with the company and lead to protracted, expensive court battles. The records contain information about Lilly's "strategies and thought processes” in handling the Prozac litigation.

A judge is expected to rule on whether to unseal the records in the coming weeks. The case is shining a spotlight on the balance between corporate secrecy and public transparency in the U.S. legal system. It also comes at a time of renewed interest in the links between antidepressants like Prozac and behavioral changes.
