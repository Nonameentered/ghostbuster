Mercury Finance Co. Granted Extension of Short-Term Credit Line with Bank of America, Permanent Refinancing Critical 

Mercury Finance Co. announced today that Bank of America has approved a 6-month extension of Mercury’s $500 million short-term revolving credit facility. The extension provides Mercury additional time to negotiate a longer-term refinancing deal as the company works to stabilize its operations following a series of setbacks last year.

“We appreciate Bank of America’s ongoing support and confidence in Mercury Finance during this transitional period,” said Mercury CEO Jane Smith in a statement. “This extension is critical as we finalize our turnaround plans and secure permanent financing to support the next stage of growth for our company.”   

Mercury, a leading automotive finance company, has weathered a tumultuous year following the sudden resignation of its CFO and the discovery of improper accounting practices. The company delayed the release of its financial results for two quarters and has been working to restate financial statements for the past fiscal year. Mercury’s stock price dropped by over 50% following the series of announcements last Fall.

With new leadership now in place, including former BigCorp CFO Mark Lee, Mercury is working to rebuild trust in its financial position and growth prospects. The refinancing deal with Bank of America or another partner is an important step, providing longer-term stability to its capital structure. According to sources familiar with the situation, Mercury aims to lock in a 3 to 5-year revolving credit facility of at least $1 billion to fund new loan originations and pay off existing short-term debts.

Mercury reported solid operating performance outside of the accounting issues, with loan originations up 22% last year and interest margin stable. However, elevated costs related to regulatory penalties and restatement expenses weighed on profitability. For the current year, Mercury projects 10-15% growth in loan originations and a rebound in profits as one-time costs decline.

Mercury’s shares rose over 3% on the news, clawing back some of the steep losses from earlier in the year. Investors appear relieved at the extension with Bank of America, as lack of financing would have created a major overhang on Mercury’s turnaround efforts. While uncertainty remains around the refinancing deal and other overdue financial disclosures, the additional time allows Mercury space to strengthen operations and the balance sheet as it works to turn the page on its recent troubles. Overall, today’s announcement is a step in the right direction for the embattled company.
