Major WMX Stockholder Calls for Chairman to Step Down for New CEO Search 

One of the largest shareholders in WMX Corporation is calling for the chairman of the board to step down to make way for a new chief executive officer search. In a letter sent to the WMX board of directors today, activist investment fund BlueLine Capital demanded that long-time chairman William Thompson resign immediately. 

BlueLine Capital, which owns over 3% of WMX shares, argued that the global materials and waste management company has underperformed competitors in recent years under Thompson's leadership. "WMX's shareholders have suffered from mismanagement and a lack of strategic vision," the letter states. "New leadership is urgently needed to ensure WMX is prepared for future challenges and opportunities."

WMX's stock price has declined nearly 25% over the past year, lagging the broader market and direct competitors. Revenue growth has been stagnant amid a strong economy, rising only 3% last year. The CEO position has been vacant since March when Thompson's handpicked successor abruptly resigned citing "irreconcilable differences." Thompson has served as acting CEO since then.

In its letter, BlueLine called Thompson's dual role as chair and CEO "untenable" and said the board has been "derelict in its duties" by not launching a new CEO search immediately. The fund threatened to withhold its votes for board members at the company's annual shareholder meeting next month if changes were not made.

A WMX spokesperson said the company has received BlueLine's letter and will respond in due course. "WMX values the input of all shareholders," the spokesperson said. However, Thompson has given no public indication he intends to step down from either role. He has led WMX as chairman since 2000 and previously served as CEO for over 15 years from 1990 to 2005.

Sources say the WMX board has been divided on how to proceed and that Thompson still maintains significant support among longtime board members. But others argue BlueLine's demands illustrate growing dissatisfaction with the status quo and that a refusal to revamp leadership could weaken confidence in the stock and prompt more shareholder activism.
