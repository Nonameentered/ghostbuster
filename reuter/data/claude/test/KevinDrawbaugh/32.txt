Pier 1 Imports Aims for High Earnings Growth in 2021 with Expansion and New Offerings

Pier 1 Imports Inc. announced an ambitious growth plan this week that aims to significantly boost both revenue and profits in 2021. The home furnishings retailer intends to open 50-75 new stores next year, increase its private label and exclusive merchandise offerings, and roll out a new customer loyalty program. 

"We see a lot of opportunity for Pier 1 to gain more market share, especially as other home retailers continue to struggle," said CEO Elizabeth Garrett in an interview. "Our growth strategy is focused on giving customers more of what they want—a unique assortment of eclectic and affordable home décor items they can't find anywhere else, as well as rewards and perks for shopping with us."

Pier 1's new store openings in 2021 will be concentrated in suburban areas of large cities in the Southern and Western United States, according to Garrett. The company will also remodel about 100 of its existing stores next year to improve the in-store experience and make room for additional merchandise displays.  

To attract more customers and increase basket size, Pier 1 will introduce several new private-label home furnishings lines in 2021 that feature bold colors and prints inspired by global travel. An updated version of its popular Papasan chair and new outdoor furniture offerings will be part of this merchandise expansion. The company also plans to partner with influencers in the home décor space to create social media buzz around new products.

Another source of growth for Pier 1 next year will be its revised customer loyalty program, Pier 1 Rewards. Relaunching in the first quarter of 2021, the revamped program will offer free shipping and returns for all members, exclusive sneak previews of new collections, and $10 in Pier 1 Cash for every $200 spent in stores or online. "Pier 1 Rewards will make it even more compelling for our best customers to keep shopping with us," Garrett noted.

With the combination of new store openings, enhanced product offerings, and an improved loyalty program, Pier 1 is targeting an increase in comparable sales of 3-4% and earnings per share growth of 8-12% for fiscal year 2021. If achieved, that level of profit growth would outpace most other major competitors in the home furnishings category and reflect a successful turnaround for a company that has struggled in recent years. Investors reacted positively to Pier 1's growth plans, with the stock up over 6% in morning trading following yesterday's announcement.
