Diametrics Medical Inc Plans to Reach Profitability by Q3 1998, Generate Millions in Revenues  

Diametrics Medical Inc, a medical device company based in San Jose, announced today that it expects to reach profitability by the third quarter of 1998 and generate millions of dollars in revenue in the coming year. The company has been developing an innovative device to monitor glucose levels in diabetes patients and has recently received FDA approval to market the product in the U.S.  

“We are excited to launch our Diametrics Continuous Glucose Monitor, which provides diabetes patients with a minimally invasive way to track their glucose levels in real time,” said CEO Jane Smith. “This product has the potential to revolutionize how people manage diabetes and live healthier lives.”

The handheld device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin to measure interstitial fluid glucose levels every few minutes. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a monitoring device, alerting the patient if levels go outside the target range. Studies have shown that tight control of blood sugar levels in diabetes patients can help reduce health risks like heart disease, blindness and other complications.

Diametrics expects to ramp up production of the devices and sensors in the coming months to meet demand from diabetes patients and healthcare providers across the U.S. The company projects revenue of $4 million in Q2, $8 million in Q3 and $12 million in Q4 as production increases. Revenue in 1999 is forecast to reach $50 million. At that level of revenue, the company anticipates becoming profitable due to the high margins on the disposable sensors, which need to be replaced every week.

The continuous glucose monitor market is a fast-growing medical device segment, with competitors including DexCom and Medtronic also offering products. However, analysts say Diametrics has a technological edge that could help capture significant market share. The company’s stock price has tripled over the past year in anticipation of FDA approval and the product launch. If Diametrics is able to successfully commercialize its device and generate substantial sales, revenue and profits in the coming quarters, the stock could continue its upward climb.
