Triarc acquires struggling Snapple brand from Quaker Oats in $300m deal

Triarc Companies announced today that it has acquired the Snapple beverage brand from Quaker Oats for $300 million in cash. The deal comes three years after Quaker Oats paid $1.7 billion to acquire Snapple, only to see the brand struggle under their ownership. 

Snapple was once an innovative leader in the new age beverage category, pioneering the ready-to-drink tea and fruit drink segments. However, under Quaker Oats' management, Snapple lost its way and sales and market share declined steadily. Quaker Oats had trouble managing the irreverent and quirky brand, and made a series of marketing missteps that failed to resonate with customers.

Triarc, which owns Mistic and Stewart's brands and is the franchisor of Arby's and T.J. Cinnamons, believes it can revive the Snapple brand and reinvigorate its sales growth. Triarc CEO Nelson Peltz said "Snapple is a great brand that lost its way under Quaker Oats. We believe we understand what made Snapple special and how to bring that magic back. This is a classic turnaround opportunity, and we are confident we can restore the brand to its former glory."

As part of the deal, Triarc will take control of all Snapple beverages, including the flagship iced tea line as well as fruit-flavored snack drinks like Mistic and Stewart's. Quaker Oats will retain ownership of Snapple's bottling operations and distribution centers. The companies hope to have a smooth transition, though industry analysts warn there may be challenges in separating the brand and operations.

The $300 million price tag represents a significant loss for Quaker Oats, which took on $1.3 billion in debt to finance its $1.7 billion Snapple acquisition in 2000. However, most analysts viewed Quaker's asking price of $500-$700 million as unrealistic given Snapple's declining sales and profits in recent years. Quaker Oats is eager to shed the underperforming brand and focus on its core cereal and pet food businesses according to company spokespeople.

With the sale, Triarc inherits the task of reviving interest in Snapple and distinguishing it from competing brands like AriZona Iced Tea, Lipton Brisk, and newcomers like Sparkling Ice. If Triarc succeeds, Snapple could once again become a force in the beverage industry. If not, Snapple may fade into obscurity under yet another failed owner. Triarc is betting $300 million that they have the right formula to make Snapple crisp and refreshing once more.
