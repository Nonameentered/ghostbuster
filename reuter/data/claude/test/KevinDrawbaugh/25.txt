WMX CEO Phillip Rooney Resigns Under Pressure from Investment Group Controlled by George Soros

WMX Corp announced today that its CEO Phillip Rooney has resigned from his position, effective immediately. The sudden departure comes after months of pressure from WMX's largest shareholder, Quantum Partners LP, an investment fund controlled by billionaire investor George Soros. 

Quantum Partners, which owns 12% of WMX shares, has been publicly critical of Rooney's leadership and WMX's lagging stock price over the last two years. The hedge fund has advocated for cost-cutting measures, a review of underperforming business units, and a refresh of the WMX board. According to people familiar with the matter, Quantum threatened to launch a proxy fight to replace board members if changes were not made.

Rooney has led WMX as CEO for the past six years but has faced mounting criticism as the company's growth has slowed in key markets. WMX stock is down over 30% since Rooney took over as CEO in 2016. Revenue growth has been stagnant for the last three years. In a letter to investors last month, Soros Fund Management's chief investment officer directly blamed Rooney's "mismanagement and strategic missteps" for WMX's poor performance.

In a statement announcing Rooney's departure, WMX said the board of directors and Rooney "agreed that the company would benefit from new leadership." WMX also announced it is launching a search from internal and external candidates to find a successor. 

The move appears to be a victory for Soros and Quantum Partners in their battle for influence at WMX. With Rooney out and a successor to be chosen, the hedge fund will likely push for directors and executives aligned with their vision of radical changes needed to turn around the company's performance. For his part, Rooney walked away with an $8 million severance package.

WMX shares rose over 5% on the news of Rooney's resignation. Whether a new leader and direction can restore long-term growth at the company remains an open question. But for now, Soros and Quantum have successfully shaken up WMX in their quest to boost shareholder value.
