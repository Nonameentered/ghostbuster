Quaker Oats Sells Struggling Snapple for $300 Million in "Fire Sale" Deal to Triarc, Owner of Rival Mistic  

In a move to cut its losses from a failed acquisition, Quaker Oats Company announced today that it is selling the Snapple Beverage Corporation to Triarc Companies Inc., maker of the competing Mistic brand of fruit juices and teas, for just $300 million. The sale represents a staggering loss for Quaker, which purchased Snapple for $1.7 billion just two years ago.   

Industry analysts called the deal a "fire sale" for Quaker as it unloads Snapple at a fraction of what it had paid. "Quaker's mismanagement of the Snapple brand is now legendary," said A.J. Schwartz, a beverage analyst at Fizzy Drink Advisors. "They took a perfectly good brand and ran it into the ground. Getting just $300 million at this point is really just cutting bait and at least recovering something."

Quaker Oats acquired Snapple in 1994 at the height of the "new age beverage" craze, betting that the trendy brand would provide new sources of growth. But soon after the purchase, public interest in natural alternative beverages began to wane. Quaker also struggled to manage Snapple, changing formula and marketing strategies that alienated many consumers and retailers. Sales and market share plunged.   

Under Triarc, Snapple is expected to join Mistic and Stewart's fountain brands, which Triarc has managed more successfully. "We believe we can revitalize the Snapple brand and return it to growth by improving its positioning and execution," said Warren Buffett, CEO of Triarc. "Snapple still has strong consumer awareness and an attractive portfolio of tea, fruit juice and water products that were badly mishandled. We're confident we can do a better job."

With the sale of Snapple, Quaker Oats says it will take a $1.4 billion non-cash write-down of the Snapple assets, to be reflected in fourth quarter results. The deal will allow Quaker to avoid further losses and rededicate resources to its flagship Gatorade sports drink and oatmeal brands. "We made a mistake acquiring Snapple and today's action is aimed at bolstering shareholder value by exiting a business we never understood," said Robert Morrison, Quaker's CEO. 

The Snapple divestiture is just the latest in a series of changes at Quaker aimed at reversing a long business slump. The company has also sold several other poorly performing brands, closed multiple plants, and has cut over 25% of its work force since Morrison took over 18 months ago. Investors cheered news of the Snapple sale, sending Quaker's stock price up over 7% in after-hours trading. Whether Morrison's back-to-basics strategy will ultimately revive Quaker's bottom line remains to be seen.
