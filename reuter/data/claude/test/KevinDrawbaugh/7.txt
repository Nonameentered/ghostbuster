FDA Investigating Third Death Linked to Ventritex Implantable Defibrillators 

The Food and Drug Administration announced today that it is investigating a third death linked to malfunctioning implantable defibrillators made by Ventritex, a medical device company based in Sunnyvale, California. Implantable defibrillators are small devices implanted in the chest to monitor heart rhythms and deliver electric shocks to correct abnormal rhythms that could stop the heart.

In a statement, the FDA said the recent death involved a Ventritex device that failed to deliver lifesaving shocks when a patient's heart went into a dangerous arrhythmia. This marks the third reported failure of a Ventritex defibrillator in the past six months. The FDA has received a total of 23 reports of failures or malfunctions related to four models of Ventritex defibrillators since the devices were approved in 2010.

In response to the new report, the FDA has launched an official investigation into the safety and effectiveness of Ventritex defibrillators. The agency may require changes to the devices or restrictions on their use. Ventritex has issued recalls for two device models so far this year. However, over 200,000 of the devices remain implanted in patients in the U.S. and worldwide.

Patients with Ventritex defibrillators should continue to remain active and mobile but see their doctors immediately if they receive a shock, experience fainting or lightheadedness, or notice changes in their heart rhythm. Doctors may replace the devices if there are signs of malfunction. The FDA recommends against explanting the devices unless medically necessary based on an individual patient's condition.

Ventritex issued a statement pledging full cooperation with the FDA investigation. However, patient advocates argue this third death calls into question why more aggressive action was not taken earlier. “How many more lives have to be put at risk before these faulty devices are taken off the market?” asked Lisa McGiffert of the Patient Safety Action Network. The FDA has not indicated if it will require Ventritex to recall any additional devices at this time but stated it “will take further action as appropriate based on the results of our ongoing investigation.”
