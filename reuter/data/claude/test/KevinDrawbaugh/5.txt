Baxter International Inc Comfortable with 1997 Earnings Forecast of $2.36 Per Share

Healthcare equipment maker Baxter International Inc. announced today that it remains on track to meet analysts' expectations of $2.36 per share in earnings for the 1997 fiscal year. While eyeing the overall slowing growth in healthcare costs across the United States and specific challenges in some of its business units, Baxter nevertheless expressed confidence in achieving the company's stated earnings target for the year.

Baxter's earnings per share continued its strong growth trajectory in the first half of the year, increasing 17% year over year to $1.19. The increase was driven by higher sales volumes in several key business areas, in particular the intravenous solutions and blood products divisions. The growth in demand for these treatments reflects rising demand for alternatives to blood transfusion and improved cystic fibrosis treatments, both areas the company has increasingly focused on and invested in.

Noel Tichy, CEO of Baxter, cited macroeconomic conditions that are constraining healthcare cost growth nationally as a watch item for the company. He noted that hospital admissions in the US declined 1 percent last quarter, the first decline since 1989. This slowdown and the shifting of some surgical procedures to outpatient settings could impact the sales of some of Baxter's hospital supplies and devices.  

An additional concern is in Baxter's dialysis and water purification divisions, where lower reimbursement rates and supply chain pressures are squeezing margins. To offset these headwinds, Baxter plans to continue investing in research and product development to strengthen its portfolio of less commoditized, higher-margin treatments. The company will also focus on global expansion, especially in emerging markets where healthcare costs are rising more rapidly and demand for modern medical technologies is growing quickly.

Despite these risks, Baxter's management remains optimistic and, based on its performance in the first half, expects to achieve full-year earnings of $2.36 per share. Strong execution and new product launches are driving enhanced operational efficiencies and higher revenues across several divisions. Barring any unforeseen macroeconomic shocks or impacts from policy changes, Baxter appears well positioned to continue its steady growth. With a solid balance sheet, experienced leadership team, and portfolio of life-saving products and services, Baxter is a stable long-term investment in the healthcare sector. Overall, shareholders should be comforted by management's confidence in achieving its earnings target for the fiscal year.
