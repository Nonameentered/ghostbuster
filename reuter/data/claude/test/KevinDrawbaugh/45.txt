Triarc Plans to Apply Successful Marketing Principles to Turn Around Snapple Sales  

Triarc Beverage Group announced plans today to revamp the marketing strategy and brand positioning of Snapple Beverage Corp., which it acquired in 1997. Triarc believes Snapple has strong potential for growth but has failed to keep up with trends in the beverage industry.  

“Snapple is an iconic brand that resonates with customers, but it has lost its way in recent years,” said Mike Weinstein, CEO of Triarc. “We plan to get back to the basics of what made Snapple great by focusing on natural, quirky, and fun products that tapped into what people cared about.”

Triarc will overhaul Snapple’s marketing to emphasize its roots as an all-natural beverage company. New advertisements will highlight Snapple’s use of high-quality, organic ingredients and playful sense of humor that originally attracted its passionate fan base. Snapple will also redesign its product line to remove artificial colors and preservatives, sticking to simple ingredients customers can recognize.  

“We want to remind people why they fell in love with Snapple in the first place,” said Stacy Gilroy, Snapple’s new vice president of marketing. “The turnaround will be rooted in authenticity, quality, and humor.”

Snapple has seen sales and market share decline steadily over the past decade due to increasingly health-conscious consumers and competition from brands like Vitaminwater and Mistic that are seen as fresher or more authentic. The brand was acquired by Quaker Oats Company in 1994 and many believe it lost its indie spirit during that era. Triarc aims to recapture that original essence and charm.

Triarc has a successful track record of reviving beverage brands. After acquiring Mistic and Stewart’s fountain brands, Triarc repositioned them in the market by improving product formulas, updating packaging, and running memorable ad campaigns. Both brands saw double-digit growth within two years of Triarc's acquisition. The company hopes to replicate that success with Snapple.

Industry analysts are cautiously optimistic about Snapple’s new direction. “Snapple has strong brand equity that has been underutilized, but it will depend on the execution,” said John Adams, of Beverage Digest. “Triarc has the marketing prowess to potentially turn things around if they can make the brand feel special and fun again. The all-natural, back-to-basics approach could resonate with today’s consumers if done right.”

Snapple’s new marketing campaign is expected to launch this spring across TV, social media, in-store, and 6,500 delivery trucks with the slogan “Made from the Best Stuff on Earth.” The brand aims to regain its position as an innovative leader in the beverage landscape. With the right strategy and messaging, Triarc may succeed in putting the fizz back in Snapple.
