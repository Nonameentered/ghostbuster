United Wisconsin Services Inc Expects Medical-Loss Ratio to Decline if No New Healthcare Reform is Introduced 

United Wisconsin Services Inc (UWS), one of the largest health insurers in the Midwest, said today that it expects its medical-loss ratio to decline over the next few years if no new healthcare reform policies are put in place. The medical-loss ratio is the amount of premiums an insurer spends on claims and expenses. A lower ratio is more favorable for insurance companies.

In an investor briefing, UWS executives said that healthcare costs overall, including insurance premiums, prescription drug prices, and hospital charges, are rising at a slower rate. They forecast that trend to continue without major policy changes. UWS plans to adjust premiums to match lower medical cost inflation, which will decrease the percentage of premium dollars spent on medical care and improve its medical-loss ratio.

“We have seen costs stabilize over the last couple of years, and we don’t anticipate a big cost driver on the horizon if existing policies remain in place,” said John Smith, UWS Chief Financial Officer. “We will monitor trends closely and make prudent adjustments to premiums and benefits to ensure a healthy medical-loss ratio for our company and affordable coverage for our members.”

The medical-loss ratio rule set by the Affordable Care Act requires health insurers to spend at least 80-85% of premium dollars on medical claims or quality improvement activities. A lower ratio means the insurer is spending a smaller portion of premiums on healthcare and keeping more as administrative costs or profit. Consumer advocates argue that high medical-loss ratios indicate that an insurer is providing good value to members.

UWS and other large insurers lobbied against the minimum medical-loss ratio rule, arguing that it does not reflect the dynamics of health insurance and can restrict innovation. Some analysts argue that as costs rise, insurers require more flexibility in pricing and higher ratios may not always benefit consumers. However, supporters of the rule say it protects individuals from excessive health insurance company profits and administrative waste.

The prognosis from UWS suggests the policy debate around healthcare costs and insurance regulation is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. With healthcare such a significant part of the U.S. economy, the stakes remain high for companies, consumers, and lawmakers alike.
