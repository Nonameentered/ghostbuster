CardioThoracic Exceeds Targets for Innovative Beating Heart Surgery Equipment Increasing Worldwide Cardiac Surgeries 

Medical device maker CardioThoracic announced today that sales of its pioneering PortAccess beating heart surgery system exceeded growth targets for the third straight year. The company reported a 22% increase in revenue from the PortAccess system, enabling over 15,000 minimally invasive cardiac surgeries worldwide in 2019 alone.

The PortAccess system allows surgeons to perform coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures without stopping the heart and putting the patient on a heart-lung bypass machine. The system, which received regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe in 2017, provides surgeons with direct access to the beating heart through small incisions between the ribs. Patients experience reduced pain, scarring, and recovery times compared to traditional open-heart surgery.

“The rapid adoption of our PortAccess system demonstrates its significant benefits to both patients and surgeons,” said CardioThoracic CEO Jane Smith. “We are enabling less invasive beating heart surgeries in a growing number of leading medical centers around the world and transforming the lives of patients with coronary artery disease.”

Several factors are driving the strong growth and interest in minimally invasive beating heart surgeries using the PortAccess system. Patients increasingly seek out less invasive surgical options with shorter hospital stays and rehabilitation times. Surgeons have also found that the system expands the pool of candidates for CABG surgery to include higher-risk patients who may not have been good candidates for the traditional on-pump procedure.

The system has been used by over 500 cardiac surgeons across 22 countries so far, though its higher upfront costs have limited wider initial adoption. However, continued strong clinical outcomes and cost-efficiency data from the use of the PortAccess system are driving more medical centers to invest in the innovative surgical equipment. 

Looking ahead, CardioThoracic aims to accelerate growth by expanding into new geographies, including key markets in Asia. The company is also developing next-generation versions of the PortAccess system with enhanced visualization and suturing capabilities to further reduce surgical complexity. With persistent growth in coronary artery disease worldwide, the pioneering PortAccess beating heart surgery system is poised to transform cardiac care for even more patients in the coming years.
