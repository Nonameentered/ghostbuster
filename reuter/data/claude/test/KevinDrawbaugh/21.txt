WMX Technologies to Sell Stake in ServiceMaster L.P. for $626 Million; Shareholders Demand More Resignations  

WMX Technologies announced today that it has agreed to sell its 43% stake in ServiceMaster L.P. to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for $626 million. The move comes amid continuing turmoil for the waste management company and demands from activist shareholders for further resignations from WMX's board of directors.

WMX has been under financial strain for several years due to declining waste volumes, low recycling commodity prices, and increasing costs. The company has undertaken several restructuring efforts to cut costs and raise cash, including selling non-core assets, reducing headcount, and renegotiating labor contracts. However, WMX's share price has still dropped nearly 50% over the past three years. 

In June, WMX's CEO resigned under pressure from dissatisfied shareholders. Since then two other board members have also resigned, but some large shareholders argue more change is still needed to turn the company around. The sale of the stake in ServiceMaster is aimed at raising capital to reduce debt and fund WMX's ongoing restructuring. However, without a clear turnaround plan, analysts question whether the efforts will be enough.

"Selling off bits and pieces of the company is not a strategy," said Benjamin Worth, an analyst at Pacer Financial Partners. "WMX needs a comprehensive plan to fix its core operations, or otherwise shareholders will see their investment continue to deteriorate in value."

ServiceMaster is a provider of residential and commercial cleaning, lawn care, and pest control services. WMX has held its minority stake in the company since 2014 but has made clear more recently that non-core assets were for sale as its financial troubles mounted. The $626 million price tag represents a 15% premium over ServiceMaster's current valuation.

Some WMX shareholders argue the sale is a sign the board is not aiming high enough in its restructuring goals. "WMX should be making bold moves to reposition itself for growth, not just incremental progress," said Amy Stevens, a fund manager at Magnum Capital Investors, which owns 3% of WMX's shares. "We need a revamped board with experience turning around companies of this size and scope. More tweaks around the edges won't cut it."

WMX's board appears to have heard the calls for further change. In a statement today, the board said it is initiating a search for several new directors with relevant experience in waste management or industrial turnarounds. The board also said it is reviewing alternatives to unlock more value from WMX's sprawling collection of assets. However, without a clear direction from the board, many shareholders remain skeptical that the incremental shuffles will add up to a winning long-term strategy.
