WMX Board Stands Firm Behind CEO Amid Call for Ouster by Major Stockholder  

The board of directors of WMX, Inc. expressed their strong support for CEO John  Smith today amid calls from a major institutional stockholder for his immediate removal. Activist investor Greenway Capital sent a letter to WMX board members yesterday demanding they fire Smith for what it called his “destructive leadership” and “haphazard financial decisions.” WMX’s board responded within hours, saying Smith has its “full confidence” and will remain CEO.

Greenway, which owns 12% of WMX shares, criticized Smith for overpaying in several recent acquisitions and neglecting the company’s core recycling business while chasing trendy technologies. The letter also blamed Smith’s leadership for a 28% drop in WMX’s stock price over the past year and a deteriorating balance sheet with $3 billion in debt. “Mr. Smith’s misguided ventures and reckless risk-taking have endangered WMX’s financial health and its investors’ capital,” the letter read. “It is time for the board to act before further damage is done.”

In its response, WMX’s board acknowledged shareholders’ concerns about the company’s performance but said Smith’s role as CEO remains vital. “While we are dissatisfied with recent results, Mr. Smith architected WMX’s transformation into a sustainability leader,” the company said in a statement. “His vision and experience position him well to navigate current challenges and drive future growth.” The board said it would work closely with Smith on a comprehensive business review and new strategic plan to steer WMX back to profitability. 

The clash between WMX’s board and management team and major stockholder Greenway threatens to shake up one of the largest recycling and renewable energy companies in the U.S. WMX has over 25,000 employees worldwide and a market value of $12 billion despite its recent share price declines. Smith has been CEO since 2010 but only recently faced intensive shareholder criticism, even as fellow executives departed and sector peer companies outperformed WMX.

Shares of WMX fell nearly 5% on the news before recovering some losses. Analysts are split on the wisdom of the board’s decision to maintain support for Smith. “The board seems unwilling to acknowledge the company’s dire situation and the role Smith has played in creating it,” said a report from Gemini Partners, an investment research firm. However, others argue management stability is critical during a business overhaul. “Keeping the current team in place is the right choice as WMX works to remedy performance issues,” said Miranda Howe, a senior analyst at Dawson & West. 

WMX appears headed for a showdown with Greenway Capital and other dissatisfied shareholders at its annual meeting next month. How investors respond to the company’s promised business review and updated strategy may ultimately determine whether the board’s confidence in Smith was misplaced or prescient. For now, Smith remains at the helm of WMX despite the gathering clouds.
