BBI Healthcare Corp targets 15% earnings growth and return on equity in merger of Bergen Brunswig Corp and Ivax Corp

BBI Healthcare Corp, the new healthcare company formed by the merger of Bergen Brunswig Corp and Ivax Corp, announced financial targets today, including earnings growth of 15% annually and a return on equity of at least 15%. The merger of the two Florida-based healthcare companies was completed in August, creating one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors and generic drug manufacturers in the U.S. with over $50 billion in revenue.  

“We have significant scale and reach across the healthcare industry, from pharmaceutical distribution to generic drug manufacturing to pharmacy management services,” said BBI CEO John Smith. “Our new company is well positioned to drive strong and consistent growth that will create value for shareholders, customers, and employees.”

BBI said it aims to achieve the 15% earnings growth through new business opportunities from its expanded offerings, operational efficiencies gained by combining Bergen Brunswig and Ivax, and growth in its generic drug business. The generic drug unit, which now has over 200 products in its portfolio, is targeting 20% revenue growth over the next 3 to 5 years. BBI believes its diversified business model will also help smooth volatility from year to year.

The return on equity target of 15% will be achieved through a disciplined capital allocation strategy, according to BBI CFO Jane Doe. “We will prioritize investments in high-growth and high-margin areas of our business, pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria, and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases,” said Doe. BBI plans to increase its dividend annually in line with earnings growth.

BBI’s scale and breadth of operations will be an advantage, according to analysts. “They have significant opportunities for cross-selling services to their combined customer base,” said Joseph Stevens, a pharmaceutical analyst at Dewey Investments. “And as a top generic drug maker, they are well positioned to benefit from the large number of branded drugs going off-patent over the next decade.”

With the merger complete, BBI now has over 50,000 employees in 25 countries. The company is headquartered in Miami, Florida and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BBI.”
