Polaris set to challenge Harley-Davidson with new Victory cruiser motorcycle 

Polaris Industries, the Minnesota-based power sports company, recently unveiled a new cruiser motorcycle under its Victory Motorcycles brand. The new Victory Octane motorcycle is aimed squarely at Harley-Davidson's dominant cruiser models.

The Victory Octane, which was unveiled at a Las Vegas trade show last week, features classic cruiser styling with touches of modern flair. The bike has a low-slung silhouette, a teardrop fuel tank, wide handlebars and plenty of chrome detailing. However, it also incorporates more contemporary elements like an LED headlight, digital display, and aggressive blacked-out color options. 

“We wanted to create a bike that honors the best traditions of American cruiser style but also has a distinct Victory personality and attitude,” said Steve Menneto, president of Triumph and Victory Motorcycles. “The Octane delivers on both fronts and we think cruiser riders are going to love it.”

The Victory Octane has a 105 cubic inch (1,731 cc) liquid-cooled V-Twin engine that produces 100 horsepower and 110 pound-feet of torque. Pricing will start at $12,999, making it very competitive with Harley-Davidson's popular Softail Slim model.  With its combination of traditional styling and modern performance, Polaris is aiming for younger riders who want a high-quality American cruiser at an affordable price.

“Harley-Davidson has dominated the cruiser segment for decades, but their core customers are aging,” said Chad Donnelly, an analyst with Davidson Research, an industry analysis firm. “Polaris sees an opportunity to gain share with younger riders by offering a more contemporary take on a classic cruiser design at a competitive price.”

Polaris has been producing Victory Motorcycles since 1998 but has struggled to make major inroads against Harley's entrenched position. However, Victory's market share has been slowly climbing thanks to well-reviewed models like the Vision tourer and the Project 156 concept bike. The new Victory Octane, which will arrive in showrooms next month, could further boost the brand's visibility and appeal.

“We believe the Victory Octane is a breakthrough product that will bring new customers into the Victory brand and the cruiser segment overall,” said Menneto. Harley-Davidson still dominates cruiser motorcycles, outselling Victory by more than 10 to 1. But with motorcycling growing more popular among younger consumers and women, Polaris is betting there are enough riders out there for both icons of American road culture. The introduction of the Victory Octane signals a new phase of competition in the cruiser market, giving riders more choice and variety than they’ve had in years.
