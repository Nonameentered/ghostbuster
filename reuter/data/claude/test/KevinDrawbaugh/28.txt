Health Care and Retirement Corp Open to Strategic Transaction, Reports Continuing Rapid Profit Growth

Health Care and Retirement Corp (HCRC), a leading provider of senior living communities and healthcare services, today announced its fourth quarter and year-end financial results. The company reported record profits for both the quarter and full year, continuing its rapid growth. HCRC CEO John Smith attributed the strong results to rising demand for senior housing and healthcare, operational improvements across the company, and strategic acquisitions. 

Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 25% year over year to $2.1 billion. Net income rose 35% to $150 million, or $1.20 per share. For the full year, revenue increased 28% to $8 billion and net income climbed 40% to $560 million. The company expects continued double-digit growth in revenue and profits in the coming year.

The robust financial performance and optimistic outlook suggest HCRC would be an attractive target for potential acquirers, especially large healthcare companies looking to expand into the fast-growing senior services market. HCRC has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy over the past several years and is now open to being acquired by a strategic buyer, according to Smith. "We believe the company is very well positioned, but as part of a larger organization we could accelerate our growth and gain new capabilities that would benefit our customers, employees, and shareholders," Smith said.

HCRC operates over 200 senior living communities, including independent and assisted living facilities as well as skilled nursing homes, across 30 states. It also provides home healthcare and hospice services, primary care clinics, and insurance products tailored to senior citizens. The company employs nearly 50,000 staff. HCRC shares rose over 4% on the news and closed at $37.82, an all-time high. The stock has generated a total return of 240% over the past five years.
