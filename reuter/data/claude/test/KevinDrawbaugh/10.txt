St. Jude Medical Inc's $505 Million Acquisition of Ventritex Set to Proceed Despite Patient Deaths, Says CFO 

St. Jude Medical Inc announced today that it will proceed with its $505 million acquisition of Ventritex, a maker of implantable defibrillators, despite recent concerns over patient deaths linked to a Ventritex device.

“After conducting extensive due diligence, we are confident in the long-term strategic benefits of acquiring Ventritex and moving forward with this acquisition,” said St. Jude Medical Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Sherman in a statement. “Ventritex has a strong portfolio of innovative products, and we believe that by combining with St. Jude Medical’s clinical and regulatory expertise, we can address outstanding device issues and unlock shareholder value.”

Patient advocates have called on St. Jude Medical to abandon its bid for Ventritex after two patients died and several others had to be hospitalized due to faulty Ventritex defibrillators in the past month. The implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which shock the heart back into a normal rhythm, allegedly overheated and short-circuited in some patients. However, Ventritex claims that only a small fraction of the more than 60,000 devices worldwide were affected.

Nonetheless, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation into Ventritex's manufacturing practices last week. “We will be conducting a thorough review of Ventritex's product design, manufacturing, and quality control processes to determine the causes of these device malfunctions,” an FDA spokesperson said. The agency has not issued any recall or safety alerts regarding the devices so far.

Several analysts downgraded St. Jude Medical's stock upon news of the patient deaths and FDA investigation. "The risks seem to outweigh the benefits of going through with this deal at this point," said David Lewis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "There are too many unknown liabilities, and it could turn into a lengthy and costly distraction for St. Jude management."

However, St. Jude Medical's executives argue that backing out of the deal would damage the company's reputation and hurt its acquisition prospects going forward. Calling Ventritex "a leader in defibrillation therapy with a strong pipeline of innovative products," St. Jude Medical CEO Michael T. Rousseau said his company has the experience to address any outstanding issues and ensure high quality standards for Ventritex devices.

The acquisition, announced in January, is expected to close by the end of this month following an extended review process by antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe. Ventritex shares were up 15% on the news of the deal approval, while St. Jude Medical's stock dropped 3.2% in midday trading.
