Retavase Does Not Outperform Genentech's TPA for Treating Acute Heart Attack, Study Finds 

A new study has found that Retavase, a blood clot-dissolving drug, does not work better than Genentech's tissue plasminogen activator or TPA for treating acute heart attacks. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examined 821 patients who arrived at hospital emergency rooms across the country with symptoms of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the most serious type of heart attack.

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either Retavase, made by biotech Chiesi Farmaceutici, or TPA, sold by Genentech as Activase. Retavaseis a recombinant form of urokinase, an enzyme that breaks up blood clots, while TPA is a recombinant form of tissue plasminogen activator, a protein involved in the breakdown of blood clots. Both are designed to restore blood flow in blocked arteries.

The study found that Retavase did not result in significantly better outcomes for patients. After 30 days, 11.3% of Retavase patients had died compared to 9.9% of TPA patients. Retavase patients were also more likely to experience bleeding in the brain, a dangerous side effect. There were no meaningful differences in other measures like chest pain resolution, heart muscle damage, or the need for interventions to open blocked arteries.

Given the lack of differences in key outcomes and the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, the researchers concluded that Retavase offered no clinical benefit over the established treatment with TPA for heart attack victims.  “On the basis of these results, we do not recommend the use of bolus urokinase over TPA for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,” the study authors wrote.

The results are a setback for Chiesi Farmaceutici, which had hoped to establish Retavase as an alternative to TPA, still the gold standard for dissolving clots blocking coronary arteries in heart attack patients. TPA has been used for this purpose for over 20 years and remains the most widely used treatment for acute heart attacks worldwide.
