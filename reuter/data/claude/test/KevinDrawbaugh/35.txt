Option Care Inc Targets Annual Revenue Growth, CEO Comfortable with Wall Street Estimates

Option Care Inc (OPR), one of the largest independent providers of infusion therapy services in the U.S., aims to increase revenue by 10 to 15 percent annually for the next 3 to 5 years, according to Chief Executive Officer John Rademacher.

Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this week, Rademacher said he is comfortable with Wall Street revenue estimates for 2020 and 2021 and optimistic about continued growth in the infusion therapy market overall. He estimates the U.S. infusion therapy market is around $100 billion today and growing 6 to 8 percent annually. 

Option Care offers intravenous infusions and injections of antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and other therapies that patients can receive at home instead of staying in a hospital. The company has over 2,800 clinicians, including pharmacists and nurses, providing infusion services to more than 230,000 patients each year.

Rademacher credits Option Care's dedicated clinician team, nationwide clinical infrastructure, and strategic partnership with Walgreens for helping achieve its growth targets. Option Care acquired Walgreens infusion services business in 2015 and provides services to patients at more than 300 Walgreens locations across the U.S.

The partnership provides "an important competitive advantage for patient access and diversifying our revenue base," Rademacher said. Roughly 25 percent of Option Care's revenue now comes from services for patients with payors like Medicare Advantage plans, Managed Medicaid plans, and accountable care organizations.  

For 2020, analysts estimate Option Care revenue will increase about 12 percent to $2.46 billion. The consensus 2021 revenue estimate is $2.75 billion, reflecting 12 percent annual growth. "While only guidance, these targets seem quite reasonable to me assuming stable pricing and continued solid market growth," said John Murray, an analyst at UBS in a note to investors.

Rademacher did note some "headwinds" around recent changes in Medicare reimbursement rates for home infusion. However, he does not expect major impact from those changes and says Option Care's geographic diversity and payor mix help offset risks from any one area.  

The company's stock rose nearly 3 percent in trading Wednesday following Rademacher's upbeat comments. Option Care shares have climbed more than 60 percent over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming the broader market. With an aging population and shift to lower-cost care settings, the home infusion market appears poised for steady long-term growth. Option Care seems well-positioned to benefit as a leader in this expanding industry.
