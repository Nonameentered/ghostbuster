McDonnell Douglas Corp Profits Up in 1996, Merger with Boeing Anticipated for 1997 Results and Outlook  

Aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas Corp reported higher profits in 1996 on the strength of jetliner sales and improving margins in its space and defense units. The company earned $1.07 billion or $3.35 per share in 1996 compared with $953 million or $3.01 per share in 1995, a 12 percent increase in profits.  

Revenue edged up 2.5 percent to $16.9 billion. The improved performance came even as McDonnell Douglas lost nine civilian aircraft orders during the year. The company finished 1996 with a backlog of $13 billion in unfilled commercial jet orders compared to $15 billion in 1995.

With a megamerger pending with rival Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas leadership touted the improved financial performance as a capstone to a successful restructuring launched in the early 1990s. “Through the dedication and sacrifice of our employees, we dramatically improved our competitiveness and positioned the company for this historic merger with Boeing,” said Harry C. Stonecipher, McDonnell Douglas chairman and chief executive officer.

The merger with Boeing, announced in December 1996, is expected to close in the summer of 1997 if approved by shareholders and regulators. Under terms of the $13.3 billion deal, Boeing will acquire McDonnell Douglas for $48 per share in an all-stock transaction. The combination will result in a single company with a portfolio ranging from jetliners to space shuttles and cruise missiles.

Looking ahead to its final quarters as an independent company, McDonnell Douglas forecast higher earnings in 1997 barring any unforeseen economic upheaval. The company expects to deliver 123 commercial jetliners, about the same as 1996. Revenue and margins in the space and defense units are also expected to continue improving as cost cutting takes hold and contracts won in 1996 and 1997 boost results.

“Barring any adverse industry surprises, 1997 should be another year of solid improvement and progress for McDonnell Douglas as we prepare to join with Boeing to redefine what is possible in aerospace,” Stonecipher said. “Our priorities this year will be maintaining our operational and financial momentum, ensuring a smooth merger transition and continuing to fulfill our obligations to customers, shareholders and employees.”

The merger is sure to bring formidable challenges as the companies integrate large and complex operations. However, McDonnell Douglas leadership believes the combined enterprise will yield substantial cost and revenue synergies, driving greater long-term profits and competitiveness. As it approaches its last months as an independent company, McDonnell Douglas is poised to end its storied history on a high note with continuing momentum in financial performance and a pivotal merger that will shape the future of the global aerospace industry.
