St. Jude Medical Inc Delays Acquisition of Ventritex Inc After Third Patient Death 

Medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc announced today that it will delay the closing of its acquisition of Ventritex, Inc., a manufacturer of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), following the death of a third patient in which a Ventritex ICD may have failed to deliver life-saving therapy. St. Jude had been planning to complete the $325 million all-cash deal on January 15 pending regulatory approval, but will now conduct a full investigation into the potential device malfunctions before proceeding.

According to a statement by St. Jude, the company received three reports in December of Ventritex ICDs failing to detect a patient’s heart going into a dangerous heart rhythm and not delivering an appropriate shock to restore normal heartbeat. In all three cases, the patients lost consciousness and had to receive emergency external defibrillation to save their lives. Two of the three patients did not survive.

“Patient safety is our top priority,” said John Rogers, President of the Cardiac Rhythm Management Division at St. Jude Medical. “While we have not yet determined if there is a defect in specific Ventritex ICDs, we think it is prudent to delay the acquisition closing until we have thoroughly investigated these incidents.” 

 Ventritex also issued a statement saying they were “deeply saddened” by the patients’ deaths and would cooperate fully with St. Jude’s investigation. Ventritex has sold over 75,000 ICDs worldwide, though it is a small player compared to much larger rivals Medtronic and Boston Scientific.

The delay creates uncertainty around St. Jude’s plans to acquire Ventritex, which would give St. Jude a foothold in the global ICD market and boost its cardiac device offerings. However, if a wider problem is found with Ventritex’s ICDs, it may force St. Jude to renegotiate or even cancel the deal. St. Jude’s stock price fell 3% on the announcement of the acquisition delay.

Analysts said the three reported device failures, while still small in proportion to Ventritex’s large base of implanted ICDs, were troubling. “Any malfunction that results in a life-threatening event should be thoroughly investigated, so delaying the close of this deal is the wisest course of action,” said Medtech Analyst Pete Kastner. “St. Jude needs to go in with eyes open to know exactly what they’re getting into.”

St. Jude said it expects the investigation into the ICD failures to take several weeks to complete. The company will update shareholders on the findings and any impact on the Ventritex acquisition when more details become available.
