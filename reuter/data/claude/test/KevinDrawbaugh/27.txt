Angeion Corp in talks with potential distribution partners for medical devices 

Angeion Corp, a medical device maker based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is in discussions with several large healthcare distributors to expand the reach of its cardiopulmonary exercise testing equipment. The company makes non-invasive devices to measure cardiopulmonary health and optimize exercise prescription.

Angeion CEO Brian Brown said the company is looking to partner with major distributors that already have strong relationships with healthcare providers, clinics and hospitals across the U.S. and internationally. “We believe partnering with established distributors will allow us to accelerate sales growth and gain wider adoption of our medical devices, especially our new wireless CPET system,” Brown said.

The discussions are still ongoing, but Angeion hopes to sign partnership deals with one or more distributors later this year. The company’s goal is to boost sales and revenue through indirect sales channels in addition to its direct sales force. Angeion reported revenue of $42 million in 2019, mostly through direct sales, and aims to increase that number by over 20% annually over the next 3-5 years with the help of distribution partners.

Angeion makes cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and pulmonary function testing systems used by physicians and physical therapists to conduct non-invasive diagnostic tests and help create customized exercise plans based on a patient's heart and lung capacity. The company’s flagship product is the wireless CPEX system launched in late 2018 that can conduct various cardiopulmonary tests and wirelessly transmit results to an iPad for review by physicians.  

The medical device market is highly competitive, so gaining the support of large distributors is key to success for a company like Angeion. Partnering with major players that already have a strong presence in clinics and hospitals could significantly raise awareness of Angeion’s products and make them accessible to more physicians and physical therapists. If Angeion is able to forge partnerships this year, its CPET devices may start gaining more mainstream adoption and open up new potential markets for the company.
