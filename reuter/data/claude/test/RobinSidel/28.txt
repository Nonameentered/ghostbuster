Mid-American Waste Files for Bankruptcy, Sells Assets to USA Waste Services for $180 Million

Mid-American Waste, one of the largest trash collection and recycling companies in the Midwest, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reached an agreement to sell most of its assets to competitor USA Waste Services for $180 million. The bankruptcy filing and asset sale come after Mid-American Waste struggled under the weight of increasing costs, declining revenue, and over $250 million in long-term debt. 

Mid-American Waste serves over 2 million residential and 50,000 commercial customers across Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. However, the company has faced significant headwinds in recent years. Rising fuel costs and fees charged by landfills have squeezed operating margins while many customers have reduced or cancelled service due to COVID-19 economic troubles. Revenue for Mid-American Waste decreased by over 12% in 2020 compared to 2019.

Unable to service its substantial debt burden with declining cash flow, Mid-American Waste engaged investment bankers earlier this year to explore strategic options, including a potential sale of the company. According to a company press release, Mid-American Waste chose to file for bankruptcy to facilitate a sale through an auction process. USA Waste Services emerged as the highest bidder, agreeing to purchase over 90% of Mid-American Waste’s assets for $180 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. 

The sale to USA Waste Services, pending court approval, would make USA Waste the second largest waste management company in the region with over 5 million total customers. In a statement, the CEO of USA Waste said, “We have long admired Mid-American Waste and are excited to join forces.  This acquisition will allow us to achieve greater route density, operational efficiencies and cost synergies while also expanding our customer base.” 

For Mid-American Waste employees and customers, the bankruptcy filing and sale to USA Waste introduces both uncertainty as well as opportunity. USA Waste has committed to hiring substantially all Mid-American Waste employees and honoring existing union contracts and customer agreements. However, future changes by the new owner could impact jobs, wages, routes and services. The court must approve the asset sale agreement and is expected to consider the deal at a hearing within the next 30 to 60 days.
