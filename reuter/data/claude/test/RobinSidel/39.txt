ITT Corp. Board Faces Decision on $6.5 Billion Hilton Takeover Bid at Tuesday Meeting  

The board of ITT Corp, the manufacturing conglomerate, is facing a pivotal decision on Tuesday regarding a $6.5 billion takeover bid for Hilton Hotels Corp, the hotel giant. At its regularly scheduled meeting, the ITT board will evaluate the unsolicited offer made last week by private equity firm Blackstone to acquire Hilton for $34 per share in an all-cash deal.

ITT acquired Hilton in a deal worth $10.5 billion in 1998 but has faced struggles in the hotel business since the 2001 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis of 2008. While ITT's defense and machinery businesses have thrived, the corporation has been looking to sell Hilton for over a year to focus on its more profitable divisions. However, ITT has not received any viable offers that meet its price expectations until now.

The Blackstone bid represents a 40% premium over Hilton's stock price before the offer and would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis. Private equity firms have been seeking new deals as markets have recovered and interest rates have remained low, encouraging borrowing to finance takeovers. Still, some analysts question whether Blackstone's bid fully values Hilton's potential for growth and global brand recognition.

For ITT's board, the proposal presents a dilemma. On the one hand, the offer would provide an exit from the volatile hospitality industry and funds that could be reinvested in ITT's core operations. On the other hand, it risks undervaluing Hilton and losing future upside if the hotel sector continues its rebound. The board may push Blackstone for a higher price before accepting the offer or convince the firm to allow ITT to retain a small minority stake in Hilton. Either path could prolong negotiations and risk Blackstone walking away.

With its board meeting imminent, ITT has not announced whether it will recommend accepting or rejecting the Blackstone offer but promised a swift review and response. ITT shareholders have applauded Blackstone's interest but noted that the final decision rests with ITT's directors to determine the appropriate course of action for maximizing value. The outcome of Tuesday's board meeting and subsequent discussions with Blackstone will signal whether one of the world's most well-known hotel brands may be set to change hands after 17 years under ITT's control.
