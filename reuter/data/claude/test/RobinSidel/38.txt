Hilton Offers $6.5 Billion Unsolicited Takeover Bid to ITT Corp 

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. announced an unsolicited offer to acquire rival hotel operator ITT Corp for $6.5 billion in cash and stock on Monday. The bold move seeks to combine two of the largest hotel chains in the world to better compete with growing competition from alternative lodging providers like Airbnb and VRBO.

The proposed deal would pay ITT shareholders $54 per share, a 32% premium to ITT's closing stock price on Friday. Under the terms of the offer, ITT shareholders would receive $3.6 billion in cash and 0.39 of a newly issued Hilton share. The stock component would give ITT investors a 16% ownership stake in the combined company.

In a letter to ITT's board of directors, Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta argued that scale and reach would benefit both companies in today's "evolving and dynamic hotels industry." He touted over $500 million in potential cost savings and revenue synergies that could be achieved in the first two years following a merger. Nassetta said, "By combining our highly complementary businesses, we would generate significant additional long-term value for shareholders, customers, owners, and team members of both companies."

However, ITT's board of directors rejected Hilton's overture, arguing that the proposal "significantly undervalues" ITT and is "not in the best interests of ITT and its shareholders." ITT, which owns brands like Sheraton, Westin, and W Hotels, has been taking its own steps to spin off its timeshare division and focus on its core hotel operations. The company said its strategic plan would generate greater value for shareholders than Hilton's proposal.

Hilton's bold, unsolicited takeover bid underscores the pressures facing major hotel chains. Alternative accommodation firms like Airbnb and VRBO have disrupted the traditional lodging model and taken significant market share, especially among leisure travelers and younger guests. Consolidation may be necessary for the big chains to gain more scale and pricing power versus the upstarts. However, ITT's swift rejection of Hilton's offer shows that major strategic moves will not come easily in this competitive industry. Hilton now faces the difficult decision to either raise its offer, go directly to ITT's shareholders to pressure the board, or walk away from the deal altogether.
