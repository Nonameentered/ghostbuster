Rubbermaid to Acquire Graco to Reduce Reliance on Plastic Amid Rising Raw Material Costs

Rubbermaid Inc., a manufacturer of plastic household products, announced today that it plans to acquire Graco Inc., a maker of baby gear and high chairs, for $3.4 billion. The all-cash deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions as Rubbermaid seeks to diversify beyond plastics.

"This acquisition will enable us to accelerate our strategy of diversification into non-plastics products as we navigate increasing costs and uncertainty in petrochemical markets," said Rubbermaid CEO John Doe in a statement.

Over the past decade, prices for polyethylene and polypropylene, which Rubbermaid uses in the production of products like food containers, trash cans, and storage bins, have become increasingly volatile. Prices spiked in the mid-2000s before collapsing during the financial crisis, then rising and falling again in the years since. The unpredictability has made budgeting and long-term planning challenging for the manufacturer.

The acquisition of Graco, which makes high-margin products like high chairs, strollers, swings, and playards under the Graco and Aprica brands, will reduce Rubbermaid's exposure to plastic resin prices, which now make up nearly 70% of the company's cost of goods sold. Graco's products primarily use metals, fabrics, and other materials. 

Rubbermaid expects the deal to close within three to four months, subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Graco shareholders. Graco will operate as a standalone division within Rubbermaid led by its current management team. Rubbermaid said it expects over $50 million in annual cost savings by consolidating purchasing, optimizing manufacturing, and streamlining distribution.

The acquisition is Rubbermaid's largest to date and the latest in a series of recent deals aimed at diversifying its product mix. Last year, Rubbermaid purchased both Brita, a maker of water filters, for $200 million, and food container company Lock & Lock for $500 million. 

Analysts viewed the Graco deal positively, noting the strategic rationale and potential synergies. "This further accelerates Rubbermaid's transformation into a broader-based consumer products company," said John Smith, an analyst at Consumer Edge Research. Rubbermaid's stock rose over 4% on the news.

With the plastics industry under pressure, more deals may be on the horizon as companies look to adapt to changing market dynamics and less reliance on petroleum-based products. For Rubbermaid, the future may be stainless steel and fabrics instead of plastic.
