CSX Corp. Raises Offer for Conrail Inc. to $9.5 Billion in Ongoing Bidding War with Norfolk Southern Corp. 

CSX Corp. announced today it has raised its offer to acquire Conrail Inc. to $9.5 billion, the latest escalation in an ongoing bidding war with rival Norfolk Southern Corp. The new CSX bid represents an 11% increase over Norfolk Southern's most recent $8.5 billion offer for Conrail, an East Coast rail freight operator.

The back-and-forth bidding has been underway for the past several weeks as CSX and Norfolk Southern, two of the nation's largest rail transport companies, look to gain routes and market share through an acquisition of Conrail. Conrail operates more than 3,000 miles of track in 12 states, handling freight transportation across much of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.

In a statement, CSX chief executive Jim Foote said, “CSX firmly believes in the strategic importance and value of acquiring Conrail, which will provide synergies and long-term benefits to customers, shareholders and employees. Our enhanced offer demonstrates CSX’s confidence in achieving meaningful cost savings and operational efficiencies as part of this transaction.”

However, Norfolk Southern shot back quickly that it remains engaged in the bidding process and considers Conrail an "ideal strategic and financial fit." In its own statement, Norfolk Southern said, "We continue to expect significant cost and operating synergies from combining with Conrail, and we are prepared to take the necessary steps to complete a transaction that provides full and fair value to Conrail shareholders."  

The back-and-forth bidding has caused whiplash for Conrail shareholders and led to a gradual price increase over initial bids. When bidding opened earlier this year, CSX offered $8 billion and Norfolk Southern came in at $7.5 billion. Wall Street analysts expect the bidding to continue as each rail giant looks to gain a leg up in a consolidating transportation and logistics sector. The final sale price for Conrail could exceed $10 billion, which would represent a substantial premium over the company's current market capitalization of $9.1 billion.
