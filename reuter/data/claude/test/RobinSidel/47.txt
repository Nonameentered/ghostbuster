ITT Corp. Sells $300 Million Stake in Alcatel Alsthom to Fend Off Hilton Takeover Bid

ITT Corporation, the U.S.-based conglomerate, announced today that it sold its 11 percent stake in Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications equipment maker, for $300 million. The sale comes as ITT looks to generate cash and raise its stock price in an effort to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corporation.  

Hilton launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT last month, offering $55 per share. ITT's board rejected the bid, calling it "inadequate and opportunistic." In response, ITT has pursued various strategies to make the company less attractive as a takeover target, including cost-cutting measures, accelerating share buybacks, and now the sale of its Alcatel Alsthom stake.

"The sale of Alcatel Alsthom stock is consistent with our strategy to optimize our portfolio and unlock value for shareholders," said ITT CEO Denise Ramos in a statement. "It provides additional capital to advance our growth initiatives and continue creating value."

ITT purchased the 11 percent stake in Alcatel Alsthom in 2015 for $250 million. The $300 million sale price represents a 20% gain on the initial investment. However, ITT's stake in Alcatel Alsthom was worth substantially more last year when Alcatel Alsthom's stock price was trading at a multi-year high. Some analysts argue that ITT is selling the asset at a discount in the short-term interest of boosting its stock price and thwarting the Hilton takeover.

Hilton sees ITT, which owns brands such as Sheraton Hotels, as an attractive takeover target to gain scale in the hotel industry.  ITT would also gain Hilton's hotel brands including Hilton Hotels & Resorts and DoubleTree. However, ITT has said the offer undervalues the company, especially its fast-growing hospitality segment.  ITT's board has implemented takeover defense mechanisms, including a poison pill, to prevent Hilton from proceeding with its hostile bid.   

With the Alcatel Alsthom sale, ITT now has an additional $300 million in cash to execute its standalone strategy focused on its hospitality, transportation, and industrial equipment divisions. However, Hilton may still come back with a higher offer in an attempt to bring ITT to the negotiating table. The takeover battle for control of ITT is shaping up to be a protracted fight.
