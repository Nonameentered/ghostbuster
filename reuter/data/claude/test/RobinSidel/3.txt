CSX Corp's new bid for Conrail Inc may not be strong enough to beat out rival Norfolk Southern Corp's higher offer 

Railroad giants CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp are locked in a bidding war for control of regional rail carrier Conrail Inc. CSX submitted a sweetened $8.9 billion bid late yesterday, raising its offer by nearly 10% from its initial $8.1 billion bid in April. However, Norfolk Southern returned fire within hours, boosting its competing offer to $9.1 billion in cash and stock. 

Conrail's board of directors will now have to determine whether CSX's increased bid is enough to overcome the significant financial advantage of Norfolk Southern's offer. At stake is ownership of Conrail's prized routes and assets in the key Northeast U.S. rail corridor. Both CSX and Norfolk Southern are seeking to expand their rail networks and tap into the major markets served by Conrail, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.

CSX had previously argued that its initial bid made the most strategic and operational sense due to the limited overlap of the two companies' existing rail routes. However, Norfolk Southern countered that its combination with Conrail would generate bigger gains in operating efficiencies and enable new competitive routes, a view that appears to resonate more with Conrail's board and shareholders based on the dueling bids.

The battle for Conrail highlights the hunger among major U.S. railroads for acquisitions that can strengthen their route networks. A wave of mergers in the 1990s reduced the number of large rail competitors, leaving CSX and Norfolk Southern as two of the three biggest operators left standing. Regional and short-line rail carriers like Conrail are attractive targets, but competition is fierce for any properties that become available. 	

For Conrail, its directors must determine how much higher the bids might go to achieve an optimal price for shareholders. Both CSX and Norfolk Southern have significant resources to continue upping the ante, but at some point, further increases provide diminishing returns if too much of the purchase price is paid out in the form of a takeover premium. The board will also evaluate the regulatory risks of the two deals, including whether antitrust regulators may require certain Conrail routes or assets to be divested to preserve competition.
