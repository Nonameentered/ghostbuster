Bidding War for Conrail Inc. Coming to a Close, Legal and Regulatory Battles Looming Ahead  

The fierce bidding war for ownership of Conrail Inc., one of the largest railroad operators in the eastern United States, appears to be coming to an end. After months of competing offers and counteroffers, Norfolk Southern Corp. has emerged as the likely winner in the takeover battle with its archrival CSX Corp. Norfolk Southern announced yesterday that it had reached an agreement to acquire Conrail for $10.3 billion in cash and stock. 

The deal is not yet final and still faces significant legal and regulatory hurdles. CSX, which had previously offered $9.5 billion for Conrail, vowed to challenge the Norfolk Southern bid on antitrust grounds and push for an extensive review from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroad mergers. Industry analysts expect CSX to argue that allowing its chief competitor to gain control of Conrail's routes would severely restrict competition in major markets across the East Coast.

However, Norfolk Southern expressed confidence that its takeover bid would withstand regulatory scrutiny and gain the necessary approvals to proceed. "This transaction will create an exceptionally fluid and efficient rail network that moves goods across the eastern half of the country," said Norfolk Southern CEO James Squires in a statement. If approved, the deal would significantly expand Norfolk Southern's network, giving it ownership of Conrail's rail lines across the Northeast and Midwest.

Both CSX and Norfolk Southern had pursued Conrail as a way to gain scale, cut costs, and boost profitability amid declines in coal and other commodity shipments. Conrail, a formerly bankrupt railroad that was privatized in 1987, operates approximately 6,500 miles of track, employs 9,000 people, and transports 160,000 carloads per year across 18 states. By merging with Conrail, either suitor stands to reap substantial annual savings and revenue gains, according to analysts.
