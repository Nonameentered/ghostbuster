Raytheon Acquires Hughes Aircraft from General Motors in $9.5 Billion Deal, Creating Third-Largest US Defense Contractor  

Defense industry giant Raytheon announced today that it will acquire Hughes Aircraft from General Motors for $9.5 billion in cash and stock, a move that will make Raytheon the third-largest US defense contractor by revenue behind only Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The deal combines two of the leading producers of sophisticated weapons and electronic systems for the Pentagon and commercial customers.  

For Raytheon, the acquisition of Hughes Aircraft is a major expansion of its space and avionics capabilities while also strengthening its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business. Hughes is a leader in aircraft electronics, missiles, satellites and space systems. The deal will add about $6 billion in annual revenue to Raytheon, which had 2019 sales of $29.2 billion. With the addition of Hughes Aircraft, Raytheon's pro forma 2019 revenue would have been $35.2 billion, surpassing Northrop Grumman's $33.8 billion.

"Joining forces with Hughes Aircraft will allow us to offer an even more comprehensive range of end-to-end solutions for our customers in defense, civil government and commercial aerospace," said Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy in a statement. "This strategic merger will accelerate our ability to develop new and innovative systems."  

For GM, the sale of Hughes Aircraft continues its exit from the defense industry to focus on its core automotive business. GM acquired Hughes Aircraft in 1985 but has been winding down its involvement in the unit over the past decade. "While Hughes has been an important part of GM's history, this divestiture allows us to further focus our efforts on our core automotive operations," said GM CEO Mary Barra.

The deal has already received regulatory approval but still needs to pass review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. If approved, the deal is expected to close in mid-2021. While there is some overlap in the product portfolios and customers of Raytheon and Hughes Aircraft, industry analysts expect regulators to approve the deal given the scale and capabilities of their leading competitors in the defense contracting sector.   

The agreement marks the first major acquisition for Raytheon since its merger with United Technologies Corp.â€™s aerospace unit last year. That $135 billion deal created Raytheon Technologies Corp. and consolidated two major suppliers to the Pentagon and commercial aircraft makers. With the new deal for Hughes Aircraft, Raytheon Technologies will have significantly expanded its reach across the defense industry and opened up new opportunities for sales growth in space and military-related electronics.
