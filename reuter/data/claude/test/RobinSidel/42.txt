CVS to Acquire Revco for $2.8 Billion, Expects Positive Impact on Earnings in 1997 and 1998  

CVS Corporation, the nation's largest retail pharmacy chain, announced today that it will acquire Revco D.S., Inc. for $2.8 billion in cash and stock. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 1997 pending regulatory approval. With the acquisition, CVS expects the merger to positively impact earnings over the next two years.

The deal will bring together two of the largest drugstore chains in the U.S., with their combined operations resulting in over 4,100 stores across 37 states and revenues of $15 billion. CVS currently operates 2,500 pharmacies in 15 states primarily in the South and East. Revco operates 1,600 stores across 22 states, largely in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. According to CVS chairman and CEO Thomas Ryan, the complementary footprints of the two companies was a driver of the deal. "By combining our resources, we can accelerate growth in more markets and gain efficiencies of scale to enable us to better serve customers and become an even stronger competitor," said Ryan.

Wall Street reacted positively to the news, with CVS stock jumping over 7% on the announcement. Analysts view the acquisition as a smart strategic move that allows CVS to expand its reach and gain access to Revco's valuable real estate and pharmacy customers. With increasing consolidation in the retail pharmacy sector, the deal will also make CVS more competitive against much larger rivals like Walgreens and Rite Aid.  

CVS expects the merger to add to earnings in 1997 and 1998 through synergies achieved by combining operations. CVS CFO David Denton projects the acquisition will add more than 15 cents to earnings per share in 1997 and over 25 cents per share in 1998. The companies will integrate functions like merchandising, marketing, and administration to achieve cost savings. Denton said, "We expect to achieve significant synergies while also continuing to deliver the great service and value that our customers expect." 

The acquisition of Revco marks the largest deal in CVS's 30-year history as a public company. CVS was advised on the transaction by Morgan Stanley, while Revco received financial advice from Wasserstein Perella. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. CVS and Revco officials expect the acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter pending these approvals.
