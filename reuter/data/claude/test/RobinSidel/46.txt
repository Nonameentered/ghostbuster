Hicks Muse acquires American Home Products Corp.'s food business for $1.3 billion 

Private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst announced today that it has acquired the food business of American Home Products Corp. for $1.3 billion in cash. The deal includes several well-known food brands such as Chef Boyardee pasta, Healthy Choice frozen dinners, Grey Poupon mustard and Progresso soups.

The sale is part of American Home Products’ strategy to focus on its core pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare businesses. “We are streamlining our portfolio to double down on health and wellness,” said John Stafford, CEO of American Home Products. “The food brands, while popular and trusted, no longer fit with our vision for the future.”

For Hicks Muse, the deal represents an opportunity to strengthen its portfolio of food and consumer brands. “These household name brands have enduring popularity and generate steady cash flow,” said Philip Muse, co-founder of Hicks Muse. “We believe there is untapped global potential, especially for brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.”  

Hicks Muse has a track record of acquiring undervalued or underperforming brands and improving their performance through innovation, marketing investment and expansion into new markets or sales channels. The firm will likely aim to refresh the brands with updated packaging and marketing, extend the product lines, and accelerate international growth, especially in emerging markets.

The deal is expected to close within 60 days, pending regulatory approval. Hicks Muse was advised on the transaction by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Simpson Thacher. American Home Products was advised by Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk.

News of the sale sparked mixed reactions. Investors welcomed American Home Products’ renewed focus, sending the company’s shares up 3.4% in morning trading. However, workers at the company’s food division expressed concerns about job security under new ownership. Labor unions intend to closely monitor Hicks Muse’s stewardship of the food brands to ensure good manufacturing jobs are not moved overseas.

Consumer reaction was also mixed. Some saw opportunity for product improvements and innovations. “Hicks Muse can make these comfort food brands better for today’s tastes with fresher ingredients and recipes,” said food industry analyst Meghan Miller. However, others feared new ownership could change or discontinue beloved products.   “I’ve been eating Chef Boyardee since I was a kid. I hope it doesn’t change,” said Louise Thompson, a loyal customer.
