Hilton offers $6.5 billion bid for ITT Corp., industry experts suggest acquisition as a possible defense 

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. announced today that it has made an unsolicited bid to acquire ITT Corp., a hotel management company, for $6.5 billion in cash and stock. The proposed deal would strengthen Hilton's global presence and help the company compete more aggressively against rivals like Marriott International and Hyatt Hotels Corp.

The bid, which values ITT shares at $68 each, represents a 30% premium over ITT's closing stock price on Friday. ITT's board of directors will evaluate the proposal and determine whether it is in the best interests of shareholders. The deal would need approval from regulators and shareholders of both companies.

The hotel industry has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years as companies look to gain scale, cut costs, and improve their digital offerings. A Hilton-ITT deal would create the world's largest hotel chain by number of properties. The combined company would have more than 18 brands and over 6,500 hotels across 121 countries. 

Several industry experts suggested the move could be a preemptive defense by Hilton against potential takeover interest from other players. "Hilton may see ITT as an attractive target before another suitor tries to snatch them up," said Michael Bellisario, senior research analyst at R.W. Baird. "By being an acquirer, it allows Hilton to control its own destiny."

ITT's midscale and budget brands like Holiday Inn and Candlewood Suites would complement Hilton's upscale properties like Hilton and Waldorf Astoria. The deal could yield up to $500 million in cost synergies, according to estimates from Bank of America analysts.

However, the tie-up also brings risks, including the high initial costs to integrate the two companies and potential culture clashes between the organizations. The hospitality industry is also facing economic uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic, though leisure travel is expected to pick up as vaccination rates increase.

Hilton's offer comes three years after its last major acquisition, a $650 million purchase of Twin America in 2018. ITT last explored strategic options, including a possible sale, in 2019 but opted to remain independent. ITT shares closed up 15% on the news while Hilton's stock dropped 4%.
