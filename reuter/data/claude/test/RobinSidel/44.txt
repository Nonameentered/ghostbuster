ITT Rejects $6.5 Billion Hilton Takeover Offer, Considers Selling Non-Core Assets to Boost Shareholder Value    

ITT Corp. announced today that its board of directors has rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from Hilton Worldwide Holdings worth $6.5 billion in cash and stock. In a statement, ITT said the offer “substantially undervalues” the company and is “not in the best interests of ITT and its shareholders.”

ITT, a diversified manufacturing and engineering company based in White Plains, New York, said its board unanimously rejected the offer after concluding that it fails to reflect the value and progress of ITT’s long-term transformation strategy. ITT’s shares rose over 5% on the news, indicating that investors expect a higher bid or other value-enhancing moves.  

Hilton's offer valued ITT at $48.50 per share, representing a 24% premium to ITT's closing share price before the announcement. In its rejection, ITT noted that the offer is below the company’s 52-week high and fails to account for the successful execution of strategic acquisitions and divestitures that have streamlined ITT’s portfolio.

“ITT is well positioned to create significant value for shareholders through the continued execution of our transformation plan,” said ITT CEO Gerald Hill. “Our board and management team stand ready to evaluate any credible offer that fully and fairly recognizes the strength of our brands, depth of employee talent and preferred position in key growth markets.”

In recent months, ITT has explored options to sell or spin off several non-core businesses in its industrial process and motion control unit. Sources say the company aims to focus its portfolio on core aerospace, automotive, and industrial pump businesses. Proceeds from any asset sales would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

The takeover bid comes as consolidation increases in the aerospace and defense sector. Engaged Capital, an activist investor with a 3% stake in ITT, has publicly pushed for strategic steps to boost the company’s lagging share price relative to peers. While ITT appears open to considering credible offers, its swift rejection of Hilton's bid signals the company may demand a significantly higher price to come to the negotiating table. Hilton now must decide whether to raise its offer and continue its pursuit or walk away.
