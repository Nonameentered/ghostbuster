Healthcare and Oil Companies to Join Corporate Merger Boom in 1997 Alongside Telecommunications, Utilities, and Insurance Sectors  

Corporate mergers and acquisitions are poised to accelerate in 1997, extending beyond the telecommunications, utilities, and insurance sectors into healthcare and energy according to industry analysts. Major oil companies and healthcare providers are evaluating strategic mergers and partnerships to gain market share and cut costs as competition intensifies in their sectors.

The surge in overall merger and acquisition activity is fueled by low interest rates, a strong stock market, and a need for companies to get bigger to compete on a global scale. The total value of mergers and acquisitions in 1996 was over $1 trillion in the U.S. alone, a 25% increase from 1995. Experts predict 1997 may set new records, with telecom, utilities, and insurance again leading the way.

"Telecommunications is going through a massive reshuffling right now with the breakup of AT&T, new technologies enabling cable and wireless competition, and the need to build global alliances," said Amy Stevens, senior managing director at Accenture. In utilities and insurance, deregulation and globalization are forcing companies to consolidate to achieve economies of scale and expand into new markets.

Healthcare and energy companies are primed to join the merger spree, analysts say. Cost pressures on hospitals and health insurers are intense, and many see mergers and partnerships as a strategy to gain negotiating power with suppliers and customers. A recent example is the proposed merger of Aetna and US Healthcare, two of the largest U.S. health insurers. In energy, major oil companies are looking to build scale and tap new sources of petroleum outside the U.S. British Petroleum's pending takeover of Amoco for $60 billion may spur other oil giants into dealmaking mode.

While mega-mergers often capture headlines, the bulk of deals are middle-market transactions involving smaller companies. This activity is also expected to rise in 1997 as more companies look to fill product or geographic gaps in their businesses through acquisitions. Strong equity markets are enabling companies to use stock as currency for deals, facilitating activity.  

Overall, experts are bullish on the prospect for significant corporate restructuring in 1997 as companies pursue strategic mergers to cut costs, enter new markets, and build global scale. Healthcare, telecom, insurance, utilities, and energy are industries to watch for major deal flow, as the forces of deregulation and cost pressures drive companies together at an accelerating pace.
