Conrail to Proceed with Shareholder Meeting Despite Norfolk Southern's Latest Attempt to Thwart Merger with CSX Corp. 

Conrail Inc. announced today that it will proceed with its special shareholder meeting on March 15th as planned, despite the latest legal maneuver by Norfolk Southern Corp. to block Conrail's proposed merger with CSX Corporation. Norfolk Southern, which has pursued its own bid to acquire Conrail, filed a lawsuit in federal court this morning seeking to delay the shareholder vote, claiming that proxy materials sent to Conrail shareholders were "materially deficient."

In a statement, Conrail dismissed Norfolk Southern's lawsuit as "a transparent attempt to thwart the will of Conrail shareholders." Conrail's board unanimously approved the merger with CSX last month, saying it would provide the greatest value to shareholders. The surface transportation provider also questioned the timing of Norfolk Southern's latest lawsuit, coming just two days before the scheduled shareholder meeting. 

"Norfolk Southern has had months to review the proxy materials and raise any concerns, yet waited until the eleventh hour in what appears to be a desperate ploy to derail the shareholder vote," said Mark Pedersen, Conrail's Chief Legal Officer. "We are confident that our disclosures comply fully with SEC regulations and that shareholders have all the information they need to make an informed choice on the CSX deal."

Norfolk Southern insists its lawsuit aims only to ensure Conrail shareholders have "full and fair disclosure" before voting on what it called "Conrail management's inferior deal" with CSX. Norfolk Southern has offered to acquire Conrail at a higher price than CSX's $8.4 billion all-stock bid, but Conrail's board has said CSX's offer provides greater strategic benefits and opportunities for growth.

The legal drama is the latest twist in an already complex merger process involving Conrail, one of North America's largest rail carriers. Industry analysts expect a protracted battle over the next several months as shareholders look set to approve the deal but Norfolk Southern uses the courts to try to secure Conrail for itself. While its lawsuit calls for "corrective disclosures" and a temporary delay, Norfolk Southern's ultimate aim appears to be disrupting the CSX merger entirely. All eyes will be on next week's meeting to see if they succeed, at least in achieving the former objective. For its part, Conrail remains defiant that it will merge with CSX on schedule later this year despite Norfolk Southern's obstructionist tactics.
