Tyco Executive Vows Company Will Not Pursue Hostile Takeover of American Standard

Tyco International's chief executive officer Ed Breen pledged today that Tyco will not attempt a hostile takeover of rival plumbing products maker American Standard. Speaking at an investor conference, Breen said Tyco is focused on organic growth and operational improvements, not acquisitions. 

“We have our hands full with integrating past mergers and optimizing our existing business units. Launching a hostile bid for American Standard is not on our agenda,” said Breen. Tyco recently acquired a majority stake in industrial conglomerate Johnson Controls International.

American Standard's stock price rose 3% on the news that it faces less threat of acquisition in the short term. Analysts said Breen's comments were reassuring and allow American Standard's management to focus on their own restructuring plan.

“This is good news for American Standard and allows them to proceed confidently with spinning off non-core assets and revamping their product lines without worrying about a takeover fight,” said James Peterson, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Tyco and American Standard are the two largest manufacturers of toilets, sinks, showers, bathtubs and other plumbing products for homes and commercial buildings in the United States. There has been speculation that further consolidation is inevitable in the plumbing sector. However, Breen said Tyco already has significant opportunities from integrating Johnson Controls that would take priority over any other large deals.  

“We have strong brands, distribution networks, and exposure to construction markets around the world,” Breen said. “Our focus is on realizing the $500 million in cost savings we promised from the Johnson Controls merger. If we can achieve that, it will drive double-digit earnings growth for years to come.”

Based on Breen's comments, analysts said any merger between Tyco and American Standard is unlikely in the next 12 to 18 months as Tyco concentrates on achieving its savings targets from existing operations.
