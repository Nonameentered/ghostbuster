Western Resources Inc. Offers $3.5 Billion to Acquire ADT Ltd. and Become Nation's Top Provider of Electronic Security Services  

Western Resources Inc., a Denver-based provider of home security and automation services, announced today that it has made an unsolicited offer to acquire ADT Ltd. for $3.5 billion in cash. If completed, the acquisition would make Western Resources the largest provider of electronic security services in North America, serving more than 10 million residential and business customers.

The offer represents a 30% premium over ADT's closing share price yesterday. In a statement, Western Resources touted the benefits of combining the two companies, saying it would result in "significant synergies, operational efficiencies, and economies of scale." The combined company would have annual revenues of more than $8 billion and be better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the expanding smart home market.

ADT's board of directors said it will review the offer in consultation with financial and legal advisors to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. ADT provides electronic security, fire detection and alarm monitoring services to over 7 million customer locations. The company was spun off from Tyco International in 2012 and had 2018 revenue of $5.4 billion. Its stock price has declined 15% over the last year as the company faces pricing pressure in its core residential security business.

"We have long admired ADT and believe a combination of our two companies would be very compelling," said Brian Thompson, CEO of Western Resources. "Together, we can better capitalize on the opportunities from the growing array of smart home solutions by leveraging our combined scale and expertise. This proposal represents a unique opportunity to deploy Western Resources' resources to strengthen ADT's business and enhance value for the shareholders of both companies."

Any deal would be subject to the approval of regulators and shareholders of both companies. Three years ago, Western Resources abandoned an unsolicited $45 billion bid for ADT after resistance from ADT management and shareholders. The new offer may face similar headwinds, as ADT's largest shareholder, Apollo Global Management, owns about 65% of ADT stock and ADT's management team has expressed satisfaction with the company's strategic direction. However, at the right price, Apollo and other investors could be persuaded to sell, according to analysts.
