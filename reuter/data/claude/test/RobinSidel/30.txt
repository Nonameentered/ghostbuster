Hilton Hotels Corp launches $6.5B hostile takeover bid for ITT Corp and its top-quality assets 

Hilton Hotels Corporation announced today an unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover bid for ITT Corporation, looking to acquire the company for its high-quality hotel brands and management business. Hilton aims to strengthen its position as the world's leading hospitality company through the acquisition.

The $97.53 per share cash offer represents a 30% premium over ITT's closing stock price yesterday. "This proposal is a win-win opportunity for the shareholders, guests, team members, and owners of both companies," said Christopher J. Nassetta, President and CEO of Hilton. "Together, we will be an even stronger, more innovative company with an enhanced ability to deliver value for all stakeholders."

ITT operates a portfolio of 12 brands across some 5,300 properties in over 100 countries. The crown jewels of ITT's portfolio are its premium and luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, and Canopy by Hilton. By acquiring ITT, Hilton would gain access to a new set of high-spending guests, especially corporate travelers and affluent leisure travelers. 

Hilton's offer comes as ITT is under pressure from activist shareholders to explore strategic options, including a sale of parts or all of the company. However, ITT's board of directors rejected Hilton's initial offer, arguing it "substantially undervalues ITT and is not in the best interests of ITT or its shareholders." ITT's stock price soared 25% on the news of the offer, indicating shareholders expect a protracted negotiation and a higher final price.

Hilton believes that the scale and synergies from a combination would yield double-digit EPS accretion for Hilton shareholders within the first full year. Hilton also expects to achieve $500 million in annual cost savings within two years of closing the deal. "A combined company would benefit from greater efficiencies, technology and innovation across development, sales, marketing, operations and corporate functions," said Nassetta.

However, the hostile nature of the bid and potential regulatory issues could pose significant obstacles to a deal. The merger would combine the two largest companies in the hospitality industry and likely draw close scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and other countries. Debt financing could also be challenging given the sheer size of the transaction. 

Hilton's offer for ITT represents one of the largest ever deals in the hotel industry. After a wave of mergers and acquisitions in recent years, large independents like ITT are seen as attractive takeover targets for major hotel chains looking to gain greater scale and more diverse brand portfolios. If completed, the blockbuster deal would cement Hilton's position as the clear market leader in the global hospitality industry. However, if ITT's board continues to reject Hilton's approach, it could lead to a prolonged takeover battle rife with drama, twists and turns. The coming months will be eventful for the hotel sector either way.
