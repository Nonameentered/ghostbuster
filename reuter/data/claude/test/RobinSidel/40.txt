ITT Corp Chairman Rejects Hilton's Request for Meeting Amid Hostile Takeover Bid  

ITT Corporation chairman and CEO Harold Blake today rejected a request by Hilton Hotels Corporation CEO Christopher Nassetta for a meeting to discuss Hilton's recent $50 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT. In a letter to Nassetta, Blake said the ITT board is "not interested in participating in a meeting to discuss an unsolicited proposal that grossly undervalues our company."

Hilton launched an unsolicited takeover attempt for ITT two weeks ago, offering $85 per share in an all-cash bid for the hotel and gaming company. ITT's shares were trading at $62 before the bid, but quickly shot up to $82 following the announcement. ITT rejected the initial bid within a week, calling it "opportunistic and substantially inadequate." However, Hilton has pressed on with its attempt, taking its offer directly to ITT shareholders and asking for a meeting with ITT's board.

In today's letter, Blake wrote that ITT's board and management team "have been singularly focused on executing our strategic plan to continue building long-term shareholder value, and we will not be distracted from that effort by Hilton's inappropriate proposal." 

ITT's rejection of Hilton's request for a meeting is the latest twist in what is shaping up to be a prolonged takeover battle between the two hospitality giants. Hilton appears determined to push forward with a deal that would combine two of the largest hotel and casino operators in the world, while ITT is digging in to fight off what it sees as an undervalued bid. ITT has implemented a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan to thwart a potential hostile takeover, and has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Hilton arguing that a merger of the two companies would substantially reduce competition.

Hilton has argued that by combining, the two companies could realize up to $500 million in cost savings and revenue synergies. However, ITT has said that any synergies from a deal would not justify the price Hilton has offered. Analysts expect Hilton to raise its bid in the coming weeks to win over ITT shareholders if it wants to push a deal through. For now though, the back-and-forth war of words between the two sides is continuing with no end in sight.
