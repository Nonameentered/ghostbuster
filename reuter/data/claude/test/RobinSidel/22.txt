CSX Chairman Confident in Conrail Merger Approval, Calls Rival Bidder's Move "Desperate"

CSX Corp. Chairman and CEO Michael Ward expressed confidence today that federal regulators will approve CSX's $8.4 billion acquisition of Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), despite a last-minute rival bid from Norfolk Southern Corp.

"We have an agreement in place, we have shareholder support, and we believe we have a strong case that will satisfy regulators," Ward said in an interview. " Norfolk Southern's move appears desperate, coming just days before Conrail shareholders are set to vote on our agreement."

CSX agreed in November to acquire Conrail, which serves customers in the Northeast and Midwest. The deal would divide up Conrail's operations, with CSX taking over routes in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Detroit. Norfolk Southern would gain lines in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.

However, Norfolk Southern earlier this month made an unsolicited $9.5 billion offer for the entirety of Conrail. Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO Jim Squires argued that an acquisition by NS would be more straightforward and have a better chance of approval by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

Ward dismissed that view and said he remains confident CSX and Norfolk Southern will ultimately get regulatory approval to split Conrail. "We've done extensive planning and agreed to appropriate remedies for any competitive impacts. Our proposal is clearly in the public interest," he said.

A special Conrail shareholder meeting is scheduled for Thursday to vote on the CSX deal. CSX and Conrail's boards have recommended approving the acquisition. Ward said Conrail's board and executives "share our view that the NS offer is inadequate and not viable." The NS bid would still need approval from Conrail's board, which appears unlikely.

If shareholders approve the CSX deal as expected, the Surface Transportation Board review is the final hurdle to complete the acquisition. CSX hopes to receive approval within a year, but some analysts think the review could take 18 months or longer due to the complexities of overhauling Conrail's rail network.

Norfolk Southern has urged the board to reject CSX's plan and agree to its rival bid, but most analysts believe regulators prefer the agreed-upon division of Conrail rather than allowing NS to acquire the entire network. "The CSX-NS plan has been carefully crafted to minimize disruption, whereas an NS-only deal could face significant regulatory risk, in our view," according to a research note by investment bank Morgan Stanley.

Ward said he remains confident the acquisition will ultimately be approved as agreed. "This transaction will provide benefits for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, shareholders and the public," he said. "We look forward to bringing the process to a conclusion and getting to work with Conrail's team to realize those benefits."
