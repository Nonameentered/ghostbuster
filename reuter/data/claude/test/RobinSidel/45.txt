Analysts Skeptical of ITT Corp's Plan to Sell Non-Core Assets Rather Than Accept $6.5B Hilton Hotels Bid  

ITT Corp's surprise rejection of Hilton Hotels Corp's $6.5 billion takeover bid in favor of selling off non-core businesses has left analysts questioning whether that strategy will unlock more value for shareholders.

On Monday, ITT announced it would pursue a plan to split into three separate public companies by spinning off its water and defense businesses to focus on its hospitality and travel operations. ITT's board determined this "transformation plan" could generate more value over time compared to an outright sale of the company.

Hilton Hotels had offered $50 per share in cash and stock for ITT last week, representing a 30 percent premium over ITT's share price at the time. ITT shares fell 8 percent after the company announced its spin-off plan and rejection of the Hilton bid.

"While pursuing a breakup strategy is an option, we believe an outright sale to Hilton would have provided the best outcome and maximum value to shareholders," said Joseph Spak, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. He argues the bid placed a high valuation on ITT's crown jewel hospitality assets, and the spin-offs introduce uncertainty, execution risks and the possibility of leaving value on the table.

ITT's planned spin-offs have also raised concerns over how it will allocate valuable assets like brands and real estate between the new companies. There are also unanswered questions about the leadership, balance sheets and growth prospects of the spin-off entities.

However, ITT's management insists the spin-off plan will maximize shareholder value over the long run by creating "pure-play" companies that can focus on their respective segments. CEO Michael Alpert said the board was "unanimous" in believing this strategy is superior to a Hilton tie-up and provides more opportunities for future growth and partnerships. 

While investors await more details of the spin-off plan, analysts remain skeptical ITT's rejected takeover bid was the right move. Hilton may also respond by increasing its offer or launching a hostile bid in an effort to prevail in the takeover battle. The coming months will reveal whether ITT's bold gamble pays off or proves to be a missed opportunity.
