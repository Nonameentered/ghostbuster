Conrail Director Abstains from Key Vote on Controversial Merger Deal with CSX Corp. 

The board of directors at Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail) voted 7 to 1 to approve a merger agreement with CSX Transportation (CSXT) in a deal worth $10.4 billion. However, in a surprise move, longtime Conrail director Thomas Wilson abstained from voting, citing concerns over "rushed negotiations" and lack of transparency for shareholders.

Conrail and CSXT announced plans to merge in January, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The merger would combine two of the largest freight rail operators on the East Coast of the U.S. and is poised to generate significant cost savings and new economic opportunities, according to executives from both companies. 

Mr. Wilson, who has served on Conrail's board for 12 years, raised objections early in the deal process but was unable to block the merger agreement from advancing to a shareholder vote. Speaking after the board meeting, he expressed frustration that his input seemed to be "largely ignored" during negotiations with CSXT. 

"While there are certainly benefits to increased scale, we have a duty to shareholders to make certain any deal is structured properly and protects their long-term interests," Mr. Wilson said. "I am not yet convinced this merger agreement accomplishes that."

Two major shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, have recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the deal at Conrail's annual meeting next month. The Surface Transportation Board also approved the proposed merger in an initial regulatory ruling last week, though a final decision is still pending.

Conrail executives defended the terms of the deal and remain confident shareholders will ratify the agreement. "This transformative merger will unlock new growth opportunities and efficiencies for customers, employees, and communities across our network," said Conrail CEO Linda Brennan. 

CSXT chairman Paul Simon expressed disappointment in Mr. Wilson's abstention but said the company will continue to make the case for the merits of the deal. "We believe this merger is in the best interests of all stakeholders and will create sustainable value for shareholders and customers alike," Mr. Simon said. 

The final vote by Conrail and CSXT shareholders will take place at their respective annual meetings on May 15. If approved, the merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year following additional regulatory review.
