Norfolk Southern Proposes New Plan to Derail Conrail-CSX Merger  

Norfolk Southern, one of the largest rail operators in the eastern United States, announced today a proposal to acquire a major stake in Conrail, an important freight rail carrier that services much of the Northeast and Midwest. The announcement was a surprise move aimed at derailing a pending merger between Conrail and rival CSX Transportation.

Under the proposal, Norfolk Southern would gain control of 61% of Conrail's assets, including key rail lines in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana and Illinois. Norfolk Southern would pay CSX $2.1 billion for its rights to acquire Conrail. CSX and Conrail entered an agreement last month under which CSX would fully acquire Conrail for $3.9 billion, but that deal is still pending regulatory approval.  

Analysts see the Norfolk Southern proposal as an attempt to break up the CSX-Conrail merger by presenting regulators with an alternative that provides more competition in the rail freight industry. Norfolk Southern argues that its plan would preserve competition in three major rail corridors - New York to Chicago, Detroit to Pittsburgh, and New Jersey to St. Louis - where a combined CSX-Conrail would dominate freight traffic.   

CSX immediately criticized the Norfolk Southern proposal as "an anti-competitive tactic designed to block efficient rail consolidations." CSX officials also argued that a fractured Conrail would be less efficient and more costly to operate. Conrail has not yet taken a public stance on the Norfolk Southern offer. Regulators at the Surface Transportation Board, which oversees rail mergers, will have to evaluate both proposals to determine if either deal should be approved.  

The jockeying for control of Conrail highlights its strategic importance in the rail freight network of the eastern U.S. Conrail operates a web of rail lines covering much of the Northeast and Midwest, connecting major ports, cities and industrial hubs. Both Norfolk Southern and CSX have been eager to acquire Conrail to expand their networks, gain access to new markets and increase efficiency. The Norfolk Southern proposal introduces a new wrinkle that could prolong the consolidation process and intensify the rivalry between the two major rail competitors.
