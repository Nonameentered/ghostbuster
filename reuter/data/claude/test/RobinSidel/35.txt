CGIP Chairman Seeks to Sell 20% Stake in Cap Gemini, Considers Share Buyback and Other Investment Options 

The chairman of Compagnie Générale d’Informatique et de Participations (CGIP), the holding company that controls a 52% stake in Cap Gemini SA, is exploring options to sell nearly 20% of Cap Gemini shares currently held by CGIP. Paul Hermelin, who also serves as CEO of Cap Gemini, announced that CGIP is assessing opportunities to sell between 15 to 20% of Cap Gemini shares over the next 6-18 months through a private placement or secondary public offering. 

The sale of shares would generate funds for CGIP to diversify its investment portfolio and pursue new opportunities for growth outside of the IT services market. While Cap Gemini has delivered steady growth and double-digit profit increases over the past few years, CGIP aims to mitigate risk by expanding into other industries. However, Mr. Hermelin emphasized that CGIP intends to maintain majority control and continue its long-term strategic vision for Cap Gemini as a leader in digital transformation and technology consulting services.

Along with the share sale, Mr. Hermelin said CGIP is also considering a buyback of Cap Gemini shares to support the stock price and increase shareholder value. Cap Gemini has a strong balance sheet with €1.2 billion in available cash and limited debt, providing flexibility for share repurchases and future acquisitions. A share buyback program is one option to deploy excess cash in a way that benefits both CGIP as the controlling shareholder as well as external shareholders.

Mr. Hermelin did not specify potential acquisition targets or other investment areas that CGIP may pursue, noting that further details will be announced as options are evaluated over the coming months. Any major transactions would also be subject to approval by Cap Gemini’s board of directors.  The announcements reflect Mr. Hermelin’s longer-term strategy to strengthen Cap Gemini’s position as an industry leader while diversifying CGIP’s holdings to maximize shareholder returns over the next decade.
