Norfolk Southern Launches New Plan to Thwart Conrail Merger, Experts Skeptical of Success  

Norfolk Southern Corp unveiled a new plan today to acquire Consolidated Rail Corp, aiming to thwart CSX's pending acquisition of Conrail. Norfolk Southern announced a surprise bid to buy Conrail for $10 billion in cash and stock. The bid comes just weeks before Conrail shareholders are set to vote on CSX's $8.5 billion takeover offer. 

Norfolk Southern has long opposed CSX gaining control of Conrail, arguing that it would grant CSX an unfair competitive advantage. "We believe our offer is superior for Conrail shareholders, customers, and employees," said Norfolk Southern CEO James Squires. "It also is best for competition, rail service, and the shipping public."

However, many industry experts are skeptical that Norfolk Southern's 11th hour bid will succeed. "The likelihood of this bid disrupting the CSX deal is very low at this point," said Bascome Majors, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. He notes that CSX's offer has already gained regulatory and shareholder approval. "Conrail's board has a fiduciary duty to get the best deal for shareholders, but Norfolk Southern would have to offer a significantly higher price to warrant scrapping the CSX merger," Majors said.

Norfolk Southern's bid may also face significant regulatory hurdles and risks. The Surface Transportation Board and U.S. Justice Department have already approved the pending CSX acquisition, so they would have to reverse course to allow a rival Norfolk Southern bid. Antitrust concerns could also pose problems for Norfolk Southern gaining control of Conrail's assets and routes.  

CSX dismissed Norfolk Southern's bid and said it is determined to complete its acquisition of Conrail. "Our transaction will benefit all stakeholders and we remain committed to concluding the merger approval process," CSX said in a statement. The company still needs Conrail shareholder approval at a special meeting on January 12. Conrail's board has recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the CSX deal.

Conrail's stock price jumped 15% on news of Norfolk Southern's rival bid, indicating that investors see opportunity for a bidding war. However, with regulatory reviews already complete and shareholder approval imminent, most see little chance of Norfolk Southern wresting Conrail away from CSX at this late stage. Barring a massive increase in its offer price, Norfolk Southern's bid looks likely to be too little, too late in its effort to outmaneuver CSX.
