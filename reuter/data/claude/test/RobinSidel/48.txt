ITT Corp Expects Sale of Non-Core Assets to Take Up to Six Months, Madison Square Garden Properties Likely to Sell Quickly  

ITT Corp announced today that the sale of several non-core business units could take up to six months to complete as it works to divest assets and focus on its core industrial businesses. The company has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to help facilitate the sales of its connector and interconnection solutions business, automotive thermal solutions business, and friction technologies business. 

ITT's CEO Luca Savi stated in a press conference, “We have already received strong interest in these business units, but divesting operational divisions takes time to maximize value for our shareholders. We anticipate the sales processes for each unit could last three to six months to allow for comprehensive due diligence, negotiation of transaction terms, and regulatory review.”

In contrast, ITT’s Madison Square Garden-related properties are expected to sell much more quickly given their desirability and the simplicity of real estate transactions. ITT has owned and operated Madison Square Garden in New York City and the adjacent Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden concert venue for the past decade. ITT will hire real estate firm CBRE to market and sell the properties, which according to industry experts could fetch up to $4 billion given New York City commercial real estate prices.

The decision to divest the Madison Square Garden properties and the three industrial business units is part of ITT’s strategic pivot to focus on its core pump, flow control, and short-cycle engineered products businesses. Mr. Savi stated, “While Madison Square Garden and these industrial units have been valuable assets for ITT, they require substantial management attention and capital resources to operate that will be better spent strengthening and growing our primary businesses.” 

ITT expects the divestitures will generate substantial cash proceeds to help reduce debt and fund internal investments in research and development, technology upgrades, and potential tuck-in acquisitions. The company’s stock price rose over 4% on the news, indicating investor confidence in ITT’s strategic direction. However, some analysts warned that if the sales are not completed in a timely manner or at attractive valuations, ITT’s stock price could face downward pressure. ITT remains confident, though, that strong interest in the assets and capable investment banks leading the sales will result in successful divestitures over the next six to nine months.
