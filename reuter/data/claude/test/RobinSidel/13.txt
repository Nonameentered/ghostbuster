Bank Merger Activity Expected to Heat Up Again as Firms Seek to Emulate NationsBank's Expansion  

The banking industry is poised for a new round of mergers and acquisitions as major regional players seek to match the growth of NationsBank Corp., analysts say. NationsBank's blockbuster merger with BankAmerica Corp. last year has put pressure on competitors to gain scale and expand into new markets. 

Regions Financial Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc. and KeyCorp are likely to be on the prowl for partners that can boost their size and geographic reach, industry experts predict. These regional banks want to remain relevant as supersized banks like NationsBank and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. use their clout to attract large business clients and gain competitive advantages.  

“The NationsBank-BankAmerica deal really upped the ante and changed expectations about scale,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. “The big regionals realize they have to get bigger and stretch out beyond their current footprints to compete on a national basis.”

Several major regional banks have expanded recently through strategic acquisitions. However, more transformative deals are anticipated in the coming months. Possible targets include weaker banks in adjacent markets as well as smaller rivals within the regionals’ current areas of operation. Some analysts foresee tie-ups between regional banks themselves to quickly gain the necessary scale and reach.

A cycle of bank mergers in the late 1990s fueled a strong stock market rally as investors bet that industry consolidation would boost profits. A new wave of deals could provide a lift for bank stocks and the overall market, analysts said. However, investors also worry that mergers could damage the ability of regional banks to provide personalized service—long a competitive advantage over giant rivals.  

 Consolidation in the banking sector has been gaining momentum for over three decades. Relaxed regulations, technological changes and fierce competition have compelled midsize and smaller banks to join forces simply to survive. The trend is likely to only accelerate as behemoths like NationsBank make size paramount. For most regional banks, the options seem clear: get big or get taken. Analysts say the next year should provide greater clarity on who will be the consolidators and consolidated in the banking industry.
