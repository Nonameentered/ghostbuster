Mid-American Waste Systems Files for Bankruptcy, Agrees to Sell Assets to USA Waste Services Inc.

Mid-American Waste Systems, one of the largest waste hauling and recycling companies in the Midwest, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today in federal court. The company also announced that it has reached an agreement to sell substantially all of its assets to USA Waste Services Inc., a national waste management company, for $350 million. 

Mid-American Waste Systems has been struggling under a heavy debt load and decreasing profit margins over the past several years. The company had overextended itself acquiring smaller waste haulers in the early 2000s to gain market share. It was unable to raise prices for customers fast enough to offset increasing costs in recent years, causing the company's earnings to suffer. Mid-American holds contracts to collect waste and recycling for commercial and residential customers in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Wisconsin.

Under the terms of the deal with USA Waste Services, Mid-American will continue normal operations as it works through the bankruptcy process. USA Waste Services will act as the "stalking horse" bidder for Mid-American's assets, meaning other potential buyers will have the opportunity to make competing offers through a court-supervised auction process. If a higher bid does not emerge, USA Waste Services will acquire Mid-American's routes, trucks, facilities, and other assets to fold into its existing operations. USA Waste Services operates in all 50 states and Canada, with 67,000 employees and $15 billion in annual revenue.

"We are pleased to have reached an agreement with USA Waste Services that will maximize value for our stakeholders while ensuring the responsible and orderly transfer of operations," said John Smith, chief executive officer of Mid-American Waste Systems. "USA Waste shares our commitment to customer service and environmental stewardship, so we anticipate a smooth transition for our employees and customers."

The agreement with USA Waste, subject to court approval and any competing bids, is expected to generate enough proceeds to pay off Mid-American's creditors and bondholders in full. The company's 3,200 employees will be transferred to USA Waste. Residential and commercial customers should continue to place waste and recycling at the curb as usual, and will receive specific information from USA Waste on any service changes 30 to 60 days after the completion of the sale.
