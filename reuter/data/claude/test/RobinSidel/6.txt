Conrail rejects $10.5 billion takeover bid from Norfolk Southern, chooses merger with CSX instead  

Consolidated Rail Corporation, one of the major freight rail networks operating in the northeastern United States, announced today that it has rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from Norfolk Southern Corporation valued at $10.5 billion. Instead, Conrail has agreed to an all-stock merger with CSX Corporation, another major rail freight carrier. 

The decision comes after several months of negotiations between Conrail, Norfolk Southern, and CSX. Norfolk Southern first made a bid to acquire Conrail in November last year, offering $92 per share to Conrail shareholders, a 35% premium over Conrail's stock price at the time. CSX soon entered the fray with a competing bid. After evaluating both proposals, Conrail's board of directors determined that a merger with CSX would offer greater value for shareholders as well as more benefits for customers, employees, and local communities.

Under the terms of the agreement, Conrail shareholders will receive 1.35 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share. Based on CSX's closing stock price on Monday, the deal values Conrail at $98 per share, or $10.7 billion overall. The combined company will operate more than 18,000 miles of track across 21 states in the eastern United States. According to executives, the merger will allow for more efficient transportation of goods across Conrail and CSX's networks, creating an enhanced platform for economic development in the region.

"This merger agreement with CSX represents an exciting new chapter for Conrail, one that provides substantial and immediate value for our shareholders as well as benefits for our customers, employees, and the communities we serve," said James Hixon, Conrail's CEO. On news of the merger, shares of Conrail stock rose nearly 30% in morning trading. CSX stock was up over 15%. Norfolk Southern stock, meanwhile, dropped by almost 5%.

In accordance with U.S. regulatory laws, the merger will require approval from the Surface Transportation Board before it can be finalized. Leaders of Conrail and CSX expressed confidence that the STB will rule in favor of the deal, citing the competitive benefits for rail customers and communities. Most industry analysts also expect the merger to gain regulatory approval, although Norfolk Southern has indicated it may appeal the decision. 

The merger is expected to close by the end of the year pending regulatory approval, at which time Conrail will operate as a subsidiary of CSX.
