Bidding war over Conrail Inc may be over, but legal and regulatory battles loom 

The fierce bidding war between CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp for control of Conrail Inc appears to be coming to an end, but the $8.5 billion deal is now facing significant legal and regulatory hurdles. CSX and Norfolk Southern, two of the largest rail operators in the Eastern United States, had been locked in a battle for months to acquire Conrail, a major freight rail network in the Northeast and Midwest. 

CSX emerged victorious with a final bid of $92 per share in cash and stock, topping Norfolk Southern's $90.50 per share offer. The deal is valued at $8.5 billion including the assumption of $1.6 billion of Conrail debt. If approved, it would be the largest rail merger in U.S. history and have major implications for freight rail traffic across much of the country.

However, the blockbuster acquisition must now pass review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, which regulates rail mergers, as well as federal antitrust regulators. Legal experts anticipate the review could drag on for 12 to 18 months given the significant competition and antitrust issues at stake. A further complication is that CSX and Norfolk Southern had previously agreed to divide up and acquire Conrail jointly in 1996, but that deal ultimately fell apart amid regulatory concerns.

Opponents argue that allowing two major Eastern rail operators to acquire Conrail would reduce competition, raise shipping costs for many companies and give the combined company too much pricing power. Farming and agriculture groups in particular have raised concerns about the impact on the transport of agricultural goods. 

CSX and Norfolk Southern counter that the deal will improve efficiency, reduce freight traffic congestion, and strengthen the role of rail in transporting goods over long distances. They also argue that trucking provides sufficient competition to constrain rail pricing. The companies have pledged to divest some Conrail assets to win regulatory approval, but details on those divestitures have not yet been announced.

The outcome of the review is far from certain and regulators could impose substantial conditions on the deal or reject it altogether if they believe it will substantially lessen competition. Canadian Pacific Railway has also expressed interest in acquiring parts of Conrail, so regulators may consider that option as a way of preserving competition. All sides are gearing up for what is expected to be an intense, drawn-out regulatory battle with major implications for the U.S. rail industry and the overall economy. The only certainty at this point is that the final chapter in the Conrail takeover saga has yet to be written.
