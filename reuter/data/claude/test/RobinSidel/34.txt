ITT Corp. Considering Acquisition as Defense Against Hilton's $6.5 Billion Bid   

ITT Corp. announced today that it is exploring strategic options, including potential acquisitions, in response to Hilton Worldwide's unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover bid last week. ITT, a diversified manufacturer and technology company, appears ready to fight  the hostile takeover attempt from its rival Hilton.   

In a statement, ITT said its board of directors "unanimously rejected" Hilton's offer, calling it "opportunistic and substantially undervalues ITT." The offer represents a 20% premium over ITT's stock price before the bid. But ITT claims the bid fails to adequately value its strong market positions and future growth potential in several business lines, including water and fluid handling systems, aerospace components, and industrial process equipment.

ITT's announcement signals that it is not willing to entertain Hilton's offer and is ready to pursue alternative strategies to fend off the takeover. "We are confident in our strategy and believe we can deliver significantly more value to our shareholders than Hilton's offer," said CEO Mary Kim in the statement. ITT appears poised to leverage its solid balance sheet and borrowing capacity to acquire other companies as a way to make itself a less attractive takeover target. Potential acquisition targets could include competitor Flowserve in the flow control and fluid handling space, or Woodward, which makes components for aerospace and industrial equipment. 

However, some analysts argue ITT may have limited options to ward off Hilton indefinitely. "While ITT is rightly rejecting this initial offer, its standalone options are limited given its size," said Steven Marks, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. "Hilton has the resources to increase its offer and still generate synergies from a deal." 

Hilton has not yet responded to ITT's rejection of its offer. Under securities laws, Hilton cannot improve on its offer for at least four weeks. Hilton first approached ITT about a potential deal several months ago, but ITT refused to engage in deal talks, according to people familiar with the matter. Hilton decided to go public with its offer last week in an effort to pressure ITT to the negotiating table. 

The high-stakes maneuvering is set to continue over the coming weeks with ITT working to strengthen its position, and Hilton plotting its next move in a risky takeover battle in the industrial sector. For now, ITT has won the first round by swiftly rejecting Hilton's surprise offer, but the fight for control of the company appears far from over.
