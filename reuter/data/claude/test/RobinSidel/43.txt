Here is a draft 500-word news article with the given headline:

CVS Corp merges with Revco D.S. Inc to dominate U.S. drugstore market, while smaller chains scramble to join forces 

CVS Corporation, the nation's largest retail drugstore chain, announced today that it will acquire Revco D.S. Inc for $2.8 billion in stock and cash. The deal combines the two largest drugstore chains in the U.S. and will make CVS the dominant player in the retail pharmacy sector with over 4,000 stores across the country.

The merger comes amid increasing competition in the drug retailing industry. Chains like Walgreens and Rite Aid have been expanding aggressively through new store openings and acquisitions of smaller regional chains. The CVS-Revco deal is expected to generate significant cost savings through economies of scale and operational efficiencies. CVS expects to achieve annual cost synergies of $100 million within two years of closing the deal.  

“This acquisition will enable us to achieve additional efficiencies that will translate into lower prices and an even better experience for our customers,” said Tom Ryan, Chairman and CEO of CVS Corporation. “By combining the CVS and Revco brands, we will strengthen our position as the pharmacy of choice across America.”

Smaller drugstore chains are now scrambling to find partners. Fred's, a regional chain with over 650 stores, is rumored to be in talks with Walgreens for a potential sale. Industry experts expect further consolidation in the coming years as mid-sized chains get acquired to compete more effectively with the large national players.  

The CVS-Revco deal is subject to approval from the Federal Trade Commission but is expected to face little regulatory resistance given that the companies have a minimal geographic overlap. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year. CVS shareholders appear to welcome the news, with the company's shares up over 5% on the announcement. The acquisition is seen as an opportunity for CVS to gain further scale and unlock significant cost savings, which should translate into higher profits and shareholder returns over the long run.
