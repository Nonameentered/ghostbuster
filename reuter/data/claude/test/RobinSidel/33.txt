Norfolk Southern CEO Remains Optimistic Despite Difficult Talks Over Future of Conrail Inc.  

Norfolk Southern Corp. chief executive James Squires said Tuesday he remains hopeful the railroad can reach an agreement with competitor CSX Corp. over the fate of Conrail Inc., a jointly owned rail network that serves much of the eastern U.S. However, Squires acknowledged that negotiations have been "challenging" and a resolution may still be some time away.

The two railroads have been in discussions for over a year on how to divide up operations of Conrail, a crucial rail network they have jointly owned since the 1990s that serves major cities from Chicago to New York. Norfolk Southern has proposed fully acquiring Conrail's operations in Ohio and Michigan while giving CSX control of the network in other states. But CSX has pushed for a more evenly split deal that would give it access to key routes in the Midwest.  

The talks come as railroads face broader challenges from declining coal shipments and a softening industrial economy. Acquiring full control of Conrail's routes could help boost traffic and profits for either Norfolk Southern or CSX. However, a deal that favors one railroad too heavily could face opposition from regulators and shippers.

In an interview, Squires said "good faith" discussions are continuing with CSX but that the companies remain "far apart" on some issues. He said any deal must be "equitable and balanced" to gain necessary approvals. "We're not there yet, but we're still working at it," he added.  

Squires said a resolution could take "weeks and months" but expressed hope one can be reached before the end of the year. If a voluntary agreement can't be reached, the matter could end up in arbitration before federal regulators. "That is not our goal, but it's an option," Squires said.  

For now, Norfolk Southern is focused on boosting profits by cutting costs and improving service. The railroad reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings last week, with profits up 16% on new efficiencies. But shares have declined over the past year amid the broader challenges facing the industry.

In afternoon trading Tuesday, Norfolk Southern shares were down 1.2% at $118. CSX shares were off 0.5% at $47.23.
