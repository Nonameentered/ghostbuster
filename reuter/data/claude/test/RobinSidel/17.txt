ADT Rejects $3.5 Billion Takeover Bid from Western Resources

Home security giant ADT announced today that it has rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from Western Resources Corp worth $3.5 billion in cash and stock. In a statement, ADT's board of directors said that the bid “substantially undervalues the company and its future growth prospects” and is “not in the best interests of ADT shareholders.” 

Western Resources, an energy and infrastructure conglomerate based in Texas, made the offer to acquire all outstanding shares of ADT last week for $12.50 per share, representing a 30 percent premium over ADT's stock price at the time. In its offer letter, Western Resources said that ADT would benefit from its resources and expertise, and that together the companies could accelerate ADT's transition into home automation and the “smart home.”

ADT's board clearly did not share that view. In its rejection statement, the board said that Western Resources offer “fails to reflect ADT's leadership position and competitive advantages in the large and growing residential security and smart home markets.” The statement also pointed out that an independent review of ADT's business concluded the company could achieve a stock price of up to $18 per share over the next 12-18 months based on its current growth plans.

ADT was spun off from Tyco International in 2012 and had 2018 revenue of $5.2 billion, providing residential security systems and monitoring to over 7 million customers in the U.S. and Canada. Despite steady revenue growth and strong market position, ADT's share price has lagged the broader stock market in recent years. The company went public in January 2018 with an IPO price of $14 per share but has traded below that level for most of the time since. ADT's majority owner and largest shareholder is private equity firm Apollo Global Management, which holds about 70 percent of ADT's shares.

In its offer letter last week, Western Resources said it had secured $4.5 billion in financing commitments from major banks to fund the cash portion of the deal. The company's CEO said an acquisition of ADT would turn Western Resources into a “world-class smart home and security provider.” Western Resources shares rose over 10 percent on the news of the offer for ADT but have since retreated as the market reacted to ADT's rejection.

While ADT has soundly rejected this takeover attempt, some analysts say the company remains an attractive target for prospective buyers that want to gain a foothold in the expanding home security and automation market. ADT and its rivals are benefiting from rising consumer interest in products like smart thermostats, voice assistants, and video doorbells. ADT may face pressure to consider future takeover offers that more fully value the company, or take other actions to boost shareholder returns, some analysts said. For now though, ADT seems determined to carry on with its current strategy as an independent company.
