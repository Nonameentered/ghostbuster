CVS to Acquire Rival Revco in $2.8 Billion Deal, Creating Second Largest Drug Store Chain in the US

CVS Corp, the largest retail pharmacy chain in the U.S., announced today that it will acquire rival Revco Discount Drug Stores Inc. for $2.8 billion in cash. The deal will make CVS  the second-largest drug store chain in the country by revenue behind Walgreens. 

The acquisition brings together the two largest regional drug store chains in the eastern U.S. and gives CVS a presence in several new states, including Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Revco operates more than 2,000 stores predominantly in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions. The combined company will have over 5,000 stores across 38 states and aims to gain purchasing power and reduce costs.

"This acquisition will enable us to enhance our position as the premier integrated pharmacy health care provider in the U.S.," said Tom Ryan, CVS Chairman and CEO. "The addition of Revco significantly expands our store base and geographic reach, providing customers with even greater access, choice and value."

Revco was taken private in 1999 in a $1.8 billion leveraged buyout by investment group DLJ Merchant Banking Partners. The company struggled in the years following the buyout due to increasing competition from large national chains like CVS and Walgreens as well as big box retailers entering the pharmacy space like Kroger and Target. However, Revco has seen a recent turnaround under CEO Mark Montgomery, streamlining operations and focusing on customer service and value.

Montgomery said, "CVS presented an attractive opportunity for Revco to combine with a respected industry leader.  Our similar company cultures and values, as well as shared mission to provide outstanding customer service and value, make this an ideal partnership." Montgomery will remain with the combined company in an advisory role to help with the transition.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval but CVS expects it to close by the end of the third quarter. To finance the acquisition, CVS said it would issue both short-term and long-term debt. The company said that with the cost savings from the merger, the deal is expected to add to its earnings within the first year after closing. CVS shares rose nearly 5 percent on the news, while Revco is privately held. The pharmacy sector has seen increasing consolidation recently in order gain scale against larger competitors.  

With the addition of Revco, CVS will operate even more stores across the U.S., strengthening its competitive position. However, the company will have to work to seamlessly integrate Revco and achieve the anticipated cost savings and synergies to make the acquisition pay off. Overall, though, this deal signals CVSâ€™s ambition to expand its footprint and gain market share in an increasingly competitive industry.
