Healthcare and Oil Companies Expected to Join Telecommunications, Utilities, and Insurance in 1997's Corporate Merger Boom, Experts Say  

The record-breaking mergers and acquisitions seen in the telecommunications, utilities, and insurance industries in 1996 are expected to accelerate in 1997 and spread to healthcare, oil, and technology companies, according to industry experts. With deregulation occurring across multiple sectors of the economy and companies seeking growth through consolidation, the stage is set for big deals across most major industries this year.

In telecommunications, the Sprint-MCI and PacTel-SBC mergers in 1996 totaled over $70 billion but were only the beginning, experts say. More pairings among major long-distance and local phone companies are anticipated, as the industry consolidates into a smaller number of giants offering bundled phone, wireless, cable, and Internet services.  

The insurance industry also experienced a wave of mega-mergers in 1996, including Travelers Group's $4 billion acquisition of Salomon Brothers and Zurich's purchase of Kemper. As companies look to cut costs by gaining scale and diversifying their offerings, additional mergers are expected in 1997, particularly in the property and casualty sector.  

Healthcare, a historically fragmented industry, is ripe for consolidation, experts note. Hospital systems have been merging at a rapid clip, and the pharmaceutical industry is under pressure to rein in costs through merger-driven synergies. Major oil companies are also seeking to expand into natural gas and renewable energy through acquisitions of smaller firms.  

The high-tech field, while not yet seeing the huge deals common in other industries, may also witness more mergers in 1997, especially among biotech, software, and Internet companies looking to gain new capabilities, access additional intellectual property, and increase their consumer bases through consolidation.   

With interest rates low, corporate profits healthy, and companies under pressure to grow to please shareholders, chief executives and their boards are likely to find mergers and acquisitions appealing, experts say. All signs point to 1997 continuing the trend of massive industry consolidation through multi-billion dollar deals.
