Conrail Rejects $10.5 Billion Takeover Offer from Norfolk Southern, Pursues Merger with CSX 

Consolidated Rail Corporation, commonly known as Conrail, announced today that its board of directors has rejected an unsolicited $10.5 billion takeover offer from Norfolk Southern Corporation and will instead pursue a merger agreement with CSX Transportation.

Conrail, a major freight rail transporter in the Northeastern United States, said the bid from Norfolk Southern "substantially undervalues" the company. Conrail has been in talks over the last several months with CSX Transportation about a potential merger of equals that would create the second-largest rail operator in North America behind Union Pacific.

In a statement, Conrail CEO Jack Johnson said, "After a thorough review and analysis of Norfolk Southern's offer by Conrail's board of directors, along with our management team and financial and legal advisors, it is evident that the offer substantially undervalues Conrail and is not in the best interest of our shareholders." Johnson added that a merger with CSX would create "material synergies that are far in excess of what Norfolk Southern's proposal could achieve."

Under the terms of Norfolk Southern's offer, shareholders of Conrail would receive $92 per share in cash, representing a 22% premium over Conrail's closing stock price on Friday. Conrail shares jumped 15% on news of the offer this morning but gave up all of those gains and then some after the rejection was announced. Conrail stock is now down nearly 10% to $78 per share. Norfolk Southern's stock is also trading lower following the news.

In response, Norfolk Southern said it remains committed to the deal and expressed disappointment at Conrail's "shortsighted" decision to reject its compelling offer. Norfolk Southern CEO James Squires said in a statement, "Our proposal would deliver immediate and substantial value to Conrail shareholders while benefiting customers, employees, and the environment. We urge Conrail's board to reconsider its position and consider the many benefits of this combination."

Conrail and CSX have been in formal merger discussions for the past three months to join their railway networks and create a single system spanning 20 states across the Eastern U.S. The merger would improve efficiency and speed up deliveries, generating $1.5 billion in savings per year for the two companies once integrated, according to Conrail. No financial details of their deal have been publicly disclosed yet. The merger still requires approval from shareholders and regulators.

Today's developments come amid a wave of rail industry consolidation as companies seek to cut costs and boost profitability in the face of slumping freight volumes. Canadian Pacific's pending $28 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern and Canadian National's proposed $33.6 billion purchase of U.S.-based logistics company Kansas City Southern highlight the trend.
