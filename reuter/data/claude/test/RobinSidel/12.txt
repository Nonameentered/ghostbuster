Texaco Inc. Completes Exit from Chemicals Business with $600 Million Sale 

Texaco Inc. announced today that it has completed its exit from the chemicals business with the sale of its Texas petrochemical facility to Huntsman Corp. for $600 million in cash. The transaction marks the end of Texaco's long history in petrochemicals as the company focuses on its core oil and gas operations.

The Port Neches plant, located along the Sabine-Neches Waterway in Port Neches, Texas, has the capacity to produce various chemical products used to make plastics, synthetic fibers, detergents, and adhesives. It started operations in 1940 and was acquired by Texaco in 1968. The facility has over 700 employees.

Huntsman, a major global manufacturer of innovative and sustainable chemical products, said it plans to retain the existing workforce at the plant which will become a part of Huntsman's global petrochemicals division. "We see significant growth opportunities by integrating the facility into our Gulf Coast operations," said Huntsman CEO Peter R. Huntsman. "The plant strengthens our petrochemicals portfolio with its ability to produce key intermediate chemicals for many of the products we manufacture."

The sale is the final step in a restructuring program that Texaco began in 1994 to streamline its operations and generate cash to reduce debt. The program included asset sales, job cuts, and the spinoff of the company's plastics and tire businesses into two separate public companies. Texaco sold its olefins and derivatives business in 1996 and its aromatics business in 1998. "With this transaction, our chemicals divestiture program is now complete," said Texaco CEO Erle Nye. "We can now focus entirely on our exploration and production operations as we continue to build shareholder value."

The $600 million sale price demonstrates the strong demand for Gulf Coast petrochemical assets despite industry fluctuations. "This is an excellent outcome that reflects the quality of the facility and its workforce," Nye said. The deal is expected to close within 90 days pending regulatory approvals. Citigroup acted as Texaco's financial advisor for the transaction.
