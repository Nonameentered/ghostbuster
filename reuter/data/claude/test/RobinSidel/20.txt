Norfolk Southern launches new effort to derail Conrail-CSX merger with proposal to buy stake in Conrail

Norfolk Southern Corp. announced today that it has made an offer to acquire 42 percent of Conrail Inc.'s stock in an effort to derail Conrail's planned merger with rival CSX Corp. Norfolk Southern's unsolicited bid values Conrail at $100 per share, a 25 percent premium over Conrail's closing price yesterday. The offer represents Norfolk Southern's latest tactic to break up the Conrail-CSX deal, which would unite two of the largest rail systems in the eastern United States.

"This is clearly an attempt by Norfolk Southern to disrupt the Conrail-CSX merger and gain control of key rail assets for itself," said John Smith, a transportation analyst with JP Morgan. "After failing to convince regulators and shareholders that the original CSX deal was anti-competitive, Norfolk Southern is now aiming for a hostile takeover of Conrail."

Norfolk Southern argues that its offer is superior to the CSX bid and would produce greater benefits and network efficiencies. But Conrail and CSX are likely to reject Norfolk Southern's proposal and proceed with their planned merger. The two companies announced an all-stock deal in December that would combine Conrail's rail network across the Mid-Atlantic with CSX's system across the East and Midwest. 

The Conrail-CSX merger has already gained approval from Conrail shareholders as well as federal regulators, although the U.S. Justice Department has imposed several conditions on the deal to address competitive concerns. The merger is expected to close early next year.

Norfolk Southern has aggressively lobbied against the Conrail-CSX merger, claiming that it would reduce competition and lead to job losses, service issues, and higher costs for rail customers. By buying a large minority stake in Conrail, Norfolk Southern would gain three seats on Conrail's board, theoretically allowing it to influence the company's direction. However, without majority control, Norfolk Southern would still face a difficult path to unwinding the existing Conrail-CSX merger agreement.

In response to Norfolk Southern's bid, Conrail said its board of directors "will carefully evaluate this proposal to determine the course of action that is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.‚Äù CSX said it intends to proceed with closing its deal with Conrail. The outcome of this latest twist in the competition for Conrail control remains highly uncertain.
