Hicks Muse's Appetite for Food Companies Continues with $1.3 Billion Acquisition 

Private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst announced today that it has acquired ConAgra's refrigerated prepared foods business for $1.3 billion in an all-cash deal. The deal is the latest in Hicks Muse's string of acquisitions in the food industry, as the firm looks to build a portfolio of complementary food brands.

The ConAgra unit produces pre-made meals, snacks, and side dishes sold under brands like Bertolli, P.F. Chang's Home Menu, and Marie Callender's. It is expected to generate over $1 billion in revenue this year. Hicks Muse sees the opportunity to roll up other promising small and midsize food brands, take advantage of operational synergies, and spur faster growth. "This platform provides a great opportunity to build a top refrigerated, prepared foods company through acquisition and management of strong, authentic brands," said Principal Christian Schade in a statement.

Founded in 1989, Hicks Muse has a long history of dealmaking in the food industry. It previously owned brands such as Beech-Nut baby food, Terra Chips, and Stubb's barbecue sauce, before selling most of its food assets to other private equity firms and diversifying into retail, energy, and other sectors. However, in recent years, the firm has returned to the food industry with force, acquiring frozen Mexican food maker Ruiz Food Products in 2017 for $1.4 billion and nostalgic snack brand Hostess Brands in 2019 for $620 million. The latest ConAgra deal brings Hicks Muse's food and beverage portfolio to over $5 billion in annual revenue, by far its largest exposure to any single industry.   

The ConAgra deal is also a sign of increasing private equity activity in the packaged foods industry. Major food companies have been shedding non-core brands and businesses to focus on their flagship products, creating opportunities for buyout firms to pick up the divested assets and wring out costs. At the same time, demand for prepared meals, snacks, and dinner alternatives has surged due to busier lifestyles and more dining at home. This powerful combination means private equity will likely remain hungry for more food deals to come.
