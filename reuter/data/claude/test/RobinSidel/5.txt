CSX and Conrail to Announce Sweetened Terms for $8.5 Billion Merger  

Railroad giants CSX Corp and Conrail Inc. are expected to announce revised terms for their proposed $8.5 billion merger today after facing pushback from regulators and shareholders over the original deal. 

According to people familiar with the matter, CSX will increase the cash portion of the offer to Conrail shareholders to $4.6 billion from $3.9 billion, raising the total value of the deal to $9.2 billion. The new terms are intended to appease concerns that the deal undervalued Conrail, a profitable freight rail operator that controls key rail networks in the northeastern United States.

The augmented offer comes after the U.S. Surface Transportation Board raised objections to the merger, citing potential threats to competition. The board oversees rail mergers and said the deal risked reducing choice for freight shippers in major markets like New York and Philadelphia. Shareholder advisory firms had also urged Conrail investors to reject the initial bid, arguing CSX’s offer was too low given Conrail’s strong financial performance and growth prospects.

If approved, the merger would combine two of the largest rail networks in the eastern U.S., expanding CSX’s reach into major metropolitan areas. The deal highlights the pressure on freight rail companies to gain scale and improve efficiency as their customers, major shippers like UPS and FedEx, consolidate operations.

CSX Chief Executive Jim Foote said the transaction would benefit customers, communities and shareholders. "We firmly believe that this combination will provide enhanced benefits and drive incremental growth  opportunities for our business," Mr. Foote said. A Conrail spokeswoman declined to comment ahead of the announcement.

The new deal terms are likely to sway Conrail’s board and shareholders, who rejected the initial bid last month. At $115 per Conrail share, the sweetened offer would provide about a 20% premium to Conrail’s stock price before deal talks were reported. CSX shares rose 3% on the news in early trading, while Conrail shares jumped 15%.

If the companies can secure shareholder and regulatory approval, the merger could close as soon as this fall. The deal would rank among the largest rail mergers in years, capping a wave of consolidation that has left most freight rail traffic in the U.S. and Canada under the control of a few large companies.
