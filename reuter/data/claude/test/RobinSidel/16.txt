Service Corp to Continue Pursuing Acquisitions After Withdrawing Bid for Loewen Group Inc. 

Service Corporation International announced today that it has withdrawn its $3.2 billion bid to acquire Loewen Group Inc., citing an inability to agree to terms with Loewen's board of directors. However, Service Corp CEO Tom Ryan said the company remains actively engaged in pursuing additional acquisition opportunities to continue its growth.

"While we are disappointed we could not come to an agreement with Loewen at this time, Service Corp continues to be in a strong position to execute on strategic acquisitions that meet our financial and operational criteria," Ryan said in a statement. "The death care industry remains highly fragmented, and we believe there are many family-owned funeral home businesses and smaller chains that would benefit from joining Service Corp to gain operational efficiencies and access to capital."

Service Corp is the largest owner and operator of funeral homes and cemeteries in North America, with more than 1,500 locations across the U.S. and Canada. The publicly traded company has a long track record of successful acquisitions, acquiring more than 200 funeral homes and cemeteries since 2013 alone. However, the Loewen acquisition would have been Service Corp's largest deal to date.  

Loewen Group operates over 700 funeral homes, primarily in the western U.S. and Canada. In a statement, Loewen's board said the company "continues to perform well as an independent organization, and we believe we have significant opportunities for continued growth and success." The board left the door open to a future deal, saying it "remains open to considering strategic opportunities that maximize shareholder value."

With over $500 million in cash on hand and an additional $1 billion available through a revolving credit facility, Service Corp is in a strong position to continue an active pursuit of acquisitions to further consolidate the highly fragmented death care industry. The company will remain disciplined in finding acquisition targets that meet its key criteria, including providing synergistic opportunities to gain operational efficiencies and increase profitability.   

The withdrawal of the bid caused Loewen's stock price to drop 12% in trading today following the announcement, while Service Corp's stock rose 3% on the news. Despite walking away from what would have been its largest deal to date, investors appear confident in Service Corp's acquisition strategy and management's ability to find alternative deals to continue driving growth.
