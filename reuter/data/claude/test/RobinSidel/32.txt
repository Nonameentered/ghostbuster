ITT Corp to Defend Against Unsolicited Bid from Hilton Hotels Corp

ITT Corp, the diversified technology and engineering firm, is preparing a defense against an unsolicited takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp. ITT's board of directors voted unanimously to reject Hilton's offer of $42 per share for the company, arguing the bid "significantly undervalues" ITT's assets and future growth prospects. 

The board is concerned that selling the company now would not maximize shareholder value. ITT's stock price has stagnated in recent years as the company has struggled with debt and activist investor criticism. However, ITT's leadership believes the company is poised for a turnaround based on a new strategic plan focused on streamlining operations and investing in core businesses like water treatment equipment and aerospace components.

Hilton sees an opportunity to diversify its business through an acquisition of ITT, gaining access to new revenue streams and technologies that complement its hotel operations. Hilton has significant cash reserves and believes it can achieve greater efficiencies by combining ITT's infrastructure with its own. Hilton argued in a letter to ITT's board that a deal would provide "compelling value" to shareholders of both companies.

ITT responded that the timing of Hilton's offer is "highly opportunistic" given ITT's recent challenges and that Hilton's bid fails to account for the progress ITT has made in its restructuring efforts and the benefits that will generate in the coming years. ITT also noted that Hilton's offer provides no premium over ITT's average stock price over the last month. ITT has hired Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor to help defend against Hilton's offer and pursue other strategic alternatives.

The standoff sets the stage for a potentially protracted takeover battle. Hilton could decide to launch a hostile tender offer directly to ITT shareholders or take its case to ITT's shareholders at the company's next annual meeting. However, that approach also risks damaging ITT's business by introducing uncertainty and disruption. Both companies have a lot at stake in the outcome of this corporate clash.
