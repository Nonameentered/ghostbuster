Western Resources Inc to Increase Offer for ADT Ltd in Hostile Takeover Bid

Western Resources Inc announced today that it will increase its takeover offer for ADT Ltd, raising the stakes in an ongoing hostile bid for the security services company. Western Resources said it will now offer $45 per share for ADT, a 15% increase over its previous $39 per share offer which ADT rejected as inadequate. 

The sweetened offer values ADT at $8.1 billion. ADT's board of directors has previously urged shareholders to reject Western Resources' takeover bid, saying it significantly undervalues the company. However, the increased offer price may test the resolve of ADT's board and shareholders.

Western Resources first made an offer for ADT in January, beginning an acrimonious takeover battle between the two companies. Western Resources, an Australian investment conglomerate, argues that ADT would benefit from its capital and global reach. However, ADT's management has said Western Resources' takeover attempt is opportunistic following a recent drop in ADT's share price.

ADT provides security monitoring and alarm systems for over 7 million homes and businesses across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The company has more than 50,000 employees and annual revenue of $10.2 billion. However, ADT faces increasing competition from smaller upstart competitors as well as tech giants expanding into home security like Amazon and Google-Nest. ADT's stock price has declined more than 30% over the past year as a result.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Western Resources said: "Our increased offer demonstrates the seriousness of our proposal and our desire to work with ADT's board and management to complete this transaction. We hope the board and shareholders will reconsider our good faith proposal, which provides compelling value in both the short and long term.‚Äù

However, ADT again rejected the revised offer, saying it still significantly undervalues the company. In its own statement, ADT's board said: "After careful consideration, including reviewing a revised proposal from Western Resources Inc, ADT's board has unanimously determined that the revised proposal continues to substantially undervalue ADT." 

The hostile takeover battle looks set to continue as Western Resources pressures ADT's board and shareholders to accept its offer. With its latest salvo, Western Resources is betting $45 per share is an offer ADT shareholders won't refuse. But for now, ADT's board is holding firm that the company is worth more still. All eyes will be on how many of ADT's shareholders agree.
