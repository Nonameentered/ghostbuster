Norfolk Southern Prepares to Buy Nearly 10% of Conrail in Railroad Giant Control Fight   

Norfolk Southern Corp., one of the nation's largest railroad operators, announced today that it intends to purchase nearly 10 percent of rival Conrail Inc.'s stock in an effort to gain greater control over the company. The move is the latest volley in an ongoing battle between Norfolk Southern and CSX Corp., another leading rail company, to acquire Conrail.

According to a Norfolk Southern spokesperson, the company will purchase up to 9.9 percent of Conrail's outstanding shares at a cost of over $1 billion. While less than a controlling stake, the purchase would make Norfolk Southern one of Conrail's largest shareholders and give it more sway in the company's decision making. The shares are being purchased from Loews Corp., an insurance company that has been divesting its holdings in Conrail. 

The purchase intensifies Norfolk Southern's campaign to acquire Conrail, a profitable rail freight operator based in Philadelphia with routes along the East Coast and Midwest. For over a year, Norfolk Southern and CSX have been engaged in a contest to take over Conrail in what would be one of the biggest railroad mergers in decades. By purchasing a significant block of shares, Norfolk Southern hopes to advance its cause and push Conrail's board to accept its $9.1 billion takeover bid over CSX's offer.

However, the move is not without risks and CSX may respond with a counteroffer for Conrail's shares. There is also a possibility that Norfolk Southern's share grab fails to change the position of Conrail's board, which continues to support CSX's merger proposal. Nonetheless, Norfolk Southern's chief executive called the share purchase "an opportunity to accelerate the acquisition of Conrail" and vowed to continue the company's efforts to complete a strategic merger he views as highly synergistic. The outcome of the control battle remains uncertain but is pivotal for shaping the future competitive landscape in the U.S. freight rail industry.
