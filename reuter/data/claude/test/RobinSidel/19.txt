Tyco International Bids $4 Billion for American Standard; Offer Rejected 

Tyco International Ltd. made an unsolicited bid to acquire American Standard Companies Inc. for $4 billion in cash this week. The bid represented a 20% premium over American Standard's closing share price. However, American Standard's board of directors rejected the offer, saying it "substantially undervalued" the company. 

Tyco is a diversified manufacturing and service company that makes products ranging from security systems to flow control valves. It has a market capitalization of over $20 billion. American Standard is best known for its plumbing products, including Champion toilets, Crane sinks, and Club bath and shower systems. It also has a heating and air conditioning division and several international operations. The company has a market value of $3.2 billion.

In a letter to American Standard's board, Tyco Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski said the acquisition would help Tyco expand into new product categories and gain American Standard's well-known brands. "By combining our companies, we see an opportunity to leverage infrastructure, distribution channels and operational strengths across both businesses to drive strong growth," Kozlowski wrote.

However, American Standard's board responded that Tyco's bid "does not adequately reflect the fundamental value and earnings potential" of the company, especially its iconic brands and international reach. "Following a comprehensive review, our board determined that Tyco's proposal substantially undervalues American Standard and fails to recognize the company's bright prospects for continued growth and increasing shareholder value," the board wrote in a letter to Kozlowski.

The rejected offer highlights the consolidation taking place in the industrial and manufacturing sectors as large companies look to gain scale and market share. Last month, Ingersoll-Rand agreed to buy Schlage Lock parent company Allegion plc for $6.3 billion. Other recent deals include Johnson Controls' $13 billion merger with Tyco Fire & Security in 2016.

Analysts had mixed views on the proposed American Standard deal. Some felt the 20% premium and multiple of 11 times earnings offered was fair, given the cyclical nature of American Standard's business. However, most agreed with the company's board that American Standard could achieve higher valuations from other acquirers that see greater potential strategic and operational synergies, especially with its building technologies division. All analysts expect American Standard to remain independent for now but say future deals are likely.

Tyco's Kozlowski said the company would remain opportunistic in expanding through acquisitions. For its part, American Standard's board stated it is "fully committed to serving the best interests of all shareholders and will evaluate all options for creating shareholder value." So for now, it's back to business as usual but more consolidation in the future is probable.
