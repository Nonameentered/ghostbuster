Conrail and CSX Increase Their Bid for Conrail, Offering Shareholders an Additional $870 Million  

Railroad giants Conrail and CSX today announced an increased bid to acquire Conrail, upping their offer to Conrail shareholders by $870 million in cash. The amended agreement now values Conrail at $9.3 billion, representing a premium of nearly 20% over Conrail's unaffected share price before the announcement of the original merger agreement in March.

The increased bid is an effort by Conrail and CSX to counter a rival $10 billion bid for Conrail last month by competitor Norfolk Southern. The competing Norfolk Southern bid threatened to upend the Conrail acquisition, leading Conrail and CSX to increase the sweetness of their deal. The enhanced cash offer provides an immediate boost to shareholder returns while providing increased deal certainty.  

"We believe our amended agreement is superior and represents compelling and immediate value for Conrail shareholders, " said James M. Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer of CSX.  "Together, Conrail and CSX will have an enhanced ability to connect customers to new and existing markets with a robust international rail network and significant supply chain advantages."

The original deal, announced in March, would combine two of the largest East Coast railroads, allowing them to cut costs and boost profit margins in the highly competitive rail freight market. The combined company would control nearly 20,000 miles of track, employ about 27,000 workers, and generate more than $13 billion in annual revenue.    

The Surface Transportation Board, which regulates proposed railroad mergers, already approved the original Conrail deal. Conrail and CSX will need to submit paperwork to modify their original application based on the increased offer terms before the deal can move forward with an updated timeline. The companies expect the acquisition to close by early next year, subject to approval from the STB and Conrail shareholders.

Conrail's board of directors has approved the amended merger agreement and recommends that Conrail shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. A special meeting of Conrail shareholders will be held on a date to be determined to vote on the proposed acquisition. If approved, the deal would mark the largest railroad takeover since Berkshire Hathaway acquired BNSF in 2010. Conrail and CSX shares rose 3% and 1.5% respectively on news of the increased offer.
