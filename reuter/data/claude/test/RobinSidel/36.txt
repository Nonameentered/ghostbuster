Top Rail Executives Meet to Resolve Conrail Takeover Battle 

Top executives from CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., the nation's third- and fourth-largest rail carriers, met this week for closed-door negotiations aimed at resolving their prolonged battle to acquire Conrail Corp., the major rail freight carrier in the Northeast. 

Representatives from CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Conrail have been locked in contentious discussions for over six months on how to divvy up Conrail's routes and assets. The dispute has delayed Conrail's long-planned privatization, frustrating officials who had hoped to complete a deal by early this year.

At issue is how best to split Conrail's 15,000 miles of track in a way that preserves competition in the region. Both CSX and Norfolk Southern currently compete for freight traffic along parts of Conrail's network, and officials worry that giving the entire system to one carrier could raise rates for shippers and hurt service. However, divvying up the routes in a way that maintains competition on all tracks has proven challenging.

Three previous rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement, casting doubt over the complex merger and Conrail's future. However, there were signs this week that the impasse may be breaking. Following two 10-hour days of discussions, top executives from all three railroads released a joint statement saying, “We made substantial progress and will continue negotiations over the coming days. We remain committed to completing this transaction as expeditiously as possible.”

While details of the negotiations remain private, some analysts speculated the breakthrough may involve splitting Conrail's prized routes through Pennsylvania and CSX taking a larger share of tracks through Ohio and Indiana in exchange. Conrail's routes through New York and New Jersey would likely remain competitive under any deal. 

If approved by regulators, a split of Conrail would mark the first time since rail deregulation in 1980 that such a large rail network has been divided between competing companies. Many shippers and government officials are hoping the resolution of the Conrail takeover battle can usher in a new era of competition in the rail freight industry.
