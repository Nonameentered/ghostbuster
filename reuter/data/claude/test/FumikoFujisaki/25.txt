Japanese Banks Take Action to End Financial Woes Ahead of Deregulation Era 

Major Japanese banks are undertaking aggressive steps to improve their financial health ahead of impending deregulation that will open up the nation's financial sector to more competition. The government is set to remove several longstanding protections for domestic banks over the next few years, exposing them to threats from foreign and non-traditional competitors.

In response, banks are shoring up their balance sheets, cutting costs, and exiting or restructuring less profitable businesses. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group—Japan's three largest banks—all reported profits for the latest fiscal year after several quarters of losses. The banks benefited from lower credit costs as well as efforts to dispose of noncore assets and reduce expenses.

The improved results suggest a gradual turnaround is under way for Japan's banking industry, which has struggled for decades with bad loans and shrinking margins. "The major banks have been doing their homework to prepare for deregulation," said Toshihiro Uomoto, a professor at Waseda University. "They have been cutting costs, strengthening their balance sheets and focusing on their core businesses."

Still, significant challenges remain. Interest rates in Japan remain extremely low, crimping the margins banks make from lending. Japan's central bank pushed its main interest rate into negative territory this year, aiming to spur lending and inflation. But negative rates also weigh on bank profits. 

Banks also face technological threats from startups and other new entrants in financial services. Japan's regulators have made it easier for non-banks to enter the payments and other financial businesses. Against that backdrop, Japanese banks are accelerating their investments in technology to digitize their operations and roll out new mobile and online platforms for customers.

The overall health of Japan's banking system remains solid, with nonperforming loan ratios at major banks below 2%--their lowest levels in decades. Billions of dollars of public funds injected into banks during the 1990s and 2000s have largely been repaid. Still, uncertainties cloud the sector's outlook.

Deregulation may intensify competition for the most profitable customers and drive down lending rates, crimping already thin interest margins. And perpetually slow economic growth in Japan will continue to hamper loan demand for years to come. For now, though, Japan's biggest banks appear to be in a stronger position to weather the challenges ahead. With their balance sheets in better shape, cost bases leaner and risk management improved, "the major banks seem ready for deregulation," said Waseda University's Mr. Uomoto.
