Nomura struggles to regain trust after scandal involving suspected illegal deals  

Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, is working to rebuild trust after revelations of suspected illegal share deals orchestrated by former executives. Nomura announced a reshuffling of its top management this week in an effort to move past the scandal and improve compliance. However, analysts say the firm faces an uphill battle to regain investor confidence.

In December 2021, Nomura disclosed that securities regulators were investigating former senior executives for arranging illegal share deals with investors in 2015 and 2016. The deals, known as “wash trades,” involve trading shares at inflated prices to generate brokerage commissions. Regulators suspect Nomura employees helped orchestrate the deals to generate at least $300 million in improper fees.  

The scandal has been a major blow to Nomura's reputation in a country where trust and integrity are highly valued. The brokerage has lost clients andseen its share price drop nearly 30 percent since the news broke. "There is no doubt our reputation has been seriously damaged," said Nomura CEO Kentaro Okuda in a statement. "Rebuilding trust is our top priority."

As a first step, Nomura appointed new leadership of its wholesale business, which serves institutional investors and was at the center of the scandal. It also created a new senior role to oversee compliance and business ethics across the wholesale division. However, some analysts argue more drastic action may be needed. "People expect a complete overhaul after something of this scale," said Naoki Kamiyama, a brokerage analyst at CLSA Securities in Tokyo. 

Nomura also faces legal and regulatory consequences. The Financial Services Agency, Japan's securities regulator, is expected to issue a business improvement order, which will require Nomura to submit plans to overhaul internal controls and risk management. Meanwhile, the brokerage may face large penalties if the FSA determines violations were intentional. Criminal charges against former executives are also possible.

The harsh penalties recently imposed on another major Japanese brokerage, SMBC Nikko Securities, provide a precedent. Last December, SMBC Nikko was issued a six-month business suspension by the FSA for similar wash trading offenses that spanned 15 years. The brokerage was also fined $1.5 billion, a record for a Japanese firm.

Stiff punishments alone may not satisfy those affected, however. Nomura also faces numerous investor lawsuits in connection with the scandal, which could cost tens of millions of dollars to settle. "Nomura betrayed our trust," said Yoshihiro Sato, whose investment firm did business with the brokerage. "You can't just wave a magic wand and make that go away."

With its reputation in tatters, Nomura has a long road ahead to restore confidence in stakeholders and the public. But executives insist they are committed to meaningful reforms to overhaul corporate culture, ensure ethical practices, and prevent future scandals. "This is the biggest challenge in Nomura's history," CEO Okuda said. "But we are determined to emerge a stronger, better firm." Time will tell if Nomura's efforts are enough to win back trust that took decades to build but only days to unravel.
