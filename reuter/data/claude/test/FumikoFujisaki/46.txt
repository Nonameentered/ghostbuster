Nomura Securities Faces Penalties After Illegal Payments to Client 

Japan's largest brokerage firm, Nomura Securities, faces sanctions and penalties after  illegally paying more than $50 million to a client in return for promises of future business. Japanese regulators found that Nomura violated anti-bribery laws and corporate governance standards by making payments to an unnamed consulting firm, which then channeled money to an influential government pension fund client.

The payments were made between 2010 and 2018, and were described as "introduction fees" by Nomura. However, Japanese regulators found no evidence that the consulting firm provided any actual services to Nomura. Instead, the payments were made to secure investment mandates from the government pension fund, according to statements from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.

The illegal payments came to light during a review of Nomura's compliance procedures and relationships with third-party agents. Nomura reported the issue to regulators and launched an internal investigation, which found multiple failures in governance and oversight that allowed the payments to continue for nearly a decade. 

In a statement, Nomura Chairman Koji Nagai said, "We take this finding very seriously. We sincerely apologize for betraying the public's trust in Nomura as a securities company." Nomura has pledged "fundamental reforms" to its compliance standards and corporate culture to prevent future ethical lapses. However, critics argue Nomura has made similar promises in the past following other compliance failures, with limited results.

The scandal deals a major blow to Nomura's reputation and risks damaging its relationships with key clients and government agencies. Nomura is currently cooperating fully with regulators and law enforcement in their ongoing investigations. Criminal charges against individuals involved in approving and concealing the illegal payments are expected. Regulators will also ban Nomura from certain securities businesses for three to six months, and require additional compliance training for all executives and employees.

Nomura is the latest in a string of major Japanese companies to face scrutiny over governance issues and illegal payments. In 2018, Mitsubishi Motors admitted to systematically covering up vehicle defects for decades, while Olympus and Toshiba both confessed to accounting fraud. The incidents have highlighted deep-rooted problems with compliance and oversight standards at many large Japanese corporations. Regulators are under pressure to take stronger action and impose harsher penalties to drive reforms.
