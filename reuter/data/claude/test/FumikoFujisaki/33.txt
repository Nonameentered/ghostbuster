Nomura Securities Co Ltd Expected to Announce Best Results in Japan, but Future Looks Bleak

Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's largest securities brokerage and investment bank, is expected to announce its strongest quarterly results in over a decade when it reports earnings next week. However, analysts warn that the company's future growth looks uncertain due to a declining market and increased competition. 

Nomura is forecast to post a net profit of over 60 billion yen ($540 million) for the fourth quarter ended March 31, up almost 50% from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of five analysts polled by Quick Corp. This would mark the highest quarterly profit for the Tokyo-based firm since 2008 and cap its best full-year performance since the global financial crisis.

The strong results are attributed to Nomura's fixed-income trading division, which likely benefited from increased volatility in global bond markets, analysts said. Nomura's retail and asset management operations also remained solid as the company attracted new individual investors and grew its private banking and trust banking assets.

"Everything really came together for Nomura this year with its various business segments all firing on all cylinders," said Tomomi Nakamura, a banking analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. "They have built up relatively stable revenue streams that don't depend so much on market fluctuations."

However, many analysts are pessimistic about whether Nomura can sustain this growth momentum. Japan's stock market has been sluggish this year, slowing trading volumes and fee income for brokerages. Nomura also faces intensifying competition from global rivals expanding into Japan's wealth management market.

"The environment is likely to get harsher for Nomura," Nakamura said. "Their earnings could drop by up to 30% next year unless market conditions drastically improve or they make breakthroughs in expanding internationally."

Some investors and analysts have called on Nomura to cut costs and improve efficiency to address the challenges in its core domestic market. Nomura currently employs over 27,000 people, many of whom serve individual investors and traders in Japan.

"Nomura needs to tackle the bloated cost structure that has built up over decades," said Naoki Fujiwara, chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co. "Without sweeping restructuring, Nomura will struggle to remain highly profitable, especially if revenue dries up again."

In response to such criticism, Nomura has taken some actions to diversify its revenue streams and cut expenses, such as exiting loss-making businesses in Europe and the Americas while building fee-based digital banking and wealth management services in Japan. But further efforts may be needed to future-proof Nomura's business model, analysts argue.

The company's upcoming earnings report will provide more details on its restructuring progress and strategy going forward. Investors are keen to see whether a slowing market will indeed drag on Nomura's earnings growth and how it plans to navigate the challenging road ahead.
