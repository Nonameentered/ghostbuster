Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) Plans Radical Reforms for "Big Bang" Deregulation Era  

The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) today announced sweeping reforms to prepare for increased competition from foreign banks following the upcoming "Big Bang" financial deregulation in Japan on October 1. The centerpiece of the reforms is a overhaul of the bank's corporate and investment banking divisions into a new unit called Global Markets Division.

The Global Markets Division will consolidate IBJ's domestic and international corporate banking, investment banking, capital markets, and trading operations under one umbrella. The restructuring aims to allow IBJ to provide integrated services to its large corporate and institutional clients as they expand globally. IBJ also plans to double the number of staff in the Global Markets Division to around 200 people over the next three years.

In addition, IBJ said it will boost staff for mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity underwriting by 50-100% to capture new business opportunities from deregulation. The bank will also start new business lines in asset management, private banking, and real estate finance. IBJ hopes these new areas can contribute up to 20-30% of profits in five years.

IBJ President Hisashi Kuroda said at a press conference, "The Big Bang will bring both opportunities and challenges to Japan's banking industry. Our reforms will transform IBJ into a dynamic and client-centric global bank that can thrive in the new competitive environment."  

However, some analysts are skeptical whether IBJ can execute the ambitious reforms smoothly. "IBJ's plans look good on paper but restructuring its corporate culture and developing new skills will be tremendously difficult," said Yoshiaki Kawasaki, a bank analyst at Nomura Securities. "Foreign banks are also not sitting still. IBJ will face intense competition and margin pressure over the next few years."

IBJ's shares rose 3.2% on the news, outperforming the broader Tokyo market. Investors are hopeful but cautious about IBJ's reboot plans. The success or failure of the reforms will significantly impact IBJ's future in Japan's fast-changing banking industry.
