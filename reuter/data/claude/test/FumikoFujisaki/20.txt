Nomura Securities Co Ltd raided by Japanese prosecutors over alleged links to racketeers  

The Tokyo headquarters of Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan’s largest brokerage firm, was raided today by Tokyo prosecutors investigating the company’s alleged connections to organized crime groups. According to sources familiar with the investigation, prosecutors are probing payments made by Nomura to “sokaiya” racketeers in return for their silence at shareholder meetings.

The raid indicates prosecutors have widened their investigation into corporate governance issues at Nomura, which began earlier this year. In June, Nomura admitted that employees had leaked confidential information to third parties, violating Japanese securities laws. The leaks led to [friendly] shareholders asking scripted questions and making supportive statements at meetings to manipulate shareholders. Nomura conducted an internal investigation, fired several employees, and was sanctioned by Japan’s securities regulator. 

Today’s raid suggests prosecutors believe Nomura’s issues with corporate governance and information control go deeper. According to experts, Japanese corporations have longstanding and complex ties to “sokaiya” racketeers, who extort money from companies in exchange for agreeing not to publicly embarrass executives at shareholder meetings. Payments to sokaiya groups are illegal in Japan, but the practice was once widespread and even tax-deductible until reforms in the early 2000s.

Nomura acknowledged the raid in a statement, saying it was “cooperating fully” with the investigation. A spokesperson said the company had “strengthened our compliance regime to prevent recurrence of past problems,” but it was too soon to determine if its actions were enough. The news sent Nomura’s stock price tumbling over 5% in afternoon trading, a sign of investor concern about potential fines or further sanctions arising from the prosecutors’ probe.

Nomura is one of several major Japanese companies to face scrutiny recently over governance issues. Nissan Motor Co Ltd last year admitted to paying $20 million to [friendly] shareholders, while prosecutor raids at Mitsubishi Motors Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp uncovered evidence of payments to sokaiya members. The raids highlight the ongoing task of reforming Japan’s corporate landscape, despite efforts to tighten laws and improve transparency over the past two decades. For Nomura and other companies, eliminating questionable practices that were once accepted will likely be a long process.
