Japan's Securities Industry Unimpressed with LDP's "Big Bang" Reform Proposals 

The Liberal Democratic Party's proposals for a "Big Bang" set of reforms to invigorate Japan's financial sector are facing pushback from leaders in the country's securities industry. The LDP panel led by former economy minister Heizo Takenaka released a series of recommendations last week aimed at deregulating Japan's financial markets and encouraging more foreign participation. However, executives from Japan's largest brokerages and investment banks argue the proposals do not go far enough.

The LDP's report calls for easing restrictions on activities of foreign financial firms in Japan, expanding the range of products offered by brokerages, and permitting more risk-taking by financial institutions. The goal is to "revitalize the Tokyo market and turn it into a global financial center," according to the report. While supporting the overall vision, industry leaders argue the specific measures are too timid to drive meaningful change.

“We've seen these types of reports before, but they have not led to bold enough reforms to truly transform the competitiveness of Japan's finance sector,” said Tetsuya Ishikawa, president of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. He called for bolder moves like permitting brokerages to directly handle IPOs, relax firewalls between banking and brokerage units, and allow foreign firms to control larger stakes in Japanese financial institutions.

Critics argue Japan's financial sector has been held back for too long by a culture that discourages risk-taking and innovation. Excessive regulation has also made Japan's markets unattractive to foreign firms, putting Tokyo at a disadvantage relative to leading global finance hubs like New York and London. The LDP's proposals are a step in the right direction but need to be more ambitious to drive change, according to most industry leaders.

“Minor tweaks to the system won't accomplish the broader vision of turning Tokyo into a hub for global finance - we need a real 'Big Bang,' not just 'baby steps,'” said the chief executive of a leading Japanese brokerage, speaking anonymously. The LDP is expected to consider feedback before finalizing its reform agenda, but there are concerns powerful lobbying groups may succeed in watering down some of the proposals. Meaningful deregulation faces an uphill battle in Japan, despite widespread calls for change from economists and market participants.
