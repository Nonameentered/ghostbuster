Nomura Securities Co Ltd's President Resigns Over Suspected Illegal Deals

The president of Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's largest brokerage firm, resigned today over the company's suspected involvement in illegal share price manipulation. Nomura President Atsushi Yoshikawa submitted his resignation in a hastily arranged press conference this morning. His resignation comes after weeks of media reports alleging that Nomura brokers conspired with executives at several Japanese companies to artificially inflate their share prices.

"I take full responsibility for the current situation and for failing to properly oversee our employees," Mr. Yoshikawa told reporters in Tokyo. "Unethical and illegal behavior will not be tolerated. I apologize deeply to our shareholders and customers."

Prosecutors announced last month that they were investigating claims that Nomura brokers encouraged clients to buy shares so companies could keep stock prices high and allow executives to offload equity holdings at an profit. In Japan, corporate executives often receive large portions of their compensation in company shares. Artificially propping up stock prices—known as “tobashi”—is illegal but common practice.  

The first signs of trouble surfaced in July when a whistleblower from within Nomura contacted financial regulators about the alleged share price manipulation. The whistleblower provided authorities with emails, chat logs, and recorded phone calls pointing to collusion between Nomura brokers and executives at four publicly listed companies to drive up stock prices.

Nomura initially denied any wrongdoing and pledged full cooperation with the investigation. However, this morning Mr. Yoshikawa said an internal review found "very serious issues" that were deeply concerning. "We have clearly failed to meet the high ethical standards that our customers expect and deserve," he said. Mr. Yoshikawa, 62, had served as Nomura's president since April 2018. His resignation is effective immediately.

Nomura's share price has dropped over 25 percent since the first reports of the scandal emerged. Analysts said Mr. Yoshikawa's resignation was necessary to restore confidence but unlikely to stem customer defections in the short term. "The problem seems much more widespread than just one executive," said Takeshi Akimoto, a banking analyst with Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. Nomura has hired an independent law firm to continue the internal investigation started by Mr. Yoshikawa. More resignations and legal charges may follow as the full scale of the unlawful share dealings comes to light.
