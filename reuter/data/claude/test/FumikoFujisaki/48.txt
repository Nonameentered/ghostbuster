Nomura Securities Co Ltd accused of making illegal payments to client  

Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's largest brokerage firm, has been accused of making illegal payments to a corporate client in a widening scandal that has already led to the resignation of the company's CEO. 

According to sources familiar with the matter, Nomura made "thank you" payments totaling $3 million over three years to an unnamed European client in possible violation of Japan's foreign bribery law. The payments were allegedly made between 2015 to 2018 to retain the business of the client, who threatened to take their business to a rival firm.

Nomura reported the findings of an internal investigation into the payments to Japan's Financial Services Agency last week, leading CEO Koji Nagai to step down to take "responsibility" for the scandal. Two other Nomura executives have also resigned over the issue.

The announcement sent Nomura's shares down more than 5% in Tokyo trading as investors reacted to the news. "Illegal payments to clients undermine the integrity of the firm and the industry as a whole," said Takashi Masuzawa, an analyst with Daiwa Securities. "Nomura needs to take decisive action to address these issues and rebuild trust with regulators and investors."

Nomura has said that while the internal investigation found evidence the payments were made to retain the client's business, there is no evidence the funds were distributed to any foreign public officials. However, under Japan's foreign bribery law, bribes paid to any foreign resident to obtain or retain business contracts are illegal.

The scandal adds to a string of compliance issues that Nomura has faced in recent years. In 2015, the firm was sanctioned for leaks related to public share offerings and insider trading. And in 2018, Nomura was fined $490,000 by US authorities for lax oversight of anti-money laundering controls.

Founded in 1925, Nomura is one of the oldest and largest brokerages in Japan. But in recent decades, it has struggled with weak profits and a loss of market share to rival firms. The illegal payments revelation and management resignations threaten to further damage the reputation and business of the embattled firm. Nomura has promised to strengthen its compliance programs and internal controls to prevent any recurrence of such incidents. But analysts say only time will tell if the latest reforms will be enough to restore confidence in Nomura and turn around its sagging fortunes.
