Nomura Securities Raided by Japanese Prosecutors Over Illegal Payments to Racketeers-Linked Client 

Japan's largest brokerage firm Nomura Securities had its headquarters raided today by Tokyo prosecutors investigating alleged illegal payments made to a client linked to organized crime syndicates. The raid is the latest blow to Nomura, which has struggled in recent years with weak profits and a declining stock price.

According to a statement by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, the payments to the unnamed client were made in violation of Japan's anti-racketeering laws. Prosecutors allege that Nomura employees knew the client had links to “anti-social forces,” a broad term that refers to organized crime groups in Japan, but continued to make payments and provide benefits to retain the client's business.

The pre-dawn raid began at 5 am local time, with over 100 investigators entering Nomura's flagship office in Tokyo to collect documents and interview employees. Nomura confirmed in a statement that investigators visited its headquarters and that it is cooperating fully with authorities. Nomura's stock dropped over 5% on the news in early trading before recovering some losses.

The scandal highlights the issue of yakuza influence in Japan's financial industry. Organized crime groups in Japan generate revenue from illegal gambling, drugs, and extortion, but also maintain legitimate business interests and investment portfolios. Financial firms in Japan at times feel pressure to accommodate yakuza-linked clients to avoid retaliation. However, anti-racketeering laws forbid companies from providing benefits or funds that directly assist criminal organizations.

Regulators have launched periodic crackdowns, but ties between yakuza and finance firms persist. If proven, the payments by Nomura would mark one of the most egregious recent examples. The prosecutors' investigation is ongoing, and Nomura has pledged to strengthen compliance and prevent any recurrences. Critics argue, however, that without a broader purge of yakuza influence from the financial system, firms like Nomura will remain at risk of violating anti-racketeering laws due to the immense pressure placed on them by criminal clients.   

Nomura has faced several recent years of poor performance and restructuring. It reported a big loss in the last quarter of 2019 and replaced its CEO in April. The raid and scandal threaten to prolong Nomura's woes and bring further reputational damage during a pivotal time for Japan's largest brokerage. The prosecutors' investigation into Nomura is continuing, signaling the likelihood of a lengthy and drawn-out process.
