Nomura Securities under investigation for illegal deals: Japanese watchdog warns of lengthy probe

Tokyo, Japan - Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) announced today that it has launched an investigation into Nomura Securities, the country's largest brokerage firm, over allegations of illegal share deals. The FSA warned that the probe could take months to complete given the complexity of the case. 

According to sources familiar with the matter, the investigation focuses on Nomura's equity derivatives trading division. Regulators are examining whether traders in that division violated laws around market manipulation and disclosure. There are concerns that Nomura traders may have spread false information to artificially move stock prices or failed to properly disclose large share purchases as required by law.

The allegations threaten to deal a major blow to Nomura, which is still recovering from an insider trading scandal in 2012 that led to resignations of top executives. "Any findings of wrongdoing could significantly damage Nomura's reputation and lead to large fines,” said Takashi Nakano, an analyst at JI Asia Research. “This case also highlights the need for greater compliance and risk controls at major Japanese brokerages.”

Nomura issued a statement saying it is cooperating fully with the FSA's investigation. "We take this matter very seriously and have launched our own internal review," said Nomura CEO Koji Nagai. However, sources say that several senior managers at the firm were aware of the questionable share deals and failed to take action. If proven, this could lead to calls for management changes at the embattled firm.

The latest investigation underscores the challenges facing Japan's $6 trillion equity market. Critics argue that self-regulation has failed, leading to repeated cases of market abuse. The FSA has stepped up oversight of brokerages in recent years, but its limited staff still struggle to oversee the large volume of trades. Today's announcement suggests the regulator will take an aggressive stance against any illegal deals it uncovers at Nomura. Investors will be closely watching as this latest scandal unfolds.
