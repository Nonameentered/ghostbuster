Two of Japan's Most Troubled Banks Take Action to End Financial Problems and Prepare for Financial Deregulation  

Two of Japan's largest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group, announced major restructuring plans this week aimed at resolving longstanding financial issues and preparing for increased competition as Japan's financial industry deregulates. 

Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest bank, said it will eliminate more than 15,000 jobs over the next decade, reduce its network of domestic branches by about 30 percent, and take a $6 billion write-down on its securities portfolio. The bank has struggled with bad loans and sluggish profits for years. It hopes the restructuring will help revive its financial performance and stock price, which has dropped nearly 50 percent over the past five years.

Mizuho, Japan's third-largest bank, also unveiled a revival plan that includes consolidating its retail banking and securities businesses, cutting about 4,000 jobs, and taking a $3.5 billion write-down. Mizuho was created in 2002 through the merger of three large banks but has failed to generate the cost efficiencies and profits it had projected. Its stock price has declined more than 60 percent over the past five years.

The restructuring plans by Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho come ahead of new rules by Japan's financial regulator to allow more competition in the country's banking sector. Regulators will soon make it easier for Japanese companies to switch between banks and for non-bank companies like brokerages to enter the banking sector. Facing this stiff competition for the first time, Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho aim to streamline operations, improve services, and reduce costs.

Still, major challenges remain for both banks. Bad loans have plagued Japan's banks for decades and continue to be a problem. Interest rates in Japan have been ultra-low for many years, compressing banks' profit margins. Japan's population is aging and shrinking, slowing the pace of loan demand.
