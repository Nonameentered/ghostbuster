First Life Insurance Firm Failure in Post-War Japan as Nissan Mutual Life Shuts Down  

Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Company, Japan’s first insurance firm to collapse in the postwar era, was  ordered by regulators to shut down operations from today. The closure of the Tokyo-based firm founded in 1918 marks the failure of a major company in an industry that has faced declining profits in recent years due to ultra-low interest rates and increasing competition.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) said Nissan Mutual Life had become unable to pay out claims and benefits to policyholders. The regulator has cancelled the firm’s license and ordered it to halt operations. Policyholders are expected to seek compensation through a policyholder protection fund. The fund is likely to pay out the surrender value or a portion of unpaid benefits to affected customers.

Nissan Mutual Life has struggled with deteriorating finances for years. It reported a net loss of 63 billion yen ($570 million) for the fiscal year ended March 2018 and a negative net worth for the past two years. The firm's solvency margin ratio, which measures an insurer's ability to pay out claims, fell below the regulatory minimum last year. Last week, Nissan Mutual Life submitted a business improvement plan to the FSA but it was rejected as inadequate. The FSA Commissioner said “We made the decision to protect policyholders as the firm's turnaround plan was deemed not viable and its financial conditions were very severe.”

The failure of Nissan Mutual Life highlights the challenges faced by Japan's life insurance sector. Rock-bottom interest rates have squeezed investment returns from bonds, making it difficult for insurers to generate profits from the premiums paid by policyholders. At the same time, intensifying competition from large players has also eaten into the market share and profits of smaller firms like Nissan Mutual Life. The industry as a whole reported declining profits for six straight years through March 2018.
