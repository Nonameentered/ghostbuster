Japanese Banks Consider Closing Foreign Operations Due to Problem Loans and New Capital Requirements

Some of Japan's largest banks are considering scaling back or shutting down foreign operations in Southeast Asia  and Europe due to rising levels of bad loans and more stringent capital requirements imposed by regulators. According to unnamed sources within the large Japanese megabanks like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Mizuho Financial Group, the banks are losing money on their foreign operations, especially in developing countries where bad loan ratios have spiked in recent years.

The volume of non-performing loans as a percentage of total lending at Japanese banks' foreign subsidiaries and affiliates exceeded 3 percent at the end of March, the highest level since the global financial crisis. In countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, the non-performing loan ratios are well over 5 percent of total lending. This has squeezed profits and made it difficult for the banks to meet higher capital ratio requirements from Japan's Financial Services Agency. The agency now requires Japan's largest banks to maintain total capital ratios, including reserves to cover bad loans, of at least 8 percent of assets. 

According to a senior Mitsubishi UFJ executive, "our Southeast Asia operations, especially in Thailand and Indonesia, have become too much of a financial drag and risk to our overall group operations. We can no longer justify the amount of capital required to support these subsidiaries." The executive noted that Mitsubishi UFJ's bad loan costs in Southeast Asia cut the bank's total net profit by over 10 percent in the last fiscal year. 

Likewise, Sumitomo Mitsui is considering downsizing or closing its wholly-owned banking subsidiaries in Vietnam and Indonesia. "These subsidiaries have limited scale but we need to allocate a disproportionate amount of capital to meet local regulations," said a Sumitomo Mitsui managing director. "We may be better off reducing our exposure in these countries and focusing on more developed markets in Asia."

In Europe, Japanese banks have spent over $70 billion since the 1990s acquiring operations in countries like the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. But weak economic growth and negative interest rates in Europe have reduced profits from these overseas subsidiaries. The strong yen has also cut into Japanese banks' profits abroad. "Our European operations are close to break-even right now but unlikely to contribute to group profits in a major way anytime soon," said a Mizhuho executive. "We have to evaluate whether maintaining these operations still makes financial and strategic sense."

Cutting back overseas operations would allow Japanese banks to focus on their main domestic market where lending conditions have improved significantly. However, shrinking their foreign footprints could also reduce their growth potential and diversification benefits over the long run. Japanese banks may need to restructure and consolidate their foreign operations to keep them viable and compliant with regulatory capital requirements. How these banks achieve the right balance between foreign and domestic operations could determine their future competitiveness and profitability.
