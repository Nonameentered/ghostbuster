Japanese Banks Take Action to End Financial Woes Ahead of Big Bang Era of Deregulation

Japan's major banks have announced plans to overhaul their operations and cut costs in an effort to boost profitability ahead of sweeping financial deregulation. The so-called "Big Bang" reforms are set to take effect in 2022, ending protections that have shielded Japan's financial institutions for decades.

The three largest banks—Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Mizuho Financial Group—all reported declines in profit for the fiscal year ending in March due to rising bad loan costs and sluggish lending. The banks now aim to improve efficiency and risk management to gain a competitive edge as Japan opens its financial markets to more foreign participation. 

Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest lender, plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its workforce. The bank will also combine its corporate and investment banking units to streamline operations. "We have to shape up to prepare for the coming era of deregulation," said CEO Kanetsugu Mike. Mitsubishi expects the restructuring to reduce costs by over $1 billion annually.

Sumitomo Mitsui will consolidate some domestic branch offices and reduce its workforce by 3,000 employees. The bank will revamp its lending practices to focus on more profitable customers, especially in the areas of housing loans and investment banking. "Our traditional way of doing business will no longer work," said Sumitomo Mitsui President Jun Ohta. "We have to adapt quickly to the new competitive environment."

Mizuho, the third-largest lender, will cut up to 6,000 jobs over the next three years, lowering staff levels by nearly 10 percent. The bank aims to improve its financial advisory services and attract more high-net-worth individuals as clients. Mizuho also plans to upgrade its digital banking services to reach new customer segments. "Bold changes are needed to overcome the challenges posed by negative interest rates, weak lending demand, and threat of new entrants," said Mizuho CEO Tatsufumi Sakai.

The banks' restructuring efforts have been met with both approval and skepticism. Some analysts argue deeper job cuts and branch closures will be necessary for the banks to significantly improve profitability. However, others point out that drastic downsizing also poses risks, as it could hamper the banks' customer service quality and ability to generate lending. The coming years will prove whether the banks' actions are bold enough for them to thrive in Japan's new era of open financial competition.
