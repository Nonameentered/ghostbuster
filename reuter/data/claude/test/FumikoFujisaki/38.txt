Nomura's Profits at Risk Amid Scandal and Expected Penalties  

Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest investment bank, faces significant financial penalties and damage to its reputation amid an unfolding insider trading scandal. Nomura disclosed today that it expects to face formal charges and pay fines of up to $600 million to Japanese regulators related to improper handling of confidential information by some of its employees. 

The scandal centers around leaks of confidential information ahead of secondary share offerings for several Japanese companies between 2010 and 2012. Nomura employees allegedly shared insider details about the deals with hedge fund traders before the information became public, allowing the funds to generate almost $100 million in profits, according to reports in the Nikkei financial news service.

Nomura has been conducting an internal investigation into the matter since 2019. The scope of the scandal and number of employees involved grew substantially over the course of the review, according to a person familiar with the probe. Nomura now plans to take disciplinary action against up to 50 employees, including 10 managers.  

The mounting crisis is a major blow for Nomura CEO Koji Nagai, who took the helm in 2012 vowing to overhaul the firm's compliance practices and restore its reputation after previous insider trading incidents. The expected penalties would be among the largest ever imposed on a Japanese financial firm, and further undermine efforts by Mr. Nagai and the bank's chairman, Nobuyuki Koga, to convince investors and regulators that Nomura had tackled ethical lapses.

Some analysts and investors argue Nomura may need to take more drastic action in response to this latest scandal. “This shows that the cultural problems at Nomura run deep,” said Michael Makdad, an analyst at Morningstar in Tokyo. “Merely firing a few dozen employees won't solve issues that seem so entrenched.” He argues Nomura should overhaul its employee compensation structure to reduce incentives for improper behavior, and consider appointing outside directors to increase oversight.
