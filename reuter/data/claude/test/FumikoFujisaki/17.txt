Nomura Securities Co Ltd Raided in Probe Into Racketeer Payments

Tokyo prosecutors raided the headquarters of Nomura Securities Co Ltd today as part of an investigation into illegal payments to corporate racketeers, known as 'sokaiya' in Japan. The raid is a blow to Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, which has been trying to rebuild trust after previous governance and risk management issues.  

According to a spokesperson from the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office, the raid began this morning and involved over 100 police and prosecutors' officials descending upon Nomura's flagship office in Tokyo. Documents and records related to questionable payments made between Nomura and 'sokaiya' corporate racketeers over the last decade are being sought. In Japan, 'sokaiya' are known for threatening to disrupt annual shareholder meetings and make public accusations about companies unless they are paid off.  

While the amounts paid to racketeers are typically modest, lining the pockets of anti-social forces is illegal under Japan's Organized Crime Countermeasures Law. For a prestigious financial firm like Nomura, such payments would also be hugely embarrassing and damage its reputation. The Prosecutor's Office raid appears to indicate this is more than a trivial matter. 

Nomura issued a short statement confirming the raid and pledging to fully cooperate with the investigation. "We are working to confirm the reasons for the investigation and the specific details," a Nomura spokesperson said. The bank's share price declined over 2% on the news, underperforming the broader Tokyo market.

Analysts said Nomura could face significant legal liabilities and penalties if payments to sokaiya racketeers were proven and substantial. "At a minimum, there will need to be answers for why such illegal activities took place, who authorized them, and how controls have been strengthened," said Steven Irvine, an analyst with Jefferies in Tokyo.  Nomura's previous compliance issues, including insider trading scandals, placed it under close regulatory scrutiny.

The raid demonstrates authorities are increasingly willing to pursue penalties against financial institutions, even blue chip names like Nomura. Some argue only stiff punishment will change banks' calculus around risk-taking and governance. For Nomura and other Japanese firms making efforts to strengthen compliance and oversight, the challenge is overcoming the legacy of a weak governance culture that previously tolerated cozy and collusive ties with vested interests. Cleaning house will be difficult but is increasingly key to regaining trust.
