Japanese Brokers Face Closure as Liberalisation of Fees Looms

Japan's huge retail brokerage industry is bracing for major consolidation and closures as the government plans to scrap fixed commissions on stock trades in October this year. The move is aimed at boosting competition in the $5.7 trillion stock market, one of the world's largest, but also threatens the profits and survival of many mid-sized brokers.  

Fixed fees for executing trades of up to 100,000 yen ($910) have been in place since 1999 and have provided a stable income stream for brokerages. But critics argue they have kept fees artificially high and hampered innovation. Deregulating trade commissions is a key part of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's plans to make Tokyo's markets more attractive as a global financial center.

Analysts expect the liberalisation to trigger a "survival game" and benefits for investors as brokerages lower fees to win customers. But dozens of smaller firms may struggle under pricing pressure and mergers are inevitable. "Those who can't compete on commissions will have to either fold or consolidate," said Naoki Murakami, chief researcher at Monex Group. "The industry's landscape will surely change."

The biggest brokers like Nomura, Daiwa and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley are well placed to cope but regional and internet securities firms are more vulnerable. Fees at major firms are estimated to drop by around 30% but smaller brokers may have to slash them by up to 70-80% to retain customers, severely cutting into profits.

"Regional brokerages have a lot of vulnerabilities...as most of their profits still come from trade commissions," said Jefferies analyst Makoto Kikuchi. "They will face the stark reality of the need to restructure their businesses," he added.

Smaller brokers have already taken steps to diversify income streams into areas such as mergers and acquisitions advisory and wealth management. But beyond trade commissions, brokerages also face structural headwinds from Japan's aging population and nearly three-decade-old economic slump.  

The industry's woes are reflected in declining profits and a fall in companies. Brokerage numbers have halved since 1990 to around 90 today, according to brokerage industry group JSDA. Tighter regulation has also taken a toll. "Conditions surrounding the brokerage industry have been deteriorating for a long time," said JSDA chairman Yasuaki Motomura.

While painful, deregulating stock trade fees should benefit Japan Inc and individual investors by reducing transaction costs and boosting Tokyo's global competitiveness. The fee revolution may be the shock the industry needs to cut overcapacity and inefficiencies. For survivors, a more open market could also present new opportunities for growth.
