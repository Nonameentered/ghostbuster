Nomura Announces Major Executive Reshuffle to Revamp Corporate Culture and Regain Investor Confidence 

Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, announced a major reshuffle of its executive team as it seeks to overhaul its corporate culture and regain investor confidence. The shakeup comes after the firm reported weak earnings and several compliance failures in recent quarters that have damaged its reputation.

As part of the reshuffle, Nomura named Kentaro Okuda, currently head of its investment management arm, as its new Chief Executive Officer. Okuda will replace Koji Nagai, who led the firm for the past five years. The change is effective April 1. 

In addition, Nomura named three new co-COOs to oversee key divisions. It named Steve Ashley, currently head of its wholesale business, as co-COO to lead its new Wholesale division comprising global markets and investment banking. It named Toshiyasu Iiyama, currently Chief Risk Officer, as co-COO to lead its new Risk Management and Governance division. And it named Noriaki Shimazaki, currently head of Retail, as co-COO to continue leading its Retail division.

Nomura Chairman Nobuyuki Koga said the new leadership team represents a "generational change" that will help transform its corporate culture by strengthening governance and compliance practices. The firm has faced scrutiny from regulators in Japan over several issues, including improper handling of confidential client information. 

Investors cheered the news, bidding up Nomura's stock price over 6 percent on expectations the new team will overhaul internal controls, focus on higher-margin businesses, and work to regain client trust. In a statement, Okuda said "We will rebuild the business model to regain profitability...and work to restore investor and client confidence in our firm."

The executive reshuffle is the most sweeping leadership change at Nomura in decades. If successful, it could mark a major turning point as Nomura seeks to revive its business and reputation. But the new team faces significant challenges in achieving a meaningful transformation of Japan's largest securities firm.
