Troubled banks in Japan's "Big Bang" financial deregulation: Mergers and restructurings fall short 

Japan's ambitious "Big Bang" financial reforms of the 1990s were meant to deregulate the financial sector, spur competition, and boost the economy. A key part of the reforms was encouraging mergers and restructurings in the banking sector to strengthen institutions and enable them to compete globally. However, many of the mergers and restructurings have failed to achieve their objectives and stabilize the banking system.

The bursting of Japan's asset price bubble in the early 1990s left many banks with non-performing loans and weak balance sheets. The Big Bang reforms allowed banks to merge and restructure to consolidate and strengthen themselves. Major banks like Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank merged to form SMBC, while Sanwa Bank merged with Tokai Bank and Toyo Trust & Banking to form UFJ. The mergers were meant to cut costs, improve risk management, and enable the new larger banks to compete internationally.

However, the mergers were often hasty "shotgun weddings" organized by the government. They frequently combined weaker banks and failed to adequately restructure them, merely transferring non-performing loans between institutions. The cost-cutting and restructuring that were envisioned often did not materialize. Recently, UFJ had to be rescued by the government and merged with the Mizuho Financial Group, another problem bank. SMBC has also struggled at times with bad loans and governance issues.

The experience of Japan's banking mergers in the 1990s highlights the challenges of deregulating and restructuring the financial sector during a crisis. Simply combining institutions is not enough. Deep restructuring of corporate culture, risk management, and governance practices are required to truly integrate and strengthen banks. The Japanese government has learned from its experiences and more recent bank mergers like that of Resona Bank appear to have been more successful, but more work is still needed to stabilize Japan's banking system. Overall, Japan's "Big Bang" failed to achieve a stable and globally competitive banking sector, indicating that deregulation and restructuring must be pursued cautiously and thoughtfully to be effective.
