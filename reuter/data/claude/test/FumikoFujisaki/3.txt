Japan's Deposit Insurance System to Seek Loans from Banks in Tender, Raising Concerns for Depositors' Protections  

The Japanese Deposit Insurance Corporation (JDIC) announced this week that it will seek up to 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) in long-term loans from private banks to boost its depleted financial reserves. The JDIC, which protects bank depositors in the event of bank failures, said its current reserves have declined significantly after large payouts to depositors of failed regional banks.  

The loan tender, which will begin next month, allows private banks to lend money to the JDIC for periods of 5 to 10 years. The interest rates on the loans will be auctioned by the private banks, with the JDIC indicating it can accept rates up to 0.5 percentage points above interbank rates. The JDIC said it needs to take out the bank loans to meet international guidelines that require deposit insurers to maintain funds equivalent to 0.8% of insured deposits.  

The announcement has raised concerns among consumer advocates and financial experts about potential conflicts of interest. "There is an issue about the independence of the deposit insurer if it has to borrow money from the very banks it insures and oversees,‚Äù said Katsutoshi Inadome, a professor of financial management at Waseda University. The JDIC directly supervises private banks and has the power to shut them down if they are undercapitalized or insolvent.

However, the JDIC maintains the loans will not compromise its independence or ability to monitor and regulate private banks. The agency said it will continue to shut down failing banks even those that provide the loans. "We need to secure enough funds to steadily make deposit payouts in the event of bank failures," said Toshihide Endo, the chairman of JDIC. "But our supervisory and regulatory stance will not change."

The agency's declining financial reserves have raised concerns that the JDIC may not have enough funding if a major banking crisis occurs in Japan. The reserves have fallen from over 3 trillion yen in 2007 to around 2 trillion yen currently, due to higher costs from liquidating regional banks. The number of regional bank failures has accelerated in recent years in Japan due to sluggish rural economies and low-interest rates.

If approved, the bank loans would be the first time the JDIC has borrowed money in capital markets to fund its reserve requirements. Some analysts argue it would have been better for the agency to raise deposit insurance premiums on banks instead of taking out loans from them. The premiums on deposit insurance for regional banks in Japan are relatively low compared to international standards. Raising the fees could bolster the JDIC's finances while also pressuring weaker regional banks to improve governance and management.
