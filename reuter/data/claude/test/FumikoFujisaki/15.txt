Moody's cuts Nippon Credit Bank's senior debt to junk level, raising concerns over Japan's financial reform efforts

Moody's Investors Service downgraded Nippon Credit Bank's senior debt rating to junk status on Tuesday, citing concerns over the Japanese lender's rising non-performing loans and weak capital buffers. The downgrade raises fresh doubts about Japan's progress in reforming its banking sector, which has been plagued for years with bad debt problems. 

The credit ratings agency cut Nippon Credit Bank's senior debt and issuer ratings by one notch to Ba2, two levels below investment grade. It also reduced the bank's baseline credit assessment—which measures its standalone financial strength—to b2 from b1. Moody's changed the outlook on the ratings to negative from stable, indicating further downgrades are possible.

In a statement, Moody's said the downgrade "reflects the rising asset risks facing the bank, specifically a higher level of non-performing loans in both domestic and overseas businesses." The ratings agency estimated Nippon Credit Bank's impaired loan ratio was nearly 9% of total loans as of March, up sharply from 6% a year earlier. Loans to small and medium-sized enterprises in Japan and domestic real estate finance were flagged as areas of particular weakness.

The ratings cut is a blow to Nippon Credit Bank, one of Japan's smaller regional lenders, as it seeks to strengthen its balance sheet and increase profits. It also calls into question the government's efforts to overhaul Japan's banking system, which still labors under the weight of bad debts that built up during the country's economic stagnation in the 1990s. Despite some progress, Japan's major banks still have relatively low capital buffers compared with international peers.

Nippon Credit Bank's new CEO, Nobuyuki Hatta, has pledged to improve risk management and slash non-performing loans. However, the bank faces significant headwinds amid Japan's ultra-low interest rates, sluggish economic growth and intensifying regional bank competition. Its stock price has plunged more than 20% this year. Hatta aims to shift focus to higher-margin lending areas like home mortgages to turn the bank around.

In a press briefing following the downgrade, however, Hatta acknowledged the bank has more work to do to strengthen its financial position. He said Nippon Credit Bank will accelerate efforts to write off bad debts, reduce costs and raise additional capital. The bank may also consider merging with another regional lender to gain scale and cut overlap.

Moody's warning shot comes at a sensitive time for Japan's banking regulators, who have been pushing regional banks to consolidate to better withstand shocks. Nippon Credit Bank's downgrade is a reminder of the fragility that persists in parts of Japan's banking system—and the risks to financial stability if reforms fail to gain traction.
