Nomura Securities Co Ltd Board Resigns in Wake of Racketeering Scandal  

The entire board of directors at Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's largest brokerage firm, resigned today amid allegations of widespread racketeering and fraud. The chairman and president of Nomura, its two executive vice presidents,  and nine outside directors all stepped down after an internal investigation found that managers and employees had engaged in illegal bid-rigging and market manipulation over the course of a decade.

The scandal came to light after a whistleblower contacted government regulators, detailing how Nomura executives conspired with officials at large Japanese companies to rig bids for stock offerings and gain insider information to manipulate public markets. Once alerted, the Japanese Financial Services Agency launched a surprise inspection of Nomura's Tokyo headquarters, seizing documents and computers.

According to sources familiar with the investigation, Nomura's top executives not only knew about the illegal activities but actively encouraged them in order to boost the company's profits and share price. The racketeering was said to be widespread, involving traders, sales staff, and executives across Nomura's operations, especially in its stock underwriting and brokerage divisions. Regulators estimate that Nomura earned over $500 million in illicit profits due to bid-rigging and market manipulation over the 10-year period.

In a statement, the outgoing Nomura board members said they took "full responsibility for the systemic failures of management oversight and governance" that allowed unlawful conduct to flourish at the firm. They bowed in apology for betraying the public trust and for failing to establish an ethical culture. The mass resignation was seen as an attempt by Nomura to avoid potential sanctions by regulators which could include heavy fines and even the suspension of some operations.
