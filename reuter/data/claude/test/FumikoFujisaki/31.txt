Nippon Credit Bank ties up with Bankers Trust to turn loans into cash

Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), one of Japan's leading consumer finance companies, announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Bankers Trust, a leading global investment bank, to securitize up to $2 billion of NCB's consumer loan portfolio. This deal will allow NCB to turn its existing loans into cash to fund new lending activities.

Under the agreement, NCB will package consumer loans from its portfolio into securities that can be sold to investors in the global capital markets. Bankers Trust will underwrite and distribute these securities to investors around the world. This type of securitization, known as collateralized loan obligations or CLOs, has become increasingly popular with Japanese consumer lenders in recent years as a way to raise new capital and diversify funding sources.

For NCB, this deal provides an attractive way to bolster its balance sheet by converting existing assets into new financing. The cash proceeds from selling consumer loan-backed securities will allow NCB to originate new consumer loans and drive further growth. At a time of ultra-low interest rates in Japan, this securitization helps NCB achieve a stronger return on equity than would be possible through traditional lending alone.

For Bankers Trust, the deal reinforces its leading position in structuring securitization transactions for Asian consumer finance companies looking to tap global funding pools. The bank will generate fees from underwriting the securities and distributing them to institutional investors in regions like North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.

"This strategic partnership with Bankers Trust gives us an innovative way to unlock value from our consumer finance portfolio and secure new funding for future growth," said Haruhiko Yoshida, President and CEO of NCB. "We are leveraging global capital markets to strengthen our financial base, which will allow us to better serve our customers in Japan with even more affordable and convenient lending products."

The deal highlights the growing interconnectivity between Japan's consumer finance industry and global capital markets. By tapping investors outside of Japan, NCB and others are finding new funding avenues to supplement traditional bank lending channels domestically. For Japan's consumers and economy overall, greater access to credit and more competition in the lending sector will likely stimulate increased consumption and support economic activity, analysts say. The NCB-Bankers Trust partnership, slated to begin next month, is the latest example of how Japanese companies are forging cross-border alliances to facilitate new business and investment opportunities.
