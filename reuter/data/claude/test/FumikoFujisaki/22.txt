Nippon Credit Bank to unveil restructuring plan, including real estate sales and overseas branch closures

Japan's Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. will unveil a sweeping restructuring plan this week that includes sales of real estate holdings and closures of some overseas branches. The plan, to be announced  on Wednesday, aims to shore up the regional bank's balance sheet  and improve profitability amid Japan's ultra-low interest rates and  challenging demographics. 

People familiar with the matter said the bank will look to sell off about  half of the 108 buildings it owns across Japan that are used as bank  branches. The sales could raise over $1 billion in proceeds to strengthen  the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio, which measures a bank's ability to  weather financial downturns. Nippon Credit Bank will then lease back  some of the properties from the new owners to continue operating branches.

The restructuring will also see the bank shutter unprofitable overseas  locations to refocus on its core domestic market. Branches in New York,  London, and Singapore are slated for closure within the next 6-12 months.  About 50-60 jobs will be cut as a result of the closures. Nippon Credit  Bank has struggled to gain meaningful scale in competitive international  financial centers and the move is aimed at improving the performance of  its operations outside Japan.  

A spokesman for Nippon Credit Bank said the restructuring plan reflects  the bank's "commitment to optimizing our business model, enhancing  efficiency and ensuring sustainable growth into the future." The  regional lender faces significant demographic headwinds in Japan with a  shrinking and aging population, especially in rural areas where it  operates most of its branches.

The latest moves are the most dramatic to date under Nippon Credit Bank's  CEO, Tetsuya Hasegawa, who took the helm in 2017 with a mandate to  reinvigorate the lender. Hasegawa has accelerated cost-cutting efforts  and overhauled the bank's overseas strategy. Nippon Credit Bank's shares  have gained 12% so far this year, outperforming the broader Tokyo stock market. Investors will be looking to Wednesday's  announcement for signs that Hasegawa's turnaround remains on track.
