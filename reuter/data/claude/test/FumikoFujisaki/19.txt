Nomura Securities Co Ltd raided by Japanese prosecutors over payments to racketeer-linked client 

TOKYO - Nomura Holdings Inc’s brokerage unit was raided by Japanese prosecutors on  suspicion that it gave illicit payments to a racketeer-linked client, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. 

Dozens of investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office entered Nomura Securities Co’s head office in Tokyo and several branches on Friday morning, spending over six hours searching for documents and other evidence, the sources said.

The prosecutors are investigating payments of nearly 10 billion yen ($91 million) in brokerage commissions to a Tokyo businessman with links to an organized crime group over five years from 2015, the sources said. Nomura Securities executives are suspected of paying inflated brokerage fees to the client and entertaining him lavishly in exchange for business, they said.

A Nomura spokesperson said the company was cooperating with the prosecutors but declined to comment further. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office also declined to comment.

The raid casts a harsh spotlight on Nomura's compliance practices and risks damaging its reputation in a country where white-collar crime is frowned upon. It also shows how Japanese authorities have stepped up their scrutiny of financial institutions in recent years.

The payments being investigated allegedly included brokerage fees for stocks and bonds trading that were far higher than normal levels and not based on the client's trading volume, the sources said. Nomura Securities executives wined and dined the client and provided him with tickets to high-profile sports and entertainment events to maintain the business relationship, they said.

While it is legal in Japan for companies to pay commissions to clients in some circumstances, inflated payments made to reward or maintain a relationship with a client can be considered a form of bribery, lawyers said. The organized crime connections of the businessman in this case raise further compliance issues, they said.

The investigation has shocked Nomura executives and staff, coming just five years after the brokerage's last major regulatory scandal. In that case, Nomura was penalized for leaking information to clients ahead of share sales its brokers were underwriting.

Nomura is Japan's largest brokerage and investment bank, but it has struggled with weak profits in recent years due to slow economic growth and ultra-low interest rates in Japan. The firm has pitched its wealth management business, which includes brokerage services for affluent individuals, as a key source of future growth.

The prosecutors are expected to take several months to decide whether to indict any Nomura officials over the case, the sources said. A decision to prosecute could lead to the departure of Nomura Securities' chief executive and other executives, they said.
