Most of Japan's Second-Tier Brokerages Predicted to Experience Losses Due to Tumbling Tokyo Stock Prices 

A recent drop in stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is expected to lead to losses for most of Japan's second-tier brokerages, according to analysts. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index has declined over 10% since the start of the year due to concerns over a slowing global economy and trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The six major brokerages in Japan, including Nomura Holdings and Daiwa Securities Group, should remain profitable despite the downturn as they have diversified revenue sources. However, the smaller brokerages that primarily service retail investors trading Japanese equities will likely struggle in the downturn. These firms generate most of their revenue from brokerage commissions, which fall during periods of declining trade volumes and asset values.  

"The smaller brokerages are the most exposed to the ups and downs of the Nikkei," said Jiro Iokibe, an analyst at Asian Equity Research. "They lack alternative revenue streams from investment banking, asset management, and overseas operations that the large firms have cultivated."

Some second-tier brokerages have already lowered their forecasts for the full fiscal year as a result of the drop in stock prices. Online brokerage SBI Holdings, which makes nearly 80% of its revenue from commissions, reported a 75% decline in quarterly profits and cut its annual profit outlook by 25%. Discount brokerage Monex Group lowered its annual profit guidance by 15%, citing "a worsening market environment."  

To withstand the challenging conditions, some smaller brokerages are implementing cost-cutting measures. SBI Holdings plans to reduce marketing expenses and Monex Group will slow the pace of hiring. A few other brokerages may need to restructure their operations to avoid reporting losses for the year if stock market conditions do not improve in the coming months.  

The downturn in Japan's stock market serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of brokerages that rely heavily on a single asset class or market for their business. Diversifying into other areas like investment banking, asset management, and global markets can provide more stability during periods of market turbulence. For Japan's second-tier brokerages, expanding into new business lines could be key to surviving extended periods of weakness in the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
