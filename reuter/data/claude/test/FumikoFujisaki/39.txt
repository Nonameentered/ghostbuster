Nomura Securities Co sinks into the red but reports healthy current profit jump

Nomura Securities Co, Japan’s biggest brokerage and investment bank, reported a net loss of 15.6 billion yen ($143 million) for the fiscal first quarter ended June due to one-time charges related to job cuts. However, Nomura’s operating profit jumped 70% boosted by a surge in trading revenue.

Nomura said its operating profit increased to 64.1 billion yen for the three months from a year earlier, its highest first-quarter result in nine years. Revenue from trading stocks and bonds rose 19% from a year earlier to 181.9 billion yen. The firm cited strong performances in global markets as its trading desks benefited from higher volatility and client activity.  

The loss was largely due to a one-time charge of 24 billion yen as Nomura cuts about $1 billion in costs, including job losses. Nomura announced in April it would cut $1 billion in costs, reduce its workforce by about 15% and overhaul its business structure. The measures aim to revive profitability after Nomura’s full-year net income plunged in the last fiscal year.

“We have made a good start to the fiscal year with the highest first-quarter operating profit in nine years,” said Koji Nagai, President and Group CEO of Nomura. “Our actions to strengthen the business platform and improve cost competitiveness are starting to bear fruit.”

Nomura reported an annual net loss of 114.7 billion yen in the year ended March 2018, hurt by a onetime charge for its overseas operations and weaker profit from retail and asset management units. Mr. Nagai has pledged to turn Nomura into a more globally focused firm, diversifying away from a heavy reliance on the mature Japanese market.

The bank now expects to book around 50 billion yen to 60 billion yen in restructuring costs for the full year, higher than the 45 billion yen initially estimated in April. But it left its annual net income guidance unchanged at 140 billion yen. Nomura said it would boost its dividend and buy back more of its own shares over the next three years.

Investors have welcomed Mr. Nagai’s turnaround moves. Nomura’s stock price has risen about 40% this year, outperforming the benchmark Nikkei. But analysts say the firm still has more work left to boost performance, especially in its retail and investor services businesses. 

“We view progress on improving cost competitiveness and globalizing management positively,” said Credit Suisse analyst Naomi Takagi. “However, we think [Nomura] still needs to build a more solid earnings base.”

Nomura remains a distant third behind rivals Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co. In the latest fiscal quarter, Daiwa posted a net profit gain of 14% on strong trading, while Mitsubishi UFJ will report earnings next week. Analysts say Nomura will need to gain more market share abroad in a tougher environment for Japanese financial firms.
