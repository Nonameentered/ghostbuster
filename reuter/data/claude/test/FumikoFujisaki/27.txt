Two of Japan's Troubled Banks Make Moves to End Financial Woes Through Restructuring and Merger  

Two of Japan's largest troubled banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc., announced major restructuring plans this week aimed at stabilizing their financial positions and boosting growth. 
MUFG, Japan's largest bank, said it will eliminate over 6,500 jobs, or about 5% of its workforce, over the next three years as part of an effort to cut costs. The job cuts will primarily come through attrition and early retirement, avoiding direct layoffs. The bank also plans to consolidate some domestic branch locations. These moves are expected to generate over $2.7 billion in cost savings at a time when MUFG's profits have been squeezed by low interest rates in Japan.

Mizuho, Japan's third-largest bank, announced a merger of three of its retail banking units to improve efficiency and cut costs. The combined unit will have over 15,000 employees serving tens of millions of retail banking customers. Mizuho did not announce any specific job cuts in conjunction with the merger but said additional cost-cutting measures would be coming over the next several years. The bank has struggled recently due to weak lending profitability and losses from some large borrowers.

Both banks have endured several years of lackluster economic growth and financial market weakness in Japan. They have also dealt with the challenges of major corporate bankruptcies, including the collapse last year of Jet Airways, to which the banks had significant exposure. Japan's central bank has kept interest rates at ultra-low levels for many years to try and stimulate economic growth and inflation. But the policy has squeezed the lending profits of major banks.

Banking regulators in Japan welcomed the restructuring moves by MUFG and Mizuho, indicating the banks need to diversify their revenue sources and improve the efficiency of their operations. Some analysts, though, feel the banks need to undertake more radical reforms to produce long-term financial stability. “Cost cuts and moderate restructurings won't be enough,” said Naoki Murakami of Perpetual Valuations in Tokyo. “The major banks need to rethink their business models and make the hard decisions to significantly streamline their operations.”

Overall, MUFG and Mizuho's announcements this week highlight the difficult business environment for Japan's largest banks. By consolidating some business units, cutting jobs and expenses, and improving operational efficiency, MUFG and Mizuho aim to overcome financial pressures, adapt to a prolonged low-growth economy, and position themselves for future success. But a return to strong and sustainable profit growth will require broader reforms and may ultimately depend on overall economic conditions improving in Japan.
