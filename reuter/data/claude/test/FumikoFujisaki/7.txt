Major Asset Management Firms Suspend Business with Nomura Securities After Scandal

Three of the world's largest asset management companies announced today that they are suspending new business deals with Nomura Securities, one of Japan's biggest brokerages, following revelations of systemic compliance failures and unauthorized trading activities. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors, which collectively manage over $15 trillion in assets, said they have halted plans to allocate additional funds or enter into new agreements with Nomura Securities until a full accounting of the company's risk management and oversight problems has been conducted. 

The moves come just days after Nomura revealed that it could face up to $3 billion in losses from unauthorized transactions by a rogue trader in its European operations. The trader, identified as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, manipulated Nomura's risk management systems for over two years to conduct high-risk trades that exceeded authorized limits. By the time the illegal activities were discovered, the trades had racked up massive losses that threaten to wipe out the profits of Nomura's European unit for the fiscal year.

Nomura's CEO Koji Nagai apologized for the company's "totally unacceptable" risk oversight failures and pledged a full investigation, but asset managers and regulators are demanding stronger action. "Simply apologizing is not enough given the systemic failures at play here," said the chief investment officer of a major British pension fund. "We need to see heads roll, proper controls put in place, and assurances that neitherNomura's culture nor its risk systems will allow this to happen again."

Analysts say the trading scandal could not have come at a worse time for Nomura, which has struggled to achieve sustainable profitability and share higher returns with investors. "Nomura was just starting to regain its footing when this news broke, and now its reputation has taken a major hit," said a banking analyst at Daiwa Securities. Nomura's shares have fallen over 15% since the unauthorized trading was revealed, wiping out over $3 billion in market capitalization. 

Regulators in Japan, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe have launched investigations into Nomura's risk management failures and compliance issues. Nomura also faces private lawsuits from shareholders alleging mismanagement. The series of headaches adds to the challenges Nagai has faced in turning around Nomura, which has reported only one year of record profits under his 5-year leadership.

The suspensions by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are an especially harsh blow to Nomura's credibility. The asset management firms are typically some of the most active traders in the markets where Nomura competes, and generate a large share of brokerage commission revenues and profits. If more institutions join them in blacklisting Nomura, the Japanese firm may face an uphill battle to restore investor trust and confidence. At a minimum, Nomura may be forced to take broader action to reform internal controls and compliance to win back its key clients in the global financial industry.
