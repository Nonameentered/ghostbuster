 Nomura Securities Pays Over $555,000 in Stock Deals to Racketeer, Resulting in Top Management Resignations

Japan's largest investment bank Nomura Securities has been rocked by a scandal involving payments of more than $555,000 to a known racketeer linked to organized crime syndicates. The undisclosed payments were made by the former head of Nomura's compliance division over an 18-month period via a complex set of transactions involving the purchase and sale of stocks at inflated prices. 

The racketeer, named as Hideaki Kobayashi, has past convictions for extortion and blackmail, and is suspected of links to Yakuza crime syndicates. Though the exact nature of the relationship between Kobayashi and Nomura's former compliance chief is unclear, prosecutors believe that Kobayashi was blackmailing the Nomura executive or had compromising information on the official.

The payments came to light during a tax audit of Kobayashi's accounts and were reported to law enforcement authorities. Prosecutors then launched an investigation into Nomura earlier this year to determine if the payments constituted bribes or kickbacks, and if other executives were aware of the transactions.

Nomura's CEO and Chairman have resigned from their positions to take responsibility for failing to prevent the scandal, though they claim they were unaware of the improper payments. The resignations of two of the company's most senior figures are a major blow, and Nomura's shares have fallen by over 10 percent since the announcement. Regulators are also scrutinizing Nomura's compliance and governance practices.

In a statement, Nomura's new Acting CEO, Tetsu Ozaki, said: "These events are deeply regrettable and unacceptable. We take our compliance and regulatory obligations extremely seriously, and we sincerely apologize for this failure in governance and oversight." He pledged a full and independent investigation into how the payments continued without being detected for so long.

Law enforcement officials have hinted that further charges are possible if it emerges that other executives conspired to hide the payments or if Nomura benefitted financially from any illegal activities facilitated by Kobayashi. The scandal looks set to seriously damage the reputation of Japan's leading securities firm in the coming months with major questions around its compliance regimes and risk controls. Nomura now faces an uphill struggle to regain investor confidence.
