Japanese securities houses face potential closures due to expected liberalisation of brokerage fees  

Major securities firms in Japan are bracing for significant impacts on their businesses as the government is set to liberalize brokerage fees later this year. The deregulation of fees charged to individual investors for stock transactions is expected to put major pressures on revenues and profit margins of the large brokerages that have dominated the industry.

At present, the large securities houses including Nomura, Daiwa and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley  effectively set a minimum floor for brokerage fees under a gentlemen's agreement. Fees for individual investors are fixed at a relatively high level, providing the major firms stable and lucrative revenue streams. However, under pressure to stimulate growth in the stock market and encourage greater participation by retail investors, the government will scrap the agreement and allow for competition on brokerage fees.

Industry experts predict fees could drop by 30-50% once liberalization takes effect, slashing a key revenue source for the major brokerages. "Brokerage fees currently account for 15-30% of revenues at the top securities firms," said Jiro Hatakeyama, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. "A sharp reduction in fees will significantly impact their top and bottom lines."  

The big brokerages acknowledge the challenges ahead but some also see opportunities to gain market share. "While liberalization may put short-term pressures on our retail brokerage business, lower fees will make the stock market more accessible and help attract new investors over the longer run," said a spokesperson for Daiwa Securities. "We aim to leverage our large customer base and solid brand to increase volumes and maintain our leading position in the market."

However, the policy change is set to reshape the competitive landscape for the securities industry. Lower fees are expected to benefit online brokerages like Rakuten Securities and SBI Securities that have much lower cost structures compared to traditional brokerages. “Ultra-low cost is at the heart of our business model,” said the CEO of Rakuten Securities. “Liberalization of fees will allow us to leverage our cost-efficiency to gain share from the established brokerages.”  

With nearly 200 securities houses currently registered in Japan, many smaller firms may struggle to remain viable as competition intensifies in a low fee environment. M&A activities are expected to accelerate, with predictions that 30-50% of firms may be acquired or even forced out of business in the coming years following the changes. The consolidation of the crowded securities sector may be an inevitable outcome of the government's efforts to boost market participation through greater competition. While a shake-up of one of the country's core financial industries is unsettling for some, others argue this may be a pivotal moment for revitalizing Japan's stock market and spurring new growth in the economy.
