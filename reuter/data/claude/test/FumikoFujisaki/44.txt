Punitive actions against Nomura Securities unlikely despite complaint to prosecutors: Government sources

By [Assistant's Name]

The Japanese government is unlikely to take punitive actions against Nomura Securities despite receiving a criminal complaint against the company for allegedly assisting a former client in avoiding financial regulations, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Earlier this week, an advocacy group lodged a complaint with Tokyo prosecutors alleging that Nomura Securities had helped an unnamed firm conceal losses in order to avoid increased scrutiny from regulators. The complaint claims Nomura had advised the firm on strategies to spread losses across multiple accounting periods and use complex derivative transactions to mask the true financial picture of the company.

If proven, such actions by Nomura Securities would be a serious violation of Japan's financial laws. However, government sources said the criminal complaint is unlikely to lead to formal charges or penalties against Nomura, given the complexity of the case and the challenges in proving deliberate illegal activity. Prosecutors are aware of the complaint but have made no decision on whether to launch a formal investigation, the sources said.

A spokesperson for Nomura declined to comment on the issue due to the ongoing legal process. However, Nomura rejected any allegation of wrongdoing in its response to the initial advocacy group report. Nomura said it provides appropriate advice to all clients based on the law and disputes any claims to the contrary.  

Analysts say punitive actions against a major brokerage like Nomura Securities are rare in Japan, despite various compliance issues uncovered in the industry over the years. Regulators are more likely to issue business improvement orders or other administrative penalties rather than criminal charges, except in clear cases of egregious law breaches. Some critics argue this approach fails to adequately deter bad behavior.

“There is a tendency for Japanese regulators to be quite lenient toward domestic financial institutions,” said Koshiro Mitsuyama, a Tokyo-based lawyer specializing in banking regulation. “Just issuing an administrative penalty is unlikely to compel major changes, especially for well-established brokerages.”
