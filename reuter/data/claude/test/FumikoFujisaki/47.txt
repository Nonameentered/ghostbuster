Nomura Securities Co Ltd faces wider pay-off scandal as former executives and general manager implicated  

Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's largest brokerage firm, is facing a widening scandal over illegal pay-offs as former top executives and a long-standing general manager have now been implicated in the unfolding crisis.

New reports from Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) allege that Nomura's former chairman Kenichi Watanabe and vice chairman Takumi Shibata, who both resigned in October 2008, were directly involved in approving "entertainment" payments to politicians, government officials and corporate executives in breach of Japanese law. 

The SESC has been investigating entertainment payments made by Nomura since 2012. It has already issued a business improvement order against the firm and brought charges against Nomura and its former chief operating officer for alleged insider trading. However, the latest reports suggest the illegal payments were much more widespread, endorsed at the highest levels of the organization, and involved sums well in excess of $1 million over six years.

In the most damaging revelations yet, SESC investigators claim that Nomura's former general manager of the corporate business department, Toshihiro Sato, oversaw a "pay-off fund" used to bribe officials and executives to win business contracts for Nomura, with the full knowledge and approval of Watanabe and Shibata. Sato, who was forced to resign from Nomura in 2008, allegedly distributed entertainment funds to about 100 people between 2002 to 2008.

The scandal threatens to deal a major blow to Nomura's reputation and raises questions over its internal compliance controls. The firm has struggled to regain market share since the 2008 global financial crisis and a pay-off scandal of this scale could undermine its attempts to portray itself as a reformed organization. There are also fears the SESC probe could spread to other brokerages.

Nomura has denied any wrongdoing by its former or current executives and said an internal investigation found no evidence the entertainment payments constituted bribery. However, sources close to the SESC probe insist the payments violated Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by influencing the decisions of public officials, politicians and executives for commercial gain. The SESC is expected to announce formal charges against the former Nomura chairman and vice chairman later this month.

The pay-off scandal is the latest in a series of blows for Japan's financial services sector, which has faced widespread criticism over poor corporate governance and scandals including accounting fraud and insider trading. There are now calls for tougher penalties and more robust compliance systems to rebuild trust in the Japanese financial system. Nomura's ability to put this latest scandal behind it and avoid further damage to its brand may depend on how swiftly and transparently it investigates these new revelations from its past.
