Major Asset Management Firms Suspend Business with Nomura Securities After Scandal

Three of the world's largest asset management firms announced today that they are suspending  business with Nomura Securities after revelations of improper practices at the major Japanese brokerage firm. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors said they have halted trading with Nomura as they investigate the scope of a brewing scandal at the Tokyo-based firm.

Nomura disclosed last week that some of its employees had leaked confidential information about planned stock sales to favored clients so they could make unauthorized trades ahead of the public. The revelations have led to a plunge in Nomura's share price and renewed scrutiny of practices in Japan's financial sector. Nomura's CEO Koji Nagai apologized at a press conference and pledged a full internal review, but asset managers that funnel trillions of dollars through Nomura are taking matters into their own hands.

“We are suspending brokerage transactions with Nomura as we investigate the facts around these troubling revelations,” said a BlackRock spokesperson. The world's largest asset manager has nearly $7 trillion in assets under management and regularly trades tens of billions of dollars of securities a month through major brokerages like Nomura. State Street and Vanguard, which jointly oversee more than $15 trillion, announced similar suspensions of activity with Nomura within hours of BlackRock's statement.

The moves by the giant asset managers represent a major blow to Nomura, which depends heavily on facilitating trades for institutional investors and asset managers. But industry experts said Nomura had violated the trust of its biggest clients and partners, requiring drastic action.

“Nomura has really damaged its credibility with this scandal, and the asset managers had no choice but to hit pause on the relationship,” said Jennifer Suzuki, a financial analyst with the Center for International Finance and Development in Tokyo. “The scandal calls into question Nomura's governance and compliance practices, and asset owners cannot afford to take risks with funds they oversee.”  

Nomura may now face further scrutiny from regulators in Japan and possibly overseas, depending on the scope of wrongdoing by its employees. The Asset Management Association of Japan has said it may launch its own investigation to "determine if Nomura's actions undermine proper governance within the Japanese financial system.”
