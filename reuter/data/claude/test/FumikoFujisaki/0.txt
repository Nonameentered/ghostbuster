Japanese Banks to Stick to Plans to Dispose of 4.5-5.0 Trillion Yen Worth of Problem Loans Despite Weak Stock Market 

Major Japanese banks plan to continue with previously announced plans to dispose of 4.5 trillion yen to 5 trillion yen ($40 billion to $45 billion) worth of nonperforming loans in the fiscal year ending March 2021 despite recent stock market weakness. The banks aim to accelerate the cleanup of their balance sheets by shedding loans that have remained unrecoverable for years.

Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group—Japan’s three largest banking groups—all reaffirmed their guidance on problem loan disposals at recent earnings briefings. The banks’ shares have declined over concerns about the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak, but their executives said their plans remain unchanged. 

The volume of planned disposals represents a sizable increase from the 3.8 trillion yen total for the last fiscal year. The banks are stepping up their efforts to resolve long-standing bad loans ahead of a deadline at the end of March 2021 set by the Financial Services Agency, Japan’s banking regulator.

Mizuho aims to dispose of 1.8 trillion yen to 2 trillion yen in problem loans, up from 1.6 trillion yen last fiscal year. Sumitomo Mitsui is targeting 1.5 trillion yen to 2 trillion yen, up from 1.2 trillion yen. Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s largest bank, plans to dispose of 1.2 trillion yen to 1.5 trillion yen, roughly flat from last fiscal year. The amounts include both write-offs and sales of nonperforming loans.

“We will steadily proceed with resolving problem assets by properly assessing collateral values and borrowers’ repayment abilities,” said Mizuho President Tatsufumi Sakai. The bank’s stock price has declined nearly 25% since the start of the year amid the market turmoil, but Sakai said Mizuho’s financial position remains solid.

Sumitomo Mitsui President Makoto Takashima acknowledged that his bank’s share price has also dropped sharply. But he said the lender will “steadily implement previously announced measures to improve asset quality without changing course.” The SMFG stock is down about 20% since the beginning of January.

Mitsubishi UFJ President Hironori Kamezawa said his bank does not currently plan any changes to its disposal target, noting that the volume of problem loans has consistently declined over the past several years. The bank’s stock price is down roughly 17% so far this year.  

The acceleration of problem loan disposals comes as major Japanese banks have largely worked through the nonperforming loans that soured in the late 1990s and 2000s following the collapse of Japan’s economic bubble. Stricter regulations have also prodded the banks to more aggressively clean up their balance sheets. But a weak stock market and slowing global economy could complicate their efforts.
