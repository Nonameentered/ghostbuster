Japanese workers face stagnant wages and job insecurity as traditional pay systems give way to flexibility  

TOKYOâ€”For decades, Japanese salarymen enjoyed the privileges and security of lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. But those traditional systems are fading amid economic pressures, leaving many workers today feeling stuck in an employment limbo of stagnant wages and job insecurity.

Japan's large corporations were once famous for their "lifetime employment" system, where salaried employees had secure jobs until retirement age. Under this system, workers were paid based primarily on seniority. While their wages were not high, salaries rose steadily over the years and employees accumulated generous benefits. They could plan their lives and finances around the certainty of their career.

But in the "lost decades" following the economic bubble burst of 1991, lifetime employment gave way to flexibility as companies aimed to cut costs. Many firms have moved away from seniority-based pay, offering lower base salaries with more variable pay based on performance. They rely more on temporary or contract workers who can be hired and fired easily.   

For young workers today, the old era of lifetime employment exists only in their parents' stories. "The companies my father worked at don't provide the same level of stability and security that he had," says Mitsuo Yamaguchi, a 29-year-old contract worker in Osaka. Like many of his generation, Yamaguchi has switched jobs multiple times, with no guarantees of permanent employment. Despite having a specialized degree and many years of experience, his income has remained stagnant.

Surveys show major companies now provide stable employment for only about one-third of their workforce, down from around 70 percent in the 1990s. The share of non-regular workers, including those in temporary, part-time or contract positions, has climbed to nearly 40 percent. 

These non-regular jobs typically pay much lower wages and provide little job security or opportunity for career growth. "There are fewer and fewer opportunities for young people to build careers, even if they work hard to get higher education," says economist Toshiaki Tachibanaki of Kyoto University.

The two-track system has contributed to worsening income inequality in Japan and shaky household finances. Poverty rates are rising, especially among single-parent families and the elderly. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made economic reforms a priority, but overhauling the employment system remains a politically charged issue.

"The old systems cannot continue as they are, but companies are hesitant to change them too quickly," says Kaori Hayashi, a researcher at the Institute for Research on Household Economics in Tokyo. "Many people still long for the security of lifetime employment. But the economic realities will not allow that system to survive."

For now, Japan is caught between past and present. The lifetime employment era is fading into memory, but the modern system to replace it remains elusive. Workers will likely continue facing the headwinds of stagnant wages and job insecurity until broader reforms take shape.
