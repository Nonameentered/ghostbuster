Abnormal Demand for Property in Hong Kong Likened to Accumulating Gold, Warns Advisor to Governor's Inner Cabinet

HONG KONG—The abnormal demand for residential property in Hong Kong is akin to accumulating gold, warned a senior government advisor, calling for the establishment of measures to cool the overheated housing market in the city.

Anna Wu Hung-yuk, chairwoman of the advisory committee to the chief executive's office, said at a roundtable on housing policy today that households were rushing to buy homes not for their living needs but to protect their wealth against inflation and economic uncertainty amid the US-China trade war and weakening global growth . 

“It's a kind of mass psychology -- like accumulating gold,” said Wu, a former lawmaker and solicitor general. “Once people think that's the only way left to protect your asset, then it becomes really abnormal and this kind of popular demand will drive the prices up very high and the affordability will become a very serious problem.”

The comments came as home prices in Hong Kong have continued to rise over the past few months, defying government cooling measures introduced last year. Home prices in the city increased for the 22nd straight month in December, government data released yesterday showed. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor rolled out a vacancy tax and higher stamp duties on residential property transactions in her policy address last October but the measures have not had the desired effect so far.

Wu warned that relying on market forces alone would not solve Hong Kong's housing affordability issue.  She called on the government to take bolder actions such as increasing public housing supply, making subsidized housing available to more people, and tightening mortgage lending to curb housing demand. 

The roundtable today was attended by scholars, real estate agents, and interest groups. But pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse Wai-chuen, who was also present at the discussion, criticized the suggestion of government intervention, calling it "unrealistic." The meeting yielded no concrete recommendations and the government has not announced any new policies in response to the discussion.
