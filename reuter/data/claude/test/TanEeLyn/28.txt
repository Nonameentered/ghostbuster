Hong Kong government releases modified version of planned civil rights curbs ahead of Chinese rule takeover

The Hong Kong government today released revisions to a controversial bill that would curb civil rights and liberties in the territory. The new National Security Law aims to prohibit secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces in Hong Kong. The law is set to take effect on July 1 to coincide with the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from British to Chinese rule.

The revised bill comes after months of pro-democracy protests last year over a now-withdrawn extradition bill. Protesters feared the bill would undermine Hong Kong’s judicial independence and lead to further erosion of civil liberties. The new security law has also sparked protests, with critics arguing it will lead to a crackdown on dissent and freedoms of speech. The law allows Chinese security agents to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time.  

Under the revised bill, some new offenses have been removed and the scope of enforcement powers has been narrowed. However, the law still grants authority to China's security apparatus in Hong Kong and allows for closed-door trials and secret witnesses in some circumstances. The maximum penalties for crimes have also been reduced from life imprisonment to 10 years. But activists argue any new security legislation poses risks to civil rights in the territory.

The new law “marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,” said Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy leader. Critics argue the law's vague language gives the government broad discretion to target opposition politicians, activists and media organizations. But Chinese and Hong Kong officials defend the law as necessary to counter threats to China's national security.

Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said the law aims to prevent “chaos and violence that have occurred over the past year.” She said the government had modified the bill to ensure it aligns with Hong Kong’s common law traditions. But opposition lawmakers argued the bill will undermine the legal system and freedoms guaranteed when Britain handed Hong Kong to China in 1997 under the “one country, two systems” framework.

The legislation has also raised tensions between the United States and China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the security law “destroys Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms.” But China's Foreign Ministry said foreign countries should stop interfering in China's internal affairs. For now, it remains unclear how rigorously the new law will be enforced once it takes effect next week. Activists, however, fear it marks the beginning of a new era of mainland control in Hong Kong.
