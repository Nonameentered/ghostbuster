NYMEX Partners with Hong Kong Futures Exchange in Challenge to Singapore Trading Dominance 

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) announced today that it is partnering with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to launch a new range of energy futures contracts traded in Asian time zones. The partnership is a direct challenge to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in Singapore, which currently dominates energy futures trading in Asia.

Under the agreement, NYMEX will license its flagship light sweet crude oil and natural gas futures contracts to HKEX to trade on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE). The new contracts will be denominated in U.S. dollars but traded during Asian trading hours to suit customers in China, Japan, South Korea, and other regional markets. 

“This partnership with HKEX provides NYMEX with a unique opportunity to extend our global reach and offer our benchmark energy products to customers in Asia for the first time,” said NYMEX President Bill Johnson. He added that the new offerings complement NYMEX’s existing contracts traded on its global ClearPort platform, which is open nearly 24 hours a day.

HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said the partnership will allow Asian customers to trade NYMEX’s “most liquid and trusted energy futures contracts within Asian trading hours and in a time zone that suits our markets.” HKEX has set a target for its derivatives market to account for 5% of global market share by turnover in the next 3-5 years. The new NYMEX contracts are a key part of achieving this goal, according to an HKEX press release.

Analysts said the move poses a strong challenge to ICE’s dominant position in Asia. “ICE has had a monopoly on Asia’s energy futures trading for too long. The NYMEX deal marks a real threat that could cut into ICE’s volumes and profits,” said George Hemminger of Commodity Insights. However, he noted that customer familiarity with ICE’s broadly similar contracts, traded for nearly 15 years in Singapore, gives the exchange a head start.

The new HKFE contracts will launch in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval. NYMEX and HKEX said in a joint statement that the partnership “represents an important step toward establishing a 24-hour energy trading center bridging major time zones in the U.S., Asia and Europe.” The deal signals intensifying competition between global exchange powerhouses as they look to new markets for growth.
