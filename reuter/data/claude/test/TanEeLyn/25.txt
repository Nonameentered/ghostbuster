China Everbright Holdings Emerges as New China Link for HongKong Telecom, Analysts Say 

Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited (HKT) announced today that it has selected China Everbright Holdings Limited as its new partner to expand business operations in mainland China. According to analysts, the move signals HKT's ambitions to tap into new growth opportunities in China to offset a slowing Hong Kong market.

China Everbright Holdings, a major financial conglomerate based in Beijing, will acquire a 10% stake in HKT for HK$12.3 billion. The strategic partnership will allow HKT to leverage China Everbright's extensive network and relationships to launch new mobile, broadband, and enterprise services targeted at mainland customers. 

"China's telecom market has massive potential, so this partnership provides us an ideal platform to access new customers and unlock the huge opportunities for future growth," said HKT Chief Executive Peter Wong.

Under the terms of the agreement, HKT and China Everbright will form a joint venture to develop a range of cross-border telecommunications services between Hong Kong and major cities in Guangdong province, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The JV will have access to the networks of both companies, enabling it to provide one-stop connectivity and ICT solutions to customers with operations in Hong Kong and southern China.

Analysts view the partnership as a pivotal step for HKT to remain competitive against rivals like China Mobile and China Unicom which already have strong presences in Hong Kong. "HKT has been slow to act on China opportunities compared to competitors," said Jeannie Cho, telecom analyst at HSBC. She estimates that mainland Chinese visitors and businesses in Hong Kong drive over 25% of HKT's revenues. "A partnership with China Everbright is a strategic play to defend HKT's home market while enabling more coordinated expansion into southern China."

The HKT-China Everbright deal is subject to regulatory approval but expected to complete in the third quarter of this year. HKT shares rose 4% on the news, reflecting investor confidence in the partnership to deliver long term growth and gains for the company.
