Hong Kong's Business Community Cautiously Welcomes Renewal of China's Trade Privileges by US President Clinton, Hopes for Congressional Approval

President Bill Clinton announced today the renewal of China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status with the United States for another year. The extension of MFN status for China allows Chinese imports into the U.S. to receive low tariffs and was widely expected to be renewed despite some opposition in Congress.

The business community in Hong Kong, which serves as an important trade hub between mainland China and the United States, welcomed the news but expressed caution that Congressional approval is still needed. The U.S.-Hong Kong Business Council called Clinton's announcement an "important first step" but said "we must not take renewal for granted." Congress has the ability to block the extension of MFN status when it takes up legislation on the issue, likely in the coming months.

MFN status has been granted annually to China since 1980 but has faced more vociferous opposition in Congress in recent years over concerns about China's human rights record and restrictions on political dissent. President Clinton has argued that maintaining open trade relations gives the U.S. more leverage to encourage political reforms. The annual renewal has often been contentious, but business groups have warned that failing to grant MFN and imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods could start a "trade war" and damage the U.S. economy.

Hong Kong businesses, in particular, have benefited enormously from open trade with both mainland China and the United States. Hong Kong is the second largest trading partner for China after the European Union and serves as the primary conduit for Chinese goods exported to the West. "The renewal of MFN status for China is crucial for Hong Kong's prosperity and its status as a center of international trade and finance," said Quentin Chu, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.  

However, others argue that the policy of constructive engagement with China on trade has failed to produce substantial improvements in human rights. Opposition leaders in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement argue that the city's freedoms have eroded in recent years under Chinese rule. "MFN renewal is a slap in the face to Hong Kong people fighting for basic human rights and liberties," said Emily Lau, a leading pro-democracy advocate and former legislator in Hong Kong. The renewal is likely to intensify the debate around U.S. policy toward China and Hong Kong in the coming months.
