Senior Economist Warns of Risky "Red Chip" Stocks Amid Poor Health of Mainland State-Owned Companies 

A prominent economist has issued a stern warning about the risks of investing in so-called "Red Chip" stocksâ€”shares of mainland Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. In a research note published today, Chen Ming of the China Policy Institute said many centrally controlled SOEs are in a "precarious financial position" due to years of debt-fueled expansion and inefficiency. 

Chen pointed out that according to official figures, liabilities at China's SOEs have ballooned to over 150% of GDP in 2019, up from about 100% a decade ago. "Many SOEs have relied on easy access to cheap credit to fund aggressive expansion, but have failed to generate decent returns on capital or operating margins," Chen wrote. "They face a debt burden that will be increasingly difficult to service if China's economy continues to slow."

The warning comes at a time when many Red Chip stocks are trading at multi-year lows, reflecting investor concerns about the state of China's economy and corporate sector. Shares of major mainland SOEs like China Unicom, China Mobile, and CNOOC are down over 25% from their highs last year, vastly underperforming the broader Hang Seng Index. 

However, some analysts argue that Red Chips deserve a closer look as many are trading at steep discounts to their book value. Ivan Fok, an equity analyst at ABC Securities said, "While the debt levels at many SOEs are indeed worrying, share prices have fallen so much that many Red Chips are now extremely undervalued if you consider the assets on their balance sheets." Fok pointed out that CNOOC, for example, is trading at just 0.7 times book value despite holding extensive oil and gas reserves.

Chen disagreed, cautioning investors that many assets on SOE balance sheets may be overvalued. "When you have SOEs borrowing money to overpay for assets and build excess capacity, asset values get artificially inflated," Chen said. "In the next downturn, many of those values may wind up being written down, in which case book values today could prove meaningless." Chen advised investors to avoid most Red Chips until SOEs show clear signs of reducing debt levels and improving transparency and efficiency.
