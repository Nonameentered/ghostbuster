Hong Kong's El Dorado Dream Unlikely to Materialize for Chinese Residents

Hong Kong has long been seen by mainland Chinese as a land of opportunity and wealth, a modern-day El Dorado. However, that dream is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve for Chinese moving to Hong Kong. 

New research shows that Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong face significant economic disadvantages compared to native Hong Kong residents. A study from Hong Kong University found that university-educated Chinese immigrants earn on average 30% less than their Hong Kong-born counterparts with comparable credentials. Immigrants are often relegated to lower-paying jobs that do not match their education or experience.

Language barriers and cultural differences are partly to blame. While Hong Kong conducts most business in Cantonese, the majority of Chinese immigrants speak Mandarin. They struggle with the fast pace of Hong Kong's business culture, social norms, and English proficiency, which is valued in international business. “If you cannot communicate fluently, you have less of a chance to get a good job and prove your worth,” said Wang Chen, an accountant from Shanghai who has lived in Hong Kong for five years. 

China's tight control over information and education also disadvantages Chinese migrants. The Chinese education system focuses on rote learning and obedience rather than creative thinking, leaving immigrants ill-prepared for Hong Kong's dynamic economy. “The skill sets that immigrants have may not necessarily match the requirements and expectations of Hong Kong employers,” said Joyce Chung of Hong Kong University's Department of Economics.

The economic prospects for Chinese immigrants have worsened in recent years due to growing anti-mainland sentiment in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy protests in 2014 and 2019 targeted mainland visitors and immigrants, portraying them as a threat to Hong Kong's identity and prosperity. Calls for immigration restrictions are fueling discrimination against Chinese job applicants and workers.

While migrating to Hong Kong remains appealing for higher pay and more freedoms compared to mainland China, the city's El Dorado image is fading for most Chinese. Chung believes that “achieving a standard of living comparable to average Hong Kong residents is becoming increasingly difficult for Chinese immigrants.” With political and social tensions on the rise, Chinese seeking economic opportunity and upward mobility may need to look beyond Hong Kong to realize their dreams.
