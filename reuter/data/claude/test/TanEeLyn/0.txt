Hong Kong's property sector condemns government over new measures to curb housing prices   

The Hong Kong government announced new measures today aimed at curbing rising housing prices in the city, including tighter caps on mortgage lending and higher stamp duties on property transactions. The new policies were condemned by major players in Hong Kong's real estate sector, who warned that they could significantly impact property demand and lead to a market downturn.

Under the new measures, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for new mortgage applicants in Hong Kong will be lowered to 60% from 70%, meaning homebuyers will need to put up more of their own money upfront when purchasing a property. The government will also raise the ad valorem stamp duty rate for transactions of over HK$2 million from 4.25% to 5%, increasing the tax burden on buyers of residential apartments.   

The moves are the latest attempt by Hong Kong's government to rein in a red-hot property market that has seen prices more than double over the past decade due to low-interest rates and limited housing supply. However, industry groups argue that further property curbs are unnecessary and could destabilize the market.  

"The continued tightening measures create uncertainties and will only serve to damage market confidence and sentiments," said Louis Chan, Asia Pacific Vice Chairman at Centaline Property Agency Limited, one of Hong Kong's largest real estate firms. He warned that transaction volumes could plunge by up to 40% in the coming months.  

Smaller property agencies voiced even starker warnings about the impact to their businesses. "This is like killing the chicken to get the eggs," said Kenny Tsui of Kenway Real Estate Agency. "The government is destroying the livelihoods of real estate agents in its misguided effort to make housing more affordable." 

The new measures are the fourth in a string of property tightening moves since 2009. While previous rounds of property curbs did lead to temporary dips in home prices, Hong Kong's housing affordability has remained little changed over the long run due to the city's strong fundamentals. Still, there are concerns that the accumulating effect of the property tightening may finally exert a lasting negative impact on the market. The coming months will be a litmus test for just how much further Hong Kong's property prices can climb.
