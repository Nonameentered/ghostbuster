Hong Kong luxury property market looks set for consolidation before Q3 recovery, say experts  

The luxury residential property market in Hong Kong is poised to stabilize in the coming months before recovering in the third quarter of this year, according to industry experts. Sales of high-end apartments and houses in the territory have slowed in recent months amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.   

"The Hong Kong luxury property market has seen some short-term softening, but the fundamentals remain strong in the long run," said John Wong, Head of Research at Hong Kong Property Services. "Wealth creation in Hong Kong and China continues at a rapid pace, and Hong Kong remains a highly attractive city for high-net-worth individuals to live and invest in property."

The number of high-end property transactions fell around 20-25% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, figures from major property agencies show. However, average selling prices have largely held steady due to limited supply and a desire by sellers to hold out for better prices. 

"Sellers are increasingly realistic in a quiet market," said Christine Li, Director and Head of Research at Cushman & Wakefield Hong Kong. "They are likely to become more flexible in negotiations in the coming months to secure transactions. For buyers, this presents opportunities to enter at a reasonable price." She expects the price decline for the luxury segment to be in the 5-8% range for the full year.

Market watchers point out that Hong Kong remains a highly sought-after city for the global elite, with its low taxes, rule of law, and geographic connectivity. The territory ranked third after New York and Los Angeles in the latest Knight Frank Wealth Report, which measures the cities preferred by ultra-high-net-worth individuals.  

“Despite some economic headwinds, we believe the resilience of Hong Kong’s luxury property market will drive a rebound in sales volumes in the third quarter and steady price growth in the medium term,” said Wong.
