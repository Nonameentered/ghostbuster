China and Britain Reach Agreement on Chinese Troops in Hong Kong, But Disagreement Looms Over Residency Rights After Handover  

Hong Kong — China and Britain have reached an agreement to allow Chinese troops to be stationed in Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty on July 1, 1997, but tensions remain over the right of abode for British citizens in the territory.

In a joint announcement today, officials from both sides said they agreed that China will have the right to station Chinese armed forces in Hong Kong following the handover. Under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984, China will regain sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain while the territory maintains a “high degree of autonomy” for 50 years. The agreement today settles a dispute over whether Chinese forces could deploy in Hong Kong after 1997 or if the territory would remain demilitarized.

The Chinese side has been adamant that Chinese troops must be positioned in Hong Kong to reinforce China's sovereignty over the region. British officials have stressed the need to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life after the handover, but ultimately conceded in the face of China's uncompromising stance. With the agreement reached today, Chinese forces would need to be stationed in military barracks in Hong Kong but would not patrol public spaces. A suggested compromise that the number of troops not exceed the British forces currently stationed in Hong Kong of about 6,000 appears to have been accepted.  

However, disagreement persists over residency rights for British citizens currently living in Hong Kong. The nearly 3 million Hong Kong residents have been promised distinct rights under Chinese rule, but Britain wants guarantees that Hong Kong residents of British citizenship can freely move in and out of Britain as well as remain in Hong Kong indefinitely. China has pushed back, saying it will not accept what it calls “dual citizenship” for Hong Kong residents after the handover and that people of British nationality must apply for Chinese passports to remain. This is emerging as the next sticking point that could damage relations as the historic transfer of power draws near.

The agreement on Chinese troops suggests Britain has accepted China's non-negotiable terms on certain sovereignty issues. But the dispute over post-handover residency indicates that negotiating the tricky balance of power between autonomy and control in Hong Kong will persist in the months leading up to the transfer of the territory from Britain to China. With less than eight months until the handover, more political clashes may be on the horizon.
