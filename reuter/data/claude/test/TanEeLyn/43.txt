Publisher and Activists Release Compilation of Letters and Essays by Chinese Dissident Wei Jingsheng, Sparking Anger from Beijing

A newly released book compiling the letters and essays of renowned Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng has drawn the ire of Beijing and prompted censorship within China. The book, titled "The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings by Wei Jingsheng," was published this week by a coalition of activists and Wei's longtime international supporters. 

Wei, 69, is one of China's most prominent political dissidents. He spent a total of 18 years in prison for his advocacy of democracy and human rights. The new book compiles many of Wei's essays, letters, and poems written during his time in prison. In them, Wei passionately argues for political reform, democracy, and freedom of expression in China.

Within hours of the book's release, Chinese government censors blocked access to websites mentioning Wei or the book. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the publication, calling Wei "a criminal" and the materials "slander." However, activists and supporters of Wei have hailed the book as an inspiration. 

"Wei Jingsheng's moral courage and visionary ideas have been an inspiration for generations," said Wang Dan, another leading Chinese dissident who spent years in prison for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. "This book ensures his important voice will continue to echo around the world and one day inside China too."

Wei remains in China but lives under heavy surveillance and restrictions on his movement and speech. In an essay included in the book, Wei writes, "The democratic future of China depends on each and every one of us -- whether we cow to tyranny or have the courage to stand for freedom and justice."  

The book was published by Beijing Spring, a New York-based organization founded by Chinese exiles and frequently critical of China's human rights abuses. All proceeds from sales of the book will go to Wei and his wife to support their living expenses, the publishers say. The book is available for purchase worldwide as an e-book and in print.
