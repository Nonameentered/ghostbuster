Sing Tao's English-language papers face advertising revenue drop after probe into circulation figures 

The English-language editions of the popular Hong Kong newspaper Sing Tao Daily are facing a large drop in advertising revenue following an independent probe that found the publications had exaggerated their circulation numbers for years. 

Advertisers were notified this week that the audit conducted by the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations found that the circulation figures of the English-language Sing Tao Daily and The Standard were inflated by up to 35% for the past three years. The exaggerated numbers meant that advertisers were paying rates based on readership numbers that did not match the papers’ actual reach and influence.

In response, major advertisers have pulled hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising from the two publications as they reassess the effectiveness of the outlets as part of their media campaigns. The drop in advertising revenue could deal a major financial blow to the Sing Tao media group, which relies heavily on advertising to fund its free English-language publications.   

The circulation scandal is a rare controversy for the 104-year-old Sing Tao media empire, which publishes one of Hong Kong's oldest and most prestigious Chinese-language dailies along with an English website and newspaper aimed at expatriate and Asian-American readers. Sing Tao executives apologized for the misleading figures, blaming the overstatements on “calculation errors” that occurred during a transition to a new auditing methodology three years ago.

However, some media analysts and former employees question whether it was possible to overstate numbers for such a long period due to repeated mistakes, suggesting the exaggerations may have been more intentional. The Sing Tao publications are battling other free English newspapers in Hong Kong for readers and advertising spending.

The Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations has suspended the Sing Tao publications from its reporting methods for six months as punishment for the unreliable data. Sing Tao will have to undergo special audits to regain entry into the organization’s reports, which provide the industry standard for circulation numbers used by media buyers and advertisers.

The chairman and CEO of the Sing Tao media group, Ho Tsu Kwok, issued a written apology acknowledging the organization’s “failure to meet the high standards of integrity, transparency and accountability that we demand of ourselves.” However, Mr. Ho also said Sing Tao remained committed to its English-language publications and announced new internal controls to ensure accurate record-keeping and auditing in the future.

The blow to Sing Tao’s reputation and bottom line comes at a challenging time for Hong Kong’s English-language media, which face competition from digital outlets as well as uncertainty around new national security laws being imposed on the city by Beijing. The circulation scandal is a setback for an organization that has long been an influential source for news about Hong Kong, China and Asia in English. The coming months will reveal whether Sing Tao can regain the trust of readers and advertisers, or whether its English-language brands face a longer-term struggle.
