Future lawmakers in Hong Kong back Beijing-backed plans to dilute civil liberties in the territory 

A group of pro-Beijing politicians elected to Hong Kong’s legislature have voiced support for controversial new security laws proposed by China that would significantly curb civil liberties in the semi-autonomous territory.

The 11 politicians who won seats in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council election last month said at a press conference Tuesday that they back the Chinese government’s proposal to draft new laws banning secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. Critics argue the laws would erode the “one country, two systems” framework that guarantees Hong Kong a high degree of political and legal autonomy from mainland China.

“We fully support the Central Government's decision and believe that national security legislation is necessary and urgent for Hong Kong,” said Holden Chow, one of the newly elected lawmakers. “The legislation can bring Hong Kong back to stability and prosperity, protect people’s lives and property, and ensure the sound implementation of ‘One Country, Two Systems.'”

The statement is an ominous sign for pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong who have long feared Beijing’s encroachment on civil liberties. The new crop of pro-establishment legislators now control a majority in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, giving Beijing far more sway over local politics. 

Chinese officials argue that national security laws are necessary to prevent unrest like the anti-government protests that roiled Hong Kong last year, while activists argue they will be used to curtail dissent and political opposition. The proposals have been widely criticized by Western governments, human rights groups and pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong.

“This is a frontal attack on Hong Kong’s promised autonomy under the handover agreement with the UK,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker. “The Chinese Communist Party now has Hong Kong in a stranglehold and it is tightening it little by little.”

The issue is expected to intensify tensions between Beijing and Washington over Hong Kong’s political future. The Trump administration has condemned China’s security laws and threatened to revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status, but Beijing appears unlikely to back down on the issue.

Some analysts argue China’s tightening grip is partly a result of inaction from Western governments to defend Hong Kong’s democratic values and civil liberties.
