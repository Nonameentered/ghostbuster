Hong Kong Democracy Activist Martin Lee Stays to Fight for Civil Liberties Under China's Rule

HONG KONGâ€”Martin Lee, one of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists, says he has no plans to leave the city despite the erosion of civil liberties and freedoms that have made Hong Kong a beacon for dissent under China's authoritarian rule.

In an interview, the 82-year-old Lee said he intends to stay in Hong Kong to continue advocating for political reform and civil rights, even as Beijing exerts more control over the former British colony. Lee helped found the city's main opposition Democratic Party and has long pushed for full democracy in Hong Kong.

"I was born here. I grew up here. I want to die here," said Lee, a lawyer and politician. "As long as I live, I will fight for democracy and universal suffrage."

Lee's comments come as China has tightened its grip over Hong Kong in recent years. In 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law that gives authorities broad powers to crack down on dissent and curtail civil liberties in Hong Kong. Since the law was enacted, many pro-democracy politicians, activists and protesters have been arrested and jailed. Some, fearing prosecution, have fled into exile.

The erosion of freedoms has dealt a blow to Hong Kong's status as an international business and financial hub, where the rule of law and open dissent were once tolerated. For decades after Britain handed Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city enjoyed unique liberties and autonomy under the "one country, two systems" framework. But in recent years, China has worked to bring Hong Kong under its control and quash any challenges to its authority.

Lee said he believes the future of Hong Kong remains uncertain but he is still hopeful the city can gain more freedoms and democratic rights in the long run. Though some colleagues have urged him to seek safety in exile overseas, Lee insisted his place is in Hong Kong, where he was born and raised.
