Deng Xiaoping's son wants to see Hong Kong handover ceremony

The son of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has expressed a wish to attend Hong Kong's handover anniversary ceremony on July 1, according to sources close to the central government in Beijing. 

Deng Zhifang, the youngest son of the late paramount leader who spearheaded China's economic reforms, has conveyed a desire to participate in at least part of the events in Hong Kong marking 25 years since the city was returned from British to Chinese rule, the sources said.

Deng Zhifang, who has kept a relatively low public profile, wants to be part of the official Chinese delegation attending the ceremony as a show of support for his father's vision to restore sovereignty over Hong Kong, the sources confirmed.

"The handover of Hong Kong was a very significant event for Deng Xiaoping and China's rise on the global stage. Deng Zhifang wants to be there to commemorate his father's important legacy," said one source with knowledge of the situation.

However, it is unclear if Deng Zhifang will attend in a personal or official capacity given his lack of any current official government or Communist Party positions. The 75-year-old former soldier has rarely appeared at public events since retiring from the People's Liberation Army.

"The central authorities have noted Deng Zhifang's enthusiasm for attending the handover ceremony but have not yet decided how or if he will participate given his somewhat ambiguous status," said one source.

The potential attendance of the former leader's son has been kept confidential in the planning of events to mark the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1, 1997. Most key arrangements have already been made and announced for the day including official ceremonies, galas, and fireworks.

Deng Xiaoping was the architect of China's "one country, two systems" model that allows Hong Kong to retain certain freedoms under Chinese rule. The handover of Hong Kong symbolized the end of British colonial influence and the resumption of Chinese sovereignty.
