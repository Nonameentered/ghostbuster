Hong Kong activists fear Chinese rule will curtail civil liberties

HONG KONG - In 1997, Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China under an agreement that guaranteed certain civil liberties and a high degree of autonomy for the city. Now, 23 years later, rights advocates and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong fear that Beijing is tightening its grip and chipping away at the freedoms promised under the "one country, two systems" framework. 

The latest sign of Beijing's increasing influence came last week when Hong Kong's legislature passed a law criminalizing any disrespect of China's national anthem. Offenders could face up to three years in prison and large fines. Activists see the new law as a direct attack on free speech and protest rights. 

"This is just the latest attempt by Beijing to silence dissent and curtail civil liberties in Hong Kong," said Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests in 2014. "If peacefully singing an anthem can land you in jail, it shows how fragile our freedoms have become."

The anthem law comes on the heels of several other moves that activists say threaten Hong Kong's autonomy. In 2018, the Hong Kong government banned a pro-independence political party. And earlier this year, several pro-democracy lawmakers were barred from running for re-election. 

According to Anson Chan, a former lawmaker and rights advocate, China's increased involvement in Hong Kong affairs is rapidly undermining the "one country, two systems" principle. "Beijing seems intent on exerting more and more direct control over Hong Kong," Chan said. "They are reinterpreting the framework to suit their needs and tightening their grip."

Beijing counters that it is acting within the framework of the 1997 handover agreement. It argues that restrictions around independence advocacy, national security, and patriotism do not infringe on civil liberties. But activists warn that if Beijing continues to expand its influence over Hong Kong, the freedoms that make it unique could be extinguished. 

Chan said activists hope the international community will speak out in support of Hong Kong's autonomy. "We need to get the message out that Hong Kong's basic liberties are under threat," she said. " 'One country, two systems' is at stake, and the world needs to stand up and take notice."
