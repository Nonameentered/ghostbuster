Hong Kong's Future Leader Tung Chee-hwa to Unveil Revised Plans to Curb Civil Liberties and Rights After Reversion to China 

HONG KONGâ€”Tung Chee-hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong after its handover from Britain to China, is set to announce sweeping new restrictions on civil liberties and political dissent in the territory. The plans, slated to take effect July 1 when China assumes control of Hong Kong, have already drawn criticism from pro-democracy activists and human rights groups.

According to senior government officials who requested anonymity, Tung will unveil new laws banning certain forms of political protest, tightening controls on free speech, and empowering police to detain individuals for up to 60 days without charge. The crackdown is aimed at snuffing out growing unrest over China's influence in Hong Kong's affairs. But critics argue it will strip away the autonomous civil and political rights Hong Kong residents were promised under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China.

"These authoritarian laws are completely contrary to the Basic Law and the promises made to Hong Kong people, " said Martin Lee, a pro-democracy politician and senior barrister. "If enacted, they will mark the end of Hong Kong as we know it." 

Under the new rules, police will be given broad authority to deny permits for public gatherings or protests deemed "detrimental to national security." They could also censor publications, arrest journalists or shut down media organizations accused of imperiling China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. Individuals charged with "sedition or subversion" may be denied bail and face life imprisonment.

A senior official in Tung's administration told reporters that "some sacrifice of political freedom is necessary to ensure a smooth transition of power and safeguard China's control." But another source said Tung faces dissent within his own cabinet over the severity of the measures, suggesting he may delay or soften their implementation to avoid unrest.

Tung's rollback of civil liberties comes amid other moves asserting Beijing's control. China's parliament recently voted to dissolve Hong Kong's elected legislature and replace it with an appointed body. Chinese officials also continue to reject calls for direct elections of Hong Kong's chief executive, a position Tung himself was appointed to by a China-selected election committee.  

The impending restrictions have galvanized Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Lee and other activists are organizing protests to pressure Tung to withdraw the "draconian" laws and honor China's promises to preserve Hong Kong's freedom. How Beijing responds may signal whether it intends to tighten its grip, or take a more reconciliatory approach to start its rule.
