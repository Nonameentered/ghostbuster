Chinese army advance party arrives in Hong Kong ahead of controversial transfer of power

An advance party of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday ahead of the controversial transfer of power in the city from the British to China on July 1. The arrival of the 40 PLA soldiers was met with protests from pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong concerned about Beijing's control over the territory's governance after the handover.

Around 20 activists gathered outside the PLA barracks in Hong Kong holding placards and chanting "One Country, Two Systems, Protect Hong Kong's Freedom". The principle of "One Country, Two Systems" was agreed between Britain and China to protect Hong Kong's partial autonomy and way of life for 50 years after the handover. However, activists argue Beijing is already exerting too much control and influence over the city, undermining Hong Kong's freedoms and high degree of autonomy promised in the handover agreement.

The PLA soldiers were greeted in Hong Kong by military officials but did not interact with protesters. They will prepare barracks and facilities in Hong Kong ahead of the deployment of an estimated 3,000 PLA troops to Hong Kong next week. The troops will be stationed in former British military bases as Beijing takes control of Hong Kong in its first major acquisition of territory beyond the Chinese mainland. 

China's President and the General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin said "the recovery of Hong Kong is a landmark event in China's resumption of sovereignty and territorial integrity." However, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed "anxiety" over whether China will honor its commitment to preserve Hong Kong's way of life. Mr. Blair said Britain has a "moral responsibility" to ensure China upholds the promises made in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

The handover ceremony will be held on July 1 with the current Hong Kong governor Chris Patten formally surrendering control of the territory at midnight. Flag raising ceremonies and other events are planned across Hong Kong to mark the occasion, though protests are also expected amid fears over Beijing's control and threats to civil liberties. The handover will end over 150 years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong, closing a long and complicated chapter of history between Britain and China. The world will be watching to see if China can maintain Hong Kong's success and freedoms in this 21st century chapter of East meets West.
