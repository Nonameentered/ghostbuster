Hong Kong Assures Filipino Workers of Their Status After Chinese Rule Takeover

The Hong Kong government today assured Filipino migrant workers in the territory that their rights and status will be protected after China officially takes over control of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. There are over 130,000 Filipinos working as domestic helpers in Hong Kong, and there were concerns about their fate under Chinese rule. 

In a statement, the Hong Kong government said existing labor laws protecting foreign workers will remain in force after the handover from Britain to China. "The rights, benefits, and working conditions of foreign domestic workers, including those from the Philippines, will remain unchanged," the government said. The Chinese government has also given assurances that it will honor Hong Kong's capitalist system and way of life for 50 years after the handover under the "one country, two systems" principle.

The Philippine consulate in Hong Kong welcomed the assurances from Hong Kong and Chinese authorities. Consul General Leo Herrera-Lim said "this should help address the concerns of Filipinos working here, especially those who wish to renew their contracts after July 1." However, Herrera-Lim urged Filipino workers to remain vigilant about their rights and alert the consulate of any issues.

There were concerns that China may impose more restrictions on civil liberties in Hong Kong and weaken labor protections. Filipino migrant groups had earlier called on the Philippine government to negotiate a "special status" for migrant workers to protect them after the handover. However, the assurances from Hong Kong and China appear to have alleviated those concerns for now.

The Filipino migrant community is an important part of Hong Kong's labor force, especially in providing childcare and elderly care. Filipinos have been coming to Hong Kong since the 1970s, drawn by the prospect of earning much higher wages than in the Philippines. Most work on two-year contracts, sending money back home to support families in the Philippines.

The smooth transition after the handover will depend on China's willingness to honor its promises to maintain Hong Kong's liberal labor and economic policies. For Filipino workers, the next few months will be a period of anxious waiting and watching as Hong Kong enters a new era under Chinese rule after 150 years of British administration.
