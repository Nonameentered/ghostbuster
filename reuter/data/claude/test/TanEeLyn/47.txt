Hong Kong gears up for historic handover ceremony to China 

Hong Kong is preparing for a momentous ceremony on July 1st to mark the return of the former British colony to China after more than 150 years of colonial rule. In a few days, Britain will hand over sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in a ceremony attended by dignitaries from China and Britain, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prince Charles.

The handover will end Britain's 156-year rule of Hong Kong and mark the transition to China's "one country, two systems" policy, under which Hong Kong will maintain its capitalist system and way of life for 50 years. There are both celebrations and fears about the handover among Hong Kong's 6.9 million residents. 

The lavish handover ceremony will include fireworks, cultural performances, and the raising of the Chinese flag over Hong Kong. The British flag will be lowered for the last time in a symbolic moment  marking the end of the British Empire. Prince Charles will represent Britain in the ceremony, while China will be represented by President Jiang Zemin, who will tour Hong Kong and attend a variety of events in the days leading up to the handover.

The pending handover has long split opinions in Hong Kong. While some welcome the handover as the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, others fear China may not honor its promise to maintain Hong Kong's freedoms and way of life. Democracy activists worry that civil liberties like freedom of speech may be eroded under Chinese rule. There are also economic concerns about Hong Kong's future prosperity and stability.

Despite these concerns, China has repeatedly assured Hong Kong residents that their way of life will remain unchanged under the "one country, two systems" principle. Both China and Britain are optimistic the handover will proceed smoothly. All eyes will be on Hong Kong on July 1st to witness this significant moment in history.
