Hong Kong Property Prices Expected to Fall Further as Speculators Turn Nervous 

Property analysts in Hong Kong are forecasting further drops in housing prices in the coming months as investor confidence remains shaky. The residential property market, which had been one of the hottest in the world for years, has been hard hit in recent months due to the US-China trade war, slowing Chinese economy, and more recently the coronavirus outbreak.

According to recent industry data, home prices in Hong Kong fell for the sixth consecutive month in January. Property values declined 1.9% in January compared to December and are down over 10% from their peak in May 2019. The downturn is the most prolonged slump since the global financial crisis over a decade ago.  

"Investor sentiment has taken a big hit due to the recent headwinds from different directions,” said Tom Lee, a property analyst at an independent Hong Kong think tank. “Both end-users and speculators have turned nervous and cautious. The supply of available housing units also remains at a high level, giving buyers ample room for bargaining."

The Hong Kong property market has long been a popular target for wealthy Chinese mainland investors. But the year-long trade war between China and the US has weakened the Chinese economy and softened demand for Hong Kong property. The recent coronavirus outbreak, which has led to quarantine measures and restricted travel within mainland China, has compounded the anxieties.  

Speculative activity, which at one point accounted for up to 20% of all property transactions, has declined notably. Flipping properties for quick profits has become rare, say industry experts. Instead, more owners appear willing to cut losses and make compromises. The volume of property sales fell 40% in January compared to the same month last year. 

"The boom days of ever-rising home prices in Hong Kong seem to be over, at least for now,” said Mark Brown, head of research at an international property brokerage. “As speculators exit the market, more realistic pricing based on intrinsic value is returning. For would-be homebuyers, especially young families, this may be an opportunity they have long been waiting for."

However, a turning point is hard to predict. The Hong Kong government has refrained from drastic market interventions. Interest rates also remain stable. Unless there are surprises in the geopolitical sphere or global economy, price cuts are expected to continue but at a more gradual pace, according to analysts. A broader recovery will ultimately depend on the revival of demand from end-users and investors alike when confidence returns.
