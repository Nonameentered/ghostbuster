Philippine Foreign Secretary to Raise Concerns Over Fate of Filipino Workers in Hong Kong After July Handover to China  

Manila, Philippines - Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced today that he will travel to Hong Kong next week to raise concerns over the fate of thousands of Filipino domestic workers after Hong Kong returns to Chinese control on July 1. There are an estimated 200,000 Filipinos living and working in Hong Kong, with many employed as domestic helpers. 

Locsin said he will meet with officials from Hong Kong and China to discuss potential issues around immigration, labor conditions, and legal status for Filipino workers after the handover from British to Chinese sovereignty. “We have decades of experience sending workers to Hong Kong under British rule, but the change in administration brings many uncertainties,” Locsin said in a statement. “We need to ensure the fair and humane treatment of our citizens working abroad.”

The Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries supply Hong Kong with a large portion of its foreign domestic workers. Filipino workers in Hong Kong sent home $3.2 billion in remittances last year, an important source of foreign income for the Philippines economy. Any threat to the jobs or income of these workers could pose problems.

Locsin said he will push for Hong Kong to establish a “dependents unit” to handle concerns related to foreign domestic workers similar to existing British agencies. He also said immigration, visa, and labor issues need to remain largely unchanged to provide continuity and security for Filipino and other migrant workers. “While we celebrate Hong Kong returning to China, we must safeguard the wellbeing of our citizens in this transition,” Locsin said. 

Officials in Hong Kong and China have publicly stated that the rights and status of foreign workers will remain largely unchanged after the handover. But labor advocates argue that without concrete policies in place, Filipino and other workers could face greater risks of abuse or non-payment of wages. The uncertainty has already led some Filipino workers to return home, according to local reports.

Secretary Locsin said he will report on the outcome of his meetings next week after he returns from Hong Kong. The Philippine government may face public pressure to take action to protect citizens working abroad if their status in Hong Kong remains unclear post-handover on July 1. Overall, Filipino officials and workers alike are approaching the next few weeks with a mix of hope and trepidation.
