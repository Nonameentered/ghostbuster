China and Britain agree to release land in Hong Kong, but experts say it's not enough to solve housing crisis 

Hong Kong’s housing shortage received a boost this week as China and Britain agreed to release more land for development. However, housing experts warn the additional land may not be enough to make housing affordable for average Hong Kong citizens.

China’s mainland government agreed to provide more land in the rural New Territories for residential housing projects. The British government, which still owns portions of undeveloped Hong Kong land, also committed to speeding up the release of certain sites for affordable housing development. According to government officials, the new land could be used to build up to 70,000 apartment units, the largest increase in available housing in Hong Kong in decades.

Housing prices in Hong Kong have skyrocketed in recent years due to a supply shortage and strong demand. The average Hong Kong apartment now costs nearly $500,000 USD, the highest in the world and unaffordable for most citizens. The lack of affordable housing has been cited as a major threat to Hong Kong’s competitiveness and status as a global financial hub. 

However, housing experts argue the new land releases are “too little, too late.” Irene Chan of the Hong Kong Housing Society said, “While any new land is helpful, 70,000 units would still not meet the total demand for affordable housing in Hong Kong. Hundreds of thousands of families are still on the waiting list for public housing, and private sector housing is out of reach for the vast majority.” She estimates Hong Kong needs to build up to 200,000 units per year to stabilize housing prices at most citizens’ income levels.

Other experts argue maximizing available undeveloped land is not enough and policy changes are needed. Thomas Wong, professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong, advocates for policy reforms including an vacant home tax, a stamp duty on foreign buyers, and rent control policies. "The fundamental issues are political and policy failures, not a physical lack of land,” he said. "Simply relying on releasing more land might provide temporary relief but won't address the roots of the crisis."

China’s central government has resisted major policy interventions, wary of setting any precedents that undermine their control. However, with affordable housing a mounting concern, more action may be unavoidable. Leaders will need to decide if further land releases and moderate policy changes can tame the crisis, or if bolder steps are required to make Hong Kong housing affordable and available for all.
