Hong Kong and Taiwan hit impasse over flags in direct shipping link talks

Negotiations between Hong Kong and Taiwan over establishing direct maritime shipping links have hit an impasse over the use of flags, reflecting ongoing political tensions.

Talks began in 2016 to allow direct shipping routes between Hong Kong and Taiwanese ports without stopping in mainland China. The proposed "three links" of direct transport, trade and postal services is aimed at boosting economic ties between the two territories. 

However, the talks stalled last month due to a longstanding dispute of how to display flags on the ships operating the new routes. Taipei insists that ships flying the flag of Taiwan can dock directly in Hong Kong, while Hong Kong officials argue that may violate its constitutional obligation to uphold Beijing's one-China principle.

Under that principle, China sees Taiwan as a province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, is constitutionally banned from treating Taiwan as an independent sovereign state.

Taiwan operates under its official name, the Republic of China, with state symbols including a red-blue flag featuring white sun. Hong Kong only allows the flag of the People's Republic of China.

"The root cause of the impasse is political, not technical," said Wong Chi-kwong, a Hong Kong lawmaker in the city's pro-democracy camp. "If Hong Kong can allow the US flag or other countries' flags to be flown here, there's no reason why it can't do the same for Taiwan."

Pro-Beijing politicians and officials in Hong Kong insist that direct links can only proceed if Taiwanese ships fly the flag of "Chinese Taipei", the designation Taiwan uses to participate in some international organizations like the Olympics. But that would be unacceptable to Taiwan, which seeks greater international recognition and opposes any move that might undermine its sovereignty.

"For Taiwan, this is a matter of principle," said President Tsai Ing-wen recently. "We should not be diminished by ruthless political suppression." Her government has vowed not to back down on the use of Republic of China flag.

The impasse highlights the complex geopolitical issues surrounding ties between Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. Further progress on direct links now depends on a political breakthrough that remains elusive despite strong public support and economic incentives on both sides of the strait.
