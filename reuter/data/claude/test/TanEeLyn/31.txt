Hong Kong Welcomes Clinton's Renewal of China's Trade Privileges, Urges U.S. Congress to Follow Suit

HONG KONG â€” The Hong Kong government and business community welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision this week to renew China's trade privileges, allowing Chinese goods to continue entering the United States at low tariff rates. Clinton announced a renewal of China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status, citing progress in China's human rights record as well as the potential economic impact on Hong Kong if MFN was revoked. 

Hong Kong officials and industry leaders expressed relief at the news, having warned for months that revoking China's MFN status could damage Hong Kong's economy. The city serves as a major gateway for Chinese goods flowing into international markets. Last year, nearly 40% of China's exports passed through Hong Kong on their way to the U.S. and elsewhere.

"We are pleased that President Clinton has recognized the importance of continued constructive engagement with China, including extending MFN status," said Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise Yue. "The economic well-being and continued prosperity of Hong Kong depends heavily on the maintenance of a liberal multilateral trading system and our role as a hub for trade and investment flows between China and the world."

U.S. lawmakers critical of China's human rights record and unfair trade practices have threatened each year to revoke the special trade status, which dates back to 1980. Each year, supporters of continued economic ties with China prevail to push through a renewal, but by a narrower margin each time. This year the renewal passed by a just a seven-vote margin in the House of Representatives in May, the tightest vote yet. The U.S. Congress must still formally approve this week's executive order by Clinton to grant MFN renewal.

"We call upon the United States Congress to sustain a visionary policy with respect to China and Hong Kong," said Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "It is vital for business confidence that the U.S. continues to strengthen rather than undermine economic ties with this region."
