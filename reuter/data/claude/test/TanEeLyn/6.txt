Hong Kong's Future Leader to Curb Demonstrations and Foreign Funding for Political Parties After Handover to China 

HONG KONG — Carrie Lam, the incoming leader of Hong Kong, vowed on Monday to curb political demonstrations and restrict foreign funding of political parties after China takes control of the former British colony on July 1. 

In her first news conference since being selected as Hong Kong’s next chief executive in March, Mrs. Lam signaled her intent to move swiftly and restore order after several years of political tensions and unrest in the city. She said she would introduce legislation banning "any person or group from receiving political funding from outside the HKSAR," referring to Hong Kong's official name, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

Mrs. Lam also promised to push for laws against "violent political behavior" and actions that advocate "Hong Kong independence" from China. While protests are currently allowed in Hong Kong and political dissent is tolerated, Mrs. Lam indicated this would no longer be the case under her administration. Her hard line is consistent with the increasingly authoritarian stance of China's leaders in Beijing.

"There are calls to amend existing laws to better regulate public assemblies, better regulate political organizations, and enact laws to prohibit advocacy of Hong Kong independence," she said. In her view, limits on political freedoms are necessary to "safeguard national security."

Critics argue that her proposals threaten Hong Kong's political freedoms and high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" framework in place since Britain handed sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Political parties, human rights groups and student organizations in Hong Kong have vowed to oppose what they see as the erosion of civil liberties in the territory.
