Hong Kong's colonial government warns Beijing not to enact laws before handover 

The Hong Kong colonial government issued a stern warning to Beijing today not to enact any laws that would apply to Hong Kong before the handover of sovereignty on July 1, 1997. 

In a statement, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said "Any laws passed by the National People's Congress that are intended to have effect in Hong Kong would be a flagrant breach of the Joint Declaration." The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration paved the way for the handover of Hong Kong to China but guaranteed the city a "high degree of autonomy" under the "one country, two systems" principle.

Patten's statement comes after reports that the National People's Congress may consider passing laws related to "sedition" and "national security" that could apply in Hong Kong. Beijing sees some pro-democracy activities in Hong Kong as seditious threats to Communist Party rule. However, Patten argued that the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution after the handover, gives the city the sole right to enact its own national security laws.

The public warning is the starkest yet by Patten as his administration counts down its final six months in power. Tensions between London and Beijing have escalated this year over everything from scraps of redundant royal symbols to key details regarding Hong Kong's political system after 1997. 

In his statement, Patten said the UK has "responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration which we take extremely seriously. Anything other than a hands-off approach to Hong Kong's autonomy would call into question China's willingness to keep its word on other matters."

The British Foreign Office echoed Patten's views in strong terms. A spokesperson said, "Any attempt by Beijing to impose national laws in Hong Kong before transfer of sovereignty would violate the Joint Declaration and endanger Hong Kong's stability and prosperity." Under the Joint Declaration, Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 as long as the city retained its liberal institutions and way of life for 50 years.

Beijing issued a quick retort to what it called "groundless accusations." A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, "No country, organization or individual has the right to interfere in laws and policies that China's central government and parliament enact according to the Constitution." The spokesperson argued that as Hong Kong will become part of the People's Republic of China in less than six months, its legislature has the legal basis and obligation to make laws for the territory.
 
The war of words has again highlighted the precarious state of trust between London and Beijing with mere months remaining until the handover. After 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong's future governance and autonomy still rest uncertain at the hands of its new sovereign power in Beijing. For Hong Kong's citizens, Patten's resolute warning provided a small measure of reassurance  - but could amount to a final act of defiance with little lasting impact. The next six months will prove pivotal in determining whether "one country, two systems" is a viable formula to protect Hong Kong's cherished freedoms or simply an empty slogan.
