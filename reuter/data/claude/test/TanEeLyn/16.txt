Hong Kong Democratic Leader Martin Lee returns from successful foreign tour ahead of China takeover 

Martin Lee, the long-time leader of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, returned home today after a week-long tour of Western capitals ahead of Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty to China on July 1. Lee's tour, which took him to Washington, London and Ottawa, was aimed at reassuring leaders that Hong Kong will retain sufficient political and economic freedoms after the handover from British to Chinese rule.

In meetings with political leaders and lawmakers, as well as speeches to business groups and think tanks, Lee argued that Hong Kong's success has been built on its strongrule of law, independent judiciary, and civil liberties like free speech and free press. He urged countries to continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate customs territory, and to support democratic reforms "to safeguard the way of life we cherish."

Lee met with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who reaffirmed America's intention to monitor Hong Kong's autonomy under the conditions of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Lee told reporters, "The Vice President assured me the U.S. places great importance on the implementation of the one country, two systems principle." In London, Lee met with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who promised to closely watch Hong Kong's freedoms in the years after the handover. 

In Ottawa, Lee met Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and urged close ties between Canada and Hong Kong to continue. "Hong Kong and Canada share the same values of freedom, human rights and rule of law," Lee said. Canada is home to 300,000 people of Hong Kong descent.

Lee's visit underscores fears that Hong Kong's way of life may change dramatically after the handover to China. Under the “one country, two systems” principle agreed between Britain and China, Hong Kong is guaranteed autonomy and the preservation of its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997. However, China's poor human rights record and the lack of democracy on the mainland has fueled concerns that these freedoms are at risk after the handover.

Still, Lee expressed optimism that if countries vigilantly defend Hong Kong's liberties, the “one country, two systems” model can succeed. Lee said, “We aim to demonstrate to the world that the people of Hong Kong are capable of running Hong Kong well with a high degree of autonomy as promised by the Sino-British Joint Declaration." Lee's tour appears to have rallied international support for that goal and Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. The real test, however, begins in just over two weeks when China assumes full sovereignty over the future of Hong Kong.
