Future Hong Kong lawmakers pass laws ahead of return to China, sparking legal clash with pro-democracy camp 

The newly elected pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong passed several controversial laws today ahead of the territory’s handover from Britain to China on July 1. The laws were rushed through in a marathon legislative session, bypassing normal procedure and scrutiny. 

The move has sparked outrage from pro-democracy groups who see it as undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic values. They argue that the undemocratic process goes against the “one country, two systems” principle that is meant to govern Hong Kong after the handover.

Among the laws passed today was a sweeping public order bill that gives authorities broad powers to ban protests, seize property, conduct warrantless searches, and deport individuals deemed as threats to national security. Critics argue the vague terms of the bill can be used to crackdown on political dissent.

Another controversial law lowered the voting age of future lawmakers from 21 to 18 but also imposed additional "patriotism" criteria for candidates, essentially disqualifying pro-democracy advocates. "It is clear they want to stack the legislative deck in their favor before China takes control," said Wong Chi-fung, a spokesperson for the pro-democracy Hong Kong Alliance.

The unorthodox legislative process began weeks ago but accelerated this week after pro-Beijing lawmakers took 70 percent of seats in Hong Kong's final election under British rule. Once the handover occurs, the new laws will remain in effect even as China dismantles Hong Kong's democratically elected legislature and judiciary. 

"There is no legal basis for laws to be applied retroactively after the handover,” said Margaret Ng, a legal scholar and pro-democracy lawmaker.  She said the laws were "shoved down the throat of Hong Kong people" by lawmakers who lacked legitimacy. Ng and other legal experts plan to challenge the laws in court on procedural and constitutional grounds.

The clashes foreshadow rising tensions between pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong and the Beijing-backed authorities who will soon be controlling the territory of 7 million people. While Hong Kong was promised a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after the handover, China's rapid legislative takeover has led to fears of creeping authoritarianism and erosion of democratic freedoms. The new laws passed today are set to accelerate that process as soon as Britain's flag comes down over Hong Kong.
