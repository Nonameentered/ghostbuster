Britain and China to Discuss Deployment of More Troops in Hong Kong Before Handover  

Britain and China are set to hold high-level diplomatic talks this week to discuss sending an additional 2,000 Chinese troops to Hong Kong in the months leading up to the colony's handover from Britain to China on July 1, 1997. The deployment of Chinese military personnel is aimed at ensuring a smooth transition of power and maintaining stability in Hong Kong during this period.

According to sources, the British delegation will be led by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, while the Chinese side will be headed by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The talks, to be held in London, are a follow up to an agreement in principle reached between the British and Chinese governments earlier this year to increase the Chinese troop presence in Hong Kong prior to the handover. Britain currently maintains a force of about 10,000 military personnel in Hong Kong.

The handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China after more than 150 years of British rule was agreed upon in 1984. Under the agreement, Britain will transfer sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997. However, Hong Kong will be allowed to retain its capitalist system for 50 years after the handover. There are concerns that China may not honor its promise to not interfere in Hong Kong's affairs over this period. The additional Chinese troops are aimed at quelling anxieties in Hong Kong over its return to Chinese rule.       

Some political groups and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have voiced concerns over what they see as an erosion of civil liberties and freedom of speech in the colony as the handover approaches. They fear that China will not honor its promise to grant Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" under Chinese rule. The presence of more Chinese troops in Hong Kong will only heighten these anxieties, critics argue. Supporters counter that the troop deployment will help ensure stability and facilitate a smooth transfer of power on July 1, 1997.
