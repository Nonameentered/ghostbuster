Hong Kong's Container Terminal Number Nine Project Resolved with Berth-Swapping Plan and Removal of Key Consortium 

The Hong Kong government today announced a resolution to the stalled Container Terminal 9 expansion project, replacing the private consortium initially selected to develop the terminal with a plan to reconfigure existing berths. The government terminated its agreement with the private consortium led by Hutchison Port Holdings Trust and replaced it with a plan to redevelop existing berths to add capacity.

The Container Terminal 9 project was intended to be an extension of the existing Kwai Tsing container port, adding additional berths to meet projected growth in cargo shipments. However, the key consortium selected for the HK$20 billion expansion project in 2016 faced multiple delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and financing. The government determined the consortium would be unable to complete the expansion on schedule to meet Hong Kong's growing container shipping demands.  

In place of the terminal expansion, the government announced a plan to reconfigure and convert existing berths in the Kwai Tsing port to increase efficiency and accommodate larger ships. By rearranging container yards, re-assigning smaller berths to handle specific types of cargo, and enabling existing berths to host mega-container ships, the port is projected to gain up to 50% additional capacity within the next 3-5 years according to Transport Secretary Frank Chan Fan. 

While the berth-swapping plan provides a quicker solution to expand port capacity, it may have longer-term consequences for sustaining Hong Kong's competitive advantage in container shipping. Industry analysts noted that reconfiguring existing infrastructure is a short-term fix and developing major new deep-water terminals is needed for long-term growth. However, terminating the agreement with the private consortium opens an opportunity for the government to reconsider how it partners with private companies on future port expansion projects.

The government portrayed the decision as in the best interests of ensuring Hong Kong's port remains a leading facilitator of regional trade. However, others viewed it as a blow to private investment in Hong Kong's public infrastructure. The resolution of the container terminal project highlights both the government's resolve to pursue practical near-term solutions as well as the challenges of partnerships with private consortiums on complex infrastructure developments.
