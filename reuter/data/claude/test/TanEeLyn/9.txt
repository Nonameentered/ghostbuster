Hong Kong Warns Beijing Against Enacting Laws Before Handover 

The Hong Kong government warned China today against enacting any new national security laws for the territory before China resumes control of the former British colony on July 1.

Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said that any unilateral move by Beijing to impose new laws before the handover could undermine the smooth transition to Chinese rule and damage Hong Kong's image as a center of commerce.

"We have a constitutional duty to enforce the laws of Hong Kong until June 30," Mr. Tung said at a news conference. "If the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passes new laws before then that are applicable to Hong Kong, it would not be proper or practical for us to implement them."

Mr. Tung's warning came after China's main legislative body, the Congress's Standing Committee, said it would consider a bill to prohibit treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese Government - acts that were not previously crimes in Hong Kong. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have been negotiating the terms of a new legal code for the territory after the handover. But the committee's move caught most Hong Kong leaders by surprise.

Beijing has pledged to preserve Hong Kong's political and economic freedoms under the "one country, two systems" formula guiding the territory's retrocession. But Mr. Tung and other Hong Kong leaders have repeatedly stressed that China should not take any steps that could undermine investor confidence in the territory or rule of law. 

Hong Kong solicitors and bar association representatives voiced strong objections today to any moves by Beijing to impose new national security laws on the territory before the handover. They argue that Hong Kong's independent judiciary, based on English common law, should not be subject to Chinese edicts before the transfer of sovereignty.
