Hong Kong's Martin Lee Upstages Future Leader Tung Chee-hwa with US Support for Political Freedoms 

Hong Kong's pro-democracy leader Martin Lee stole the spotlight from future Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa during Tung's visit to Washington DC this week. Lee, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, met with senior US officials and lawmakers to push for continued political freedoms and democratic reforms after the handover of sovereignty from Britain to China on July 1. 

Tung was in Washington for a lower-key visit to build relationships with US leaders ahead of becoming Hong Kong's first post-handover Chief Executive. However, Lee's high-profile visit and appeals for US intervention in Hong Kong's political future dominated news coverage and discussions around Capitol Hill. Lee warned that "after the handover, there will be a continuous erosion of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong" under the control of Beijing and Tung's administration.

Lee met with officials at the White House and State Department, as well as leaders from both parties in Congress. He urged them to monitor the human rights situation in Hong Kong closely after the handover and to pressure China and the incoming Hong Kong government to honor political freedoms protected in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.

Several members of Congress introduced a resolution expressing "grave concern" about threats to freedom of speech, assembly and political participation in Hong Kong. The resolution called on China to uphold civil liberties in Hong Kong and allow democratic reforms like direct elections of government leaders. Senators and members of Congress from both parties pledged to visit Hong Kong after July 1 to meet with pro-democracy leaders and review whether China and Tung were protecting key political freedoms.

Tung gave a keynote speech at the US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, reaffirming commitments to civil liberties, free markets and the rule of law. However, Tung avoided answering questions from US lawmakers about potential erosion of freedoms or how quickly he would expand democratic institutions. Tung said political reforms would be "gradual and orderly" but gave no timetable for direct elections of government leaders. Analysts viewed Tung's visit as an attempt to reassure US political and business leaders about Hong Kong's future amid anxiety over growing Chinese control. But Lee's high-profile lobbying mission clearly stole the spotlight and put Tung on the defensive about democratic reforms.

The duelling visits highlight tensions over the pace of expanding freedoms and elections in Hong Kong after the handover to China. While Britain signed a joint declaration with China protecting civil liberties for 50 years, pro-democracy leaders fear without democratic reforms and elections, those freedoms are at risk over time. Tung and Beijing will be under close scrutiny from the US and other Western governments to uphold the rights and freedoms that have long underpinned Hong Kong's prosperity. But this week in Washington, Martin Lee landed the first blows in the bout over Hong Kong's democratic future.
