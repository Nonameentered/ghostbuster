Second Wave of Chinese Soldiers Arrive in Hong Kong Ahead of Handover from UK  

A second group of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers crossed into Hong Kong from mainland China today, as the handover of the territory from the UK to China draws near. Nearly 400 soldiers traveled across the Sham Chun River border in seven buses this morning, joining the roughly 400 troops that entered Hong Kong last week.

The arrivals mark the start of what will be a gradual increase of Chinese military presence in Hong Kong leading up to the official handover on July 1, when Britain will end its 156-year colonial rule. Under a deal struck between Britain and China, Hong Kong will operate under the "one country, two systems" model, allowing it to maintain its own political and economic systems for 50 years.

However, the influx of Chinese troops ahead of the handover is stoking fears among some Hong Kong residents about losing freedoms and autonomy. "We don't know what the soldiers will actually do or how much authority they will have," said Wong Chen, a pro-democracy activist, "Their presence just reminds us that communist China will soon be fully in control of Hong Kong."

Chinese officials say the PLA troops will not interfere in everyday affairs and are simply preparing for a garrison handover ceremony on July 1. The soldiers will be confined to their barracks. But critics argue this contradicts the promises of Hong Kong maintaining its own rule of law and judicial independence from China.

The handover agreement limits China to stationing only a symbolic number of troops in Hong Kong after 1997 for defensive purposes. However, out of view of cameras at the border today, critics worry Beijing may have quietly sent more soldiers across, or plan to do so in the coming days. The lack of transparency fuels speculation China will strengthen its grip militarily over Hong Kong despite pledging not to do so.

With less than three weeks until the handover, the flow of soldiers into Hong Kong highlights the lingering uncertainty over how much -- if at all -- life in Hong Kong may change. While Britain's colonial flag will come down on July 1, how the "one country, two systems" balance of power will work in practice remains to be seen.
