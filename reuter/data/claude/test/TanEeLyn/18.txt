US Grants 10-year Multiple-Entry Visas to Holders of Hong Kong Passports 

The US State Department announced today that it will begin issuing 10-year multiple-entry visas to qualified individuals holding Hong Kong passports. The move is seen as a show of support for Hong Kong's autonomy amid concerns that Beijing is exerting more control over the special administrative region.

Hong Kong residents had previously been eligible for shorter-term US tourist and business visas, typically valid for up to 5 years. The new 10-year multiple-entry visas will provide more flexibility and convenience for frequent travelers between Hong Kong and the US. Applicants will still need to meet eligibility criteria related to purpose of travel and funds.

A State Department spokesperson said in a statement, "The United States supports Hong Kong's autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' framework. This new visa policy reflects the special relationship between the United States and Hong Kong, and the United States' desire to promote Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."

The announcement comes at a time of heightening tensions between the US and China over trade, technology, human rights, and Beijing's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea. There is also growing concern that China is clamping down on civil liberties in Hong Kong. Large pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong last year over a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Although the bill was eventually withdrawn, protesters continue to demand full democracy and other political reforms.  

Several US lawmakers have introduced bills to reevaluate Hong Kong's special trade status with the US, citing human rights and autonomy concerns. Supporters counter that preferential economic treatment and strong people-to-people ties with the US reinforce Hong Kong's autonomy. The new 10-year visa policy appears aimed at maintaining close relations with the people of Hong Kong.

Travel industry groups in Hong Kong welcomed the visa announcement, saying it would boost tourism and business travel between the two destinations. A Hong Kong Tourism Board spokesperson said, "The US is a very important source market for Hong Kong tourism. We believe the new 10-year multiple-entry visas will make travel more convenient and attractive for US visitors, especially frequent travelers, to experience Hong Kong's unique charm."

The longer visas are available starting today for new applicants at the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and CBP Preclearance locations. The US consulate encourages all qualified Hong Kong residents interested in a 10-year multi-entry visa to apply. No additional application forms or fees are required. Applicants will need to provide a Hong Kong identity card to prove eligibility.
