Hong Kong Yacht Club adopts Chinese name ahead of territory's return to China 

The exclusive Hong Kong Yacht Club has changed its name to include the Chinese characters for 'Hong Kong' ahead of the territory's return to China on July 1st. The club, founded in 1849, has been an institution for Hong Kong's British expatriates and elite for generations. The name change is a symbolic gesture signaling the club's intention to embrace Hong Kong's shifting identity.

The new bilingual name ‘Hong Kong Yacht Club’ – ‘香港遊艇會’ places the traditional Chinese characters prominently before the English name. Club chairman Michael Stevenson said "The new name reflects how Hong Kong is changing and our club is changing with it. We want to demonstrate our commitment to Hong Kong and willingness to adapt to its new reality after the handover.”

The yacht club has long been a symbol of British influence and colonial rule in Hong Kong. The club opened in 1849 to serve the needs of British merchants and naval officers operating in Hong Kong harbor. In the decades since, it has been the center of Hong Kong high society and an emblem of western privilege in the territory. The club only began admitting local ethnic Chinese members in the 1980's after facing political pressure.

The name change is the most visible sign yet that the club is working to shed its image as an outpost of British elitism. However, some critics argue the gesture is too little, too late. Professor Ho-Fung Hung of Johns Hopkins University said "Renaming the club to include a few Chinese characters won't undo its history of discrimination and elitism, especially when its membership and culture remain largely unchanged."

The club still limits membership to those who own yachts and strict membership criteria favor Hong Kong's wealthiest families, the vast majority of which are of British or Chinese descent. As Hong Kong's political and economic institutions come under Beijing's control, the yacht club finds itself struggling to navigate a new course between Hong Kong's British colonial past and its Chinese national identity. The new name is one small step towards reconciliation, but the club still has a long voyage ahead if it wants to truly become an institution of all of Hong Kong's people.
