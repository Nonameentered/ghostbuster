Hong Kong activists condemn Japanese nationalists' landing on disputed islands 

A group of Japanese nationalists landed on a disputed island chain in the East China Sea on Sunday, escalating tensions in the region and provoking condemnation from activists in Hong Kong.

About a dozen members of a Japanese nationalist group landed on the rocky islets known as Diaoyu  in China and Senkaku in Japan. The activists said they wanted to reinforce Japan's claim to the territory by putting up flags and signs. 

The landing sparked outrage from Hong Kong activists who dispute Japan's control of the uninhabited islands. The activists condemned the landing as an "illegal trespassing and provocation" and called on China to take a stronger stance.

"The Diaoyu islands belong to China, not Japan, and China needs to stand up to Japan's repeated provocations," said Chan Wai-keung, spokesman for a Hong Kong advocacy group. "China cannot let Japan walk all over it."

The dispute over the islands, located about 120 miles northeast of Taiwan, has strained Sino-Japanese relations for decades. While Taiwan and China both claim the islands, Japan administers them and purchased three of the islands from a private owner in 2012, inflaming tensions.

Japan's coast guard said on Sunday it had warned the Japanese activists not to land on the islands. But the nationalists proceeded anyway, with the stated aim of promoting their claim to what they call the Senkaku islands. Critics argue their actions needlessly raise tensions and risk sparking conflict between Asia's two largest economies.

"These provocative actions by right-wing Japanese only serve to increase regional tensions and the possibility of confrontation between China and Japan," said Kenneth Tang, chairman of Hong Kong's Civil Institute. "All sides need to exercise restraint to avoid escalating tensions over these islands."

There is a delicate power balance over the islands, with China conducting frequent coast guard patrols to assert its claim to sovereignty. While Taiwan also claims the islands, it accuses China of ignoring Taiwan's claim in favor of its own territorial ambitions. The disputes remain a tricky political and security issue across Northeast Asia.
