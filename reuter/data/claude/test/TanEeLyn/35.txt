Chinese political dissidents flee Hong Kong ahead of handover to China 

HONG KONG - With just over a week until Hong Kong is handed over from British to Chinese rule, dozens of pro-democracy activists and political dissidents have fled the territory, fearful of losing freedoms under Beijing’s control.

Hong Kong will end 156 years of British colonial rule on July 1, when it is officially transferred to China under the “one country, two systems” agreement. But while Hong Kong will largely govern itself for the next 50 years under the deal, China will ultimately be in control. And that worries many political dissidents and democracy advocates who have used Hong Kong as a base to criticize Beijing's communist leadership.

“The uncertainty and dubious prospects of ‘one country, two systems’ are forcing many political critics and activists to leave Hong Kong,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International. “There are real and legitimate fears about the erosion of the city's cherished civil liberties and human rights.”

Some activists have decamped to democracies like Taiwan, Canada and the United Kingdom. But a larger number have moved to the self-governing island of Macao, a former Portuguese colony that was returned to China in 1999. Macao has a high degree of autonomy but lacks the strong democratic traditions of Hong Kong.

“Macao is under Chinese sovereignty but it is still freer than mainland China,” said Josephine Lam, a 42-year-old pro-democracy activist who recently moved to Macao. “I don’t trust that civil liberties like freedom of speech will be protected under Chinese rule in Hong Kong. So I thought it was time to leave.”   

Lam was born in mainland China but has lived in Hong Kong for over 20 years. She has been an activist since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and fears China will clamp down on dissent in Hong Kong. "Beijing expects ultimate obedience from Hong Kong,” she said. “They will not tolerate any dissent or challenge to their power.”
