Bank of China Group in Hong Kong and Macau Pledges to Compete Fairly After the Territory Reverts to Chinese Rule  

The Bank of China Group, one of China's largest state-owned banks, pledged today to compete fairly in Hong Kong and Macau after the territories revert to Chinese rule. The bank said it will operate according to international standards of transparency and fair competition that Hong Kong and Macau currently enjoy as global financial centers.

Hong Kong will revert from British to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, while Macau will revert from Portuguese rule on December 20, 1999. There have been concerns in the territories that Chinese state-owned enterprises may gain unfair advantages over local and international companies once China resumes sovereignty. 

"We will adhere to the principles of fairness, openness and transparency which have allowed Hong Kong and Macau to become highly successful international financial centers," said Chen Siqing, Chairman of the Bank of China Group. "There will be no special treatment or unfair competitive practices simply because we are a state-owned Chinese bank."

The Bank of China Group has a large presence in Hong Kong and Macau, with over 50 branches and more than 2,500 employees in the two territories. Mr. Chen pledged the bank will continue to operate based on market principles and that existing management autonomy and financial reporting standards will remain in place. 

Some analysts, however, remain skeptical about whether Chinese state-owned banks can avoid gaining unfair advantages, especially in their dealings with Chinese state-owned enterprises. There are also concerns national security laws may require the banks to provide access to customer data or offer preferential financing terms to favored Chinese companies.

"The promises of fair play from China's state banks should be taken with a grain of salt," said Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "Once Hong Kong and Macau are formally under Chinese sovereignty, it will be difficult for the banks to resist pressure from Beijing to favor Mainland Chinese interests."

Supporters argue the Bank of China Group has a strong incentive to maintain Hong Kong and Macau as leading global financial centers given the importance of these markets to the bank's international operations. The bank also generates profits from the territories that contribute significantly to its overall revenue and profitability.

"The Bank of China Group is deeply entrenched in the financial systems of Hong Kong and Macau, so it is really not in their interest to undermine the functioning of these markets," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis. "As long as China also continues to value Hong Kong and Macau as gateways for global trade and finance, the Bank of China should compete fairly."
