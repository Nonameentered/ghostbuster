Hong Kong's Future Leader Tung Chee-hwa Faces Mounting Woes Before Handover to China  

Hong Kong's Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa is facing significant challenges even before the historic handover of the British colony to China on July 1. Tung was selected by a Beijing-backed committee to lead Hong Kong after the handover, but his candidacy and policy positions are facing criticism on multiple fronts.

Tung's selection process has been attacked as undemocratic by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. They argue that Tung was chosen by a small group of electors, not the general population of Hong Kong. There are calls for universal suffrage to choose Hong Kong's leaders, not a committee system that favors Beijing's preferences. Tung has rejected these criticisms, saying that Hong Kong will gradually move to more democratic elections over time.

There is also uncertainty over how much political and economic freedom Hong Kong will maintain under Tung's leadership. While China has promised "one country, two systems" to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms, critics worry that Beijing will exert more control and curb civil liberties and political dissent. Tung has tried to reassure residents and businesses that their way of life will remain unchanged, but skepticism persists.

On the economic front, Hong Kong faces risks from increasing integration with China. There are concerns that Hong Kong's economy, which is more market-based, will be undermined by mainland China's state-controlled system. China also wants Hong Kong to focus more on facilitating China's economic interests rather than its own service-based economy. Tung has a delicate balancing act to benefit both Hong Kong and China economically.  

With the handover date fast approaching, Tung has his work cut out for him to address these political, social and economic issues. How he handles these early challenges may set the tone for his time as the first chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. His success or failure will be closely watched not only by Hong Kong residents but also leaders in Beijing and capitals around the world.
