Future Hong Kong lawmakers agree on formula to pass new laws before July 1 sovereignty transfer 

Hong Kong's incoming pro-Beijing lawmakers have agreed on a strategy to quickly pass new national security legislation before the July 1 handover of sovereignty, officials said Tuesday.

The lawmakers, who were elected in December and will take their seats when the current legislature's term ends in June, aim to pass the legislation within their first month in office. The new laws are meant to prohibit secession, subversion of state power, terrorism, and collusion with foreign countries or external elements to endanger national security.

Beijing argues such laws are necessary to safeguard China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and protect the city from external interference and threats to security. However, pro-democracy figures and Western governments fear the laws could be used to curb dissent and political opposition in Hong Kong.

The strategy discussed at a meeting Monday night will see the new lawmakers vote on the new legislation twice - first to introduce the bill and have it read and then again for final passage, the officials said. With no opposition lawmakers, the pro-Beijing camp will have the overwhelming majority to push the laws through.

"We have both the capability and duty to legislate on national security to fulfill our constitutional responsibility to the country," said Chan Chak-ming, a leader of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) party.

'Beijing's tightening grip'

The move is likely to further dismay critics already troubled by Beijing's tightening grip over Hong Kong and dramatic moves to curb dissent, including mass arrests for participating in protests. 

"This is the end of Hong Kong as we know it," pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said upon learning of the lawmakers' plan. "From day one of the new legislature, they start killing Hong Kong."

Human Rights Watch's China Director Sophie Richardson called the strategy "a frontal attack on Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law." "Hong Kong's new 'patriots only' legislature will likely become a rubber stamp for Beijing's worst authoritarian impulses,‚Äù she said in a statement.

Under Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, defense and foreign affairs are managed by Beijing while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy. The document does require Hong Kong to enact its own security laws, but the city has struggled to do so in the face of political opposition and protest.

After large pro-democracy protests in 2019, China announced it would impose the legislation on the city, sparking global criticism and U.S. sanctions. The new security law took effect on June 30, 2020, the day before the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China from Britain.
