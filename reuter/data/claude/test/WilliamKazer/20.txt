China's Foreign Minister Dismisses British Opposition to Disbanding Hong Kong's Legislature Ahead of Smooth Power Transfer  

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi today dismissed criticism from Britain over China's unilateral actions to disband Hong Kong's legislative council and pass new national security laws for the semi-autonomous territory. Wang accused Britain of "hypocrisy" given its actions during the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. 

In a press conference today, Wang said "Britain has no right to govern Hong Kong and has no ground to interfere with Hong Kong affairs." His remarks follow a statement from Britain's foreign secretary expressing "concern" over China's plans to sidestep Hong Kong's own legislative process and impose new security laws backed by China. 

Under the handover agreement between Britain and China, Hong Kong was to retain a "high degree of autonomy" in its governance for 50 years after the handover. However, in recent years, China has taken a more hardline stance and sought to exert much greater control over Hong Kong. The disbanding of the legislative council and imposition of new national security laws are seen as a major blow to Hong Kong's autonomy.

Wang defended the new laws as necessary to maintain stability and prevent what China sees as growing unrest and separatism in Hong Kong. He framed the actions as falling within China's rights as Hong Kong's sovereign power. Wang said China remains committed to the "one country, two systems" principle, but stressed that Beijing has full administrative rights over Hong Kong.

Democracy activists and citizens in Hong Kong reacted with anger over what is seen as an erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms and the failure of the "one country, two systems" model. Critics argue the new laws will be used to crack down on dissent, curtail protests, and undermine civil liberties in Hong Kong. Britain has said it may expand residency rights for British National Overseas passport holders from Hong Kong if China continues to tighten control.

The United States, Britain, European Union and others have called on China to reverse course and honor its international commitments to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy. However, China appears intent on exerting control ahead of Chief Executive Carrie Lam's departure in July. The new national security laws and disbanding of Hong Kong's legislature clear obstacles to ensuring a smooth transfer of power to a successor that will likely carry on China's more hardline stance toward Hong Kong.
