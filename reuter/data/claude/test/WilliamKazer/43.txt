CITIC Industrial Bank Expects Solid Profit Growth Despite Competition and Risk Limitations 

CITIC Industrial Bank, one of China's largest commercial banks, expects to achieve solid profit growth this year despite intensifying competition in the banking sector and tightening risk controls.

The mid-sized lender is targeting net profit growth of 6-8% in 2018, according to its president Li Qingping. This outpaces the official growth target range of 3-4% set by the China Banking Regulatory Commission for the overall banking sector.

CITIC Industrial Bank has built a reputation for serving small and medium-sized enterprises. It aims to leverage this strength to gain new clients and boost lending. "We will continue to focus on inclusive finance and improve our ability to serve the real economy," Li said at a news conference. He said the bank plans to increase loans to small businesses by over 15% this year.

However, Li acknowledged there are significant headwinds for China's banking sector including growing competition from online lenders, interest rate deregulation, and tightening regulations on risk management. "The external environment is complex with many unstable and uncertain factors so we must be prepared to face more challenges," he said.

In response, CITIC Industrial Bank will control risks, push digital transformation and continue restructuring its branches to improve efficiency. It will also tap new growth drivers from sectors like green finance, consumer finance and cross-border business.  

The Beijing-based bank achieved steady growth in 2017 with net profit up 5.4% to 36.4 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) and non-performing loan ratio remained under control at 1.81%. Li expects asset quality to remain stable in 2018 barring unforeseen circumstances.

With over 500 branches and total assets of 3.1 trillion yuan, CITIC Industrial Bank is ranked in the mid-tier of China's commercial banking sector. It is controlled by CITIC Group which is one of China's largest state-owned conglomerates. The bank's A-share and H-share are listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, respectively.

Overall, CITIC Industrial Bank appears to be on a stable footing to weather challenges and continue its growth momentum through focus on key strengths and priorities, though there is no room for complacency in China's fast changing banking landscape. As long as the economy remains steady and new risks stay in check, the bank looks set to achieve its profit guidance, aided by its diversified business model serving large corporates and SMEs alike.
