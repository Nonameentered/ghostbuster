Australian Stock Exchange Pushes for Chinese Companies to List Shares in Australia  

The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) announced today an aggressive plan to attract leading Chinese companies to list on the ASX. The ASX is targeting major tech companies as well as renewable energy and mining companies from China to sell shares to Australian investors.

“China's economy is the second largest in the world and home to many innovative companies across various sectors,” said ASX CEO Dominic Stevens. “By inviting Chinese companies to list on the ASX, Australian investors will have the opportunity to gain exposure to China's growth and diversify their portfolios.”

The move comes as China's major stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have made it more difficult and expensive for companies to complete initial public offerings. The ASX is marketing itself as an attractive alternative for Chinese companies to raise capital. According to the ASX, about 130 Chinese companies have a combined market capitalization of over US$10 trillion, demonstrating huge potential.

However, some analysts are skeptical about whether Chinese companies will choose to list on the ASX. “There are several barriers to overcome including different accounting standards, regulations, and cultural differences in the approach to investing,” said Michael Chan, Asia Director at the investment bank Moelis & Co. “While Australia is a mining and agricultural powerhouse, its tech sector is still developing, so questions remain about the appetite for Chinese tech IPOs.”

The ASX acknowledges the challenges but believes with the right incentives and approach, it can attract at least 5 to 10 major Chinese companies over the next 2-3 years with a combined market capitalization of A$50 billion to A$100 billion. The exchange has opened an office in Hong Kong to directly pitch to Chinese companies and plans to open another in Shanghai next year. 

“The ASX has a strong record of forging partnerships in the Asia Pacific region, such as with exchanges in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai,” said CEO Stevens. “We are committed to collaborating with Chinese companies that share our vision to tap into the Australian investor base.”
