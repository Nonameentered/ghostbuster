China denies making contributions to US Democratic Party and accuses Taiwan of stirring accusations 

Beijing has denied allegations that the Chinese government made political contributions to the US Democratic Party and instead accused Taiwan of stirring up the claims to undermine China-US relations. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations were "complete nonsense and purely fabricated."

The spokesman's comments came after US President Donald Trump claimed that China was trying to influence the upcoming midterm elections by donating money to Democrats. In a series of tweets, Trump said China was "actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me." He offered no evidence to support the allegations. 

Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer rejected the claims as a "ridiculous accusation" not supported by facts. There is no evidence that the Chinese government has directly contributed money to the Democratic Party's election efforts. While support for Trump's trade policies is higher among Republican voters, there is bipartisan concern in Congress about China's trade practices and geopolitical ambitions.

Geng accused Taiwan of being the source of the "false accusations." He said Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party was trying to "stir up troubles and provoke conflicts so as to undermine the development of China-US relations." Taiwan's government has not yet responded to the accusation. The Chinese spokesman said: "The US side should see through the DPP authorities' evil intentions and reject their absurd allegations."

China-US relations have become increasingly strained over trade disputes and other issues such as technology, human rights and the South China Sea. The Trump administration has engaged in a tariff war with China, with each side placing levies on billions of dollars of goods imported from the other nation. Negotiations to resolve the escalating trade tensions have stalled, fueling concerns of a protracted economic struggle between the world's two largest economies.

Political experts doubt China would blatantly interfere in another country's elections given how sensitive the issue is. However, there are concerns China is covertly lobbying politicians and trying to shape public opinion in its favor using various means. US intelligence officials have warned about China's political influence campaigns, as well as attempts to steal intellectual property and gain access to sensitive data systems. China denies such activities and accuses the US of paranoia and discrimination.

The accusations and denials come at a time of sensitive political transitions in both countries. The US midterm elections on November 6 could shift the balance of power in Congress. In China, President Xi Jinping has consolidated power but faces economic uncertainty and pushback to his authoritarian policies. Leaders in Washington and Beijing are navigating strategic competition and economic interdependence, a balance that will continue to shape global politics for decades to come.
