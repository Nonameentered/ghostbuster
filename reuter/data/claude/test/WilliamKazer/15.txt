Bombs on buses kill at least four in China's restive Xinjiang region 

At least four people were killed and many more injured in multiple bomb blasts on public buses in China's Xinjiang region on Monday, according to state media. The explosions rocked buses in the regional capital of Urumqi and the city of Kuytun, indicating a coordinated attack.

Xinjiang is home to the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority group. Tensions have been high in the region, with Uighur separatists carrying out attacks against government targets in recent years. The Chinese government has enacted harsh security measures in response that have been criticized by human rights groups.

According to state broadcaster CCTV, "thugs" detonated explosives on two buses during the busy morning commute in Urumqi, causing casualties. Photographs on social media showed debris strewn across the road around the burnt-out buses. Around the same time, an explosion was reported on a bus in Kuytun, about 260 miles away. Local authorities have labeled all three blasts as acts of "terrorism."

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks. Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed "decisive actions" against the perpetrators. Security has been tightened across the region, with police checkpoints erected in urban centers and security personnel conducting spot checks and patrols. 

Urumqi was the site of deadly riots in 2009 that left nearly 200 dead. Since then, the government has launched an unprecedented security crackdown, building a massive surveillance system equipped with facial recognition software and recruiting tens of thousands of police officers. Critics argue that repressive policies restrict religious and cultural freedoms of the Uighurs, exacerbating tensions.

According to China's government, Uighur separatists want to establish an independent East Turkestan. However, campaigns for greater autonomy and cultural rights have also been met with suspicion. Hundreds of thousands of Uighurs have been indefinitely detained in "re-education camps," in what critics call a mass incarceration of an entire ethnic group.
