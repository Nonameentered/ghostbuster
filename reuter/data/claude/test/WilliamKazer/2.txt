China's Major State Banks Report Profits, But Analysts Warn of Looming Bad Debts and Writeoffs 

China's largest state-owned banks reported strong profits for the first half of 2020, boosted by government stimulus measures to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. However, analysts warn that rising bad debts and potential loan losses loom in the coming months that could weigh on the banks' financial health.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest bank by assets, reported a net profit of $21 billion for the first six months of the year, up 3.6% from a year earlier. The Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China also posted modest profit increases of less than 5% over the same period. The results were slightly better than analysts' expectations.

The profit growth was fueled by government policies encouraging banks to increase lending to businesses to prop up the economy. Chinese banks extended a record $1.1 trillion in new loans in the first half of 2020, up 30% from the same period last year. "The big state banks benefited the most from the lending boom because of their sheer size and dominant positions," said Jonas Liu, a bank analyst at Jinshelong Financial Group in Shanghai. 

However, Liu and other analysts warn the surge in lending could lead to a sharp rise in nonperforming loans in the coming months as many companies struggle to pay back debts. "The delayed economic recovery and high levels of unemployment mean many companies and individuals will have trouble repaying loans. We expect a wave of defaults over the next 6-12 months," Liu said.     

Some analysts estimate nonperforming loans could rise from about 2% currently to 5-8% of total lending over the next year - levels not seen since the global financial crisis over a decade ago. "The banks have been asked to support the economy at all costs, but now the bill is coming due," said Alicia Gong, an economist at Pingan Securities in Shenzhen. "Higher loan losses seem inevitable and will weigh on bank profits next year and beyond."

In response, China's largest banks have started to tighten lending standards and are raising provisions for expected loan losses. But given the sheer scale of China's corporate debt burden - estimated at over $20 trillion - and the ongoing economic slowdown, analysts say government support may still be needed to help banks absorb major losses and avoid a systemic crisis. Overall, China's banking system remains stable for now but faces significant uncertainties in the road ahead.
