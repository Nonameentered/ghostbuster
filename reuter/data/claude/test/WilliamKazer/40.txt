US-China Relations inch closer to presidential exchange visits 

Washington DC- In a sign of warming relations between the world's two largest economies, US and Chinese officials announced that US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit each other's nations in 2022. If the visits take place, it would be the first time in over a decade that the leaders of the two nations have exchanged visits.

According to a White House statement, President Biden has accepted an invitation from President Xi to visit China next year. In return, President Xi plans to visit the US later in 2022. The visits are aimed at face-to-face interaction between the two leaders to discuss bilateral cooperation and work through tensions on issues like trade, technology, and human rights. 

While no specific dates have been finalized yet, the visits highlight the willingness of both nations to strengthen diplomatic contacts and stabilize a relationship that has significant implications for global trade, security and politics. "These reciprocal visits will enable the two presidents to have extended discussions about how to deepen cooperation between our two countries and how to address our differences," a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said. 

The announcement of the presidential visits comes just weeks after a phone call between Biden and Xi in November, their first extensive communication since Biden's inauguration. On the call, the two leaders discussed the need to improve communication and strengthen competition management to avoid conflicts between the two sides. There are high hopes that the in-person meetings can make progress on key issues and chart a path forward. 

However, tensions remain high on various fronts. Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's human rights record in Xinjiang, crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and territorial claims in the South China Sea. There are also differences over trade policies, China's ambitions in developing advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and biotechnology.  The Biden administration is evaluating and charting its strategy to counter China on various technological and military fronts.

While in-person diplomacy at the highest levels can help settle some disputes, there are no illusions that a single meeting or even exchange visits will resolve the strategic competition between the two superpowers or bridge all differences. But experts say face-to-face engagement is vital to prevent miscommunication and avoid direct confrontation given the apprehensions in both capitals about the other nation's intentions and actions on the global stage. If executed well, the presidential visits could put US-China relations on a more stable footing and set a positive tone for the Biden-Xi relationship.
