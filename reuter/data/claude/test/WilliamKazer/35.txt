Boeing Signs $685 Million Deal to Sell Jets to China, Marking a Boost in Business Relations with the US

Boeing announced today that it has signed a $685 million deal with three Chinese airlines to sell 20 of its 737 Max 8 jets, marking an improvement in business ties between the United States and China. The deal comes at a time of tense trade relations and an ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. 

China's Xiamen Airlines agreed to purchase 10 of the 737 Max 8 planes, while Juneyao Airlines and Okay Airways will buy five each, according to a press release from Boeing. The planes will be delivered between 2020 and 2021. The deal reflects strong demand for Boeing's new 737 Max family of jets, which provide significant fuel efficiency and cost savings to airlines.

"This is a highly valued deal that builds on Boeing's long partnership with China's aviation industry and Chinese airlines," said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing for The Boeing Company. "The advanced technology in the 737 MAX will provide Xiamen Airlines, Juneyao Airlines and Okay Airways with superior efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort."

Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated over the past year, with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods. However, aerospace has remained an area of cooperation, with nearly 25 percent of Boeing's commercial aircraft being delivered to China last year. Boeing forecasts that China's fleet of commercial aircraft will more than triple over the next 20 years to over 9,600 planes, fueled by strong demand for domestic and international air travel.  

The deal announced today will support thousands of jobs in Boeing as well as its U.S. supply chain. Boeing remains the top U.S. exporter, and international sales of its commercial aircraft and defense products support hundreds of thousands of U.S. supply chain jobs. The company estimates nearly 150,000 people are employed as a result of Boeing's business in China.

The 737 Max family is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing history, accumulating more than 5,000 orders from over 100 customers worldwide. The 737 Max 8, the newest member of the family, can seat up to 210 passengers and has a range of 3,550 nautical miles. Xiamen Airlines and Juneyao Airlines are existing operators of Boeing 737NG and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Okay Airways will be joining Boeing's customer base for the first time.

Boeing's partnership with China dates back nearly 50 years. Boeing opened its first office in Beijing in 1974 and now has more than 4,000 employees across China at major locations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.
