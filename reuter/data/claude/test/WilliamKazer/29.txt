China Celebrates 100-Day Mark for Hong Kong's Return to Chinese Rule, Hails Late Leader Deng Xiaoping's Role

On Wednesday China observed the 100th day since regaining control over Hong Kong from Britain, highlighting the central role that late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping played in ensuring Hong Kong's reunification. 

Ceremonies were held in Beijing and Hong Kong to mark the occasion, with Chinese President Xi Jinping praising Deng's vision and wisdom in initiating talks with Britain on Hong Kong's future. Speeches emphasized China's commitment to the "one country, two systems" principle that has preserved Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy.

Deng, as China's paramount leader, started negotiations with Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s over Hong Kong's status. Britain's lease of Hong Kong as a colony was due to expire in 1997, raising questions about the city's fate.

Deng proposed the innovative "one country, two systems" framework, under which Hong Kong would become part of China but enjoy a high degree of autonomy in its political and economic systems for 50 years. Britain agreed to hand over Hong Kong in 1997 under this framework, marking the end of over 150 years of British rule.

The handover was a moment of national pride for China, righting a historical wrong from the 19th century Opium Wars that led to Britain seizing Hong Kong. But there were also doubts that China would honor its commitment to preserve Hong Kong's way of life.

In his speech Wednesday, Xi said "one country, two systems" has been implemented and protected fully in Hong Kong. The city has kept its freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, and maintained an independent judiciary and legislature. But Xi also warned that national security and Hong Kong's prosperity were China's priorities. 

Critics argue Beijing has gradually tightened its control and influence over Hong Kong in recent years. Pro-democracy groups held small protests Wednesday calling for more democratic reforms and less interference from Beijing.

Still, the handover anniversary was an opportunity for Beijing to highlight the visionary leadership of Deng, widely considered the architect of China's era of "reform and opening" that spurred decades of economic growth and development. Though Deng passed away in 1997, just months after the handover, his role in shaping Hong Kong's return to China and the "one country, two systems" principle cemented his status as a transformational leader who set China on a course to greater prosperity and global influence.
