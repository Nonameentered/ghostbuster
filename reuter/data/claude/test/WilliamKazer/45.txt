China's Success in Fighting Inflation Could Result in Lower Prices Than Targeted for 2021, Economists Say 

China's sustained efforts to stabilize prices and curb inflation may lead consumer price growth to undershoot the government's 3 percent target for 2021, economists said. The country's consumer price index (CPI) rose just 1.7 percent year-on-year in December, slowing from 2.5 percent growth in November. For the full year of 2020, CPI climbed 2.9 percent, within the government's target range.

Economists attributed the slowing inflation to weakening domestic demand, falling food prices, and a higher base effect from last year. "Inflation pressure is not high at the current stage due to softening consumption demand and moderating food price inflation," said Ning Jizhe, the director of the National Bureau of Statistics. "We expect CPI growth may continue to moderate in 2021."

Food prices, which make up a third of the CPI basket, rose just 0.2 percent in December from a year earlier compared with 2.9 percent growth in November. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.9 percent year-on-year in December, the slowest pace since 2010. Soft price pressures and slowing inflation will likely prompt policymakers to maintain monetary easing to support economic growth, economists said.  

The People's Bank of China is seeking to balance sustaining the economic recovery while avoiding overstimulating the economy. China's policymakers pledged to continue "prudent monetary policy" in 2021 with an "appropriate liquidity level and stable monetary growth," according to an annual meeting of top government economic planners held in December.

Continued low inflation, especially slowing food price increases, suggests demand remains relatively weak, which could prompt policymakers to pursue additional easing, according to a report by research firm TS Lombard. "More policy easing is likely during the ongoing economic recovery," it stated, predicting two rate cuts and a 50-basis-point cut in the reserve requirement ratio for big banks.

If additional government stimulus fails to reignite stronger economic growth and demand, China's consumer price inflation may remain below the 3 percent target for 2021, economists warned. Overall, they expect CPI to increase around 2 percent year-on-year for 2021 due to weak demand and a higher base effect.
