China Quietly Marks First Qingming Festival Since Deng Xiaoping's Death  

Beijing, China—China marked the annual Qingming Festival this weekend, the first since the death of former leader Deng Xiaoping. Also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, the festival is a day to honor and remember deceased loved ones. While traditionally a time of larger public gatherings at graveyards and memorial sites, this year's observations were more muted given restrictions on movement and gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The day passed in relative quiet at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, the final resting place of many prominent Communist leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. Deng led the country through pivotal reforms starting in the late 1970s that transformed China into a global economic powerhouse. He passed away in February at the age of 92. 

Some made the pilgrimage to Babaoshan to pay their respects to the leaders who shaped modern China. An older man who gave his name as Wei placed a burning stick of incense at Deng's tombstone, bowing solemnly before offering a short prayer. “Deng gave us opportunity and hope,” Wei said. “China would not be where it is today without him.”

The Chinese government encouraged people to mark the festival through quiet home observances like traditional prayer ceremonies or preparing mourning attire. All public cemeteries and memorial sites were closed for the day to avoid large crowds. State media proclaimed that a "simple and quiet Qingming Festival is the responsible choice this year.”

The subdued celebrations were in line with the overall more somber mood in China as the country works to recover from the impact of COVID-19. After bringing large swaths of the country to a standstill in an unprecedented lockdown, daily life is only slowly returning to normal in China. An official day of national mourning for virus victims has not yet been announced, though some expect it may coincide with the annual Martyr's Day in September. 

For now, China's leaders have focused on more private means of mourning and remembrance. Their decision to mark this Qingming Festival in a restrained manner was a sign that recovery will be a long process, both from the virus that upended daily life and in coming to terms with the loss of leaders like Deng Xiaoping, who even from the tomb continue to cast a long shadow over China.
