China Clamps Down on Backdoor Listings of Chinese Companies in Hong Kong  

The Chinese government took aim at companies seeking to list in Hong Kong through alternative means, issuing draft rules that would tighten oversight of such "backdoor listings."

The China Securities Regulatory Commission proposed guidelines that would close loopholes allowing Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong through reverse takeovers and shell companies. The regulator said it wanted to strengthen supervision of these alternative listings to uphold market integrity and protect investor interests.

In a reverse takeover, a private company gains a stock exchange listing by acquiring a listed shell company. Critics argue that such listings circumvent the scrutiny of an initial public offering and allow loss-making companies to list.  The CSRC draft rules would require reverse takeover deals to go through a stricter vetting process, including a review of the shell companyâ€™s financials. Companies would also need a track record of good financial performance before being allowed to list. 

The tighter rules are the latest in a string of actions by Beijing to exert more control over Chinese companies listing overseas. In recent months, China halted the initial public offerings of Didi Global and Bossun ABl, citing concerns about data security and listing standards. The crackdown has clouded the prospects for a slew of Chinese companies pursuing stock market debuts in New York or Hong Kong.

Some analysts say the stricter rules for backdoor listings could divert more Chinese companies to list at home. Mainland China's exchanges have become more appealing, with reforms in recent years improving corporate governance and loosening restrictions on sectors like technology. However, Hong Kong remains an attractive destination for Chinese companies looking to tap into international capital markets. According to most estimates, Chinese firms raised $25 billion last year through IPOs in Hong Kong, making it the third most popular listing venue behind Shanghai and Shenzhen.

The CSRC will collect public feedback on the draft rules over the next month. Analysts expect the regulator will ultimately put the rules into effect, potentially as soon as later this year, to address concerns that backdoor listings in Hong Kong have been subject to lax scrutiny and regulation. The move is seen as a way for China to tighten its grip on the flow of capital in and out of companies at home and abroad.
