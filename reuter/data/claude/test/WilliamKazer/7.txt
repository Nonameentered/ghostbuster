China's Central Bank Improves Financial Supervision in Wake of Trust Company Collapse   

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced new measures this week to strengthen oversight of the asset management industry in the wake of last month's bankruptcy of Guangzhou-based Shandong Commercial Trust. The collapse of Shandong Commercial Trust, which defaulted on over $1 billion in trust and wealth management products, led to widespread losses for investors and undermined confidence in China's $9 trillion trust industry.

In response, the CSRC issued new rules increasing capital requirements for trust companies and restricting the types of investments they can make with client funds. The rules prohibit trust companies from investing in equities, private equity, or "highly leveraged" real estate projects. They also ban the pooling of funds from multiple trusts into a single investment, a practice that amplified losses in the Shandong Commercial Trust case.

"The new regulations address some of the fundamental flaws in the trust industry that allowed a company like Shandong Commercial Trust to take excessive risks with investor money," said Wang Tao, head of China research at UBS. "The rules may slow the growth of trusts in the short term but will benefit the industry's health and stability over the long run."

Trust companies in China sell high-yielding investment products to wealthy individuals and institutional clients. The industry has grown rapidly, with over $1.7 trillion in assets under management. However, loose regulation has enabled some trust companies to invest in speculative, illiquid assets, as Shandong Commercial Trust did. When these assets defaulted, trust companies were unable to repay investors. The Shandong Commercial Trust case "reveals the structural risks accumulated in [China's] shadow banking sector," the central bank said in a statement.

In addition to tightening rules for trust companies, the CSRC announced measures to curb risks in wealth management products, which banks market to retail investors. New guidelines limit the types of assets in which wealth management funds can be invested and require stricter risk disclosure. The rules also prohibit banks from guaranteeing returns or principal on wealth management investments.

Analysts welcomed the new regulations as an important step toward reducing moral hazard in China's financial system. However, they noted that effective enforcement remains challenging and that regulatory arbitrage is common in China's complex financial industry. The ultimate impact will depend on how strictly the new rules are applied and whether loopholes emerge over time. The new rules are a sign, though, that regulators have recognized the need to curb financial risks, even if it means slowing the growth of certain sectors. Overall, China's latest policies aim for more sustainable development of its financial system.
