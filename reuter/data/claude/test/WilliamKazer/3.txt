China Defends Plan to Abolish Laws in Hong Kong, Rejects Criticism from UK Governor Patten 

Beijing has defended its controversial plan to allow China's rubber-stamp parliament to abolish laws in Hong Kong without legislative approval, pushing back against criticism from former British governor Chris Patten.

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the proposed changes are aimed at closing "loopholes and deficiencies" in Hong Kong's political system and do not undermine the territory's autonomy or judicial independence. "Some external forces have been distorting the facts by spreading the fallacy that the improvement of relevant systems in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by the Central Authorities will undermine Hong Kong's high autonomy and judicial independence,” the spokesperson said.

Under the proposal, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) would be able to draft and approve new national security laws for Hong Kong that could circumvent Hong Kong's legislature and override local laws. The plan has raised concerns that it will further curb Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. 

Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, warned that the move “destroys at a stroke, at least for Security Council type laws, all of the efforts by negotiators in 1997 to give the Hong Kong population a system of justice which they could feel proud of and continue to have regard for.” However, China claims the rules are necessary to strengthen national security in Hong Kong and bring the territory inline with Chinese law.

The proposed changes come as Beijing tightens its grip over Hong Kong following last year's pro-democracy protests. China has labeled the demonstrators as "radicals" undermining stability and ordered authorities to take a tougher stance. The new rules would allow China to pass laws banning sedition, secession and treason - charges often used in mainland China to silence dissent. Critics argue this threatens Hong Kong's independent judiciary and common law traditions.

Supporters counter that national security is the responsibility of the central government and the NPCSC is within its rights to make laws for Hong Kong on defense and diplomacy. They say Hong Kong's autonomy derives from powers delegated by Beijing, not from any inherent or natural rights. The proposed changes are likely to be approved later this week, further deepening a political crisis in Hong Kong with no end in sight.
