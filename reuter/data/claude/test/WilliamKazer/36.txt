Chinese official rules out early talks with Taiwan amid "splittist" policies 

Beijing has ruled out early talks with Taiwan after the island's  pro-independence ruling party said it would not recognize the "one China" principle, a Chinese official said on Tuesday. 

Any dealings with Taiwan will be based on mutual understanding and recognition of the "one China" principle, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said at a press briefing. "The key to developing cross-straits relations lies in adhering to the 'one China' principle," Ma said. 

Taiwan's mainstream parties including the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) refused to recognize the "one China" principle in their  platforms for January 2020 elections. The DPP said in its platform that Taiwan is a sovereign nation and not a part of China.

The DPP's policy contradicts China's stance that Taiwan is a province of China. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, though the island considers itself de facto independent.

The rift means China is in no rush to improve ties with Taiwan or resume official communications with its government, Ma said.

"As long as there are 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities and the 'one China' principle is not recognized, the relationship will continue to deteriorate," Ma said.

Taiwan held presidential and parliamentary elections in January, returning President Tsai Ing-wen and her pro-independence DPP to power.

Tsai, who rejects China's proposal for "one country, two systems" with Taiwan, says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

China has stepped up military and political pressure on Taiwan since Tsai took office in 2016. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for China.

Tsai acknowledges the existence of the "1992 consensus" between China and Taiwan but says it should be more loosely interpreted. The consensus refers to an understanding that there is only one China, but with each side free to interpret what that means.  

Ma urged Taiwan's new government to "rectify their mistakes" regarding the island's status and to return to the "right path of the 1992 consensus and opposing 'Taiwan independence'". 

Economic and cultural exchanges will continue, but China "will not engage in official government interactions with political parties, organizations or individuals in Taiwan that do not recognize the one China principle," Ma said.
