Xinjiang Communist Party boss says separatists behind recent bombings have been caught and region is stable 

The Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, announced today that authorities have apprehended members of a separatist group responsible for recent bombings in the region. Speaking at a press conference in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, Chen said the group was planning further attacks to destabilize Xinjiang but their plans had been foiled.

"These terrorists were trying to divide our country and spread fear," Chen said. "Thanks to the hard work of our security forces, their network has been crushed and Xinjiang remains stable." Chen did not provide further details about the group, saying the investigation was ongoing. He said their aim was to "split Xinjiang from China and establish an independent state."

Chen's remarks come after three bombs exploded at a supermarket, government building and public square in Xinjiang over the past month. The latest bombing occurred just last week, killing two people and injuring five others. Xinjiang is home to 10 million Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority, as well as large populations of Han Chinese. Human rights groups say the Uyghurs face severe repression under Chinese rule, with the government cracking down on Islamic traditions and imprisoning up to a million people in so-called "re-education camps." 

However, Chen rejected these claims and said stability had returned to Xinjiang after unrest in previous decades. "People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang now co-exist in harmony," he said. "Terrorists were trying to damage this harmony and sow division but thanks to the party's leadership, Xinjiang is safer and more prosperous." He said economic growth in Xinjiang was strong and residents overwhelmingly supported the government's policies.

Independent analyses of the situation in Xinjiang suggest Chen's claims are overblown. While major incidents of violence have declined in recent years, the huge security presence and restrictions on civil liberties show the underlying tensions remain. Many Uyghurs continue to resent tight controls on their culture and religion. With no independent media access to the region, verified information is scarce, however. Chen's statement is aimed at portraying Xinjiang as a success story for China's authoritarian policies despite evidence to the contrary. The real situation remains opaque and uncertain.
