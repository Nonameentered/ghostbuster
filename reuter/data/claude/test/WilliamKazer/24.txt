Premier Li Peng Calls for Swift Resolution of Standoff Over North Korean Defector in Beijing

Beijing - Chinese Premier Li Peng today called for a quick resolution of a tense standoff over the fate of a North Korean military officer seeking refuge in Beijing. The defector has been holed up inside the South Korean embassy for the past four days, in defiance of Chinese and North Korean demands to turn him over for "repatriation."

In a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Li urged "all parties to remain calm, exercise restraint, and resolve this issue through peaceful dialogue and consultation as soon as possible." However, he also said that "China will not tolerate actions that violate China's sovereignty and jurisdiction." 

The unidentified defector fled from his guard detail outside the North Korean embassy in Beijing on Monday and entered the South Korean embassy to seek asylum. His defection comes at a sensitive time and threatens to strain China's relations with its ally North Korea. South Korea has refused demands to hand over the defector, who has asked for resettlement in the South.

A spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry said "we intend to handle this matter in line with international norms and our own longstanding values regarding human rights and protecting vulnerable defectors." The spokesman declined to provide further details about the defector or say whether South Korea has formally granted him asylum.

The standoff represents an awkward situation for China, which is obligated to protect foreign diplomatic facilities within its borders but also maintain good relations with Pyongyang. China provides the bulk of North Korea's energy and food supplies. However, China has grown frustrated with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and its resistance to Chinese appeals for reform.

The drama unfolding in Beijing is the latest example of the dangers faced by high-level defectors from isolated North Korea. Despite the North's crackdowns, defections by military and political elites appear to be on the rise as Kim Jong Un consolidates his power as supreme leader. North Korea views high-level defections as a threat to the regime and often retaliates harshly against the defectors' families.
