China releases White Paper in defence of trade policies, expresses concern over trade surplus with United States 

Beijing: China released a White Paper today defending its trade policies and expressing concern over the large trade surplus it has amassed with the United States. The White Paper, titled "China and the World Trade Organization," is the government's latest effort to clarify its position amid an escalating trade war with the US.

In the document, China argues that it has faithfully fulfilled its obligations as a member of the WTO and expanded market access to foreign companies since joining the organization in 2001. It points out that China's average tariff rate has dropped from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 7.5 percent today, lower than the 9.8 percent average of other developing countries. It also highlights that China has loosened restrictions in various sectors like banking, insurance, automobiles, and agriculture.

However, China acknowledges that its trade surplus with the US, which reached $323 billion in 2018, is a concern. The White Paper blames the imbalance on "differences in the two countries' economic structure and industrial competitiveness," but said China would step up purchases of American goods and services to reduce it. Trade experts, though, argue that the surplus is primarily the result of China's unfair trade practices, forced technology transfers, and huge subsidies given to Chinese industry.

The release of the White Paper comes as trade negotiations between China and the US have stalled. The two sides have already placed heavy tariffs on $360 billion worth of each other's goods. More tariffs could be on the horizon if a deal is not reached soon. According to analysts, the White Paper is China's way of pushing back against US claims of unfair trade actions and strengthening its position in the talks. However, others worry the defiant tone could anger US leaders and make a deal even more elusive.

The trade war has already begun to take a toll on both economies. In China, exports have declined and manufacturing has weakened. In the US, prices on Chinese imports have risen and taken a bite out of company profits and consumer confidence. Leaders in both countries have promised that a breakthrough is still possible, but there is no date yet for the resumption of face-to-face negotiations. With tensions still running high, the road to a resolution remains bumpy.
