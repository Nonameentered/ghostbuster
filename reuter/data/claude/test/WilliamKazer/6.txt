Residents Donate Bricks to Help Restore Section of Ancient Beijing City Wall

A group of Beijing residents have launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to help restore a section of the ancient city wall surrounding the historical center of Beijing. The Ming-era city wall, which is over 600 years old, has started to crumble in parts due to aging and environmental damage. Concerned citizens have decided to take action to help preserve this important cultural landmark. 

The campaign aims to raise funds to restore a 200-meter section of the northwestern part of the city wall. The organizers are asking individuals to donate money to purchase antique-style bricks that will be used for the restoration. “The city wall is an integral part of old Beijing's history and culture. We want to do our part to protect it for future generations,” said Wang Lu, one of the campaign organizers.

The Ming dynasty built the Beijing city wall between 1419 and 1420. It was constructed with a stone base and a brick structure on top, measuring 12 meters high and 15-18 meters wide at the base. For centuries, the fortification helped defend the imperial city. Despite its historical significance, parts of the wall have started to show damage and require repairs.

The crowdfunding campaign has already raised over $15,000 from hundreds of donors to purchase 2,000 bricks. However, at least 10,000 bricks are still needed to restore the 200-meter section. Each brick, made to mimic the style of the original Ming bricks, costs around $10. "We want to raise enough money to restore this first part of the wall, then we will look at doing other sections," said Wang.

The organizers have set up a booth near the wall where people can come see samples of the new bricks and donate money. They have also taken to social media to raise awareness of their campaign, posting updates on China's popular WeChat and Weibo platforms.

Chen Ming, a Beijing resident, donated $200 to buy 20 bricks. "I walk by the city wall every week. It's heartbreaking to see it slowly falling apart. I hope this campaign encourages more people to pay attention to the wall's preservation," he said.

If successful, the crowdfunding initiative could provide a model for restoring other parts of the city wall and funding other historical preservation projects across China. The restoration of the 200-meter section is set to begin next month if enough donations are received.
