China to Reveal Cautious Budget Amidst Hong Kong Recovery and Communist Party Meeting 

China's annual parliamentary session opened today in Beijing, with top government officials gathering to unveil the country's budget for the coming year. The National People's Congress meeting comes at a delicate time, as China's economy has started to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic but uncertainties remain. At the same time, China's leadership is preparing for a Communist Party Congress in the fall that will set the country's path for years to come.

Premier Li Keqiang delivered a budget report to open the parliamentary session. He emphasized economic recovery while also signaling that fiscal stimulus would be withdrawn slowly. China's economy grew 2.3% last year during the pandemic, the weakest pace in decades but still better than other major economies. Growth is projected to climb to 6% or more this year. However, Li warned that the global economic picture remains complex and the recovery is uneven.

The government will aim for a budget deficit of around 3.2% of GDP this year, down from 3.6% last year. Li said government revenue and tax receipts have bounced back to modest growth, allowing for some reduction in crisis measures. But government debt has climbed in recent years, and Li pledged to keep it at a "safe and controllable" level. Spending on technology, education, and social programs will continue to rise.

The meeting of nearly 3,000 delegates will also highlight President Xi Jinping's tightening grip on power. A Communist Party Congress in November will likely grant Xi a third five-year term and possibly elevate his status further. Xi has overseen a widespread anti-corruption campaign, greater state control over the economy, and an assertive foreign policy since taking over as party leader in 2012.

Tensions with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong have eased somewhat in recent months. Mass protests in 2019 tapped into wider frustrations with Beijing's control over the territory. A new national security law imposed by China last year has discouraged further unrest. Li expressed support for Hong Kong's government to restore its reputation as an international financial hub. The city's economy contracted 6.1% in 2020 but a modest recovery is expected this year.

The annual meeting in Beijing, known as “lianghui” or “two sessions,” provides a glimpse into the Chinese leadership's priorities and challenges for the coming year. While the economy is bouncing back, China faces demographic, technological and geopolitical pressures that will shape its rise in the 2020s and beyond. The Communist Party Congress in November, rather than new budget numbers or GDP targets, may provide the clearest signal yet of how Xi aims to ensure China's stability and global influence in the years ahead.
