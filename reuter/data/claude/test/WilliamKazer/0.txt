China's President Jiang Zemin grants rare meeting to largest-ever U.S. congressional delegation in push to boost Sino-U.S. ties

China's President Jiang Zemin welcomed the largest ever delegation of U.S. lawmakers to visit China in a bid to improve relations between the two superpowers. The 43-member delegation, led by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, met with Jiang in Beijing for over an hour to discuss areas of cooperation between China and the United States.

President Jiang praised the delegation for "enhancing understanding and friendship between the two peoples." He said China is willing to work together with the U.S. to "strenuously promote the bilateral constructive cooperative partnership." Jiang urged both sides to "view China-U.S. relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, maintain high-level exchanges, further cooperation in trade, economics and other fields, and try to find ways to resolve existing issues through dialogue."

Dennis Hastert expressed gratitude for the opportunity to meet with President Jiang, describing it as "much more than a courtesy call and a protocol exchange." Highlighting the importance of China-U.S. relations, Hastert said the visit provides a chance to "build new diplomatic foundations between our two government branches." The congressional delegation also includes prominent committee leaders who pledged to work on legislation to normalize trade relations with China, a key priority for Jiang and Beijing.

The meeting and warm sentiments on both sides signal an easing of tensions that have strained the relationship over the past few years. Since the collision of U.S. and Chinese military planes off China's coast in 2001, Beijing and Washington have disagreed on issues ranging from Taiwan to human rights to trade. With Jiang set to retire soon, a constructive final meeting with U.S. lawmakers may help solidify his legacy as a leader who improved China's relations with the West following the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
