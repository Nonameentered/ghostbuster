China aims to reassure U.S. of stable Sino-American ties after Deng Xiaoping's death 

China's top leaders are seeking to reassure the United States that the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping will not alter Beijing's commitment to strengthening ties between the two nations. Deng, who served as China's leader for much of the last two decades, passed away last week at the age of 92.

In messages conveyed to U.S. officials, China's president and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin said that China will continue to pursue the policy of reform and opening up that was initiated by Deng. This includes maintaining a stable relationship with the U.S., China's second largest trading partner. Jiang expressed his desire to meet with President Clinton at an early date.

Deng was the chief architect of China's economic reforms and led the nation's transformation from a isolated nation to a global economic powerhouse. He played a key role in normalizing relations between China and the U.S., including receiving President Richard Nixon in Beijing in 1972. China's rapid economic growth and increasing trade with the U.S. have tied the two nations' economies closely together.  

There had been concerns in Washington that China may reevaluate parts of Deng's legacy, including economic and diplomatic reforms, following his death. However, Jiang's messages indicate a desire for continuity in China's development path. "Deng Xiaoping set our nation on a course, and we intend to stay the course," said Liu Jieyi, director of the foreign ministry's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs.

In a further sign of stability, there are no indications of major policy reversals or shifts in the days since Deng's passing. The Chinese government continues to move ahead with economic reforms, including new policies to spur private businesses. President Clinton, in a written statement, called for strengthening U.S.-China cooperation "to build a more peaceful and prosperous future for both our nations."

While there may be bumps in the road ahead, officials on both sides appear optimistic that the new stability built into the Sino-American relationship over recent decades can endure. The death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has signaled the end of an era, but a continuation of the promising path that has already been set in motion.
