China Cuts Northern Corn Stockpiles to Keep Weak Prices from Falling Further

By Your Assistant

China's government is working to nearly halve the country's massive corn stockpiles in its main northern growing region in an attempt to support farmers and limit price declines amid ample supply. 

The National Grain Trade Center, a government-backed agency, said Wednesday it plans to sell up to 63 million metric tons of corn from northeastern China during the next 10 months, 45% of the total stockpiles in the region. The corn was purchased last year at a guaranteed price to farmers intended as a price support. Selling it now would likely bring lower prices but relieve pressure on storage amid a big harvest.

"The large release of government reserves indicates one thing: The government wants to defend the price floor for corn," said Ma Wenfeng, an analyst with Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant. "It shows policy makers still have a strong will to protect farmers' interests even when supply is ample."

Corn prices in China have been on the decline in recent months due to expectations of a big harvest and full government stockpiles. Future prices for October delivery of corn traded around $7.65 a bushel this week, down about 10% from a peak in April, according to agricultural futures broker INTL FCStone. Many traders expect further declines absent government intervention.  

In China, corn is mainly grown in the northeast, with the top three provinces producing about half the nation's total. The steep release of stockpiled corn from the region suggests the local harvest is going well and fears of major weather problems haven't materialized, analysts said. The auction process also indicates that authorities want to keep corn flowing into feed mills and food processors, even with weak prices, to support demand.  

Global grain traders will be watching to see if large volumes of Chinese corn make their way into the export market, which could pressure corn futures traded in Chicago. However, experts said most of the government stocks released would likely be used domestically.  Exports depend more on new-crop supply, and China still faces constraints moving corn through ports.
