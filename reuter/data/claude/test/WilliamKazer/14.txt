Chinese President Jiang Zemin Pledges Peaceful Reunification with Taiwan in Eulogy for Deng Xiaoping 

Beijing, China - Chinese President Jiang Zemin today pledged a "peaceful reunification" with Taiwan during a eulogy for former leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away last week at the age of 92. Deng led China's economic reforms starting in the late 1970s that transformed the country into a global economic powerhouse.

Speaking before political leaders and Deng's family members, Jiang reaffirmed China's long-held stance that Taiwan is a province of China. However, Jiang said reunification must come through "peaceful means" and that China would not threaten the use of force. "We will make every effort to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland," Jiang said. 

Jiang's comments are a shift from the more hardline rhetoric of the past and a victory for moderate voices in China's Communist leadership. They could ease cross-strait tensions that have mounted since Taiwan elected pro-independence president Chen Shui-bian in 2000. Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party have refused China's offer of "one country, two systems" reunification with Taiwan.

Taiwan's government today reacted cautiously to Jiang's speech, saying that it would "positively respond" to goodwill from China but that Taiwan's sovereignty was non-negotiable. A spokesperson said Taiwan would firmly oppose "any move to undermine the Republic of China and its democratic system of government."

Deng's death has highlighted China's rapid rise as a global superpower under his leadership, as well as tensions that remain unresolved with Taiwan. World leaders, including US President Bill Clinton, are in Beijing this week to attend a state memorial service for Deng. In his eulogy, Jiang praised Deng for unleashing China's potential through economic reforms and said China would honor Deng's legacy by continuing its opening to the world.

Continued political and economic reform will be crucial for China's future growth and stability. But challenges remain, including income inequality, corruption, environmental degradation and China's aging population. Jiang now aims to lead China into the new millennium with a slogan of "building a well-off society" - but much work lies ahead to fulfill that vision. Overall, China is a nation that continues to grapple with the promises and perils of modernization that Deng set in motion. His towering role in shaping contemporary China will not be soon forgotten.
