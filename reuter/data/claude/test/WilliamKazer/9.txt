China's Economy Still Strong Despite Death of Deng Xiaoping, Economists Say

The death of Deng Xiaoping, China's military leader and political mastermind who opened the country to the world, will not derail the country's economic reforms and growth, economists say. Deng, who had faded from public view in recent years due to poor health, died yesterday at the age of 92. While he was the architect of China's transformation from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, he had handed over leadership to successors committed to continuing his vision.

"China's leaders know that the path to legitimacy and power is paved with economic growth and higher living standards," said John Wong, professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. "They have every incentive to continue down the road that Deng built."

Under Deng's leadership in the 1980s and 1990s, China opened up to foreign investment, privatized state-owned enterprises, and encouraged private businesses and entrepreneurship. The results were staggering; China's economy grew at an average rate of 10 percent annually, propelling hundreds of millions out of poverty. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, though still behind the United States.

Deng promoted a pragmatic, non-ideological approach to policymaking which came to be known as "Socialism with Chinese characteristics." While nominally communist, China adopted free market policies and encouraged capitalism under tight political control. The so-called "paramount leader" wielded near absolute power during his rule, but also pushed gradual political reforms. He stepped back from politics in the mid-1990s, leaving a system with regular transitions of power and a greater role for technocrats.

The Communist Party appears firmly in control of the country for now. Last year, China saw a sweeping anti-corruption campaign, and President Xi Jinping centralized more power under his authority. With no obvious successor, Xi is poised to lead China for the foreseeable future. While dissent and freedoms remain limited, most Chinese benefit from increasing prosperity and opportunities. 

Deng's impact on China's development cannot be overstated, but his successors have governed in line with his vision for the past 20 years. "China has built strong institutions and interests around its hybrid model; There is no turning back," said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. With the economy slowing in recent years, China's leaders will face pressure to pursue bolder reforms, but a reversal of China's opening up seems unlikely. Deng may be gone, but his legacy lives on.
