China Warns Japan Over Encouraging Right-Wing Activities in South China Sea Islands 

China issued a stern warning to Japan today over what it called “irresponsible rhetoric” from Japanese officials encouraging right-wing activists to travel to disputed islands in the South China Sea. Geng Shuang, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said Japan should “immediately stop its interference in the South China Sea issue” and not embolden “right-wing forces” that could destabilize the region.

The warning comes after a member of Japan’s parliament suggested that activists travel to the Spratly Islands, an archipelago claimed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. China maintains that it has indisputable sovereignty over the islands and their surrounding waters. The Chinese rebuked the Japanese lawmaker’s comments as “extremely irresponsible” and said they could encourage “dangerous and illegal activities.”

Tensions between China and Japan have escalated recently over territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Japan controls a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, that are also claimed by China. There are concerns that disputes over these territories could lead to a wider geopolitical crisis. 

The warning from China is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle for influence in the Western Pacific that also involves the United States. The U.S. has criticized China’s military buildup on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, conducting so-called “freedom of navigation” operations to challenge China’s claims. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that “China’s predatory world view has no place in the 21st century.”

In its warning to Japan, China indicated that it would not tolerate any unilateral actions that undermined its claims in the region. “The Chinese government’s determination and will to safeguard territorial sovereignty and legitimate maritime rights and interests is unshakable,” the Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. For now, Japan has not responded officially to China’s demands, but further provocations from either side could increase the possibility of a direct confrontation.
