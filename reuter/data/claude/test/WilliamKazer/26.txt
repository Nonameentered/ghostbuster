Microsoft and Legend Group Enter Licensing Pact to Protect Intellectual Property Rights in China 

Microsoft Corp. and Legend Holdings Ltd. announced a broad licensing agreement to strengthen protection of intellectual property rights in China. The deal allows Legend to use Microsoft's patents for its devices and services in China, while Microsoft obtains access to Legend's patents.

The agreement comes amid ongoing concerns about intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers in China, especially related to American tech companies. The deal highlights the continued challenges of operating in China, even for a company as large as Microsoft that has been in the market for decades. However, it also shows Microsoft's commitment to work with local companies to minimize risks.

"This agreement represents a new model for cross-company collaboration that will benefit China's innovation ecosystem," said Horace Dediu, a technology analyst at Asymco. "By sharing IP and cooperating, Microsoft and Legend can accelerate innovation while avoiding legal disputes."

The details of the exact patents and how much access each company gained were not disclosed. However, a spokesperson for Legend said the agreement covers a broad range of technologies, including mobile devices, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other areas that are priorities for the Chinese government's "Made in China 2025" plan. 

Microsoft has operated in China for more than 20 years but continues to face challenges, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn professional network being periodically blocked. The Windows and Office maker also faces piracy and intellectual property risks in China's huge consumer tech market. The deal with Legend aims to head off potential disputes by increasing cooperation. 

Legend is a major Chinese technology conglomerate founded in 1984 that pioneered the country's PC market and now makes smartphones, software, and cloud services. The Beijing-based company has ambitions to expand globally but also faces obstacles around intellectual property, making a partnership with an experienced U.S. firm appealing. 

The agreement is a sign of continued thawing tensions between Washington and Beijing on trade and technology issues. However, analysts cautioned more progress was still needed to address long-standing concerns around forced tech transfers, government subsidies, and other issues that have strained the relationship between the world's two largest economies.
