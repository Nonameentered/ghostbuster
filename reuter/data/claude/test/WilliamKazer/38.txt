China introduces anti-dumping rules to protect domestic companies from unfair foreign competition 

The Chinese government announced today that it is implementing new anti-dumping regulations to protect domestic companies from unfairly low-priced goods flooding the Chinese market from foreign competitors. The new rules will allow Chinese companies to file anti-dumping cases against foreign firms that are selling goods in China at “unfairly low” prices that could damage Chinese competitors.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the new rules are aimed at creating a "fair and transparent" trade environment and promoting the healthy development of trade relations. However, critics argue the rules could be used as a protectionist measure to shield inefficient Chinese companies from foreign competition. The regulations follow a WTO ruling last year that China's existing anti-dumping rules were inconsistent with global trade norms.

Under the new regulations, Chinese companies can file anti-dumping cases against foreign firms if they can show that imported goods are being sold at a price lower than the cost of production, and that such low pricing is damaging domestic industry. If anti-dumping duties are imposed, they would require importers to pay the difference between the imported good's price and its "normal value" to eliminate the unfair advantage.

The announcement of the new rules comes amid ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States. The Trump administration has frequently accused China of unfair trade practices that have resulted in massive job losses in U.S. manufacturing. China's move to strengthen its anti-dumping regime could lead to greater trade frictions if the rules are perceived as targeting U.S. firms. However, Chinese officials insist the measures are aimed at promoting fair trade and globalization.

"China is opening its door wider to the outside world," said Commerce Minister Zhong Shan at a press briefing. "We welcome all foreign companies to invest and trade in China, but trade should be mutually beneficial and on an equal footing." The new anti-dumping rules will take effect on November 1, 2019. Observers say Chinese companies are likely to start filing more anti-dumping cases, especially against companies from the United States, Europe, South Korea and Japan.
