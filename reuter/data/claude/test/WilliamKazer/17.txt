China's State-Run Steel Companies to Trim Bloated Payrolls and Survive in Competitive Market

The Chinese government announced plans to cut up to 1.3 million jobs in its sprawling state-run steel sector to reduce excess capacity, improve efficiency, and enable companies to survive in an increasingly competitive global market. 

China's steel industry has been expanding rapidly over the past decade fueled by government subsidies and easy access to credit from state-run banks. The sector now produces half the world's steel but growth in demand has slowed both domestically and abroad. The resulting oversupply and debt burden mean many Chinese steel firms are now unprofitable and relying on government support.

The job cuts were announced by China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and will take place over the next 2-3 years. The reductions represent about 20-25% of the 5 million jobs in China's iron and steel industry. The ministry said the companies suffered from "low work efficiency, loose management, and a bloated workforce." The cuts are aimed at reducing costs and improving productivity at a time when China's economic growth has slowed to its lowest level in 30 years.

The job losses will hit China's giant state-owned enterprises like Baogang Group, Shougang Group, and Anshan Iron and Steel Group which dominate the sector. These companies grew rapidly during the boom years but now suffer from outdated technology, excessive debt, and overstaffing according to industry analysts. Private steel companies in China are typically more efficient but have been crowded out by the state giants.

The government plans to provide funding for retraining and early retirement programs to ease the transition. However, the layoffs will fuel worries about rising unemployment in China as the economy continues to slow. The news comes as the U.S. steel industry complains China's massive state support for its steel companies amounts to unfair competition, flooding global markets with cheap steel. U.S. steel producers have won anti-dumping duties against Chinese steel makers.

China's plan to cut steel sector jobs is a step towards addressing the pressing issues of industrial overcapacity and corporate debt that experts have warned threatens the country's long-term economic health. The shorter-term pain of job losses will be the price China has to pay to build a more sustainable market economy less dependent on government support. Overall, China is caught between its policy of maintaining social stability and the realities of global market forcesâ€”a conflict inherent in its state capitalist system.
