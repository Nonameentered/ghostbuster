China's Vice Premier Calls for Tougher Controls on Financial Risk to Protect Banking System 

BEIJING—China's Vice Premier Liu He called for stronger measures to control financial risks and protect the country's banking system, as the government looks to curb rising debt levels in the world's second-largest economy.

Speaking at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee on Sunday, Vice Premier Liu said China needs to "resolutely curb the excessive accumulation of financial risks" and take action to dissolve existing risks. The committee was set up last year to coordinate regulation of China's complex financial system.

Vice Premier Liu's comments reflect Beijing's concern over rising debt levels in China and the threat this poses to the country's financial stability. China's total debt has risen rapidly over the past decade and now exceeds 250% of gross domestic product according to some estimates. Much of this debt built up within China's state-dominated banking system and in the country's largely unregulated shadow banking sector.

To curb debt growth, China has embarked on a campaign to rein in risks from areas like shadow banking, real estate, and local government borrowing. But slowing credit growth too abruptly could damage economic growth. China's government is aiming for GDP growth this year of around 6.5%, a pace that requires a continued steady expansion of credit.

Vice Premier Liu said on Sunday that China needs to balance controlling financial risks with supporting economic growth. He called for "promoting restructurings, mergers and acquisitions, and phasing out outdated overcapacities" in industries with excess capacity like steel and coal. Doing so would help lower debt levels in those sectors.

The Chinese government has a number of options to tighten controls on financial risks, like raising interest rates, tightening regulation on shadow banking, and allowing some state-owned enterprises to default on their debts. But Beijing has so far moved cautiously to avoid stifling China's growth momentum.

China's banking system—in which the state controls most of the largest banks—is healthier than economies in other emerging countries according to most measures. But as China's economy slows further, keeping the banking system stable will be crucial to maintaining growth and public confidence in the economy. Strong words of warning from top leaders like Vice Premier Liu signal Beijing's resolve to curb financial risks—even if actually doing so proves difficult in practice.
