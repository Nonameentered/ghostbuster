China to Return Hijacker to Taiwan, But Analysts Say It is Just a Small Step Towards Easing Tensions  

China has agreed to return a Taiwanese man who hijacked a flag carrier to Taiwan, a small conciliatory move that analysts say does little to ease the underlying tensions between China and Taiwan.

The man, identified only as Zhou, hijacked a plane belonging to China Eastern Airlines on Tuesday during an internal flight in southern China. He demanded to be flown to Taiwan, saying he wanted to “escape to Taiwan where there is democracy and freedom.” After the plane landed in Taiwan, Zhou surrendered to police and was taken into custody.

Taiwan had requested Zhou's return under international civil aviation agreements. On Wednesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said it would return Zhou to Taiwan, calling the hijacking a "serious illegal act." However, the office said the move reflected China's desire to safeguard aviation safety and "has nothing to do with improving cross-Strait relations."

Analysts said China's agreement to return Zhou is a small step but does not signal a shift in China's overall hardline stance toward Taiwan. "It's a very minor concession to make while still maintaining a tough position," said Drew Thompson, a former US Defense Department official now at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. "Beijing wants to convey that one small act does not undermine their overall determination to compel Taiwan to accept China's definition of the cross-strait relationship."

Tensions between China and Taiwan have risen since Tsai Ing-wen and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won Taiwan's presidential election in 2016. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for China. In response, China has cut off formal communication with Taiwan, ramped up military exercises, and poached several of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies.	

Against this backdrop of tensions, China's agreement to return the hijacker is unlikely to spur further goodwill or cooperation, analysts say. "This is not a turning point ... It's not a breakthrough or a sign that broader tensions are easing," said Thompson. While China's move eases an isolated dispute, the underlying differences between China and Taiwan remain unresolved. "This doesn't fix the broader issues in the relationship or change the trajectory," Thompson said.

In the end, a safe resolution of the hijacking was in the interests of both sides. But a single act of cooperation is unlikely to pave the way for more substantive progress, as long as the question of Taiwan's political status looms large between them.
