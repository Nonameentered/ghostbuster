China May Adjust Treasury Debt Mix to Attract Domestic Investors

The Chinese government is considering adjusting the mix of securities it issues to attract more domestic investors to buy central government bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) may increase the proportion of Treasury bonds with maturities of three to five years that are popular among Chinese investors. It could also raise the debt limits for domestic investors to encourage more local purchasing of government securities.

The moves aim to diversify the investor base for China's $1.9 trillion Treasury bond market amid rising external economic uncertainties. China's domestic bond market is dominated by commercial banks and brokerages, while foreign investors own just 2% of outstanding government bonds. Individual investors have shown more interest in recent years as market access has opened up, but their share is still small relative to the size of China's household wealth.

The MOF will need to balance attracting more domestic buyers with maintaining adequate demand from foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds, who hold most of the government bonds owned by offshore investors. "The MOF wants to encourage local participation to more actively purchase Treasury bonds, but it will be a gradual process without crowding out foreign investors," said one of the people.
 The Treasury bond plan was mentioned by Premier Li Keqiang at the National People's Congress this month, when he said the government will expand medium to long-term Treasury bond issuance and support the steady development of the domestic debt market.

China is reshaping its Treasury issuance and yield curve to match domestic investor preferences and increase liquidity. Three-year note issuance in the local government bond program was raised at the expense of shorter- and longer-term notes in some recent auctions. The finance ministry sold three-year notes at a lower yield than the benchmark to attract demand.

The yield gap between Chinese government bonds and comparable U.S. Treasuries recently shrank to its narrowest in more than a decade, reflecting strong foreign demand for Chinese debt. While advantageous for the government's borrowing costs, lower yields could curb enthusiasm for some domestic investors other than banks. Broadening the domestic investor base would insulate China's bond market against volatile foreign flows and support the development of more diverse fixed-income investment products for Chinese retail investors. 

Raising issuance of popular maturities and enabling higher investment limits are options to court more local buyers that the MOF can implement fairly readily, said the people. In the medium term, improved market access for insurance funds, asset managers and individuals could significantly boost domestic participation in China's bond market if policymakers are willing to embrace more sweeping changes.
