China Presents United Front to Plan Funeral of Deng Xiaoping

Beijing, China - The Chinese government today announced plans for an elaborate state funeral for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who guided China's economic reforms and opening to the outside world. Deng passed away last night at the age of 92. 

The announcement of Deng's death plunged China into a state of national mourning and set off a flurry of preparations for what will be one of the most important state funerals in modern China's history. The central government has declared a week of official mourning during which normal work and entertainment activities will be suspended.

In a rare display of unity, top government and Communist party leaders gathered today in Beijing to coordinate plans to honor Deng, who despite holding no official government posts for the last two decades continued to exert broad influence over China's political direction. Although plans for the specifics of Deng's funeral have not yet been announced, it is expected to include a grand farewell ceremony in the Great Hall of the People followed by the eventual cremation of Deng's body and burial of his ashes at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Beijing.

Deng spearheaded China's reforms in the late 1970s to open up the economy to global trade and private market forces after the death of Mao Zedong. His policies led to decades of breakneck economic growth that propelled China to become the world's second largest economy. Despite some political ups and downs, Deng worked his way back to supreme leadership in China in the late 1970s and was broadly revered as the "paramount leader" of China until his death.

Tributes to Deng from world leaders have already started pouring in. US President Barack Obama called Deng "an iconic figure who helped China take its first steps into the modern world" and said "China's extraordinary growth and development has changed the face of the global economy." Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Deng as "a great figure with historical achievements" who led China into a new era of "Reform and Opening Up."

Deng's death marks the end of an era in China's modern history. His bold reforms set China on a path to prosperity but also widened a rift with Communist party hardliners. As China charts its course for the 21st century, Deng's legacy as the pragmatic leader who ushered in an age of openness and change will not be soon forgotten. But the tributes today from across China's political spectrum show that at least for now, Deng's funeral will be an opportunity to set aside differences and recognize the great helmsman who pointed China toward its future.
