Unemployed Taiwanese Journalist Hijacks Plane to China Seeking Political Asylum 

A Taiwanese journalist claiming to be unemployed and facing financial hardship hijacked a passenger plane today and diverted it to China, saying he is seeking political asylum.

The journalist, identified as Chen Wei-han, 34, seized control of the passenger aircraft shortly after takeoff from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The plane was destined for Hong Kong with 192 passengers and crew on board. Chen  allegedly claimed he had explosives in a briefcase and demanded that the pilots divert the flight to China. The pilots complied and landed the aircraft at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, where Chen surrendered to authorities.

In interviews, Chen said he could no longer find work as a journalist in Taiwan and was facing dire financial circumstances. He accused the Taiwanese government of "suppressing free speech" and making it impossible for him to continue his journalistic work. "I have no choice but to leave Taiwan and seek asylum in a country that welcomes free speech," Chen told reporters. "I hope China will consider my request."

Taiwanese officials condemned Chen's actions as reckless and dangerous. "This was an irresponsible act that put many innocent lives at risk," said Taiwan Transportation Minister Wu Hong-mo. "Political dissent does not justify hijacking an aircraft."

Chen's parents told reporters they were shocked by their son's actions but knew he had been under severe financial and career stress for over a year. They had been helping to support him financially as his job prospects dwindled. "We just didn't realize how desperate he had become," said his mother. "But hijacking a plane is never the right choice, no matter the situation."

The passengers and crew were unharmed in the incident. Chen is in police custody in China pending an investigation. If convicted of air piracy, he faces up to 20 years imprisonment according to Chinese law. His request for political asylum remains pending with Chinese immigration authorities.
