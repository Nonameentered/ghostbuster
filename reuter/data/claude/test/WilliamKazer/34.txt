China Orders Boeing Jets, Leaves Door Open to Rival Airbus in Political Move  

China finalized a $37 billion deal today to purchase 300 planes from Boeing, giving the U.S. aero giant its largest commercial sale ever to the Chinese aviation market. However, in an apparent political move, China's largest private airline also announced it has inked an agreement with Boeing's European rival Airbus for another 180 planes in a deal worth about $24 billion. 

The Boeing purchase deal includes 270 Boeing 737s and 30 long-haul 777s. The combination of narrow-body and wide-body jets will enable China's state-owned airlines to meet growing demand for air travel in China for both domestic and international flights. The order had been expected for months and Boeing has said it is already factoring the planes into its production schedules through the 2020s.

However, within hours of the Boeing announcement, Hainan Airlines—China's largest private carrier—said it signed a deal to buy 180 planes from Airbus, including 50 A350 wide-body jets and 130 A320 family single-aisle aircraft. The Airbus order, worth $24 billion at list prices, appears designed in part to rebalance China's geopolitical interests and not rely too heavily on U.S.-made aircraft. China regularly leverages its huge commercial aviation market, forecast to become the world's largest in 10 years, as an instrument of its foreign policy and geopolitical interests.

Some analysts see the split decision as a move by China to gain leverage with the United States on trade and other strategic issues by signaling it has other options in Europe. The decision "allows China to hedge its bets and teach the U.S. a lesson," said aviation analyst Peter Harbison. The U.S. and China have been involved in a series of spats over the past two years, including an ongoing trade war with rounds of tariff increases by both sides." Buying some from Boeing and some from Airbus allows China to diversify," he added.

The new aircraft will boost the fleets of fast-growing Chinese airlines, which have been straining to keep up with surging travel demand in China's domestic market, as well as to overseas destinations. China's commercial aircraft fleet is expected to grow from 2,610 planes in 2017 to well over 6,300 aircraft by 2037, according to Boeing.

While the Boeing sale represents its largest commercial deal with China, the U.S. planemaker still maintains a market leadership position in China's aviation market. Boeing predicts demand for 7,700 new aircraft worth $1.2 trillion from China over the next 20 years. Even with increased competition from Airbus and China's new homegrown C919 jet, Boeing expects to capture half that market value, though at lower profit margins. The dual purchase agreements with the American and European aviation giants underlines China's eagerness to leverage its massive market to secure the best deals and maintain geopolitical equilibrium between its key trading partners.
