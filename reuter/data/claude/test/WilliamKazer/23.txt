China to Host High-Profile U.S. Official Despite Funding Allegations

China announced today that it will host a high-ranking U.S. trade official for economic talks next week, despite allegations that Beijing continues to fund state-backed hacking operations targeting Western companies. 

Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo will travel to China for meetings with Vice Premier Liu He and Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. The talks are aimed at improving business ties between the two economic superpowers, even as tensions linger over China's failure to curb alleged cyberattacks and intellectual property theft.

Only last week, a report surfaced that Chinese government-affiliated groups have launched a new wave of cyberattacks on major corporations in the technology, healthcare, defense, and finance sectors. Private cybersecurity firms have traced the attacks back to groups with links to China's Ministry of State Security. The report threatens to undermine progress in trade negotiations and prompts questions about China's commitment to fair economic competition. 

The visit also comes on the heels of a Pentagon report warning that China is intensifying military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan, a self-governing democratic island that Beijing claims as its territory. The aggressive actions risk destabilizing the region and further straining U.S.-China relations. 

Secretary Raimondo is expected to raise concerns over China's cyber threats, market access restrictions, and unfair trade practices that have cost American companies billions of dollars each year. The Trump administration signed an initial "phase one" trade deal with China in January 2020, but most tariffs still remain in place as negotiators struggle to secure a broader agreement.

There are hopes the in-person meeting could help thaw tensions and pave the way for tariff rollbacks as well as a potential summit between presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping later this year. But the hacking allegations and other disputes highlight the significant challenges that remain in resetting the vital economic relationship between Washington and Beijing.

Continued progress will require China to take concrete actions to curb illegal cyber activity, open its markets to U.S. companies, and end predatory trade practices, U.S. officials said. Absent policy changes, relations may continue to deteriorate with consequences for global trade and geopolitics. Next week's talks will be a significant test of whether the two sides can overcome differences and work together in good faith. The future of the bilateral trade relationship hangs in the balance.
