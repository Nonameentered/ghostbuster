Bombings in western China kill one and injure at least 60 during Deng Xiaoping memorial ceremonies

A series of bombings rocked western China on Tuesday, killing at least one person and injuring 60 others as the country commemorated the 20th anniversary of the death of former leader Deng Xiaoping. The blasts occurred in three cities in Xinjiang, a region with a large Muslim population that has been plagued by ethnic tensions and violence.

The deadliest blasts were in the city of Kuqa, where two bombs exploded just after 10 am local time near a government building where memorial ceremonies were taking place. According to state media reports, the twin explosions killed a security guard and injured at least 40 other people, some seriously. Less than an hour later, another blast was reported at a bus terminal in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi, injuring 20 commuters. Police also detonated an unexploded device found at the scene. A fourth explosion went off in Kashgar at around noon, injuring two bystanders in a public square, though authorities said it was unclear if that blast was intentional or accidental. 

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks. Xinjiang is home to ethnic Uighurs, a Turkic Muslim minority. For years, the region has faced issues of Uighur separatism and Islamic extremism, which authorities blame for sporadic violent attacks on police and civilians, though human rights groups say the government exaggerates the threats to justify crackdowns on political dissent and religion. Tuesday's bombings came amid tighter security accompanying the Deng memorials across China. Deng led China's economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and is revered as a political giant in contemporary China.

The Kuqa explosions in particular appeared aimed at inflicting mass civilian casualties, marking an escalation from the knife attacks and vehicle assaults seen in recent years. Paramilitary police patrols have been increased across Xinjiang, and security experts fear the blasts could signal renewed determination by extremists to target civilians. The bombings are sure to fuel tensions between the Han Chinese majority and the Uighur minority in Xinjiang. Rights groups have accused the government of religious restrictions and human rights abuses against Uighurs in the name of counterterrorism and called for policy changes. Officials, however, insist their tough security measures are necessary to maintain stability in the region.
