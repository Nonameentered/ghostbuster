China's Fight Against Inflation Proves Successful as Economists Predict Record-Low Price Rises

China's battle against rising prices is paying off, economists said, signaling the country's longest stretch of subdued inflation in over a decade. Consumer inflation slowed to 2.1% in January from 2.5% in December, below the government's target of "around 3%" for the year. Food prices, which make up nearly a third of the consumer price index, rose just 4.2% compared to double-digit increases a year ago. 

The weakening inflation suggests China's economy may have further cooled in early 2020, giving the government more room to stimulate growth if needed. China has made stabilizing consumer prices one of its priorities this year as rising living costs can undermine public confidence and social stability. 

China's producer price index, a gauge of costs for goods and services as they leave factory gates, declined 0.1% in the month versus a rise of 0.3% in December. Falling producer prices reflect sliding demand and overcapacity in China's industrial sector that was already under pressure from the trade war with the U.S.

The country's core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, edged up 1.4% in January, the smallest increase since March 2019. Lackluster demand, oversupply, as well as a government effort to ensure ample supplies have helped rein in inflation, economists said.  

To cushion the economic slowdown, China loosened restrictions on interest rates and the housing market in recent months to boost lending and construction. Residential property investment quickened in January, while new home prices in 70 cities rose at a steady pace. However, any pickup is likely to be gradual.

"Looking ahead, economic activity may start to recover on further policy easing and fiscal stimulus measures. However, the risks to China's growth trajectory remain downward, given weak domestic and external demand. Consumer inflation should continue trending lower barring any shocks," said Erin Xin, Greater China economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.

In conclusion, China's successful battle against price rises in January points to further economic weakness that may prompt more policy support. However, any recovery is likely to be slow, with inflation expected to remain muted barring external shocks. The government's targeted easing so far seems to be stabilizing the slowdown rather than spurring a strong rebound.
