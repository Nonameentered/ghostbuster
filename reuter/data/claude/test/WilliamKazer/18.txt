China Slams U.S. Human Rights Record in Response to Washington's Accusations 

Beijing has fired back at Washington's criticism of China's human rights record by issuing a report slamming the state of human rights in the United States. The report from China's State Council Information Office outlined a wide range of issues including racial discrimination, income inequality and gun violence in America.

"The U.S. government has violated human rights domestically and oversees constantly trampled on human rights in other countries," the report states. It accuses the U.S. of "systematic racial discrimination" citing disproportionate police violence against African Americans and unequal opportunities in education and employment. 

The scathing report comes just days after the U.S. State Department issued its annual assessment of human rights issues in China, highlighting suppression of political dissent, arbitrary detentions of activists and restrictions on free speech and religion. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China's actions constitute "genocide" citing abuses against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.

China rejected these accusations, calling them "lies and disinformation." In its counter-report, China said the U.S. has "seriously infringed upon Chinese citizens' and overseas Chinese students' legitimate rights and interests." It pointed to a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S., particularly over the past year during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trading of accusations and criticism on human rights is the latest episode in the increasingly fractious relationship between the U.S. and China. The Biden administration has signaled it will continue the tough stance on China adopted by the previous administration, even as it seeks cooperation on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation. 

For its part, China shows no signs of backing down or conceding to U.S. demands on issues like economic reform or increased access for Western companies and investors. The dueling human rights reports suggest each nation is doubling down on its criticism of the other on the world stage, indicating tensions between the two superpowers are unlikely to ease anytime soon. Overall, the spat highlights the deep divides between the U.S. and China in ideology and values.
