Farmers in Beijing quietly mark the death of Deng Xiaoping, putting livelihoods above memorials  

As China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was mourned in a state funeral in Beijing this week, the farmers in villages surrounding the capital went about their daily routines. While the nation's top leaders gathered to remember the man who led China's economic reforms, local farmers focused on tending crops and livestock, putting the demands of the harvest above memorials.

In the farming village of Xiaotangshan, about 40 kilometers north of Tiananmen Square where Deng's memorial service was held, most residents had little time to watch the elaborate televised ceremonies. "We have to work the fields, we don't have time to watch TV all day," said farmer Jiang Wu, 52. "Deng made it so we have more freedom now to run our farms, but we still have to earn a living."

Deng, who ruled China from 1978 to 1992, dismantled agricultural collectives and allowed farmers to work individual family plots, sparking increased food production and rural prosperity. But many smallholder farmers still struggle with poverty and debt. "Deng gave us reforms, but life is still hard," said Xiaotangshan farmer Liu Mei, 46. "We appreciate what he did, but we can't spend days mourning when there are chores to do and mouths to feed."

In contrast with the outpouring of grief in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the mood in Xiaotangshan and other rural enclaves was muted. No local memorial events were organized, and farmers expressed little interest in travelling into Beijing to pay respects. While Deng's political and economic changes still resonate, daily survival remains the top priority for China's 900 million farmers. 

As China pauses to reflect on Deng's transformative but turbulent rule this week, the silence of the farmers speaks volumes. While lauding his role in propelling China's rise, they show that more progress is needed to fulfill Deng's goal of national prosperity. For those feeding a nation, honor and ideals take a backseat to Putting food on the table. Deng reshaped the destiny of his country, but for better or worse, the countryside he sought to uplift remains largely unchanged. The farmers keep stoically toiling, as leaders and lands come and go.
