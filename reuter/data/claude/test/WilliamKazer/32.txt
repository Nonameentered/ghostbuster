U.S. Vice President Al Gore Looks to Mend Ties with China Amid Controversy Over Election Interference Accusations 

As Vice President Al Gore touched down in Beijing this week, he looked to repair the strained relationship between the U.S. and China in the wake of  explosive allegations that China had interfered in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to support Democratic candidate Joe Biden.  While Beijing has vociferously denied the charges, the controversy threatens to undermine cooperation between the two superpowers on issues like trade, climate change, and nuclear proliferation. 

Vice President Gore was dispatched by President Biden in a bid to reset relations with China and find common ground.  Upon arriving in Beijing, Gore met with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and conveyed Biden’s interests in working together on shared challenges.  “While we have real differences, President Biden believes we must engage China from a position of strength while cooperating whenever possible,” Gore told reporters.  “A constructive relationship between the U.S. and China is in the interests of both nations and the wider world.”

Wang responded that China also hopes for “mutually beneficial cooperation” but criticized “false accusations” about election interference that “poison the atmosphere of bilateral relations.”  China’s government has stated that the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence report alleging Chinese election meddling was “fabricated” and warned the Biden administration not to use it as a pretext for hostility.   At their meeting, Wang demanded that the U.S. withdraw the report and warned there would be “consequences” if new policies restricting trade or technology agreements were imposed as a result.

The election interference charges have strained an already tense relationship rife with long-standing disputes over trade, human rights, Taiwan, and China’s territorial ambitions. President Biden has promised a tougher approach to China than his predecessor yet seeks China’s cooperation on other priorities like climate change.  As vice president under former President Obama, Gore helped negotiate the Paris climate accord with China's support.  With the midterms upcoming, Biden also wants to show he’s still open to bipartisan deal-making.
