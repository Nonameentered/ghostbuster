Beijing Offers Reward for Information on Bus Bombing, Blames Criminal Elements  

Beijing, China — The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau offered a reward of one million yuan ($146,000) today for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for Monday's bus bombing that killed 12 people and injured 32 others. The bombing rattled the city and raised concerns about terrorism ahead of next month's National Congress of the Communist Party.

In a press conference today, spokesman Wang Xuyuan sought to downplay terrorism fears and attributed the attack to "criminal elements." He said police had found traces of an improvised explosive device at the blast site and preliminary analysis suggested it was of a type commonly used by criminal gangs to extort money or retaliate against opponents. Wang said police "have well-developed leads in the case" and urged anyone with knowledge of the attack to come forward to claim the reward and aid police in their investigation.

The explosion occurred at 7:45 a.m. on bus route 46 as it made its way through the normally busy downtown area of the city. Pictures from onlookers show the bus's frame mangled and the roof of the vehicle torn apart by the force of the blast. Doctors at nearby Dong Dan Hospital said several victims suffered wounds from metal shrapnel and glass and some required amputations. Three victims remained in critical condition as of Tuesday evening.

Although Wang and other officials have discouraged speculation about terrorism, the bombing has already heightened security in the capital in advance of the National Congress starting on November 8. Additional police officers and security checkpoints have been deployed at transportation hubs, government buildings and tourist attractions. The congress will bring Xi Jinping, leader of the Communist Party, and other top officials to Beijing for a week of meetings.
