The proposed bills that have caused concern amongst internet access providers include the "Protecting the Right to Organize Act" (PRO Act) and the "For the People Act". The PRO Act is aimed at strengthening the rights of workers to organize and bargain for better pay and benefits. However, the bill has provisions that could undermine the independence of contractors and gig workers and unionize them. The bill could also undermine the right of companies to create and manage independent contractor relationships, and provide a competitive advantage to larger firms.
