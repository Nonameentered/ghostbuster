The CFTC, which is responsible for regulating the derivatives and futures markets in the US, had introduced new rules in 2013 that required banks to hold more capital against a range of trades, including swaps and foreign exchange derivatives. The aim of these regulations was to reduce the risk of another financial crisis by ensuring that banks had sufficient capital to cover any potential losses.
