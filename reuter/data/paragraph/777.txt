To further enhance its e-commerce capabilities, the USPS will also be creating an e-commerce hub that will provide customers with a single point of contact for all e-commerce-related inquiries. This hub will be staffed by dedicated customer service representatives who will be trained to handle all types of e-commerce inquiries, including those related to shipping, tracking, and payment processing.
