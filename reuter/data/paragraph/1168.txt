The case was brought by New York-based company NYPC which runs a foreign exchange trading platform that allows participants to bet on the direction of foreign currencies using complex financial instruments. NYPC argued that its trading platform, which operates outside the US, was not subject to CFTC regulation because it was not related to the US commodities market.
