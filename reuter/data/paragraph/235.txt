The incident was the latest in a rash of cyber-break-ins into high-profile web sites. On August 23, a hacker rang up $14,000 in electronic bills by manipulating a flaw in the Oracle Corp. web site. Oracle's web site is used by businesses to obtain updates on the company's software products. And on August 27, hackers broke into the Microsoft Corp. web site and replaced its home page with one of their own - an electronic voodoo doll with Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates' face pinned to its back. In each case, the hackers exploited security holes that allowed them to gain access to the web sites' computers.
