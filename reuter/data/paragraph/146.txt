A June survey by Dun and Bradstreet estimated the number of home Internet users at 28 million. A recently released survey by the Media Metrix research firm said U.S. Internet users reached a total of 54 million in October.  The Harris survey showed women continuing to close the gender gap in the realm of online usage, with 38 percent of female respondents saying they had gone on the Internet, up from 27 percent at the beginning of the year. Male users rose to 52 percent from 39 percent since January.
