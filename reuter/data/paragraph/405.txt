Leach's bill would also create a "Universal Charters Act" to create an alternative chartering system that would provide national banking powers to companies within any state. He said it would require the creation of national banking standards, regulatory procedures, agency oversight and consumer protections. The bill would merge the Office of Thrift Supervision into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and create the Office of Financial Supervision to help coordinate the activities of the Federal Reserve, OTS and OCC. The bill calls for an advisory council be created to give thrift customers a voice in regulators' rulemaking.
