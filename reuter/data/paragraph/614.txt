Executives from Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., PSINet Inc. and AT&amp;T addressed an unusual gathering Thursday in the Capitol Hill office of Rep. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and one of the founders of the Congressional Internet Caucus. The 95-member bipartisan group of legislators, which Wyden formed late last year, held the first of a series of meetings to learn more about the Internet as Congress gears up to tackle a host of issues related to the global computer network.
