In conclusion, the proposal by the International Internet Group to introduce seven new TLDs is a positive development for the Internet community. The new TLDs will provide relief for businesses and organizations that have been struggling to find available addresses, and will reduce the likelihood of trademark disputes. The proposed model for the management of the new TLDs is fair and transparent, and will ensure that the benefits of the new TLDs are enjoyed by all. While there are concerns about the potential impact on the existing TLDs, the overall benefits of the proposal are likely to outweigh the risks.  Overall, it is a positive step towards the development of a more robust and resilient Internet infrastructure.
