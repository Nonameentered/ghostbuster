Jim Dryden, of the OECD's Center for Global Information Infrastructure, downplayed the significance of the guidelines, saying the document is a blueprint, not a policy.  The report is still in draft form and only will be approved by the OECD's members countries if it reaches consensus. "This is designed to try to start a debate," Dryden said.  "The main purpose here is that we should recognize that various governments have various approaches."
