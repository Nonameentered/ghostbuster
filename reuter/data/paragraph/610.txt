D'Amato called that argument "old-fashioned, old-line thinking." "Competition matches efficiency and consumer choice," he said. In the hearing, the only support for a compromised position was offered by J. Carter Beese Jr., acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulations must foremost "ensure the safety and soundness" of the financial system, Beese said, adding he is willing to compromise on allowing only certain types of mergers. The manner in which the government regulates activities of affiliated companies also remains unresolved. The Roukema and Leach bills would make parent companies liable for the errors of subsidiaries. But D'Amato said such a legal shield would work against the market because it would perpetuate the current system in which little cross-industry competition exists.
