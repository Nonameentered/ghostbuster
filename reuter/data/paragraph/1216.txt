According to Professor Matthew Smith of the University of Michigan, one of the authors of the study, the challenge is twofold. "Many users don't feel they need to switch from their current providers," Smith said, "while others simply don't know what other online services are available." To address this challenge, online businesses need to focus on marketing and product differentiation. They should strive to create a unique customer experience by offering unique products and services that customers canâ€™t get elsewhere. In addition, they should highlight the customer service and support they offer their users.
