Further, the ever-mutating software, which makes up many online businesses, may be beyond the government's enforcement capabilities.  "It is essential that taxpayers comply with the regulations in a timely manner in order for any revenue to be collected," the report said.  The Treasury also believes that the taxation of the Internet should follow regulations designed to apply to all forms of business.  "The taxation of electronic business transactions should recognize that today's electronic business models may drastically reduce the amount of labor and other resources necessary to produce a given product," Robert Davidson, a Treasury official said in a memo to the department.  But while recognizing the special needs of electronic businesses, the Treasury should also be careful not to create loopholes, the report said.  The report proposed that Congress pass uniform laws covering the taxation of income from all sources, and that the department take steps to ensure that current forms of taxation, such as for capital gains and other income not subject to withholding, continue to apply to electronic commerce.  The report acknowledged that changing old laws might prove difficult, and proposed that the department sponsor conferences to discuss taxation issues. The report also proposed that the department create a task force to monitor the issue.
