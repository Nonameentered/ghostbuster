On the other hand, there are also some concerns about the proposal. Opponents argue that it could lead to an increase in risk-taking by non-financial companies, as they may not be subject to the same rigorous regulations as traditional banks. Additionally, it could lead to an increase in industry consolidation, as established firms merge with or acquire rising fintech startups. This could reduce competition in the industry, which could lead to higher prices and lower quality services for consumers.
