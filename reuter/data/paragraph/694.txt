"It is important to remember that the impetus to contain this kind of risk is not sought in the pursuit of some utopian concept of markets devoid of all government oversight," Greenspan said. "The task of regulations is to minimize the probability of systemic problems and, should they arise, to contain them to an extent that spillovers to the general economy are minimized or avoided," he said.  Greenspan, who has repeatedly emphasized the need for Congress to modernise financial laws, used a nuclear physics analogy to describe the challenge of avoiding catastrophic economic markets. "That cataclysmic interaction, which can be compared to the chain reaction of nuclear physics, has been the preferred method of warfare of the twentieth century and can be the entrance to economic failure," he said.
