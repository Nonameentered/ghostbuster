The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for approving and regulating the use of TLDs. ICANN's Board of Directors recently met to create the guideline for renewing and grading TLD applications. Key criteria that will be considered for TLD approvals are the functionality of domain extensions, potential security concerns, and the prevention of domain name confusion.
