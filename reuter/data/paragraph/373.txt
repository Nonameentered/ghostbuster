The commission will have to decide, however, if access fees should apply to Internet calls which actually use regular phone lines.  "We have a remarkable agreement to disagree," Werbach said. "The commission raised the issue and most of the parties on both sides of the argument made strong, passionate cases. Ultimately, the commission did not go in either direction."  Long distance companies such as AT&T cheered the commission's move.  "We're delighted that the FCC has made this important step in recognizing that access fees should apply to similar competitive services," said Manny Schecter, AT&T's vice president of government affairs. "This is an important principle for the ongoing process."  Internet service providers were also pleased with the decision.
