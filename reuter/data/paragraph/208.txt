The report is especially critical of France, which recently enacted a law that would effectively impose a tax on electronic transmissions. The task force's draft report criticised the policy as an "attempt to regulate the Internet through taxation." The first section of the draft report, titled "Empowering a Free Market for the Global Internet," urged the administration to pursue its war against international regulation of the Internet. It proposed the U.S. government urge other countries to oppose all forms of "discriminatory" regulation, such as taxes or requirements that each country have a physical presence for doing business over the Internet. Taxation should be based on easy-to-apply criteria like the country or state of residence of the consumer, the draft said. The second part of the report urges government assistance for schools and other institutions in the United States to ensure they can buy technology at discount prices. In addition to promoting U.S. technology exports, it also encourages research to better protect the security and privacy of Internet transactions and more research into the effects of the Internet on society and the economy.
