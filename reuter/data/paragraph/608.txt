Roukema and D'Amato, a fierce and consistent proponent of deregulation, both proposed to broadly expand the list of "financial activities" a firm can engage in while still being eligible for charters from banking regulators. This would include insurance, securities and investment advice, and would allow, for example, an insurance company to partially own and bank and vice versa. D'Amato's bill would permit virtually unlimited new forms of financial combinations, while Roukema's language is more conservative, allowing no more than a 10-percent stake -- and possibly less -- of a non-financial firm in a financial firm. She said her bill "will provide diversity and option to the American financial consumer, but at the same time be mindful of consumer safeguards and competition."
