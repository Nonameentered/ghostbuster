At their first hearing on the issue, members of the House Banking Committee set out the main elements of pending legislation that would essentially divorce financials from commercial activity. Relatively small differences, however, could cause a huge divide between various banking, insurance, securities and mutual fund groups that had come together to support free-market principles and tear down barriers enacted nearly seven decades ago. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, has reintroduced legislation that would revoke the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and allow far greater financial services convergence than is now possible. Rep. Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican and chairwoman of the House Banking's Financial Institutions subcommittee, presented a bill that would allow a limited combination of financial services and commercial firms. Most of the financial services industry, however, support a broader approach.
