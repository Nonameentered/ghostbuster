The Federal Reserve is responsible for the supervision and regulation of banks and other financial institutions in the United States. Powell, who took office in February 2018, has been a vocal advocate for modernizing the country's financial regulatory framework ever since his appointment to the position. Amongst his priorities has been the need for regulatory reforms that are fit for purpose, acknowledging the rapidly evolving nature of the global financial landscape and the ever-increasing need for the US to remain at the top of the game.
