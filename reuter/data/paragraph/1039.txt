The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global forum comprised of 36 countries, has recently drafted guidelines on encryption. According to the OECD, the guidelines aim to balance the benefits of encryption technology with the need for law enforcement and security agencies to access encrypted data when necessary. The draft guidelines have avoided some contentious issues related to encryption, choosing instead to focus on areas where there is general agreement.
