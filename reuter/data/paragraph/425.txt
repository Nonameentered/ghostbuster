Welcoming the opportunity  Credit unions, already damaged by the effects of the lower court ruling, are hoping for another chance. "There would obviously be tremendous relief if the Supreme Court decided to hear the case," said Pryor. He said credit unions would welcome the opportunity to argue the distinction between state and federal credit union charters, an issue of contention that hasn't been completely resolved. "There hasn't been a case heard on this subject since 1934, and a lot has happened since then," he said.
