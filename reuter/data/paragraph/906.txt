Supporters of the proposed expansion believe that the new domain extensions will help resolve the issue of having limited options for domain names. If there are more domain extensions to choose from, businesses will have a greater chance of acquiring a domain name that matches their brand. Moreover, the change is expected to enhance online marketing, as businesses will be able to incorporate branding benefits into their domain names.
