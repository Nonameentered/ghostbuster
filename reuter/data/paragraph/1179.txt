Recently, a group of legislators introduced two bills in Congress to challenge these restrictions and promote greater access to encryption technology for U.S. companies and consumers. The first bill, named the Secure Data Act, aims to eliminate the current export licensing requirements for non-military encryption products, and instead relies on the Department of Commerce to establish guidelines for the export of strong encryption technology. The second bill, called the Promoting Digital Privacy and Security for All Act, seeks to reinforce the protections provided by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution by prohibiting government backdoors that would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption protections.
