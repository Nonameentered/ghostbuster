The revenue cap is a limitation placed on banks from engaging in securities underwriting. Historically, the revenue cap was put in place to prevent conflicts of interest between banking and investment banking operations. The original cap was set at 5% of a bank’s tier 1 capital, which is a measure of the bank’s financial strength.
