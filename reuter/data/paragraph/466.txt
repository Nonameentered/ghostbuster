Some of the member of the Internet coalition, which includes America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp., US West Inc. and MCI Communications Corp., do pay fees under special contracts, Selwyn acknowledged. But those fees vary widely and are almost entirely waived, he said. The study also focussed on Internet use as a small part of the entire phone system. The long-distance network, for example, carries more than 1,000 times more Internet traffic than the local-access network and accounts for 95 percent of all Internet traffic, the study said. The local phone system, meanwhile, carries less than 0.8 percent of all Internet traffic, the study said. In fact, the telephone system ranks only sixth among the various networks carrying Internet traffic, it said. The study also concluded phone companies have enough surplus capacity to prevent congestion, at least in the short term. The phone companies say they need to impose access fees because Internet usage is causing congestion at switchs between local-access networks and the rest of the system. The company studies said such "untolled" calls cost them around $3 billion to $7 billion a year.
