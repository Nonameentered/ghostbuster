"The Leach bill is still alive, despite the fact that he made political turmoil for the House leadership," said Edward Yingling, executive director of government relations at the American Bankers Association. "It's too early to tell whether the leadership would decide to squash the bill." Leach said the bill would allow banking firms to sell customers an array of financial products from within one corporate family. The change would benefit customers of banks, thrifts and other financial firms by enhancing their access and making services more affordable, Leach said.
