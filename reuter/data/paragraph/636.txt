The bill, which got much more support than expected last year but was not acted on, aims to reconcile two competing concerns - the security of free citizens and the security needs of governments. It would allow companies to export technology domestically with strong encryption capabilities.  But companies would have to have the ability to decode, or decrypt, customer data for governments with proper orders. That requirement has caused suspicion in the computer industry that their products would be open to backdoor police access - something the bill expressly seeks to prevent.
