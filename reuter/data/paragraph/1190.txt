The issue of intellectual property (IP) rights is also a significant challenge for businesses operating in different countries. Different countries have different IP laws that businesses must comply with. This can be a difficult task, especially for small businesses that do not have the resources to navigate the complex legal landscape. Failure to comply with IP laws can lead to legal action and significant financial damages.
