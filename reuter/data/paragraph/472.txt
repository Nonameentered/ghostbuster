Local phone companies previously argued that people were increasingly bypassing long-distance companies by communicating through the Internet and that they should get access fees as compensation.  But the study released Wednesday found that the total Internet traffic flowing through the phone network was only two percent of domestic long-distance traffic in 1995.  The Internet coalition urged the Federal Communications Commission to impose a $1,500 limit on the connection charges Internet companies pay per month for direct access to the phone network.  The group also recommended that the FCC encourage local phone companies to combine their signalling and voice networks, as AT&T and Nynex Corp. have done, to reduce capacity bottlenecks. AT&T calls its combination SNEAK, or low-rate circuit switching. It essentially splits the switchs into two networks, so that they are not overwhelmed by Internet callers.
