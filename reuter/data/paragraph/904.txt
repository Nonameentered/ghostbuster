Top level domains are the last part of a website address, like .com, .org, or .net. The current TLDs on the internet are around 1,500 varieties with .com being the most used domain extension worldwide. With the limits of widely utilized domain extensions, the new open-door policy to TLDs will result in the allowance of a broader range of extensions with a specific meaning, such as .music or .nyc to demonstrate location and purpose.
