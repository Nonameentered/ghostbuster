Goodlatte's bill would:  remove export bans on encryption products, allowing U.S. companies to freely export most products. require the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a flexible algorithm, or basic set of programming instructions, to be used for encryption. allow computer companies to incorporate their own algorithms, such as those used by Netscape. exempt most Internet-based companies from any reporting requirements to the government about sales of encryption products. allow software companies to share protected encryption source code with foreign subsidiaries.
