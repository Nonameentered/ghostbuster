The decision not to impose fees means that both companies offering consumer Internet services such as America Online and long-distance phone companies such as AT&T will continue to pay the same access fees. It was not immediately clear if smaller companies offering Internet connections, such as independent service providers, also were affected by the commission's decision.  Kevin Werbach, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan research group the Progress & Freedom Foundation, said the commission had made a "tentative decision" against extending the access fees to Internet service providers. This decision was part of the notice of proposed rulemaking.
