The bill's repeal of Section 32 - which allows certain companies to buy up to 10 percent of a bank's stock - would apply to all entities, including insurance companies. Insurance companies are currently restricted to owning no more than 5 percent of a bank's stock. The bill also would permit direct corporate ownership of insurance companies and direct insurance activities by banks as well as create two new powers for banks, securities and insurance: The new powers would allow banks to merge with securities firms and acquire insurance companies, and they will create a limited power for financial holdings companies to engage in multiple lines of commerce. This would give companies offering both securities and banking products the same protection as banks enjoying a "banker's bank" exemption.
