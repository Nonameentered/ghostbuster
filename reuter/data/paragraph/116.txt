Internet access providers, such as America Online Inc. and the Microsoft MSN service, added subscribers this year, but the rate of growth is declining as the customer base grows larger.  AOL, by far the biggest online provider, had 11.1 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter, right in line with the 11 million it had at the end of the second quarter but up sharply from nine million in 1998.
