The case before the Supreme Court involved John Dunn, a CFTC target, who had been accused of trading foreign currency options. When someone buys an option, he or she has the right to purchase or sell a set amount of currency for a fixed rate at a fixed time in the future. This off-exchange transaction was not recognized or regulated by the CFTC, because the commission believed its jurisdiction extended only to futures contracts, not options. Dunn and the banks argued that options trading was covered by the original 1974 law.
