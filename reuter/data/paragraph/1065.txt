The proposal has not been without its critics, however. Some experts have expressed concern that the introduction of new TLDs could erode the value of existing TLDs, such as .com and .org. They argue that if the new TLDs are allocated too freely, there could be an oversupply of names and domains, resulting in a devaluation of the existing TLDs.
