The ruling has been widely praised by those who argue that the CFTC should not have the authority to regulate foreign currency transactions conducted outside US borders. Critics of the CFTC have argued that the agency is overreaching in its jurisdiction and should not be able to regulate activities that have no direct effect on US markets. The Supreme Court's decision supports this view, and could open the door to more foreign currency transactions taking place outside US jurisdiction.
