The Internet currently has nearly 10 million sites using one of seven top-level domains, with 5.5 million using "com" alone. Although the total number of registered sites has increased by 2 million in the past year, growth has been restrained by the shortage of desirable domains. The committee also called for the creation of competing registration services, all of them governed by a not-for-profit organisation known as the Domain Name Clearinghouse.
