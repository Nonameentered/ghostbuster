The FCC said it expects to receive comments on all aspects of Internet access charges, including whether to impose access fees on ISPs. It said it will consider the legal authority it has to do so, as well as issues involving technical capability.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said Tuesday the agency was not endorsing a position on the Internet fee issue. He said the agency's decision would be based on what would be "best for consumers, best for economic growth, best for the development of the Internet."
