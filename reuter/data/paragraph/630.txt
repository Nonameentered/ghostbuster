The debate is part of the continuing clashes between consumers and businesses demanding more secure communications, on one side, and an anxiety by law enforcement to maintain access to encrypted messages, on the other. Encryption scrambles messages, making them unreadable except to those who possess the proper key. The current restrictions, imposed in the early 1990s, only allow companies to export products with relatively weak 64-bit encryption, thwarting them from taking advantage of the stronger 128-bit encryption favored by most foreign nations.  Last year, President Clinton dramatically relaxed restrictions on the export of encryption but maintained a "dual use" system, which essentially requires companies to jump through some export hoops when they send products abroad using encryption.
