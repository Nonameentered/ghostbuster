"We basically heard their frustration," said Commerce Undersecretary William Reinsch. "We are going to try and address some of their issues. â€¦ We'll make some changes, sawing off the bits that don't fit." The regulations released Monday reflect the government's intention to let U.S. companies export certain encryption products. But an industry alliance that includes giants such as Microsoft Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. blasted the rules as unworkable and confusing and said Wednesday it is prepared to go to Congress to get changes. "We are incredibly frustrated with the agencies involved in crafting the regulations," said David Smiroldo, spokesman for the Business Software Alliance. "The regulations were so complex and in some cases so illogical that you couldn't actually comply with them."
