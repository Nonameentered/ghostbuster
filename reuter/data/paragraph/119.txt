The Harris survey said the lion's share of Internet users, some 23 million, accessed the Internet directly through online services. Some nine million used commercial Internet service providers such as AT&amp;T, while two million accessed the Internet through place of employment, the survey reported. Americans were spending slightly less time online than six months ago, according to the poll.
