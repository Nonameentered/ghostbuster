Analysis The Federal Reserve's decision to deny the Justice Department's request serves as a critical reminder of the need for financial institutions to properly weigh privacy, security, and regulatory accountability when developing potential mechanisms for lending. By rebuffing the government's proposal, the Fed is enforcing the legal requirements and standards in place to protect personal data and ensure the protection of individual rights. At the same time, the decision serves as a roadblock for the Biden administration's broader efforts to restore anti-discrimination safeguards. The government's proposal was seen as a way to hold financial institutions accountable and to identify any lingering discrimination in US banking. By rejecting the request, the Federal Reserve highlighted the need to prove that any data collection mechanisms have clear objectives and would not pose a risk to personal data privacy.
