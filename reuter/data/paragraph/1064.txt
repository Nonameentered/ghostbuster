The introduction of new TLDs is also expected to resolve trademark disputes, which have been a growing concern for businesses and organizations. Trademark disputes occur when two or more businesses claim the same name or domain, which can lead to lengthy legal battles and costly settlements. The new TLDs will provide businesses with a wider range of naming options, reducing the likelihood of such disputes.
