The answer to the question is that it depends on many things.  It depends on the laws of California, Canada, and England, as well as any applicable federal laws.  It will also depend on the laws of any other jurisdictions that may be applicable.  Additionally, the terms of the contract between the seller and the buyer will also be relevant.  If the terms specify that the laws of a particular jurisdiction or country are applicable, then those laws will take precedence.
