Caucus co-chairman Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said he looked forward to the day the government could step in to protect against activities on the Internet such as software piracy and encryption control. "What we lack isn't a general consensus on the importance of the Internet, it's the strategies to protect it," Torricelli said.
