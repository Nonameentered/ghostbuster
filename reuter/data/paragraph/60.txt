The laws that govern the transaction depend on a number of factors, including where the company is located, where the consumer is located, and what type of transaction is taking place. In the case of the company in California selling a book to a consumer in Canada from a web site hosted in England, the laws would be a combination of international laws, state laws (in California and Canada), and federal laws. For example, the transaction may be subject to different tax laws, different laws regarding trade and commerce, and different laws regarding consumer protection. Additionally, the transaction may involve the laws of the country where the web site is hosted, such as laws regarding intellectual property rights, privacy, or fraud.
