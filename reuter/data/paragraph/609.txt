The D'Amato bill would remove restrictions on commercial entities owning financial companies. The firms could own no more than 25 percent of a financial business smaller than themselves, but they could own up to 10 percent of a larger firm. The Roukema bill goes further than the Leach to control such ownership. Commercial companies could own up to 10 percent of a financial services firm, but no more than 5 percent of any subsidiary of the firm. This would more closely limit a bank, for instance, from being controlled by a commercial firm.
