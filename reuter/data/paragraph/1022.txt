Supporters of the proposal argue that it could drive innovation in the financial sector and lead to better outcomes for consumers. For example, the increased competition from new entrants could lead to lower fees and improved services. Furthermore, banks could take advantage of new technologies, such as AI and big data, to offer more personalized services to their customers. This could help to improve financial inclusion, as new services become available to those who are currently underserved by the traditional banking system.
