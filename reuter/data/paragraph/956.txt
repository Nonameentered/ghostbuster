The bill includes provisions to consolidate the regulatory agencies that oversee banks, securities firms, and insurers, as well as provisions to increase the transparency and accountability of these agencies. For example, the bill would create a single regulator for all federally insured banks, reducing the number of federal regulators from five to three.
