The new report, written by Jonathan Sallet, a partner in the Washington office of law firm Hogan & Hartson and former legal advisor at the FCC, challenges the phone company claims. Sallet concluded that phone companies have not introduced any new technology or architecture to handle the surge in Internet traffic onto their networks. "For now, our assessment is that it doesn't appear that the telephone companies have had to bear a significant cost burden in providing Internet access services," Sallet said.
