The FCCâ€™s proposed plan would reduce the access fees that incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) charge long-distance phone service providers to use their networks to complete calls. The access fees, also known as Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, are currently set at a fixed rate of 26.5% of long-distance call charges. The proposed reduction would lower this rate to 14.8% for interstate calls and 20% for intrastate calls, bringing the fees in line with modern industry standards.
