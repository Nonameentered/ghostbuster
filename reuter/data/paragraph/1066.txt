Despite these concerns, the IIG remains optimistic about the potential benefits of the new TLDs. According to the group, the introduction of new TLDs will provide businesses with greater flexibility in naming their websites, and will allow them to choose names that are more relevant to their brand and identity. The new TLDs will also provide a boost to the overall Internet economy, as more businesses and organizations will be able to establish an online presence and reach out to a wider audience.
