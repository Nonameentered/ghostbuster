The proposal, advanced by Undersecretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Hawke, would repeal literally all existing barriers between banking, insurance and securities businesses. Under the plan, a single entity would be allowed to own a bank, a securities firm and an insurance company and conduct any of those activities from one set of offices. It would also allow non-financial companies to own and operated U.S. banks. Detroit's General Motors Corp., for instance, could open a car-loan financing subsidiary.
