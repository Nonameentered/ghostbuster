Critics believe the fees -- which make up about 40 percent of all long-distance charges -- are excessive, because they have not been changed since 1984, even though costs have fallen.  The regulation of long-distance rates and access fees has become increasingly complex as the telecommunications industry rapidly changes. With its notice, the FCC proposed to become more active in setting the fees that long-distance companies pay to local service providers for the right to use their networks. Currently, the fees are based on federal and state regulations and tariffs. The prospect of long-distance rates being slashed sent telephone stocks into a sharp decline Tuesday, including in Amsterdam, where KPN stock fell nearly 6 percent.
