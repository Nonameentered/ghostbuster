Under the proposed plan, businesses would be able to choose any name for the addresses, rather than having to obtain permission from a central authority as is currently the case with .com, .org and .net addresses. The new top-level domains could then include general interest domains, such as .web, .arts and .info, and geographical domain names, such as .eu for Europe and .asia for Asia.
