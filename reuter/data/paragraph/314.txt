In October, the Internet Society formed the International ad hoc Committee on domain names to consider expanding the number of names available. The committee agreed that the Network Solutions monopoly should be terminated as soon as possible.  Currently, if 10 people want to use the same name for a website, only one can register for it and the other nine must choose different names or negotiate with the holder of the name.
