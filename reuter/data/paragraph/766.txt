In addition to the financial repercussions, experts warn that participation in pyramid schemes can have lasting psychological effects. According to an article in The Atlantic, victims of pyramid schemes often experience feelings of guilt and shame as a result of their decisions. Participants can also become resentful of family and friends, who they may feel were in on the scheme but didnâ€™t inform them. This can lead to a loss of trust and the breakdown of relationships.
