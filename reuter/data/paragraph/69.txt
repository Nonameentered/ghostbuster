The restrictions sought by Congress and other governments here and abroad, could hamper growth of the industry, some experts warn. "We all understand the value of broader consumer protection but we don't want it to come at the expense of our ability to reach new markets," said Wendy Melillo, vice president of business affairs at News2U, an Internet broadcast firm. "We don't want legislation to inhibit our ability to expand their products." The industry is working with Congress to prevent any laws that would unduly restrict online commerce. "We are trying to work out a rational, self-regulatory scheme rather than put something into law," said Mike Godwin, staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "We don't want to have the Congress set up another big, unwieldy bureaucracy to just rubber-stamp what the marketplace is doing." Longstanding labor laws also govern the hiring of independent contractors or outsourced workers. As online firms contract out more work, they should make sure they avoid potential legal problems with unpaid overtime or minimum-wage regulations, said David C. Vladeck, a Washington attorney and professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.
