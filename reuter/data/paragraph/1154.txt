The case has received significant attention from both sides, with banks and credit unions launching advertising campaigns to sway public opinion. The ABA has argued that credit unions are “creeping into banking territory,” and that allowing them to expand their field of membership would lead to unfair competition and less choice for consumers. Credit unions, meanwhile, have countered that the ABA is simply trying to protect its own interests, and that expanding their field of membership is a necessary step in keeping up with the changing financial landscape.
