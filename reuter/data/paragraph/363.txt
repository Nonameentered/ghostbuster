The proposed changes to the access charges, which would need to be approved after a comment period, would take effect on April 1. The notice of proposed rule-making seeks to resolve a debate over two approaches to cutting fees. The one endorsed by the FCC would combine elements of both.  Under the so-called "market-driven approach," intrastate access charges would be frozen at their current levels until customers have sufficient choices in the local telephone market. At that point, the access fees could be cut by a formula based on a complex system of rate averaging.
