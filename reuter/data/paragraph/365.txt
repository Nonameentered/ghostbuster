The agency also proposed eliminating access charges between local service providers and wireless companies but left unchanged local-to-local access fees.  The FCC proposed to protect rural phone service providers from the effects of lower access fees by allowing rural and small companies to ask for subsidies. A portion of the long-distance fees paid by AT&amp;T, MCI WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. would be set aside to help cover the costs of providing phone service to rural and underserved areas.
