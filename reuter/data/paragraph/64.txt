"The federal government should not jerk the reins on the Internet," said Jeff Richards, a partner at law firm Heller, Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco, which markets a wide range of legal services for online companies. "But it could set guidelines and provide [state] governments with leeway to [develop] new laws on a case-by-case basis." Nevertheless, some rules are slowing emerging. Earlier this month, President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act, which restricts online access to minors, streamlines cellular phone industry regulation and helps fund schools' Internet connections. The law outweighs the much debated Communications Decency Act, which was struck down as unconstitutional last summer.  Administrative bodies at the federal and state level have cracked down on certain activities they deem illegal. The Federal Trade Commission has ordered six online marketers to immediately halt a scheme in which "spammers" sneaked advertising onto an unsuspecting user's Web site. Four states have sued online cigarette retailers for disregarding a 1992 law that prohibits shipments of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco items through the mail.
