"Transactions in foreign currency are exempt from CFTC jurisdiction," argued Richard Cooper, an attorney for one of Dunn's funds. He argued that a plain reading of the Treasury Amendment exempted all transactions, not just those involving actual foreign currency. Banks, utilities and energy companies -- all of which engage in foreign currency and other transactions covered by the amendment -- agree with Cooper's interpretation. "We talk to many people in the industry and it is our understanding that the implications of the case could extend much further," said Lynelee Brown, a lawyer with Heller Financial, a Chicago-based lender. "It could affect companies in the energy industry and all those firms that issue government securities." Bankers and energy companies, in briefs to the Supreme Court, said that ruling in favor of the CFTC would force them to move much of their operations overseas to avoid CFTC regulation.
