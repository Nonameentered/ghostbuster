The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of 29 member countries including the United States and Japan, is at the heart of world commerce and is attempting to overcome disagreements over how much governments should regulate encryption, a technology used to scramble data and protect privacy, business and government secrets. The negotiation over encryption policy has been a high priority at the OECD, particularly for the United States, which wants to limit export overseas of strong data-scrambling technologies without a way for government authorities to unscramble the code.
