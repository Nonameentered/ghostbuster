In 1982, the National Credit Union Administration, which regulates federally chartered credit unions, decided to allow the unions to encompass multiple occupational and geographical groups. This policy change allowed the unions to nearly quadruple in size from about 1 million members in 1982 to about 3.6 million members today.
