The Comptroller of the Currency last Wednesday indicated it may preempt and override a Rhode Island law that bankers say discriminates against them in favor of other insurance sellers. The Rhode Island measure, which takes effect April 1, requires companies selling insurance to register with the state, pay a fee and adhere to certain training and consumer disclosure rules. But it also requires that bank personnel involved exclusively in banking activities, such as loan origination, must not sell insurance. Insurance sold by banks must be separate from any banking activities, the measure said.  The Comptroller's Office said that the Rhode Island law may interfere with national banks' ability to offer insurance products. It asked for public comment and can pre-empt the state law if it is found to be unduly burdensome.
