The International Internet Group (IIG) has recently proposed seven new top-level domains (TLDs) in an effort to increase the number of available Internet addresses and resolve trademark disputes. The seven domains include .shop, .web, .site, .app, .blog, .book, and .music. The proposal comes as a response to the growing pressure on the current TLDs, which are running out of available addresses.
