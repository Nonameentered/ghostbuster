The Comptroller's Office sought comment from the public on whether it should preempt the Rhode Island law. The American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and several other organizations wrote to the office, urging an override.  The industry groups said a limited preemptin is appropriate because the Rhode Island law discriminates against national banks.  "The legislation clearly has the effect of preventing national banks from competing in Rhode Island on a levelplayig field with insurance agents," said Robert D. McIntyre, a senior vice president at the American Bankers Association.
