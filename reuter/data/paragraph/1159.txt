The case, Manhattan Regional Agency LLC v. United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was brought by a New York-based financial services company that had been accused by the CFTC of illegally trading in foreign currencies. The company, which argued that the CFTC had overstepped its authority, challenged the agency's jurisdiction, prompting the Supreme Court to take up the case. The court ultimately decided the case on two questions: does the CFTC have the jurisdiction to regulate foreign currency transactions; and if so, was the CFTC's enforcement of the law in this case appropriate?
