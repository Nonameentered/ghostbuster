Many of the country's community banks have argued that the big banks have an unfair advantage over their smaller rivals. They argue that smaller institutions would not be able to compete with the resources of larger banks, which could engage in riskier activities without fear of repercussions. Additionally, some have suggested that the repeal would lead to further consolidation in the banking sector, with larger institutions dominating the market and limiting consumer choice.
