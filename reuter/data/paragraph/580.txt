Under the proposal, companies would have to sell assets and divest businesses exceeding a certain threshold, perhaps 30 percent, the people said. They added that the plan may not set an upper limit on how much a firm can do in the non-financial sectors.

The groups fear that conglomerates could gain pricing power that could be used to take over banks paying below market rates for deposits.
