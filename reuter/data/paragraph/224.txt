Representatives from America Online, Microsoft, Netscape Communications and Compaq Computer were in the crowded conference room, Reinsch said. "They wanted to make sure we understood their view and that we heard them," he said. Industry representatives said the changes likely to be made to the draft rules were incremental, not dramatic. "It looks like we're going to see the same approach," said Oscar Hsu, a security analyst at IDC Research. "It's a progress but it's not a giant step because there is no belief yet that if you don't have key recovery you don't ship the product." Industry's primary complaint against the draft rules was that the government's requirements for key recovery support, a form of access control, were vague. While the other companies did not publicly commit to changes in their plans for encryption products, AOL said it would "respect" the administration's export policies. "We look forward to working with the government to ensure that our members have access to necessary and appropriate encryption technology, while recognizing the government's legitimate security interests," AOL said in a statement.
