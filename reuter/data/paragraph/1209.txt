At the heart of the case is the question of whether the CFTC has the power to impose these regulations on the industry. The banks argue that the agency has overstepped its bounds and that the regulations are too burdensome and will hinder their ability to compete in the market. They also argue that the regulations will force them to reduce the number of trades they conduct, which will reduce liquidity in the market and could potentially lead to higher costs for consumers.
