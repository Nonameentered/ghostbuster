At the heart of the case is the National Credit Union Administration’s (NCUA) decision to allow credit unions to serve a larger “field of membership” in states where they have a small presence, as long as they have a “reasonable connection” to the area. This decision has been under attack by the American Bankers Association (ABA), which argues that the NCUA has overstepped its authority and that the expanded field of membership gives credit unions an unfair advantage.
