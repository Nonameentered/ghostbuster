The IAHC recommends limiting the number of prefered generic top-level domains to seven - .com, .net, .org, .int, .firm, .store and .web. The proposed .web and .store domains are not currently used. The panel also proposed that a new body, the Domain Nam Supporting Organisation, be created to help police the Internet addresses and authorise new firms to handle registrations. The body would include representatives from business, technical and intellectual property organisations and be linked to the Internet Society.
