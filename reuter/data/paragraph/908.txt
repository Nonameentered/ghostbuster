For example, if Africa acquires its TLD, it will likely have a profound impact on how the world perceives the African continent and its entire online sphere. As Roberto Gaetano, a member of the ICANN Board of Directors, stated, "The expansion of TLDs will be a catalyst for innovation and will allow developing countries to have a greater presence on the internet."
