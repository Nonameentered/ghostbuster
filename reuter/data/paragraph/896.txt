The task force's proposal recommends the introduction of seven new TLDs: .blog, .shop, .app, .music, .film, .design, and .tech. These TLDs are intended to complement the existing generic TLDs (.com, .org, etc.) with which they will coexist and help to create a more dynamic and diverse online landscape.
