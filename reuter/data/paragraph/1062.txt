The IIG, which is composed of representatives from various Internet companies and organizations, is proposing a new model for the management of the TLDs. Under the proposed model, the IIG will oversee the allocation of new TLDs and ensure that they are assigned fairly and transparently. The IIG will also set up a resolution center to deal with trademark disputes and other issues that may arise.
