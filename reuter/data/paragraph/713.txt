The lawsuit, which pits banks against credit unions, is being followed closely in the banking industry and by consumer groups, which argue that credit unions provide lower-cost services than do banks.  At issue is whether the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which regulates federal credit unions, had the authority to allow credit unions to join together members from distinct groups into "multi-group" unions.  Banks have argued that the law Congress originally passed creating credit unions only allowed a single group of people to band together in a credit union. To permit multi-group credit unions was to let them compete unfairly in the banking industry, the banks stated.  But in its appeal to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department argued that multi-group credit unions actually encourage competition among banks by providing a banking alternative for those not easily served by banks.
