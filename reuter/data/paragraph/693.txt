"The challenge of modern financial regulation is to modernise the regulatory system without compromising the safety and soundness of the system," Greenspan said.  Greenspan warned, however, that while "for the vast majority of firms, competition has provided an adequate shield against serious losses," not all financial disasters can be prevented. To guard against such disasters, he said, required "a concerted effort by the entire financial system to contain those relatively few losses that can become systemic."  Greenspan likened the role of financial regulators to the containment of a nuclear reaction. "In a financial system, the containment barrier is the set of regulations that have evolved over the years."
