"The guide does not dictate a single 'model' policy that governments should adopt," said the draft distributed to journalists, which is expected to be approved late this month.  Rather, it is intended to help countries identify the public interests involved, review their own needs, and decide how best to "regulate and promote the use of encryption." In many areas, the draft report stops short of endorsing administration policy. On U.S. efforts to persuade other countries to adopt its key recovery system -- which provides the government with certain access to decode scrambled messages -- the guidelines simply suggest that governments consider such a system.
