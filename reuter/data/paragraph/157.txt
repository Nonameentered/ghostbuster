The Treasury Department report found that online enterprises are already subject to the same mix of taxes and exemptions as all other forms of commerce, such as property taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes, income taxes, estate taxes and sales taxes. For example, the department found that buying online is exempted from most telephone taxes, but toll-free telephone calls used to place orders are still subject to the 3 percent federal excise tax.
