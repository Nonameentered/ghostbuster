Encryption products are essential tools for protecting consumer data, improving security, and facilitating commerce around the world. The new rule is intended to ensure they are not misused by foreign governments or malicious actors. It will require companies to acquire a license before exporting items that contain certain types of encryption technology. These include encryption products that have been modified to reduce their security thresholds; products with relatively weak encryption standards; and products whose primary purpose is to obscure data trails. Companies would also be required to obtain licenses for mass market products targeting foreign customers.
