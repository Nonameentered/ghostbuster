In a speech to a congressional joint committee examining amendments to federal financial laws, Greenspan likened the development of new financial products and markets to the birth of nuclear power, which sparked a "craze of nuclear optimism" as energy experts sought to solve global energy needs.  "Years later, the emphasis shifted," he said. "The realization that the chain reaction of nuclear fission, while a source of enormous potential for good, also carried with it sever risks and possible catastrophe." That is analogous to the current state of financial markets, he said. "As the dynamic growth and competitive environment in the complex of financial markets continue, sometimes beyond our understanding, the potential for enhanced economic efficiency is enormous," he said. "But let us not forget that the stability of marketplace operations remains equally important. There can be no doubt that systemic risks will continue to accompany many of the activities occurring in mature markets for some time to come."
