Supramolecular polymers are polymer complexes that are held together via non-covalent intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, metal-ligand interactions, or ionic interactions. Unlike conventional covalent polymers, where molecular chains are bound via strong covalent bonds, the subunits in supramolecular polymers are connected via dynamic non-covalent links. These weaker interactions impart interesting properties to supramolecular polymers, including the ability to respond to and change in response to external stimuli such as temperature, pH, and solvent polarity. 

An example of a supramolecular polymer system that can change in response to external stimuli are polymers formed from ureido-pyrimidone (UPy) units, which self-assemble into polymer chains via quadruple hydrogen bonds between UPy units. These hydrogen bonds are dynamically formed and broken, allowing UPy polymer chains to reorganize and respond to changes in solvent or temperature. For instance, UPy polymers dissolved in a polar solvent at low temperature may form extended hydrogen-bonded chains, but raising the temperature provides enough energy to break these hydrogen bonds, causing the chains to dissociate into individual UPy units. Switching to a nonpolar solvent, the UPy units may then re-assemble into new hydrogen-bonded structures adapted to the nonpolar environment. 

The dynamic nature of the quadruple hydrogen bonds in UPy supramolecular polymers was demonstrated in a study by Folmer et al. (2000), who used NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy to monitor UPy polymer structure in solution. They found that in a polar solvent (CDCl3), UPy monomers assemble into linear stranded polymers with around 5-10 UPy units at 10°C. Raising the temperature to 50°C caused these extended chains to dissociate into individual UPy monomers. However, upon lowering the temperature back to 10°C, the UPy monomers reformed extended stranded polymers, demonstrating reversibility and thermoresponsiveness.

In summary, supramolecular polymers possess properties distinct from those of conventional covalent polymers due their dynamic non-covalent linkages. These linkages allow supramolecular polymers to respond to changes in their environment, reorganizing into new structures adapted to new conditions. The ability for UPy-based supramolecular polymers to reversibly assemble and dissociate in response to temperature changes highlights the dynamic nature of their hydrogen-bonded network. These polymers show great promise for various applications due to their stimuli-responsiveness and ability to undergo reversible conformational changes.
