Human remains provide invaluable insights into life and death in past societies. The skeletal record offers a glimpse into people's lives—their diet, health, activities, and diseases—as well as how their bodies were treated after death. Evidence from formal cemeteries, in particular, yields information on burial practices and beliefs. Yet, there are limitations to what human remains alone can tell us about ancient cultures. The Eastern cemetery of Roman London, for example, reveals aspects of life and death in that city but also highlights the need for caution when interpreting skeletal and mortuary data. 

Established in the 2nd century AD, the Eastern cemetery was the main burial ground for the Roman inhabitants of Londinium for over 400 years. The thousands of skeletons unearthed there paint a picture of health and diet at the time. Most remains show signs of physical stress and malnutrition, as well as infections and diseases like tuberculosis that plagued urban populations. A few individuals, however, display better health and diet, pointing to some social inequality. Isotope analyses indicate that nearly all the deceased were born locally, suggesting London was a stable, long-term community.

The cemetery also yields insights into Roman burial practices. Inhumation in wooden coffins and cremation were both common, with burial goods like pottery or glass bottles sometimes included as grave goods. The use of lead plates to seal tombs, a practice found elsewhere in the Roman world, indicates connections to wider customs. However, most burials lacked any identifying inscriptions, leaving the personal identities of the dead unknown. 

While informative, the human remains from London's Eastern cemetery must be interpreted carefully. Burial practices do not always directly reflect religious beliefs, and we cannot assume this population was uniformly Romanized based on their health or diets. The lack of personal information, moreover, prevents us from determining the exact social status, origins or life experiences of the individuals found there. Additional historical and cultural context is needed to fully understand this skeletal record.

In conclusion, analysis of human remains like those from Roman London's Eastern cemetery provides a glimpse into life, death, and society in the ancient world. However, mortuary practices and skeletal data alone offer an incomplete picture. Caution must be exercised when interpreting remains divorced from their full cultural context. By combiningbioarchaeological evidence with other archaeological, textual and historical records, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the lives—and afterlives—of past peoples.
