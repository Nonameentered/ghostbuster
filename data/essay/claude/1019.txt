The widespread use of the pesticide DDT in the mid-20th century led to devastating effects on populations of predatory birds around the world, including Peregrine Falcons and Eurasian Sparrowhawks in the UK.  DDT was introduced as an agricultural pesticide in the 1940s and was used extensively to control insect populations that threatened crops and transmitted diseases. However, DDT also accumulated in the tissues of animals in the food chain and caused a range of negative impacts, especially on predatory birds at the top of the food chain. 

In the 1960s, scientists discovered that DDT was causing eggshell thinning and breakage in predatory birds, leading to severe population declines. A seminal experiment conducted by Derek Ratcliffe in the late 1960s measured the effects of DDT on Peregrine Falcon and Sparrowhawk eggshells over time. Ratcliffe collected eggs from museum collections from before DDT use, as well as fresh eggs from currently breeding birds. He found that Peregrine Falcon eggshells had declined in thickness by up to 20% between 1947 and 1967, and Sparrowhawk eggshells had declined by up to 38% between 1954 and 1967. These declines in eggshell thickness correlated directly with increasing concentrations of DDE, the breakdown product of DDT, in the birds’ tissues. The thinner and more fragile eggshells were breaking under the weight of incubating parents, resulting in reproductive failure and rapid population declines. 

Ratcliffe’s experiment was groundbreaking in providing a direct link between the use of DDT, accumulation of DDE in predatory birds, declining eggshell thickness, and population declines. His work was instrumental in spurring countries to ban the use of DDT, including in agricultural use in the UK in 1984. Since the DDT ban, Peregrine Falcon and Eurasian Sparrowhawk populations have begun to recover in the UK and numbers have returned to near or at pre-DDT levels in recent decades.

In conclusion, Derek Ratcliffe’s experiment conclusively proved that DDT exposure caused a disastrous thinning of eggshells in Peregrine Falcons and Sparrowhawks in the UK. By directly measuring eggshell thickness over time, his work demonstrated the mechanism by which DDT decimated populations of these predatory birds. His research was a critical factor in bans of DDT that have allowed for the recovery of these birds of prey. Ratcliffe’s experiment stands as a seminal case study in conservation biology and the impacts of pesticides on wildlife.
