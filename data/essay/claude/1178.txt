There are several potential risks to mailing smoked salmon that must be mitigated to ensure food safety and quality. The most significant risks are related to temperature abuse and spoilage during transit. Smoked salmon is a perishable food that must be kept refrigerated to limit the growth of bacteria. If the salmon is left at room temperature for too long during mailing and delivery, it can spoil and become unsafe to eat. 

To mitigate these risks, it is essential that the salmon is kept as cold as possible during the entire mailing process. This starts with properly chilling the salmon to 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below before packing and shipping. The salmon should then be packed with ice or ice packs in an insulated container like a Styrofoam box. The container should be clearly marked 'perishable' and 'keep refrigerated.' It may also help to include handling instructions on the package directing anyone delivering or transporting the box to keep it refrigerated at all times.

Another risk is physical damage to the fish during transit that could affect quality or introduce contaminants. To reduce this risk, the salmon should be securely wrapped, preferably in vacuum sealed bags, before placing in the insulated container. Wrap or packing material should fill any empty space in the container so the bags of salmon do not shift around. Clearly mark the box as 'fragile' in addition to the temperature warnings. 

Following these best practices—properly chilling the salmon, packing it with ice in an insulated container, securely wrapping the fish, and clearly marking the package with instructions—can help mitigate the risks of temperature abuse and damage during mailing smoked salmon. The salmon will have the best chance of arriving at its destination at peak freshness and safety. With the proper precautions taken, mailing smoked salmon can be done successfully with minimal risks to the food or the consumer. But it is critical that temperature control is maintained throughout the entire process.
