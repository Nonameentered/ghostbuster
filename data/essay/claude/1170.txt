Obesity rates have been climbing steadily over the past few decades, even as average daily calorie intake has declined in many countries. This seeming paradox can be explained by several factors, including changes in lifestyle and genetics. Our lifestyle today is far more sedentary than in the past, and we do not burn as many calories through physical activity as we used to. While genetics plays a role in the development of obesity for some individuals, lifestyle changes are needed to counteract it for most of the population. Regular physical activity is crucially important for both preventing and treating obesity. 

Our modern lifestyle is largely the culprit for rising obesity rates. Cheap, convenient, and highly processed fast food, snacks, and sugary beverages are more readily available now, and we eat more of them. Portion sizes have also increased dramatically. At the same time, we live increasingly sedentary lifestyles, spending many hours each day sitting—while commuting, working at desks, watching TV, and using phones or computers. This combination of poor diet and physical inactivity creates an “energy imbalance” where we consume more calories than we burn, leading to weight gain over time. While daily energy intake has declined slightly in some countries, it is still above levels required for most people based on their activity levels.

For some individuals, genetics contributes significantly to the risk of obesity. Certain genes have been linked to a higher likelihood of weight gain and difficulty losing weight. However, genes do not directly cause obesity on their own. Lifestyle and environment still determine whether someone becomes obese or not. Genetics may make weight management more challenging for certain people, but balancing energy intake and expenditure can still overcome genetic predispositions. Obesity rates have risen too quickly in recent decades for genetics alone to be the cause. Lifestyle changes remain key.

Regular physical activity is one of the most important tools we have for addressing obesity. Exercise helps create an energy deficit by burning calories and building metabolism-boosting muscle. It also leads to numerous other health benefits like improved cardiovascular health, strength, endurance, and mental well-being. For weight loss, a mixture of cardio exercise and strength training works best. Public health initiatives promoting active transportation, access to recreational facilities, and physical education can make it easier for people to be active.

In summary, despite a slight decline in average daily calories, obesity levels continue to rise due to major lifestyle changes. While genetics play a role for some, diet and exercise are still the most significant determinants of obesity for most people. Promoting active lifestyles and balanced nutrition are some of the most promising strategies for overcoming this urgent public health problem. Physical activity in particular should be a key part of approaches both for preventing and treating obesity.
