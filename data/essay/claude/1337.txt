What recent discoveries have challenged the traditional view of 'ritual landscapes' and what implications do they have for our understanding of prehistoric societies?

The traditional view of prehistoric 'ritual landscapes' was that specific sites were designated exclusively for ritual or ceremonial activity and were separate from other spheres of activity. Recent discoveries in archaeology have challenged this notion and revealed a more integrated and complex understanding of these landscapes. Rather than being isolated from settlements and daily life, ritual sites were intrinsically tied into the wider social and cultural landscape.

One example that challenges the traditional view is Stonehenge in England. For decades, Stonehenge was seen as a ritual site solely used for ceremonial purposes. However, recent excavations have revealed that it was part of a much larger complex of monuments and settlements. At Stonehenge, archaeologists found that people inhabited the area as early as 3100 BCE and that the monument was built gradually over centuries. The earliest phase of wood posts and pits gave way to massive stones being erected, but throughout people occupied the area. This shows that rather than an isolated ritual site, Stonehenge was at the center of a settled cultural landscape for generations. 

Discoveries at other European sites also point to more complex understandings of these landscapes. For instance, at the ritual monument complex at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, archaeologists found that in addition to the massive limestone pillars, smaller residential buildings were interspersed throughout the site, indicating that people not only traveled to the site for ritual events but inhabited the space. The site was not solely a ritual center but an integral part of the cultural landscape, tying ritual practice to daily life.

In the Americas, recent work at the ancient city of Cahokia in Illinois provides another example. Cahokia was a populous city from 700 to 1400 CE and home to massive earthen mounds, the largest of which is over 100 feet high. The mounds were long seen solely as ritual or ceremonial structures. However, new research shows that the mounds were intertwined with residential areas and daily life. Residential housing and craft production were found directly adjacent to mounds, and the mounds themselves were built gradually over centuries by locals residing in the area. Like at Göbekli Tepe and Stonehenge, ritual sites were fundamentally integrated into the lived experience of the population.

These new insights reveal that prehistoric ritual landscapes were not isolated or strictly ceremonial. Rather, they were fully integrated into the cultural and social fabric, built gradually over generations, and connected to residences, craft production, and daily life. A strict separation of the ritual and the mundane is a false dichotomy. For prehistoric societies, ritual practice shaped and was shaped by all aspects of life. This challenges notions of rituals as isolated or distinct from normal life and shows how fully integrated and gradually evolving these landscapes were - constructed by generations over centuries of cultural activity, both ceremonial and quotidian. Our understanding of prehistoric societies as a whole is enriched by recognizing the complex relationships between ritual sites, daily life, and the wider inhabited landscape.
