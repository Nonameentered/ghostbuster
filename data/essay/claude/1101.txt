After Nero's suicide in AD 68, Rome entered a chaotic period known as the Year of the Four Emperors. In this year, four menâ€”Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian, seized imperial power. Vespasian ultimately triumphed, establishing the Flavian dynasty that would rule Rome for 27 years. Vespasian's successful bid for power came in three main stages: 1) gaining military support, 2) securing allies in the Senate and provinces, and 3) defeating rival Vitellius.

First, Vespasian needed the backing of legions to have a chance at becoming emperor. He was the governor of Judaea during the First Roman-Jewish War, commanding three legions. According to Tacitus, Vespasian's soldiers proclaimed him emperor on July 1, AD 69. The legions of Moesia, Pannonia, and Illyricum soon joined them. Vespasian now had the military strength to make a bid for Rome.

Second, Vespasian worked to gain allies and political support. He needed the Senate's recognition to legitimize his claim to power. Vespasian's brother Sabinus and ally Mucianus helped rally senators to his cause. Many provincial governors also backed Vespasian, giving him control over Egypt, Africa, and likely Hispania and Britannia. Seeing Vespasian's strength, the Senate formally recognized him as emperor.

Finally, Vespasian moved against his rival Vitellius, who had seized power months before. Vitellius had the support of legions in Germania and Gaul, but proving to be an ineffective and cruel ruler. As Vespasian's forces marched into Italy from the east, legions in northwestern provinces and Moesia defected to Vespasian. The final blow came when Vespasian's army under Mucianus captured Rome. Vitellius was killed, defeating the last challenge to Vespasian's rule. 

In conclusion, Vespasian's bid for power had three critical stages: gaining legions' support, winning over Senators and provincial governors, and defeating his rival Vitellius. With sufficient military strength and political alliances, Vespasian was able enter Rome, claim power, and found the stable Flavian dynasty. His success in the Year of Four Emperors shows the importance of these three factors in gaining imperial power in Rome.
