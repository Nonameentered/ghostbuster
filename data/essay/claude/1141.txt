Gladiators were immensely popular in the Ancient Roman world. They were professional fighters who battled each other, slaves, prisoners, beasts or other dispatched combatants in large arenas and auditoriums for the entertainment of audiences. Gladiatorial combat began around the 3rd century BC as a part of funeral rituals and offerings to the dead. However, over time it evolved into elaborate public spectacles. 

There were several reasons why gladiatorial combat and gladiators themselves gained such widespread popularity in Ancient Rome. First, the Romans admired physical courage, bravery and martial skills. Gladiators displayed these virtues in their fighting. They willingly faced death and injury, and the crowds cheered on the brave and courageous fighters. The spectators also enjoyed watching the technical fighting skills and physical prowess of the gladiators. Gladiators were highly trained and specialized in a particular style of combat and weaponry. They exhibited a level of skill and mastery over their craft that the crowds appreciated.

Second, the spectacles of gladiatorial combat fulfilled a human desire for excitement and thrill. The fights were highly charged, dangerous events where blood was spilled and life and death hung in the balance. There was an element of uncertainty regarding the outcome of a match which built suspense. The roaring crowds, exotic animals and staged spectacles combined to create an adrenaline-fueled environment. For the spectators, it was a form of escapism and entertainment.

A third reason was the spectacle and pageantry surrounding the events. The gladiatorial shows were highly ritualized with an emphasis on ceremony, costumes and staging. They were a diversion from everyday life. Exotic animals and elaborate sets were utilized to heighten the drama. There were also underlying themes of life and death that resonated with religious and cultural beliefs. The shows were a display of wealth and generosity, as they were expensive to put on, and the sponsors gained status and popularity from hosting them.

In conclusion, gladiatorial combat was immensely popular for a combination of reasons - it celebrated virtues the Romans admired, fulfilled a human desire for excitement, and was a spectacular form of entertainment and pageantry. Although brutal by today's standards, for the Romans it highlighted cultural values and was a source of thrill and diversion. The popularity of gladiators reflects some eternal aspects of human nature that continue to manifest today in our fascination with competitive sports and reality television.
