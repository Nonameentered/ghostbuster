There are several challenges facing horticultural weed management in the European Union due to the Plant Protection Products Directive, which banned or restricted the use of many synthetic herbicides. Producers must now implement integrated weed management strategies that minimize reliance on chemical herbicides by utilizing a combination of modified tillage and cropping practices, timing of weeding, and maximizing crop competitiveness.

Tillage and cropping practices have a significant impact on weed populations and the need for herbicide applications. Reduced tillage systems that minimize soil disturbance, such as no-till or zone tillage, can allow weeds to become established more easily since their seeds remain near the soil surface. While reduced tillage has many environmental and soil health benefits, additional weed control measures are required. In contrast, occasional deep plowing can bury weed seeds deep within the soil and prevent them from germinating. However, deep plowing also disrupts soil structure and should only be performed when necessary for weed control.   

Crop rotation is an important cultural control for weeds. By rotating between crop families, the weed community cannot become dominated by species that thrive in a particular crop. For example, rotating between cruciferous crops and legumes prevents mustards and clovers from becoming problematic. Additionally, fall cover cropping or intercropping provides weed suppression through shading and competition. Once cover crops are harvested or terminated, they provide an organic mulch that can further suppress weeds, especially when rolled to form a dense mat.

The timing and frequency of weeding activities also has a major impact on weed populations. It is important to control weeds early in the season when they are small, as this requires less effort and causes less damage to crops. Weeds should be hoed, pulled, or cut down before they produce seeds to prevent additions to the seedbank. Frequent scouting and weeding, especially during the critical period of competition early in the season, provides the most effective control. Weeds are also easiest to remove when soil is moist, as roots can be detached more readily.

Maximizing crop competitiveness through plant spacing, shading, and rapid establishment is a key strategy for weed suppression. Close spacing, dense plant stands, and crops that produce a leaf canopy early in the season prevent light from reaching weed seedlings. Crops that establish quickly after planting and produce an early, dense canopy, such as summer squash, cucumbers, and snap beans, are very effective for natural weed control through shading. Wider crop row spacing provides more opportunities for weeds to become established, so narrow, evenly-spaced rows should be used when possible. 

In summary, the Plant Protection Products Directive has restricted the availability of many synthetic herbicides, requiring producers to implement alternative weed control strategies. An integrated approach utilizing modified tillage and cropping practices, proper timing of weeding activities, and maximizing crop competitiveness through shading and plant spacing can effectively control weeds while limiting reliance on herbicides. By combining multiple weed suppression tactics, the impact of any one approach is enhanced, resulting in more sustainable, long-term weed management.
