Descartes' aim in the Meditations on First Philosophy is to establish a firm foundation for knowledge that is certain and indubitable. He seeks to achieve this by systematically subjecting all of his beliefs and assumptions to radical doubt. Descartes wants to find some proposition that is immune to doubt and that can serve as the bedrock upon which he can build a system of knowledge. 

In the First Meditation, Descartes subjects all of his sensory experiences and perceptions to doubt. He notes that the senses can deceive us, as in the case of optical illusions or the effects of psychotropic drugs. Dreams can also seem utterly realistic and lifelike. Since there is no sure way to distinguish waking life from a dream, Descartes concludes he cannot trust his senses to provide certain knowledge.

Descartes also doubts his cognitive abilities and the thoughts produced by his mind. He notes that he has made intellectual errors in the past, and that his judgments are often flawed or imperfect. Moreover, there may be an omnipotent God who has created him with a nature prone to cognitive error and false judgments. Alternatively, an evil demon may be actively deceiving him and causing him to err. For these reasons, Descartes concludes he cannot rely on his mental faculties alone to arrive at certain knowledge. 

Having subjected all of his ordinary beliefs to radical doubt, Descartes searches for some proposition that can withstand doubt. He finds that even if he doubts, he must exist as the one doing the doubting. This leads to his famous cogito argument: "I think, therefore I am." His existence as a thinking thing is the first and most foundational item of knowledge that is indubitable.

Descartes then proceeds to rebuild his system of knowledge on this new foundation. To verify other propositions, he relies on clear and distinct perceptions of his intellect and on the goodness of God. Clear and distinct ideas, for Descartes, are those perceptions that are "present and unmistakable" and that "enable him to distinguish between the features that make a perception clear and distinct and those that do not" (Newman 246). Since God is not a deceiver, Descartes trusts that these clear and distinct ideas must accord with reality. This allows him to rationally deduce the distinction between mind and body, the existence of God, and other metaphysical propositions.

In sum, Descartes' aim in the Meditations is to establish a firm foundation for knowledge that can be known with certainty. He achieves this aim through a systematic method of doubt that calls all beliefs into question, until he arrives at the indubitable proposition that he exists as a thinking thing. On this secure basis, he relies on clear and distinct perception and the veracity of God to rationally rebuild knowledge of metaphysics and the world. Descartes thus provides an archetype for modern foundationalist epistemology in his pursuit of certainty and methodical system of knowledge.
