The practice of animal sacrifice was fundamental to ancient Greek religion, dating back to the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1200 BC) and continuing for over a millennium until the spread of Christianity in the Roman period. The earliest evidence of animal sacrifice comes from the Minoan and Mycenaean periods on Crete and mainland Greece. The sacrifice of cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs was a common ritual, as evidenced by animal bones found at Knossos, Mycenae, and other sites. 

The purpose and significance of these early sacrifices is not entirely clear, but they were likely intended to honor and gain the favor of deities to ensure agricultural fertility, success in war, or other benefits. The sacrifices established a gift-giving relationship between mortals and immortals, while also providing an opportunity for communal feasting on the sacrificial meat.

In the Archaic and Classical periods (8th to 5th centuries BC), animal sacrifice became an even more central practice, especially in the large civic centers of Athens and other Greek poleis. Major sanctuaries like the Acropolis in Athens were the sites of frequent blood sacrifices, especially of cattle and sheep. The sacrifices were intricately ritualized, with detailed procedures for the selection, purification, and killing of the animals, and the offering of certain parts like thighs bones and fat to the gods. 

The purpose and meaning of these sacrifices had now expanded. They were still intended to honor the gods, especially during key festivals and prayers for victory in war or good harvests. But they also held a strong social function in fostering community bonds through the communal eating of sacrificial meat. The sacrifices and festivals gave rhythm to community life and reinforced a shared religious identity.

Philosophers like Socrates began critiquing the practice of blood sacrifice,seeing  it as crude and unnecessary. Some started advocating bloodless sacrifices of incense and hymns instead. But for most Greeks, animal sacrifice remained the conventional means of honoring and communing with the gods for centuries. It formed a fundamental part of ancient Greek piety and social life from prehistory through the Classical period. In summary, Greek animal sacrifice served religious, social and community-building functions for over a millennium.
