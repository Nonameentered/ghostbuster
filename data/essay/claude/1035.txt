Quality assurance schemes have had a significant impact on the horticultural industry in recent decades. They aim to increase food safety, sustainability, and quality standards throughout the supply chain, from growers to retailers to consumers. One of the most well-known quality assurance schemes in Europe is EUREPGAP, now GlobalG.A.P. EUREPGAP was established in 1997 in response to growing consumer concerns over food safety, sustainability, and quality. It has developed into a comprehensive set of standards that cover the entire production process for horticultural goods. 

EUREPGAP was founded by several European retailers who sought to harmonize standards for good agricultural practices across countries and growers. Initial standards focused on food safety, requiring producers to implement more systematic approaches for risk assessment, pesticide use, and hygiene. Standards for worker health, safety and welfare were also incorporated early on. Over time, the standards expanded to include environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, and product quality. Today, GlobalG.A.P. aims to ensure sustainability and encourage responsible approaches at each step of the supply chain.

For producers, complying with EUREPGAP standards requires effort and resources, but also provides several benefits. By meeting rigorous, internationally-recognized standards for food safety and sustainability, growers are able to gain preferred supplier status with major retailers. This helps secure their market position and opportunities for business growth. Compliance also minimizes the risk of food safety incidents that could damage consumer trust and sales. Growers benefit from more efficient production processes and potential cost savings from optimized pesticide and fertilizer use. 

For consumers, EUREPGAP certification means greater assurance that the produce they buy is safe, responsibly and sustainably sourced, and meets high quality standards. With increasing disconnect between consumers and food production, quality assurance schemes provide transparency and confidence in the supply chain. They help address consumersâ€™ growing concerns over topics like pesticide use, farm worker welfare, environmental protection, and animal welfare. EUREPGAP certified goods may also gain price premiums from consumers seeking higher quality, more responsibly produced products.

In conclusion, EUREPGAP has brought significant changes to the horticultural industry in Europe by establishing standards for food safety, sustainability, environmental protection and product quality. For both growers and consumers, EUREPGAP certification means reduced risks and more responsible practices along the supply chain. While compliance requires investment, it brings economic benefits through access to major retailers and price premiums. Quality assurance schemes like EUREPGAP will likely continue to shape the future of horticulture as standards are revised to keep pace with scientific knowledge, industry best practices and consumer values.
