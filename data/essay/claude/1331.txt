There is significant evidence for prehistoric hunter-gatherer subsistence from archaeological sites dating to the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods in Europe, the Near East, and elsewhere. Three key sources of evidence are animal bone refuse, hunting methods and tools, and site function. By analyzing these lines of evidence across multiple sites, including Star Carr, Ohalo II, and Lepenski Vir, we can identify trends in subsistence strategies, seasonality, and complexity of hunter-gatherer societies. 

Animal bone refuse left behind at habitation sites provides direct evidence of the species that prehistoric hunter-gatherers hunted and consumed. At the Mesolithic site of Star Carr in England, excavations revealed large amounts of red deer antler and bone. The antler was used to craft various tools, indicating the importance of red deer to the inhabitants. The presence of juvenile red deer bones also shows that the site was occupied in late winter/early spring when the deer gave birth. At Ohalo II, a 23,000-year-old hunter-gatherer site in Israel, animal bones included gazelle, rabbit, tortoise, and fish, demonstrating a diverse diet. The seasonal availability of some species points to occupation in the spring.

Hunting methods and tools also provide information about subsistence strategies and seasonality. Microliths, small stone tools useful for arrows and spears, were found at Star Carr, indicating the inhabitants hunted with projectile weapons. Large pits found at the site may have been used to trap animals, suggesting an efficient mass-hunting approach. At Ohalo II, remains of plant-fiber nets, hooks, and harpoons indicate the inhabitants fished and may have used nets to hunt small game in a complex, coordinated manner. The tool types present at Ohalo II point to a spring/summer occupation.

Site function and organization provide additional evidence of subsistence patterns and societal complexity. Star Carr contains the remains of four wooden structures, though their exact purpose is unclear. The structures, in combination with large amounts of refuse, suggest longer-term occupation, perhaps on a seasonal basis. Ohalo II features the remains of brush huts, hearths, storage pits, and middens. The presence of several huts and storage pits indicates a larger community living together for more than just a brief period. Thus, Ohalo II may represent a longer-term, seasonal occupation by a complex hunter-gatherer society. In contrast, the Mesolithic site of Lepenski Vir in Serbia features hut structures Riverine that were likely only briefly inhabited. The lack of storage pits and limited refuse points to short-term occupation, suggesting a simpler nomadic society.

In conclusion, analysis of prehistoric hunter-gatherer sites provides significant evidence for subsistence strategies, seasonality, and societal complexity. Animal bones, tools, and site features point to systematic hunting, fishing, and foraging by both simple nomadic groups and more complex, semi-sedentary societies. When interpreted together with an understanding of local environments and resources, these lines of evidence offer important insights into lifeways of the earliest prehistoric humans in Europe, the Near East, and beyond.
