There are three main schools of thought concerning Herodotus' historical methods and his relationship to his predecessor Hecataeus. The first view, dominant in the 19th century, saw Herodotus as the "Father of History" who invented a new form of critical, rational, and analytical historical inquiry that was a clear break from the mythical accounts of poets like Homer and mythical genealogists like Hecataeus. The second view, which emerged in the mid-20th century, argued that Herodotus was not as radical a departure from his predecessors and remained grounded in a mythical and poetic mode of thought. The third view, which has become dominant, takes a more balanced perspective, recognizing both Herodotus' rational critical spirit and his continuities with poetic and mythical traditions.

The 19th century view celebrated Herodotus as the first "scientific historian" who approached history with a critical and rational spirit, evaluating sources and considering multiple viewpoints. In this view, Herodotus made a clean break from his predecessor Hecataeus, who represented an uncritical mythical mode of thought. This view sees Herodotus as essentially inventing the genre of critical history. The mid-20th century saw a reaction against this view. Scholars like G.S. Kirk argued that Herodotus was still deeply rooted in poetic and mythical modes of thought, not a radical break from Hecataeus but rather continuous with poetic and mythical storytelling traditions. 

The current dominant view takes a more balanced perspective, recognizing both Herodotus' rational spirit and his ties to poetic tradition. Scholars see Herodotus as innovating and helping to shape critical history, but not as entirely divorcing himself from the mythical and poetic. For example, Herodotus evaluates historical sources and considers multiple sides of stories - hallmarks of critical thinking. However, his work is also filled with mythical, tragic, and poetic elements. Herodotus seems to have tried to rationalize myths rather than just reject them. His relationship to Hecataeus follows a similar pattern: he built upon and developed Hecataeus' work, but also criticized his predecessor and approached history with a more critical spirit.

In conclusion, views on Herodotus' historical methods and relationship to Hecataeus have evolved from seeing him as the "Father of History" who made a clean break with the past to recognizing both his rational, critical innovations and his continuities with poetic and mythical traditions. The current dominant view is that while Herodotus helped pioneer critical history, he remained grounded in and built upon poetic and mythical modes of thought, including the work of Hecataeus. Herodotus emerged as a critical thinker, but not one who divorced himself entirely from the mythical and poetic. This view sees Herodotus as a pivotal figure who helped shape the transition from poetic myth to critical history.
