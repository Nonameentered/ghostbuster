Dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating are two absolute dating methods used in archaeology to determine the age of artifacts and archaeological sites. Absolute dating methods provide a specific date range for artifacts or sites, as opposed to relative dating methods which only provide a sequence of events. Dendrochronology studies the rings of trees to date wood samples, while radiocarbon dating measures the decay of radioactive carbon in organic materials. Both methods have been instrumental in developing archaeological chronologies and understanding human history.

Dendrochronology works by analyzing tree ring patterns. Trees often grow new rings seasonally, with wider rings during optimal growing conditions. As trees age, these rings create patterns that are unique to the climate conditions of the time. By studying a sequence of rings in a tree cross-section, dendrochronologists can determine the approximate year each ring was formed, creating a wood sample chronology. This is possible because trees of the same species growing in the same climate conditions will have very similar ring patterns. Once a chronology has been established for living and dead trees in a region, wood found at archaeological sites can be directly dated by matching its pattern to the reference chronology.   

Dendrochronology is most accurate for samples up to about 10,000 years old, as uncertainties accumulate beyond this. It requires well-preserved wood samples, availability of long-lived tree species, and overlapping lifespans between living and dead trees to create a robust chronology. However, it can provide calendar-year precision, and works for a wide range of geographical areas. Dendrochronology has been instrumental in dating historical structures as well as prehistoric dwellings and artifacts. For example, it has been used to date Native American pueblos in the southwestern United States from AD 400 to 1300.

In contrast, radiocarbon dating measures the decay of radioactive carbon (14C) isotopes to determine the age of organic materials up to about 50,000 years old.  Radiocarbon enters the biosphere through natural processes and living things maintain a constant level of 14C during their lifetimes. However, once an organism dies, carbon uptake stops and radiocarbon levels start to decline as the isotope decays into nitrogen. By measuring the amount of radiocarbon left in an organic sample today, scientists can calculate how long it has been decaying and estimate its age.  

Radiocarbon dating requires small organic samples that were once alive, like wood, paper, cloth, and human or animal remains. It provides less precise dates than dendrochronology, with uncertainties of up to a couple centuries. Radiocarbon dating works best for samples between 500 to 40,000 years old. It revolutionized archaeology by providing a dating method for sites where dendrochronology was not possible. For example, radiocarbon dating was critical in determining the age of Paleolithic cave paintings in Spain and France. Together, dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating cover the time period of human history and prehistory, providing an invaluable tool for understanding our ancient past.
