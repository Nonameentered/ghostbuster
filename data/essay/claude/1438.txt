The dramatic monologue was a form of poetry that became popular in Victorian literature. Poets employed this form to critique social and political issues through the voice of a speaker. By speaking through the voice of a character, the poet could detach themselves from the speaker and explore controversial ideas. Both male and female poets utilized the dramatic monologue, though they often differed in their subject matter and choice of speakers. 

Alfred Tennyson and Robert Browning were two prominent male poets who frequently wrote in the form of dramatic monologue. In poems like “My Last Duchess” and “Porphyria's Lover,” Browning adopted the sinister voice of a male speaker to offer a disturbing glimpse into a violent and patriarchal psyche. Meanwhile, Tennyson employed the form to give voice to marginalized speakers, as in “St. Simeon Stylites” where he speaks through the voice of a lonely ascetic. For these male poets, the dramatic monologue was a way to explore the diversity of human psychology and experience.

Female poets like Augusta Webster also employed the dramatic monologue, though they were more likely to use it as a means of social critique by giving voice to oppressed speakers, especially women. In Webster's poem “A Castaway,” she speaks through the voice of a fallen woman contemplating suicide. The woman reveals how the harsh judgment of society has led her to this desperate point. By using the first-person voice of this oppressed female character, Webster highlights the plight of outcast women in a patriarchal society.  

The form of the dramatic monologue allowed Webster to detach herself from the values and judgments of the speaker. Though she speaks through this woman's voice, Webster does not necessarily endorse her views or claim them as her own. This allows Webster to compassionately represent this woman's oppressed position while also implicitly critiquing the structures of society that lead to such oppression. The reader can recognize the tragedy of her situation without feeling that Webster is declaiming against men or society directly.

In conclusion, the dramatic monologue was used by many Victorian poets, both male and female, to provide social commentary and critique. Specifically, Augusta Webster employed the form to speak through the voice of a female castaway, allowing her to highlight issues of women's oppression in a subtle yet powerful way. While male poets also used the dramatic monologue to provide psychological insight into their characters, female poets were more likely to focus on issues of social justice and give voice to marginalized groups. Overall, the dramatic monologue was a pivotal form that allowed poets to shape their era's evolving ideas about society, politics, gender, and human nature.
