The two prominent theories that attempt to justify state punishment are utilitarianism and retributivism. Utilitarianism justifies punishment on the basis of the social benefits and overall good that it brings about. In contrast, retributivism justifies punishment on the basis that those who commit crimes deserve to be punished as a matter of just deserts. 

The utilitarian theory holds that punishment is justified if the total good produced by it outweighs the total evil. So punishment should aim to deter criminal behavior, rehabilitate the criminal, and protect the public by incapacitating the criminal. If these aims are achieved through punishment at an acceptable cost, then it is justified under utilitarianism. Objections to the utilitarian approach include that it could justify punishing the innocent and disproportionately harsh punishments if it maximized utility. It also ignores the moral desert of the criminal and fails to respect their inherent dignity.

Retributivism justifies punishment not based on its consequences but purely on the culpable wrongdoing of the criminal. So punishment is morally justified because the criminal deserves it as a just response to their crime. The specific form of punishment depends on the severity of the offense and the degree of moral blameworthiness determined by factors such as the criminal's motives and intentions. Some propose a so-called 'implied consent' basis for just deserts, that by committing a crime the criminal consents to being punished. 

However, other theories argue just deserts depends on the harm of the offense - more serious crimes warrant more severe punishment regardless of consent. Limiting retribution theories argue punishment should be proportionate to the crime but not necessarily aim to inflict as much harm as the offense itself. Reconstructive theories view punishment as a means of recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of the victim by restoring the moral balance. They argue punishment levels should reflect this restorative aim, not simply harm.

In conclusion, while utilitarianism justifies punishment consequentially based on its benefit to society, retributivism justifies punishment deontologically based on the inherent moral desert of the criminal. There are various retributive accounts that differ in how they think desert and proportionality should be determined when punishing criminal offenders.
