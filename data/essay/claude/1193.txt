The extraordinary development of computers over the past 75 years has been primarily driven by rapid advances in microprocessor and memory technologies. Microprocessors, which serve as the "brains" of computers, have become exponentially more powerful over time according to Moore's Law. Memory chips have also increased rapidly in capacity and decreased in cost, enabling computers to store and access vast amounts of data. These technological dynamics have fueled the digital revolution and permeated nearly every aspect of the economy and society.  

The first commercial microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971, which contained just 2,300 transistors and could perform 60,000 instructions per second. Today, the latest Intel Core i9 processor has over 10 billion transistors and can perform over 100 trillion instructions per second—an increase of more than four millionfold. This staggering improvement in processing power has been achieved through consistent doubling of the number of transistors in microprocessors about every two years, as predicted by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Transistor counts in microchips have increased at an exponential rate while their costs have dropped exponentially.

Advances in memory chips have followed a similar trajectory. The first commercial DRAM memory chip in 1970 could store just 1 kilobit of data. Today, a single memory card can store up to two terabytes of data—an increase of over 400 millionfold. Memory capacity has exploded while prices have plummeted. In 1970, one kilobit of memory cost over $8,000 in today's dollars. The same amount of memory today costs a tiny fraction of one cent. This has enabled computers to store massive amounts of data that can be accessed nearly instantly.

The combination of vastly more powerful yet affordable microprocessors and memory has fueled the rapid progress of computer performance according to Moore's Law. Early computers could complete only thousands of instructions per second and had little data storage, while today's standard laptops are millions of times faster and more capable. The latest high-end computers used for research can perform hundreds of quadrillions of instructions per second and have access to exabytes of data. Supercomputers used for advanced applications like weather forecasting and nuclear simulations are again orders of magnitude more powerful.

The same technologies that have propelled the incredible growth of computers over the past decades are reaching fundamental physical limits. Transistor sizes are approaching the scale of just a few atoms, and memory components can store only a finite number of bits in a given space. Future progress will require new breakthroughs, such as optical, molecular, and quantum computing. Optical computers would use photons instead of electrons to transfer data and perform calculations at the speed of light, while molecular and quantum computers could harness complex computational abilities inherent at the molecular and subatomic scale. 

Computers have transformed society through their extraordinary power and capabilities, but continued progress in the long run will rely on revolutionary new technologies still on the horizon. While the growth of microprocessor and memory technologies over the past 75 years has been truly remarkable, there are limits to the current paradigm of digital computing that point to fundamentally new types of computers in the coming decades if progress is to continue at its breakneck pace. Overall, the development of computers has been one of the most significant technological revolutions in history, and with new breakthroughs on the frontier of physics and engineering, the digital age is still only in its infancy.
