The onset-rhyme model of syllable structure is an alternative to the more traditional flat structure model. In the flat structure model, syllables are broken down into simple constituents like vowel (V), consonant (C), and sometimes consonant clusters (CC, CCC, etc.). So a word like "cat" would be represented as CVCV. In contrast, the onset-rhyme model divides syllables into two components: the onset which consists of initial consonants, and the rhyme which includes the vowel and any following consonants. So "cat" would be represented as C/at. 

The onset-rhyme model is considered by many linguists to reflect the phonological structure of syllables more accurately. There are a few reasons for this. First, onset and rhyme behave as coherent units in many languages. For example, in English, consonant clusters tend to stay together in onsets but not across the onset-rhyme boundary. We have words like "spray" but not *"psray." Second, onsets and rhymes demonstrate similar phonological behavior within and across languages. For example, consonant deletion more often affects onsets, vowel reduction more often affects rhymes. These patterns occur in many unrelated languages suggesting onsets and rhymes are fundamental to syllable organization.

A third argument for the onset-rhyme model is that it aligns with the intuitions of native speakers. When asked to divide an unfamiliar word into syllables, English speakers tend to break between onset and rhyme rather than within a cluster. For example, they are more likely to divide "trumpet" as "trum/pet" rather than "*tr/um/pet." Together these considerations provide substantial support for the onset-rhyme view of syllable structure.

However, the onset-rhyme model is not without its weaknesses and limitations. One issue is that the division between onset and rhyme is not always clear. In some cases, ambisyllabic consonants seem to belong simultaneously to both onset and rhyme. For example, the /l/ in a word like "middle" acts as the coda of the first syllable but also the onset of the second syllable. Another challenge is the analysis of syllable nuclei that contain both a vowel and consonant, as in the word "little." Here it is not straightforward whether the consonant should be grouped with the onset or rhyme.
