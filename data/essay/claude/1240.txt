The theories of Anthony Giddens and Pierre Bourdieu have had a significant impact on archaeology and how archaeologists understand past societies. Giddens’ Structuration Theory and Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and field provide theoretical frameworks for analyzing how social structures shape individual actions and vice versa. While Giddens and Bourdieu's theories overlap in considering the recursive relationship between structure and agency, they also differ in their emphasis. Bourdieu focuses more on how an individual's habitus is shaped by their positioning in a social field, whereas Giddens accentuates how structures are reaffirmed and transformed through the knowledgeability and agency of actors. 

Bourdieu's concept of habitus refers to the mental structures through which people perceive and navigate the world. Habitus is shaped by one's position in a social field, which consists of relationships between social positions. One's habitus causes individuals to make choices that unconsciously conform to the rules of the field, thus reproducing the existing social order. At the same time, habitus is not deterministic—individuals have some degree of agency or free will in their actions. Habitus provides archaeologists a way to understand how and why people in a past society may have acted in certain ways based on their social position and experiences.

However, Bourdieu's theory of habitus has been criticized as too rigid and deterministic. Giddens' Structuration Theory provides an alternative framework that gives more importance to human agency and free will. Giddens argues that structures and agency are recursively related, meaning that structures shape people's actions but people are also constantly reaffirming and changing the structures through their actions. Social structures are systems of rules and resources that individuals draw upon in their actions. Agents have knowledgeability—an awareness of the rules and resources of their social structures. They exercise agency by choosing to follow or ignore the rules of structures in their actions.   

Giddens' Structuration Theory can provide insights into how archaeologists can apply these ideas. For example, an analysis of a medieval peasant house and household artifacts could examine how social structures surrounding gender, family, and class shaped the actions of individuals in the household but were also reproduced and negotiated through people's daily practices. The layout of spaces, division of labor evidenced by artifacts, and details of the diet may reflect the rules of the overarching feudal system structure. However, the agency of individual family members in conducting daily tasks and using certain goods would have also served to subtly reaffirm, change, or challenge those rules. By considering the knowledgeability of actors, archaeologists can gain a deeper understanding of how past societies functioned through the mutual constitution of structures and agency.

In conclusion, the theories of Giddens and Bourdieu provide archaeology with useful frameworks for considering the relationship between individuals and society. While Bourdieu focuses more on how one's position in the social structure shapes habitus and future actions, Giddens emphasizes how structure and agency are mutually constitutive. An archaeological analysis informed by Giddens' Structuration Theory can provide insights into how social rules shaped human practices in the past while also allowing for individual free will and variation, thus providing a more balanced perspective. By applying these ideas, archaeologists can develop a fuller understanding of past societies through investigations of artifacts, architecture, and daily practices.
