The aim of the practical looking at ant locations and interactions in different habitats was to investigate the ecology of ants and their impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Several tests were performed to study the coverage, presence, and interactions of different ant species in woodland, grassland, and wasteland habitats. 

To examine the distribution and abundance of ants in the different habitats, quadrates were used. A 1m x 1m quadrate was placed randomly in each habitat, and the number of ants present within the quadrate was recorded for 10 minutes. This was repeated three times for each habitat. The mean number of ants was highest in the woodland habitat, followed by the wasteland, then the grassland. This suggests that woodland provides the most suitable habitat for ants, likely due to the availability of shelter, shade, and food sources.

To study which ant species were present in the different habitats, ants within the quadrates were collected, identified, and recorded. Nine ant species were found in total, with the woodland habitat containing the highest number of species. Formica fusca and Lasius niger were found in all three habitats. Mapping was used to show the locations of the different ant species in a diagrammatic form. The maps indicated that some ant species, such as F.fusca, were spread throughout the habitats, while others were concentrated in certain areas.

Dot plots were constructed to display the frequency of occurrence of each ant species in the different habitats. They showed that some species, such as F.fusca and L.niger, occurred very frequently in all habitats, while others were restricted to one or two habitats. A chi-square test was performed to determine if there was a significant association between ant species and habitat type. The results were significant, indicating that the distribution of ant species was non-random and strongly dependent on habitat type.

Observations were also made on interactions between different ant species. Aggressive behavior, avoidance, and recruitment were witnessed between certain species, suggesting competition for resources and territoriality. F.fusca was observed to be a dominant species, as other ants avoided areas populated by them. The interactions between ant species are important in determining their distribution and abundance, with dominant or aggressive species able to monopolize resources and exclude other species from certain areas. 

In conclusion, the practical provided insight into the ecology of ants in different habitats and how they interact with each other and the environment. Various tests revealed patterns in the distribution, abundance, and species of ants in woodland, grassland and wasteland. Further studies could extend to investigating how changes in habitat and climate may affect ant populations and communities. Overall, the practical highlighted the important role that ants play in terrestrial ecosystems.
