Code-switching refers to the practice of moving between different languages or language varieties in conversation. There are several types of code-switching that relate to how speakers choose to use language to influence how others perceive them. 

One major type of code-switching is inter-sentential switching, where speakers switch languages between sentences. For example, a Spanish-English bilingual speaker may say “Fui al doctor ayer. I had a checkup.” This type of code-switching shows that the speaker can comfortably use both languages, but prefers to keep them somewhat separate at the sentence level. It may allow the speaker to express themselves in the language that can best convey a particular idea or concept. At the same time, it signals the speaker’s bilingual competence to listeners.

Intra-sentential code-switching involves switching between languages within a sentence, such as “I’m going to the tienda to get some groceries.” This type of code-switching requires very advanced bilingual skills as the speaker must grammatically and phonologically integrate two linguistic systems within a single sentence. It may be used to convey cultural concepts that are best expressed in a particular language. It also highlights the speaker’s linguistic dexterity to interlocutors. 

Another form of code-switching is situational switching where a speaker selects one language over another based on the situation or context. For example, a speaker may use Spanish at home with family, English at work, and Spanglish with friends. The choice of language is strategic and meant to match the expectations of different listeners. It allows the speaker to signal their linguistic allegiances and shape how they are perceived in diverse social settings.

In summary, there are several types of code-switching based on how bilingual speakers choose and alternate between languages. While all types demonstrate a speaker’s ability to navigate between linguistic systems, they accomplish different goals. Inter-sentential and intra-sentential code-switching showcase a speaker’s bilingual fluency. Situational code-switching is a pragmatic choice that allows speakers to match language to context and signal their affiliations to diverse groups. Through code-switching, bilingual speakers can strategically use language to influence how they are viewed and the identities they project to the world.
