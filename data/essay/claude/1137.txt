Speech development in children occurs in several distinct phases as they learn language naturally through interaction with caregivers and the world around them, rather than through explicit instruction. Imitation alone does not explain how children acquire the complex rules of language. According to Noam Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, children are born with an innate ability to learn the grammar and structure of language. 

In the first year of life, children go through a babbling phase from around 4 to 10 months of age. At this stage, infants spontaneously produce strings of syllables like “ba ba ba” or “da da da”. While initially reflexive, babbling becomes more speech-like and infants start to imitate the sounds and rhythms of the language they are exposed to. This early vocal play helps infants practice making different speech sounds and strengthen the muscles used for speech. 

From about 10 months, infants enter the one-word stage, also known as holophrastic speech, where they produce their first words to convey meaning. For example, a child may say “milk” when they want milk or “ball” when playing with a ball. At this point they understand many more words than they can produce. Their early vocabulary is mainly composed of nouns, verbs, and adjectives related to their everyday experiences. 

Between 18 months to 2 years, children experience a burst of vocabulary development and begin combining two words together in short phrases. This is known as telegraphic speech because, like telegrams, the phrases lack function words and follow a specific rhythmic pattern. For example, a child may say “baby cry”, “more juice”, or “mommy come”. Though still limited, this combination of words allows the child to express a wider range of needs, questions, and interests.

From 2 to 3 years, children enter the grammatical stage where they begin using basic grammar rules to produce simple sentences of three or four words. For example, “I want juice” or “Mommy is cooking”. They start using articles, prepositions, pronouns, and verb tense and conjugation. Their vocabulary grows rapidly during this period, reaching up to 10,000 words by age 3. 

By age 3, most children have mastered the basics of language and enter the conversational stage. They speak in longer sentences, ask lots of questions, and engage in back-and-forth discussions. They use language to recount experiences, tell stories, describe events, and express their thoughts and feelings. From here, children's language abilities continue to expand and become more sophisticated as they prepare for literacy and beyond.  

Children do not learn language through imitation alone. According to Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, children are born with a biological predisposition to acquire the rules of language. All human languages share certain properties in common, including components like nouns, verbs, and adjectives as well as a particular word order and hierarchy of phrases and clauses. Chomsky argued that children are born with an innate knowledge of these universal linguistic principles, which acts as a scaffold to learn the grammar of the specific language or languages they are exposed to. 

Through interaction with speech, children learn to associate particular sounds, words, and phrases of their native language with the correct grammatical rules and semantic meanings. The language input they receive triggers the language acquisition device in their brain, providing the environmental stimulation to activate their intrinsic capacity for language. While imitation plays some role, it cannot account for how children master the complex system of rules that govern a language solely based on the speech they are exposed to. Children are primed to acquire language through the interaction of their innate universal grammar and experience with a specific linguistic environment.

In summary, speech development progresses through several phases as children's abilities become increasingly sophisticated. From initial babbling to mastery of grammar and conversation, children learn language in a natural way through cues built into their biology and interaction with others. Universal grammar provides an explanatory framework for how children acquire the rules particular to their native language with relative ease and in a consistent sequence, supporting the argument that language is an innate human ability rather than one solely learned through imitation.
