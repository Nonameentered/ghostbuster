The freedom of the press during the English Civil War in the 17th century had a significant impact on the production and dissemination of royalist propaganda. The breakdown of censorship regulations under the tumult of the war allowed the proliferation of printed material espousing the royalist cause, as authors were newly able to compose anonymously and spread their messages to a wide audience. Royalist writers took advantage of this liberty to spread propaganda through the clever use of language, theatrical devices, and the promotion of pro-monarchical themes.  

The anonymity afforded by the wartime press was crucial for the spread of royalist ideas. Without an official censor, authors were free to publish materials without including their names or official licenses, allowing them to evade retribution for their support of the king. Anonymity emboldened royalist writers to distribute more extreme propaganda messages in support of Charles I and in condemnation of Parliament. The royalist newsbook Mercurius Aulicus, for example, was published anonymously from 1643 to 1645. Its unknown authors viciously satirized Parliament and its army without fear of punishment.

Royalist writers employed innovative and dramatic language to provoke emotions in their readers and spread persuasive propaganda. They used bilious invective and ad hominem attacks to mock parliamentary leaders, portraying them as low-born, foolish, and villainous. For example, Marchamont Nedham, in his anonymously published newsbook Mercurius Britanicus, relentlessly lampooned Parliament's general Thomas Fairfax as a fool.  At the same time, royalists used flowery language and metaphors to portray King Charles I as a heroic, divinely-ordained monarch. Charles was depicted as a second King David, destined to overcome his foes. This emotive and dramatic language was meant stir passions in readers and convince them of the royalist cause.

Theatrical metaphors and tropes were also used in royalist propaganda to create dramatic narratives of the war that emphasized themes of moral justice and tragedy. Royalists portrayed the king as a tragic hero, destined to eventually triumph over the villainous Parliament. anonymously published works like Eikon Basilike, purportedly by Charles I himself, presented the king as a martyr, employing theatrical and emotive language to sway readers to the royalist cause by appealing to their moral sensibilities and desire for a tragic drama. The use of theatrical metaphor was a powerful propagandistic device because of its ability to provoke emotion and shape moral narratives.

In conclusion, the freedom of the press during the English Civil War allowed royalists to spread persuasive propaganda through printed publications. The ability to publish anonymously, use dramatic language and metaphor, and promote pro-monarchical themes led to the proliferation of propaganda that supported King Charles I's cause during the war. Although the parliamentarians also engaged in propaganda efforts, the royalists particularly took advantage of the breakdown of censorship to spread their messages and attempt to shape public opinion. The dramatic language and metaphorical tropes they employed have even had a lasting power, influencing later perceptions of Charles I as a tragic hero and martyr. The tumult of the 1640s revolutionized propaganda in England and demonstrated the power of print media to shape ideas during times of political upheaval.
