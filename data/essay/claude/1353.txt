The Cold War era spanned roughly from the end of World War II in 1945 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. During this period, the world was broadly divided into two opposing geopolitical alliances: the Western bloc led by the United States, and the Eastern bloc led by the Soviet Union. The heightened tensions and conflicts between these superpower blocs led to massive changes in international diplomacy. 

First, new actors emerged on the global diplomatic stage. As former colonies gained independence in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere, dozens of new nation-states were formed and joined the United Nations. These newly independent countries pursued their own national interests and alliances, introducing new voices and agendas into global diplomacy. Regional organizations like the European Economic Community and the Organization of American States also gave more power and influence to groups of smaller states.

Second, diplomacy became more multilateral and regional. The postwar order was designed and maintained by new multilateral institutions like the UN, IMF, and NATO. While the superpowers frequently engaged in bilateral talks, most diplomatic negotiations involved multiple countries and alliances. There was also a rise in regional diplomacy, as neighboring countries collaborated on trade, security, and other issues. Groups like ASEAN and the Warsaw Pact shaped diplomacy at a regional level.

Third, there were advances in public and personal diplomacy. Leaders like Eisenhower and Khrushchev engaged in "summit diplomacy," meeting face to face to address tensions. Celebrities and cultural figures toured the world to share national values. Radio stations like Voice of America and Radio Moscow aimed propaganda at foreign audiences. These new tools of public and personal diplomacy allowed countries to appeal directly to citizens and leaders abroad.

The end of the Cold War conflict in 1991 transformed diplomacy once again. With the Soviet Union dissolved, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower. The UN took on new peacekeeping roles. Advancements in trade, finance, travel, and communications ushered in an era of unprecedented globalization and global governance.  Institutions like the WTO and World Bank shaped diplomacy at a global level.

Finally, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent "War on Terror" reshaped diplomacy. There was a new focus on countering violent extremism, restricting the flow of weapons and funds to terrorists, and stabilizing conflict zones that bred extremism. Alliances like NATO took on counterterrorism missions. Advancements in surveillance and drone technologies gave countries new tools for military diplomacy.

In conclusion, diplomacy underwent profound changes during and after the Cold War era. The rise of new actors, multilateral and regional diplomacy, public and personal diplomacy, as well as major world events drove steady evolution in global politics and international relations. Three major sources of change were the end of the Cold War, globalization, and the post-9/11 era. While the period was marked by tensions between superpowers, diplomacy at all levels grew increasingly global, diverse, technological, and complex.
