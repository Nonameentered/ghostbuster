Anglo-Saxon burial practices provide valuable insights into early medieval English society between the 5th and 11th centuries AD. The Anglo-Saxons were Germanic tribes that migrated to Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans. They brought with them distinct pagan burial rites that incorporated grave goods, reflecting their views on the afterlife and social status. Studying these burial practices gives us a glimpse into their culture, religious beliefs, and social hierarchies. 

A key feature of Anglo-Saxon burial rites was the inclusion of grave goods, objects placed in the grave to accompany the deceased into the afterlife. The items included weapons, jewelry, pottery, and other valuables. The specific goods provide clues to the gender, social status, and profession of the deceased. For example, swords, shields, and spears indicate a male warrior, while jewelry, weaving equipment, and keys suggest a female. The quantity and quality of goods also signify wealth and social standing. Lavish burials with an array of expensive goods point to someone of high status, while simple burials with few or no goods indicate lower status.

The inclusion of grave goods demonstrates the Anglo-Saxon belief in an afterlife where the deceased could make use of and enjoy physical objects. Their pagan religion featured gods like Woden, Thunor, and Frig who welcomed fallen warriors into a paradise called Valhalla. The grave goods ensured the deceased had the necessities to feast and fight in the afterlife. For example, a warrior's sword allowed him to fight, while a cauldron or bowls allowed for feasting. The presence of wagons or horses symbolized transportation to the afterworld.  

Burial location and container also provide insight into social status. Wealthy individuals were often buried in chamber graves - timber structures underneath burial mounds. Poorer individuals were buried directly in the ground, sometimes in wooden coffins. The wealthy were also more likely to be buried at famous religious sites, like Sutton Hoo, indicating their ability to be interred in prestigious locations. Location of the burial on a hilltop or with views of settlement sites also suggested higher status.

In conclusion, study of Anglo-Saxon burial rites offers invaluable information about their religious beliefs, social hierarchies, and views of the afterlife. The gifts of weapons, tools, food, and other goods interred with the dead provide glimpses into their occupations, wealth, and status in this life and the next. The remains also shed light on their pagan spiritual views, with evidence of belief in an afterlife in which the pleasures and duties of mortal life were continued. Burial practices thus offer a rich insight into this period of English history.
