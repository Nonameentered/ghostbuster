There are several advantages to goat and sheep milk production. Goat and sheep milk are highly nutritious, containing essential nutrients like protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Their milk is also naturally homogenized, meaning the fat globules are very small and remain suspended in the milk rather than separating into a cream layer, which some people prefer. In addition, goat and sheep milk is naturally high in medium-chain fatty acids, especially capric, caprylic and lauric acids, which have various health benefits. For people who are lactose intolerant, goat and sheep milk can be an alternative since it is often easier to digest due to smaller fat globules and a decrease in the lactose content. 

However, there are also challenges to goat and sheep milk production. Goats and sheep require daily milking and feeding, as well as regular veterinary care, all of which demand significant time and resources. Housing, equipment, and supplies can also represent a major capital investment for farmers. There are additional costs for transportation, marketing, and distribution of the milk. Price volatility and market access can pose risks for producers. Another challenge is managing animal stress, nutrition, and health, which directly impact milk production, quality, and yield. Ensuring high quality milk requires meticulous care of the animals.

To optimize milk production and quality, farmers should focus on several key areas. Providing ideal nutrition, especially in late pregnancy and early lactation, is critical. A balanced, high-quality diet with plenty of roughage and access to clean water is essential. Maintaining a regular milking schedule is also important for production and the health and comfort of the animals. A quiet, low-stress environment, fresh bedding, shade, and veterinary care will keep animals healthy and productive. Certain breeds, especially Nubian, Saanen, and Oberhasli goats, as well as East Friesian and Lacaune dairy sheep, have been specifically bred for high milk yield and hardiness. These breeds are typically a farmer's best option if the primary goal is maximizing production.

In summary, while goat and sheep milk production presents certain advantages in nutrition and digestibility, there are also significant challenges, especially related to resources, time, cost, and animal management. However, with a diligent focus on nutrition, health, housing, and an ideal milking schedule—especially when using breeds specifically suited for dairy production—farmers can achieve high milk quality and yield to maximize the benefits of goat and sheep milk. Overall, for the small farmer, the pros of producing specialty milk may outweigh the cons, especially when there is a local market of consumers demanding high-quality artisanal cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products.
