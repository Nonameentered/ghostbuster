The study of mollusc assemblages from archaeological sites can provide significant insight into changing landscapes and environments over time. Molluscs, as relatively immobile organisms that are closely tied to specific ecological conditions, can act as bioindicators for the environment in which they lived. By analyzing the species present and abundance of molluscs in archaeological contexts, inferences can be made about the local environment, vegetation, climate, and land use.

At Ufton Green in the Kennet Valley, analysis of the mollusc assemblage from core 50 provides evidence for environmental and land-use change in the area potentially linked to human activity. The basal layer of the core dates to the late Mesolithic and is dominated by open grassland species such as  Catinella arenaria, indicating an open environment. Through the Neolithic, the molluscs suggest the presence of open woodland with a mixed habitat and the occurrence of wetter conditions, shown by shade-tolerant and moisture-loving species.

The Bronze Age sees a shift to more open grassland species again, suggesting forest clearance and potentially pastureland. The dominance of open grassland species continues through the Iron Age and Roman period, and provides evidence for extensive deforestation and the establishment of agricultural fields in the area. The molluscs from these periods also indicate drier conditions and less woodland.  

In combination with other bioarchaeological evidence such as pollen analysis, the mollusc data can provide a more complete picture of the changing environment. For example, a decrease in tree pollen alongside an increase in open grassland mollusc species suggests widespread deforestation. Evidence for cereal pollen in conjunction with open habitat molluscs may indicate the cultivation of crops. Thus, the molluscs supplement other proxy data in reconstructing the landscape.

The analysis of the Ufton Green mollusc assemblage demonstrates the significant insights these data can provide into environmental and land-use change, especially when considered together with other bioarchaeological evidence. Although immobile, molluscs are closely tied to their surrounding habitat, and changes in the types and abundance of species present can reflect impacts on the landscape potentially caused by human activity and environmental fluctuations. Through the core at Ufton Green, the molluscs indicate significant changes in woodland cover, moisture levels, and land use that signify human alteration of the environment from prehistory onwards. Overall, molluscan data form an important part of bioarchaeological study in reconstructing past landscapes.
