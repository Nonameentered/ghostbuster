Waterlogging, or the saturation of sites by water, has been instrumental in preserving many archaeological artefacts that otherwise would have decayed or disintegrated over time. When organic materials like wood, leather, and textiles are submerged in oxygen-depleted water, their decay slows down dramatically. At very low oxygen levels, bacterial and chemical activity that breaks down materials effectively stops, preserving artefacts for centuries or even millennia. 

Several techniques are commonly used to determine the age of waterlogged archaeological finds. Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating, can be used to date wooden objects by correlating the tree rings of long-dead trees with known dated samples. Radiocarbon dating measures the decay of radioactive carbon-14 in organic materials like wood, leather, and textiles to estimate an age range. Stratigraphy, the study of layers of soil (“strata”) at a site, helps archaeologists understand the relative chronology of objects based on the layer in which they are found. With careful excavation, waterlogged strata can often be distinguished, aiding greatly in dating and contextualizing finds.

One of the most famous examples of a successful waterlogged excavation is the Nydam Mose site in southern Jutland, Denmark. Discovered in 1859, the Iron Age site featured three well-preserved oak-built boats, dating between 200 and 500 AD. The boats, along with wooden paddles, animal bones, and metal and textile artefacts were preserved by the acidic, oxygen-poor bog water. Dendrochronology helped date the wood, while radiocarbon dating and stratigraphy confirmed these dates and placed the finds in chronological context. The ships and artefacts revealed intricate details about boatbuilding, economy, and daily life in the Iron Age.

A more recent example is Must Farm in the UK, an extraordinary Bronze Age site in situ preservation, where wood, textiles, plant materials and other organic artefacts remained as they were deposited in a lake around 800 BC. The lack of oxygen and acidic conditions allowed for unprecedented preservation of intricately woven textiles, paddles still with their handles, and even the remains of meals. Radiocarbon and dendrochronological dating confirmed the Bronze Age settlement, providing remarkable insights into a formative period of British prehistory.

In conclusion, waterlogging has been critical to the preservation and discovery of archaeological artefacts that provide windows into ancient technologies, cultures, and daily life. Careful excavation, dating, and analysis allow these silent and often wonderfully preserved witnesses of the past to speak again. With the help of water, they have endured for centuries and continue to share their secrets with us.
