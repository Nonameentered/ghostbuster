Language acquisition after the age of five differs significantly from earlier development in several key ways. Children's utterances become increasingly complex syntactically, their narratives achieve greater cohesion, and their language use becomes highly attuned to social contexts. 

In terms of syntax, one of the most notable developments is the emergence of relative clauses. Whereas children up to age five typically only produce simple sentences with a subject, verb, and object, after age five they begin using relative clauses to create complex sentences that provide more detailed information. For example, a five-year-old might say, "I played with the girl. She had a red coat." An eight-year-old, on the other hand, would likely combine these into a single sentence using a relative clause: "I played with the girl who had a red coat." The relative clause "who had a red coat" modifies and gives more information about "the girl."

Young children's narratives also become much more cohesive after age five. Their stories come to have a clear beginning, middle, and end, as well as logical sequences of events. They begin using cohesive devices that tie together their ideas, such as pronouns to refer to characters already introduced ("He went to the store"), temporal connectors like "then" and "after that" to indicate the order of events, and causal connectors such as "because" to explain why something happened. For example, a five-year-old might tell a rambling story: "John went to the store. He got some milk and cookies. Then he played outside. He fell off the swing." An eight-year-old, on the other hand, would likely provide a much more coherent narrative:  "John asked his mom to go to the store because he wanted milk and cookies. After he bought the snacks, he went to the playground. While he was swinging, he fell off by accident because he was eating his cookies and lost his grip." The use of pronouns, connectors, and relative clauses allows the child to tie together concepts and create a smooth, logical flow.

Finally, children's language use becomes highly attuned to social contexts as their language and cognition develop. They become keenly aware of social roles, relationships, and audiences. Their word choice, style, and even language register will shift based on whether they are speaking to a teacher, a parent, a friend, or a younger sibling, for example. They can discuss how their own speech might change based on the social context. For instance, an eight-year-old might say, "I don't talk to my teacher the same way I talk to my friend. I have to be more polite and use bigger words." This type of meta-linguistic awareness of how language operates in various social spheres emerges around age five and continues to develop through the teenage years.   

In summary, language development after age five brings increasingly complex syntax, more cohesive extended narratives, and a heightened awareness of social contexts. While preschool-aged children can produce basic sentences and short stories, school-aged children's language abilities allow for sophisticated communication that is multidimensional, collaborative, and highly social. Their syntactic, narrative, and social development work together to allow rich conversations, build interpersonal relationships, share information, and participate fully in their communities.
