Albright & Wilson Plc disappointed as raw material prices fail to drop

Albright & Wilson Plc, the UK-based chemicals maker, expressed frustration today that raw material prices have failed to recede in recent months despite broader declines in commodities. The company has been hoping for relief from high costs for several key industrial chemicals and metals to boost profit margins. However, persistent supply tightness and steady demand have kept raw material prices elevated, dealing a blow to the firm's bottom line.

“We had anticipated some easing of raw material costs by now, given the broader pullback in commodities prices over the last quarter,” said Penny Morris, CEO of Albright & Wilson. “Unfortunately, the chemicals and metals we require for production have not seen the price drops we had hoped for. Tight supply and healthy demand have conspired to keep costs up.” 

The company’s primary raw materials include caustic soda, used to make chlorine and hydrochloric acid, titanium dioxide, a whitening pigment, and copper, used for wiring and tubing. Prices for all three materials are up double digits over the past 12 months despite an 8% drop in the Bloomberg Commodity Index. Tight supply conditions in the caustic soda and titanium dioxide markets show little sign of easing, while steady demand from major economies like China has supported copper prices.

The stubbornly high costs have squeezed profit margins for Albright & Wilson, which have fallen over 3 percentage points to just under 12% in the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year. While the firm has raised its own prices and taken cost-cutting measures to offset some of the impact, it has not been enough to fully counteract the rise in raw material expenses. 

Morris noted that some new supply coming online over the next 6-12 months may help balance markets and relieve pressure from a cost perspective. However, she cautioned that an escalation of ongoing trade disputes could threaten global growth and industrial demand, potentially disrupting any supply-driven price relief.

“Our raw material cost outlook remains uncertain given the mix of factors in play,” Morris said. “While we see some supply help on the horizon, risks around trade and growth could hamper demand and delay any meaningful price drops. For now, we continue to take management actions to adapt to this challenging cost environment, but our margins will remain under pressure until we start to see broader market pricing support.”

Investors reacted negatively to the news, sending Albright & Wilson shares down over 4% in London trading. The stock is off nearly 20% from highs reached earlier this year. With no quick fixes in sight, shareholders may face more short-term pain before raw material relief helps boost the company’s profitability. Overall, a tricky balancing act amid uncertain times for the specialty chemicals firm.
