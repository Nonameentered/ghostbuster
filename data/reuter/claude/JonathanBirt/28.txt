UK government puts AEA Technology Plc up for sale, offering expertise from crisp packet design to nuclear waste disposal 

The UK government has announced plans to sell its shares in AEA Technology Plc, a British engineering and applied science company. AEA Technology provides consultancy and R&D services to both government and commercial clients across diverse fields including energy, environment, defense, and industry.

Founded in 1996 when the UK Atomic Energy Authority was privatized, AEA Technology employs over 1500 people across its offices and laboratories in the UK, France, Japan, and the US. The company works on niche applications ranging from the design of Walkers crisp packets to safe disposal of radioactive waste.

The planned sale of AEA Technology is part of the UK government's divestment of shares in organizations outside its core remit. UK Government Investments, which oversees government shares in public sector bodies, has appointed NM Rothschild to advise on the sale of the government’s 49.9% stake in AEA Technology. According to UKGI, the sale will aim to secure “value for money for taxpayers while continuing to operate in line with its core purpose.”

AEA Technology has seen fluctuating fortunes in recent years. While the company remains profitable, revenue from its government advisory work has declined in the face of budget cuts. However, its commercial work, especially in areas like product design, materials testing, and renewable energy consulting, has grown. The company believes its diverse capabilities and client base position it well for future growth.

Some questions remain around AEA Technology's long-term management of historic nuclear liabilities. The company is responsible for decommissioning its former nuclear research sites and associated waste management programs. Critics argue that privatizing the company risks absolving government responsibility for these costly and complex programs which span over 100 years. Supporters counter that regulated independence allows AEA Technology to operate more efficiently as a commercial organization.

The sale of AEA Technology is expected to generate significant interest from infrastructure funds, private equity, and engineering consultancies attracted to the company’s intellectual property and strategic capabilities. If successful, the sale could raise over £200m, although the eventual price will depend on the outcome of the government's ongoing negotiations with potential buyers.
