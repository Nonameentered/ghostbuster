Zeneca Group Predicts Strong Profit Growth Fueled by New Drugs and Agro-Chemicals 

Zeneca Group, the U.K.-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, today said it expects strong profit growth this year driven by new drug launches and increasing demand for its agro-chemical products. 

The company forecasts earnings per share growth of between 15 to 20 percent for 2021, according to its latest investor update. This reflects increasing sales of new oncology drugs like Enhertu, a treatment for previously treated HER2-positive breast cancer, as well as Lynparza, which is used to treat ovarian and pancreatic cancers. The company secured approvals for new indications of these drugs across global markets last year, enabling it to reach more patients and boost sales.

Zeneca also cited its agro-chemical or crop protection business as another growth driver this year. The division creates products to control weeds, pests and diseases to improve crop yields. It expects this segment to benefit from solid market conditions and new product launches, delivering mid-single digit revenue growth. 

"2020 was a pivotal year, delivering many successes, and we now have a new operational model fully in place to underpin sustainable long-term growth," said Pascal Soriot, Zeneca's chief executive officer. "Our focus in 2021 is on flawless commercial execution for new medicines and continued progress of our clinical development pipeline.‚Äù

The upbeat forecast comes on the back of a mixed 2020 for Zeneca where it weathered weak sales of some legacy drugs but saw stronger growth in newer medicines and agro-chemicals. Annual product sales declined 2 percent to $35.6 billion but core earnings per share rose 9 percent when excluding the impact of divestments and the pandemic.

Zeneca's outlook depends on its ability to continue the strong launch trajectory of new drugs like Enhertu and further progress of its mid- and late-stage pipeline. The company has over 70 new medicines in development across various disease areas including oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory, and diabetes.  

However, Zeneca also faces risks from the loss of market exclusivity for some existing drugs and macroeconomic uncertainties exacerbated by COVID-19. Epidemic outbreaks and containment measures could disrupt its manufacturing and supply chain or hit sales if patient access to its medicines and vaccines is limited.

While Zeneca is optimistic about the year ahead, its forecast hinges upon the course of the pandemic and health regulatory reviews of its new drugs. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's progress in the coming months to gain better visibility into whether it can deliver on its profit growth targets.
