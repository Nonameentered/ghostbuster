Celltech Group Plc expected to turn a profit in 1998 as it plans to launch two lead drugs  

Celltech Group Plc, a leading UK biopharmaceutical company, is poised to turn profitable for the first time in 1998 driven by the planned launches of two of its lead drug candidates. The company has invested heavily in research and development over the past decade and now has a promising pipeline of new drugs, especially in the areas of rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

Celltech’s lead rheumatoid arthritis drug candidate, CDP870, is entering Phase III clinical trials and showing strong potential. If approved, it would compete in a market worth over $10 billion annually. The company’s lead cancer drug, CDX-110, is in early Phase II trials for the treatment of prostate cancer. Early results have been encouraging and the drug could tap into a market of over $5 billion if successful.  

The planned launch of these two drugs in the next 2-3 years is expected to drive significant revenue growth for Celltech, according to analysts. The company has invested over $500 million in its pipeline over the past 10 years but has yet to turn a profit, posting losses for the past four years. Revenue has been minimal, mostly from collaborative agreements and technology licensing.  

With its lead drugs progressing well, Celltech is building up its sales and marketing capabilities to prepare for their commercial launch. It recently hired a new head of sales from a major pharmaceutical firm to spearhead its commercial operations. Manufacturing partnerships are also being secured to ensure sufficient production capacity for the new drugs.  

Given the sizeable potential of the rheumatoid arthritis and prostate cancer drug markets, if CDP870 and CDX-110 get approved, they could generate combined peak sales of over $2 billion for Celltech, according to estimates by analysts. The company’s shares have already risen 25% in the past 12 months in anticipation of its first profits and the successful launch of these two drugs could drive further gains, analysts said. While still risky, Celltech appears poised to deliver on its promise as a biotech pioneer and start generating returns for investors.
