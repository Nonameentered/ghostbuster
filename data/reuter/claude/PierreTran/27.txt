Airbus partners with China to build 100-seater jet as Alenia enters new programs

European aviation giant Airbus announced today a partnership with Chinese state-owned aerospace company COMAC to develop a 100-seat jetliner for the fast-growing Asian market. The new aircraft program, called the C919-100, targets regional hauls in China and other Asian countries. It will compete directly with Boeing's 737 MAX program.

Under the joint venture, Airbus will provide technical assistance to COMAC in areas such as design, manufacturing, and certification. COMAC will have majority ownership and control of the program. The new aircraft is expected to fly in 2025, with deliveries of the first C919-100 jets in 2027.

"China is a hugely important market for commercial aircraft, and Airbus has long seen strategic value in partnering with COMAC," said Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus. "This new program will allow us to strengthen our ties with COMAC and ensure Airbus has a competitive product for the 100-seat market in China and beyond."

The C919-100 venture is the latest effort by Airbus to strengthen its position in Asia's fast-growing aviation sector. Airbus already works with COMAC on the smaller ARJ21 regional jet program and helped COMAC set up manufacturing facilities in China. Airbus also wants to counter Boeing's strong position in China and win more narrowbody aircraft orders in coming decades. Boeing forecasts demand for 8,600 new airplanes in China through 2038.

In related news, Airbus subsidiary Alenia Aermacchi said today it will help develop new military fighter jets and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the United Arab Emirates armed forces. Alenia will work on the new programs with Mubadala, an investment firm owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. This expands Alenia's partnership with Mubadala, which already owns a stake in Alenia's parent company Leonardo.  

The deals reflect efforts by European aerospace groups to find new sources of growth as major commercial aircraft programs like the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320 face slowing orders. New aircraft ventures with China and military programs in the Middle East provide opportunities for Airbus and its subsidiaries to diversify their business and revenue streams over the coming decades.

The article summarizes the key details and context around two announcements from Airbus and its subsidiary Alenia: a new joint venture with COMAC to build a 100-seat jet for China, and new military aircraft programs with Mubadala in the UAE.
