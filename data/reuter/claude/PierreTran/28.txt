France's Thomson SA Electronics Group Considers Two-Stage Privatisation 

The French electronics and technology company Thomson SA announced today that it is exploring options for a two-stage privatization process. The company was nationalized in 1982 but has since grown into a global leader in consumer electronics and media technology, generating over €20 billion in annual revenue.

According to Thomson SA's chief executive Jacques Duclos, the first stage of the process would involve listing up to 49% of the company's shares on the Euronext Paris stock exchange as early as next year. "We have built a strong, globally competitive business with increasing profits and a promising future in sectors like digital home entertainment and professional video equipment," said Duclos. "The time is right to allow public investment in our company while still maintaining government support."

The French government currently owns 53% of Thomson SA and would retain a majority stake after the initial public offering. However, depending on the success of the listing and Thomson's performance over the next few years, the government would consider selling additional shares to reduce its ownership below 50%—a move that would complete the privatization process.

Some analysts view the two-stage process as a cautious approach, allowing both the government and Thomson SA to evaluate public sentiment before full privatization. "Floating less than half the shares is a prudent strategy," said Genevieve Moreels, a Paris-based business analyst. "It will raise capital and give ordinary investors a chance to buy shares in this prestigious company, while ensuring the government influence over any major strategic decisions."   

However, others argue that a complete one-step privatization would raise more capital and give Thomson SA more independence and flexibility. "Gradual privatization prolongs uncertainty and could hamper Thomson's ability to make bold moves in today's fast-changing technology sector," said Paul Tourre, an economist at the Sorbonne. "There may also be less appetite from investors if they are hesitant about the government remaining the largest shareholder."

For their part, Thomson SA's executives expressed confidence in the two-stage approach. "This balanced process will strengthen our company by access to public funds while maintaining our long partnership with the French government," said Duclos. The Minister of Economy and Finance likewise signaled the government's support for the privatisation strategy, calling it an "important step to unleash the global potential of this industrial champion." The coming months will reveal how minority shareholders and equity markets also view this incremental change in ownership of a venerable French technology icon now preparing to compete on a global scale.
