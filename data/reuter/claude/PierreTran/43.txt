Airbus Confidently Presses Ahead with Studies on 555-Seat Passenger Plane Despite Boeing's Retreat 

Airbus announced plans today to continue studies on developing a new ultra-large passenger aircraft that could seat up to 555 people, despite Boeing's recent decision to pause development of a competing aircraft. Airbus said it sees demand for such a mega-plane emerging in the mid-2020s, driven by major hub airports needing to accommodate more passengers with limited infrastructure expansion options.

Guillaume Faury, chief executive of Airbus, expressed confidence in a double-decker aircraft seating 450 to 555 people and able to fly up to 8,000 nautical miles. "We see a market for a plane of this size and are continuing concept studies,” Faury said. “Just because Boeing has paused does not mean the market opportunity has gone away.” Airbus has dubbed the concept the A3XX, though a final name like A380neo or A390 is possible if the project proceeds to production.

Last month, Boeing announced it was suspending feasibility studies on a new aircraft to succeed the 747 jumbo jet, which seats more than 400 people. Patrick Shanahan, Boeing’s chief executive, cited uncertainty in the cargo and passenger markets. But Airbus believes the time is right to pursue what would be the world's largest commercial jetliner. Forecasters project demand for aircraft seating at least 450 people to reach 1,300 planes over the next 20 years, worth over $400 billion in total sales.

“Mega-hubs in the Middle East and Asia have infrastructure constraints but also see the largest demand increases,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend Flightglobal Consultancy. “A larger plane is one way to accommodate growth when you can’t add more flights.”

Airbus’ super-plane would aim to leapfrog the Boeing 747 and current A380, which seat 400 and 550 people respectively. The new aircraft would incorporate the latest technologies to boost fuel efficiency and reduce noise, allowing it to serve major airports. Airbus is discussing the concept with airlines and lessors to refine specifications and the business case. If launched, the A3XX would still require 7-10 years of development before entering service. Airbus hopes to make a go/no go decision around 2021.

The article provides an overview of Airbus announcing plans to continue studying an ultra-large 555-seat passenger plane, despite Boeing recently suspending work on a competing aircraft. Airbus sees demand for such a plane by the mid-2020s and is confident in the market opportunity. The article outlines some details of Airbus' concept, dubbed the A3XX, and provides context on Boeing's decision and market forecasts indicating demand for very large aircraft. Airbus aims to decide whether to proceed to production with the A3XX around 2021. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the article in any way. I am happy to refine and improve it further.
