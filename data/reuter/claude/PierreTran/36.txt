Eurotunnel's Shareholder Democracy in Spotlight with Vote on Debt Restructuring deal

Eurotunnel PLC, the operator of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, is putting its shareholder democracy to the test this week as it asks investors to approve a debt restructuring plan aimed at stabilizing the company's finances. 

The plan, which will swap existing debt for new loans and bonds,  requires approval from 75% of Eurotunnel's shareholders in a vote on Thursday. The company has struggled under a heavy debt load in recent years, and the restructuring is aimed at giving Eurotunnel more flexibility to invest in operations and weather economic downturns.

“This is a pivotal moment for our company and our shareholders,” said Jacques Gounon, Eurotunnel's chairman and chief executive. “The restructuring plan puts Eurotunnel on a sustainable financial footing and will allow us to improve our links, build new partnerships and open up new opportunities for growth.”

However, the plan is not without risks and dissenting shareholders. Some argue the restructuring favors major creditors over shareholders and will dilute existing investors' stakes. Proxy advisor Glass Lewis has recommended shareholders vote against the plan, arguing the debt swap undervalues the company and is not in the interests of minority shareholders.

Eurotunnel has been majority-owned by its creditors since a 2007 restructuring in which banks took control of 55% of shares in exchange for debt forgiveness. The channel tunnel operator has struggled with its debt load ever since, with debt currently standing at over €9.7 billion, compared to a market value of just €513 million.
 
Under the new restructuring plan, an old €2.8 billion bank loan would be swapped for new secured bonds, while a €4.7 billion unsecured bond would be exchanged for new subordinated bonds and €500 million in new equity. The plan would defer near-term maturities until 2022 and give Eurotunnel more financial flexibility.
 
However, the equity issue will significantly dilute existing shareholders, reducing their total stake to 15% from 45% today. This has angered some shareholders, especially hedge funds that have bought into Eurotunnel's equity hoping to profit from a rebound. They argue the debt restructuring undervalues the company's equity and long-term prospects.

“The board is effectively giving away control on the cheap to appease creditors,” said Paul Singer, founder of Elliott Management, one of Eurotunnel's largest shareholders. Elliott and other shareholders plan to vote against the restructuring deal, but it remains unclear if they have enough votes to block approval.

The vote on Thursday will be a test of Eurotunnel's shareholder democracy and governance. If approved, the restructuring will give the company more stable footing and flexibility to improve operations. But it will come at the cost of significantly reducing existing shareholders' ownership and stakes in Eurotunnel's future upside. The outcome of the vote and its ultimate impact will demonstrate whether shareholder interests or creditor control are driving Eurotunnel.
