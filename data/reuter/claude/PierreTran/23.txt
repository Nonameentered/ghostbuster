Air France Reports Improved Earnings and Orders 20 Boeing and Airbus Aircraft

Air France-KLM reported improved earnings for the third quarter today along with plans to acquire 20 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus to improve fuel efficiency and meet growing demand.

The airline group reported net income of $960 million, up 14% from the same quarter last year. Revenue also grew 5.6% to $8.8 billion. The improved results were driven by a 7.8% increase in passenger traffic and stable cargo demand. The earnings handily beat analyst expectations.

Buoyed by stronger financial performance, Air France-KLM announced plans to purchase 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 10 Airbus A350 widebody jets. The new aircraft will replace older, less fuel-efficient planes currently in the fleet and support network expansion. Deliveries of the aircraft will start in 2023 and continue through 2028.

"With solid traffic and revenue growth as well as tightly controlled costs, our third quarter results demonstrate the Air France-KLM Group's momentum and transformation is delivering," said CEO Benjamin Smith. "At the same time, the fleet renewal plan with the order of Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 aircraft reflects our ongoing commitment to improve our environmental sustainability and offer the very best products to our customers."

The new aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by at least 20% compared to the planes they replace, resulting in lower carbon emissions. The A350 and 787 also provide superior cabin comfort for passengers with larger windows, lower cabin altitude, higher humidity, and quieter engines. The more modern and spacious aircraft are expected to attract higher-paying business and premium leisure travelers.

Air France and KLM currently operate a mixed fleet of Airbus, Boeing and Embraer aircraft. The new orders will move them closer to an all-widebody fleet and improve commonality to reduce costs. The fleet renewal is a key part of the company's strategic plan to boost profitability and better compete with fast-growing Gulf carriers.

Air France-KLM's earnings recovery and fleet renewal announcement were well received by investors, with the stock up over 5% in trading today. Analysts viewed the company's results and new aircraft orders as signs of improving momentum and competitive positioning within the industry. With a stronger balance sheet and more efficient aircraft, Air France-KLM appears poised for sustainable growth and profitability.
