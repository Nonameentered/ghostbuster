Airbus: No Evidence of Boeing Pressure to Block A3XX Production 

Airbus executives said today there is no evidence that Boeing pressured suppliers or government officials to block the production of Airbus's new superjumbo A3XX jet. Airbus has been investigating claims that Boeing engaged in anti-competitive behavior to stall the development of the 600-seat A3XX in the early 2000s. However, after an extensive internal review, Airbus found no proof to substantiate the allegations.

"We thoroughly looked into claims that Boeing took actions to delay or cancel the A3XX program, but could not find any evidence to support them," said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. "While Boeing was certainly concerned about the impact of the A3XX on the market, our review found that their expressions of concern were fair and reasonable, and within the bounds of typical commercial competition and discourse."

Specifically, Airbus investigated whether Boeing convinced major suppliers like engine manufacturers not to work with Airbus on the A3XX or lobbied governments to withdraw financing or infrastructure support needed for the program. Airbus found no evidence these types of pressure tactics were deployed. Boeing has rejected claims it acted inappropriately regarding the A3XX.  

Without major suppliers and government backing, the A3XX program struggled in its early days. However, Airbus was eventually able to line up partners and funding for the aircraft, now renamed the A380, which entered service in 2007. The A380 became the world's largest passenger airliner, though sales have disappointed and Airbus recently announced it will cease A380 production in 2021.

Airbus and Boeing, the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers, are in a long-running competition for dominance in the global aircraft market. Claims and counter-claims of unfair behavior are common in the aerospace industry. However, verified instances of anti-competitive behavior are rare. The Airbus internal review indicates the claims surrounding the A3XX appear to be unfounded, and simply part of the usual competitive rhetoric between the two plane makers.  

Airbus says it will continue to monitor Boeing's actions closely for any potentially unfair activity, but for now considers the A3XX allegations to be closed. Airbus remains focused on improving its competitive position through innovation, cost management, and producing aircraft that airlines around the world need and want to fly their passengers.
