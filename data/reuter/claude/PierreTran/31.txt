Airbus Must Speed Up Plans to Compete with Boeing-McDonnell Douglas Merger

European aerospace giant Airbus needs to accelerate efforts to counter the effects of the proposed merger between American plane makers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, industry analysts warn. The $13.3 billion all-stock deal, announced last month, would create a company dominating the commercial aircraft market. Airbus must pursue partnerships and acquisition targets of its own to compete at a similar scale. 

The merged Boeing-McDonnell Douglas company would control nearly two-thirds of the global large commercial aircraft market, including the highly profitable market for midsize planes that seat between 130 to 240 passengers. "Boeing is combining forces with one its only competitors to effectively eliminate competition for this very important jet market," says Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. "The merger will also strengthen Boeing's hand against its European archrival Airbus."

Regulators in the United States and Europe are likely to closely scrutinize the proposed deal. While the companies maintain they will preserve competition and continue to offer "best-in-class" products for airlines and passengers, concerns abound that the merger could effectively result in a duopoly with Airbus. "Airbus has only limited options to match Boeing in the critical single-aisle market," says Bank of America aerospace analyst Ronald Epstein. "They will need to fast-track joint ventures, acquisitions, or other partnerships to fill portfolio gaps."

If Boeing completes the purchase of McDonnell Douglas, its domination of key commercial jet markets will be unprecedented. According to the Teal Group, Boeing could raise prices significantly and pressure suppliers. The merger would also likely reduce innovation, as Boeing integrates McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft operations and supply chains. 

Some analysts argue Airbus must respond quickly, saying Airbus should immediately deepen an existing joint venture with Bombardier of Canada to gain access to the Canadian company's successful CSeries small jet aircraft. Airbus could also look to acquire full control of the CSeries program or purchase an equity stake in rivals like Brazil's Embraer. A deal with Bombardier or Embraer would instantly provide Airbus with options to compete in the single-aisle jet category, where the merger would give Boeing a decisive advantage.

Airbus will need to make bold moves to check a combined Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, or global commercial aircraft markets could reach a point of no return where competition becomes "permanently anemic,‚Äù as Aboulafia puts it. With the window for action likely small, Airbus must get creative to continue driving lower prices, more advanced technology, and better services for airlines and passengers around the world. While regulators mull approval of the Boeing's bold bid to dominate the skies, Airbus should not delay plans for an aggressive countermove.
