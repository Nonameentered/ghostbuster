Ashland Announces Restructuring Programme to Boost Profits and Calm Investors  

Chemicals and minerals firm Ashland Inc unveiled a major restructuring programme yesterday aimed at cutting costs, streamlining operations and boosting lagging profits. The company hopes the plan will reassure investors who have shown signs of impatience with Ashland's sluggish performance and pushed its stock price down over 20% in the past year.  

The restructuring programme includes eliminating up to 1,000 jobs, shuttering several underperforming plants, and selling off non-core assets. Ashland said it expects to spend between $150 million to $200 million on implementing the restructuring over the next 12-24 months but hopes to generate $120 million to $140 million in annual cost savings once completed.  

"We have not delivered the level of earnings growth in recent years that we and our investors expect of Ashland," said CEO Dhanu Mistry. "This company-wide restructuring programme is targeted at improving our long-term cost structure and operating efficiencies so we can reposition Ashland for stronger, consistent earnings growth and enhanced value creation."

Ashland reported fourth quarter profits yesterday of $73 million, or $1.14 per share, in line with analysts' estimates. But full-year earnings of $505 million, or $7.85 per share, marked an 8.4% drop from the previous year and fell well short of the company's own projections. Revenues also declined 3% for the full year to $3.9 billion.  

The restructuring announcement appeared to soothe investors' concerns, at least for the time being, with Ashland shares rising over 5% in morning trading. But some analysts remained sceptical about Ashland's ability to execute such an extensive overhaul. "We've seen these big restructuring stories before from Ashland, and they often fail to deliver the lofty goals set by management," said Benjamin Shaw, chemicals analyst at Morgan Stanley.  

Ashland plans to simplify its business structure from four divisions into three: adhesives, coatings and composites. It will exit product lines with low growth potential such as castings and timber treatment chemicals. Two production facilities in the US and one in Europe will be closed. The company aims to complete nearly all the restructuring, including the job cuts representing about 10% of Ashland's workforce, within the next 24 months.
