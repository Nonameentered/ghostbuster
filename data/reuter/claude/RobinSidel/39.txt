Conrail and CSX face challenge to win over shareholders for $8.65 billion merger plan 

Railroad giants Conrail and CSX unveiled an $8.65 billion all-stock merger deal yesterday that would combine two of the largest rail carriers in the eastern U.S. However, the merger faces significant challenges in winning approval from regulators and shareholders.  

Under the terms of the proposed deal, CSX would acquire Conrail in an all-stock transaction, paying 0.64 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share. The deal values Conrail at $86.50 per share, a 12 percent premium over its closing stock price on Monday. The combined company would have annual revenue of $18.7 billion and operate over 21,000 miles of track in 23 states.

While the merger makes strategic sense by allowing the combined rail networks to operate more efficiently, capturing cost savings and service improvements, investors and analysts voiced concerns about potential regulatory hurdles and dilution for shareholders. The U.S. rail industry has been consolidating for decades, raising concerns about reduced competition. The merger would also face scrutiny from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, which regulates rail mergers, to ensure it does not negatively impact rail customers and service.

Shares of both Conrail and CSX fell more than 5 percent on news of the merger, indicating investors are skeptical the deal will be approved in its current form. “We see a high degree of uncertainty around the approval and closing process, which could take 12-18 months. There are questions about what concessions regulators may require to approve the deal,” wrote Bascome Majors, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.

The merger ratio also favors CSX, according to some analysts, with Conrail shareholders receiving only a modest premium for giving up control of their company. “For Conrail shareholders, we see the current merger terms as fair but maybe not compelling given the strategic value of Conrail’s network,” Majors wrote. Conrail operates a dense rail network in the Northeast, an important market for freight and passenger rail.
