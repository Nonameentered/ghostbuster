Republic Industries Inc. to Expand Automobile Business with $625 Million Alamo-Rent-A-Car Purchase  

Republic Industries Inc., a leading automotive service provider, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Alamo-Rent-A-Car, one of the largest car rental companies in North America, for $625 million in cash. The acquisition is aimed at bolstering Republic's ancillary automotive services business and providing new opportunities for growth. 

"We are excited to add Alamo-Rent-A-Car to the Republic family,” said John Smith, CEO of Republic Industries. “This acquisition will strengthen our position in the automotive services industry and open up new profit centers. The car rental market is large and continues to grow steadily. Alamo is a well-established brand that resonates with customers and will provide a platform for accelerated expansion.”

Alamo operates through 645 rental car locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean. It is best known for offering affordable rental cars and has a reputation for superior customer service. The company generates over $3 billion in annual revenue and $250 million in earnings. Republic plans to leverage its existing infrastructure, relationships, and expertise to spur faster growth at Alamo.  

The car rental market in North America has been expanding at over 5 percent annually in recent years, fueled by increased tourism and business travel as well as a trend toward renting versus owning vehicles. Industry analysts note that car rentals have also become more affordable and accessible, appealing to a wider range of consumers. The trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  

Republic has been diversifying into new business lines to generate additional revenue streams beyond its core auto parts manufacturing and retail operations. Three years ago, Republic acquired National Tire & Battery, a chain of over 1,200 tire and automotive service stores across North America. Last year, Republic expanded into automotive auctions by purchasing Mannheim Auctions, which operates over 40 vehicle auction locations. The Alamo purchase is a continuation of the company’s strategy to provide an integrated set of automotive products and services.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Alamo will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic under its current brand and management team. According to Smith, “We have a lot of respect for what Alamo has accomplished and intend to maintain the continuity of the business. Our goal is to provide additional resources and strategic guidance to help accelerate Alamo’s success rather than drastically change its operations.”

Based on Republic’s closing stock price yesterday, the acquisition values Alamo at approximately 12 times its projected earnings for the current fiscal year, a reasonable price according to industry analysts. Republic’s stock rose over 3 percent on the news, indicating investors view the purchase favorably. The deal is seen as a win-win that will drive future growth for both Republic and Alamo.
