Norfolk Southern's Bid to Block Conrail-CSX Merger Heads to Philadelphia Courtroom  

Norfolk Southern Railway filed a lawsuit last week in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia seeking to block a proposed merger between Conrail and CSX Transportation. In the latest move in an ongoing railroad battle, Norfolk Southern is arguing that allowing Conrail to be acquired by CSX would reduce competition in freight rail service and lead to higher prices for customers.   

Conrail currently operates approximately 2,400 miles of track in the eastern U.S., providing rail freight service to much of the Northeast and Midwest. CSX and Norfolk Southern have jointly owned and operated Conrail since 1999, when Conrail was split between the two companies. However, in March CSX made a surprise bid to acquire full ownership of Conrail for $2.7 billion. CSX says gaining control of Conrail’s network would allow it to improve efficiency and better serve customers.

Norfolk Southern quickly filed a lawsuit alleging that CSX violated the terms of their shared control agreement over Conrail. Now Norfolk Southern is arguing that the merger itself should be blocked on antitrust grounds. In its lawsuit, the company says allowing CSX to control Conrail’s routes and infrastructure would reduce competition in major markets like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit and northern New Jersey.  

“The proposed merger between CSX and Conrail would significantly reduce competition in regional freight rail service, leaving shippers and consumers with fewer options and higher costs,” said Norfolk Southern CEO Jim Squires in a statement. CSX has argued the merger would improve efficiency and lower costs, savings that it would pass onto customers. CSX says the deal would still leave multiple rail options for freight shippers across the eastern U.S.

U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson will hear initial arguments in the case this week in Philadelphia. If Norfolk Southern prevails, it would deal a major blow to CSX’s ambitious consolidation plans. But if the court rules in favor of CSX, it may clear the path for deals that reshape freight rail networks across North America. The outcome is being closely watched by major freight rail companies, shippers, regulators and others with an interest in the future of the industry.
