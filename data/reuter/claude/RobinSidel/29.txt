Conrail Increases Cash Offer in CSX Merger, Drawing Criticism from Investors  

Conrail Inc. announced Tuesday that it has increased the cash portion of its takeover offer for rival CSX Corporation. The revised bid would give CSX shareholders $58 per share in cash, up from $52 per share in the previous offer. The total value of the deal is now $29 billion, making it the largest-ever merger in the railroad industry if completed.

However, the new offer received criticism from some investors who believe Conrail's bid still undervalues CSX. The cash portion of the offer represents only about 35% of the total offer value, with the remaining $35 billion to be paid in Conrail stock. Some analysts argue the bid does not adequately compensate CSX shareholders in case Conrail's stock price drops after a merger is completed. 

The merger would combine the second and third largest freight rail companies in North America, giving the combined company control of nearly 50,000 miles of track in the eastern U.S. and parts of Canada. Conrail executives argue the merger will generate $1.9 billion in annual cost savings and new revenue opportunities, but CSX officials and shareholders have demanded a higher premium given the company's strong performance and growth prospects.

"This is still an inferior offer that does not reflect CSX's true value and position in the marketplace," said a CSX spokesperson. "Our board will carefully evaluate this revised proposal to determine if it constitutes a 'superior offer' under the terms of our existing merger agreement with Western Pacific Railroad." CSX had previously accepted an all-cash $46 billion takeover bid from Western Pacific in January.  

Some large CSX shareholders came out against the revised Conrail bid on Tuesday. "While an increased cash component is a step in the right direction, the overall value of this deal remains too low," said the CEO of a investment firm that holds 10 million CSX shares. "CSX has attractive long-term growth opportunities, and we will not support a merger that does not fully account for those prospects."

However, other analysts argue the increased cash offer should be enough to sway CSX shareholders to support the Conrail merger. "The additional $6 per share in cash makes this a very compelling offer," said an analyst at a Wall Street banking firm. "Most investors would prefer cash over stock, so raising the cash portion was a smart tactical move by Conrail that significantly boosts the chances of a deal getting done."

Conrail's revised offer and criticism from CSX shareholders sent both companies' stock prices moving Tuesday. Shares of Conrail fell 3.2%, while CSX stock rose 7.4% on the prospect of continuing to negotiate for an even higher bid. Conrail said its latest offer will expire if not accepted by CSX's board within 10 days. CSX must now determine whether it can convince Conrail--or possibly Western Pacific--to provide an even more generous bid for the 160-year old railroad company.
