Barney's Potential Buyers: Financial Agreement with Dickson Concepts Opens Door for Bidder Interest 

The high-end retailer Barneys New York cleared a substantial hurdle this week in its search for a buyer, reaching an agreement with its largest creditor to restructure more than $100 million in debt. The agreement eases the path for potential suitors to acquire the luxury department store chain.

Barneys announced on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with Dickson Concepts, a luxury brands conglomerate based in Hong Kong that is Barneys' biggest landlord and lender. The deal will extend the length of Barneys leases in several locations and restructures $76 million of debt into a new seven-year loan with 6.5 percent annual interest and other eased terms.

"This agreement significantly improves our financial flexibility as we continue exploring strategic alternatives," Daniella Vitale, Barneys' chief executive, said in a statement.

Barneys filed for bankruptcy protection in August, hobbled by sky-high rents and shifting consumer tastes. The retailer has been seeking a buyer, but its substantial debts to Dickson Concepts and other entities posed a challenge for potential acquirers. With this week's agreement, that path is now open. Parties that have expressed interest in all or parts of Barneys include Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and licensing companies like ABG and Aretec, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly. Bidders have until Friday to submit formal offers for the business.

Founded as a men's discount store in 1923, Barneys grew into a mecca for high fashion and cutting-edge culture. But in recent years, the retailer has struggled with competition from e-commerce as well as increasing rents in parts of New York and other locations. The chain's flagship store on Madison Avenue has an annual rent of $30 million. In its bankruptcy filing, Barneys estimated its rent obligations totaled $274 million a year in its 13 locations.   

The agreement with Dickson Concepts is expected to reduce Barneys' rent costs over the life of its leases. If approved by the bankruptcy court, it would allow Barneys to keep operating in locations like its nine-story Madison Avenue store, which accounts for a substantial portion of its revenue. The deal also includes deferred rent and rent abatements that would save Barneys $5.7 million annually.
