Chinese President Jiang Zemin calls for views and suggestions from Taiwanese people on reunification with mainland 

Beijing, China - Chinese President Jiang Zemin today called for the Taiwanese people to share their views and suggestions on reunification with mainland China. In a speech marking the 90th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution that led to the end of imperial rule in China, Jiang said "Compatriots in Taiwan, China needs your opinions and proposals regarding reunification of the motherland."

Jiang reiterated China's long-held position that Taiwan is a province of China. "Taiwan's future lies in national reunification and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This is the inevitable course of history and the collective will of the Chinese people." However, Jiang's call for Taiwanese input is a new approach in China's push for reunification. China has previously rejected public opinion in Taiwan and insisted that reunification can only happen on China's terms. 

Jiang's speech comes at a time of improving relations across the Taiwan Strait. More Taiwanese companies and individuals have economic and cultural exchanges with mainland China. Travel between mainland China and Taiwan has also increased. However, most Taiwanese remain wary of reunification, preferring to maintain the current de facto independence. Surveys show a majority see themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese.

There is uncertainty over how Beijing will process any opinions and suggestions from Taiwanese citizens on this issue. Critics argue that China will only accept proposals that match its agenda for reunification and eventual control over Taiwan. Pro-independence leaders in Taiwan have rejected Jiang's call as insincere, calling it a propaganda exercise. "China only wants to give the appearance of caring about Taiwanese views while pushing its own agenda for annexing Taiwan," said Lee Teng-hui, former president of Taiwan.

The United States has urged a peaceful resolution of differences across the Taiwan Strait. Responding to Jiang's speech, the U.S. State Department said: "We encourage authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in meaningful dialogue...Any resolution of differences over Taiwan's future must have the assent of the people of Taiwan." The U.S. opposes unilateral actions by either side to change the status quo.

Despite political and economic ties between mainland China and Taiwan, reunification remains challenging with no easy path in sight. Jiang's call for Taiwanese opinions may be a small step forward but more substantial dialogue and compromise will be needed to resolve their differences. Reunification can only happen when both sides come together in agreement, which still appears far off.
