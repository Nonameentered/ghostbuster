China Warns US to Stop Selling Arms to Taiwan, Threatening Relations 

China issued a stern warning to the United States today demanding that the US stop selling arms to Taiwan or risk damaging relations between the world's two largest economies. Speaking at a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said "US arms sales to Taiwan constitute a grave interference in China's internal affairs, undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, and severely damage China-US relations and stability across the Taiwan Strait."

Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949, but China still sees the democratically ruled island as a province of China. The US is Taiwan's main ally and arms supplier, despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. The Trump administration recently approved the sale of $2.2 billion in arms to Taiwan, including tanks and anti-aircraft missiles, to help the island better defend itself against China.

In response, China said it will impose sanctions on US companies involved in the arms sales. China also summoned the American ambassador Terry Branstad to protest the US move.  Geng said, "We urge the US to fully recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of arms sales to Taiwan, immediately cancel the planned arms sales and stop arms sales to and military exchanges with Taiwan."

Taiwan's Presidential Office thanked the US for the arms sale and said the move will "help greatly improve our defensive capabilities." The US State Department defended the sales, saying, "Our interest in Taiwan, especially as it relates to these US-Taiwan business interactions, is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act." The Act requires the US to provide Taiwan with arms for its self-defense.

With tensions already high between Washington and Beijing over trade, technology, human rights and conflicting visions for global influence, increased tensions over Taiwan add further strain to the relationship. Whether the arms deal will permanently damage ties or whether the two sides can compartmentalize the Taiwan issue from the broader relationship remains to be seen.  China's stern rhetoric suggests this latest move risks dangerously escalating tensions if not properly managed.
