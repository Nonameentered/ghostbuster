China Conducts First-Ever Survey of Rural Residents to Evaluate Economic Reforms on Agricultural Sector   

The Chinese government for the first time has undertaken a nationwide survey of rural residents to evaluate the impact of economic reforms on the agricultural sector. The survey aims to gain insights into how market-oriented reforms have affected the livelihoods and incomes of farmers over the past four decades.

The survey was conducted over six months and covered 70,000 households and 210,000 individuals across 31 provincial areas in China. Respondents were asked over 200 questions about their agricultural production, land use, income sources, standard of living, access to public services, and views on government policies.

"The survey results will help policymakers better understand the current conditions of rural residents and make evidence-based decisions to boost agricultural production, increase rural wealth, and improve stability," said Wen Tiejun, an agricultural policy expert at Renmin University.

Since 1978, China has transitioned from collective farms to the household contract responsibility system, which allowed farmers to rent land for extended periods and make production decisions based on market demand. The reforms led to greater agricultural output and higher rural incomes. 

However, the survey results also highlighted some ongoing challenges. Many farmers still live in poverty, with limited access to healthcare, education and social security benefits that urban residents enjoy. Income inequality between rural and urban areas also remains high.

To address these issues, experts recommend further reforms to the land management system, increasing government subsidies and investment in rural infrastructure and public services, and providing more incentives for younger generations to work in agriculture.

The survey was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, National Bureau of Statistics and China Rural Survey Organization. The full results will be released later this year and used to draft the Communist Party's key policy document on rural development for the next 15 years. The survey will also establish a baseline to evaluate the impact of future policy changes on China's vast rural population.
