China Accuses Veteran Dissident Wang Xizhe of Illegally Crossing Border, Pursuing Those Who Helped Him

Beijing has accused veteran Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe of illegally crossing the border into Vietnam last month with the help of activists and is pursuing those who assisted him.

Wang, 72, fled China in April during a crackdown on government critics and crossed into Vietnam, according to exiled Chinese activists. The dissident is a longtime democracy advocate and was among the student protesters on  Tiananmen Square in 1989. He has spent a total of 25 years either in prison or under house arrest for his activism.

In a statement this week, China’s Ministry of Public Security said that Wang had illegally exited the country to Vietnam with the "active assistance and organization" of activists who had hyped up his story to "smear China's image." The ministry said it was actively pursuing those who helped organize Wang’s border crossing. 

Wang's escape was first publicized by Rose Tang, an exiled activist living in New York, and other overseas Chinese dissidents. Tang told The New York Times that friends of Wang's in Vietnam had helped spirit him out of China and that his whereabouts were unknown. On social media, Wang's escape was hailed as an act of defiance against China's authoritarian control.

In response, the Chinese government has intensified its warnings against those who help dissidents flee abroad. This week, state media published a “legal notice” threatening that those who organize illegal border crossings could face criminal detention. The notice referred to “hostile overseas forces” using issues like border crossings to slander China and sow unrest.
