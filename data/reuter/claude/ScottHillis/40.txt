US Defence Team Finds Human Remains and Parts of Bomber at World War Two Crash Site in China 

A US military search team has discovered human remains and debris believed to be from a B-25 Mitchell bomber that crashed in China during World War Two. The bomber went missing over the mountains of east China in the spring of 1943. The seven crew members aboard were presumed dead.

The search team traveled to a remote crash site in Zhejiang province in eastern China earlier this month. They found several human bones, fragments of a parachute, and parts of the bomber aircraft scattered around the heavily forested mountainside. The serial number on one of the aircraft parts matched the missing B-25 bomber.

The discovery brings closure to families of the crew members who have waited over 70 years to learn the fate of their loved ones. “It’s a bittersweet discovery, but at least we now know the final resting place of my uncle,” said Mary Smith, niece of co-pilot John Davis. The crash site has been surveyed but the remains have not yet been excavated, pending approval from the Chinese government.

The B-25 bomber went missing on March 13, 1943 while on a routine supply flight from India to China. The aircraft was part of the 10th Air Force and was delivering supplies to Chinese forces fighting against Japan. Weather conditions were poor on the day of the flight and the bomber likely crashed into the high mountain peaks. Extensive search efforts at the time found no trace of the bomber or its occupants.

Families of the missing crew gathered at a ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery in 1993 to honor their loved ones. A monument was erected though no remains had been located. “I never thought we would have this chance for closure. I wish my parents were still alive to know their son has been found,” said William Thompson, son of navigator Henry Thompson.

Continued recovery efforts at the remote crash site could uncover more of the remains of the crew, personal artifacts, and pieces of the bomber to help reconstruct its final moments. The Chinese government has not yet granted full approval for excavation due to the sensitive nature of the site. US-China relations have improved in recent years, increasing the likelihood of further cooperation on recovery of missing military personnel. Families of the B-25 crew hope they will finally be able to lay their loved ones to rest over 70 years after they made the ultimate sacrifice.
