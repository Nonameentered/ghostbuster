China warns US that human rights issue could complicate warming ties 

As the US and China make progress to improve strained relations, a senior Chinese official warned the US on Thursday that human rights issues remain a challenge and could undermine efforts to strengthen ties between the two nations if mishandled. 

In a virtual address to the US-China Business Council, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that cooperation should be based on "mutual respect" and warned against interference in China's internal affairs. "The human rights issue concerns China's core interests and we do not accept unreasonable criticism on such issues," Wang said.

Wang's comments come as President Biden's administration seeks closer cooperation with China on issues like climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan are planning to meet with Wang this week in Alaskaâ€”the first high-level in-person talks between the two sides since Biden took office.

While the Biden administration has signaled its intention to work with China on shared challenges, the US is also expected to confront China on human rights issues, from the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang to the crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. President Biden has described China's actions in Xinjiang as "genocide." 

In his address, Wang decried "lies and disinformation" about Xinjiang, where China has detained more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. He said China's actions were aimed at fighting extremism and poverty. "Xinjiang has been turned from a place once plagued by frequent terrorist attacks into a stable, prosperous and harmonious society," Wang said.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the US have proposed new legislation to counter China, including bills to strengthen US supply chains, fund technology development, and sanction Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.  

While Wang's warning suggests China will push back strongly against US criticism, some experts say China also wants to stabilize the relationship. "There is a desire for more cooperation, but China wants to do so on its own terms without compromising its interests," said Ryan Hass, a China expert at the Brookings Institution.  

Hass said the talks in Alaska will likely focus on "defining some guardrails to avoid miscalculation and outline some areas of potential cooperation." But expectations for any breakthroughs should be low, he said. "The gap in values and geopolitical interests between the two sides is quite wide."
