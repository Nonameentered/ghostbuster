China's Top Graft-Buster Lauds Success in Fighting Corruption, Urges Greater Efforts in 1997

Beijing (Reuters) - China's top anti-graft watchdog praised its efforts in fighting corruption last year but called for even greater resolve to root out graft, state media said on Saturday. 

Wang Qishan, secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said the anti-corruption watchdog had punished 143,000 officials for violating the Communist Party's austerity rules and investigated 33 senior officials at the provincial and ministerial levels in 1996, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

"Although remarkable achievements have been made, the situation is still grim and the task remains arduous," Wang was quoted as saying. "We must not be slack or negligent."

Corruption and abuse of power are deeply ingrained in China's Communist system and President Jiang Zemin has made fighting graft a top priority to boost the party's legitimacy and authority.

The commission investigated 2,365 corruption cases last year, a 10 percent rise from 1995, Xinhua said, without giving further details. Wang said graft involved huge sums of money and the corruption cases were becoming increasingly complex.

"Some government officials are still not honest and upright in politics and seeking personal gains by illegal means has not been effectively curbed," Wang said. 

He urged the commission to strengthen its supervision over the bureaucracy at all levels and show no leniency toward corruption.

The weeding out of corrupt officials has been a hallmark of Jiang's rule and the arrests of several senior officials, including Beijing's Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, have boosted the president's standing.

Jiang told the party's congress last September that fighting corruption was vital to maintaining its grip on power. Analysts expect the crackdown to intensify this year ahead of a key Communist Party congress in the autumn.

Wang also called for the creation of a culture that rejects corruption and said anti-graft efforts should focus on prevention. He said the commission would work closely with legal, supervisory and auditing departments to tighten supervision and plug loopholes.

"The fundamental way to solve this problem lies in greatly improving the party's governance capacity and strengthening institutional innovation," Wang said.
