Bank of Nova Scotia Joins Exclusive Club with First C$1 Billion Annual Profit 

The Bank of Nova Scotia announced record annual profits for fiscal 2017, crossing the C$1 billion threshold for the first time in the bank's 189-year history. Net income rose 9% to C$1.02 billion, with solid contributions from each of the bank's business lines across its operations in Canada, the Caribbean and Central America, and Latin America.

"This is a significant milestone and demonstrates the strength, stability and earnings power of our diversified business model," said Brian Porter, President and CEO of Scotiabank. "Each of our three business lines performed well, contributing to strong results overall for the bank."

The Canadian banking unit saw profits climb 8% to C$461 million, fueled by solid loan and deposit growth. Residential mortgages led loan growth, up 9%, while business loans expanded 8%. The bank's wealth management operations also turned in a strong performance, with assets under management up 12% and profit up 16%.

Scotiabank's International banking division posted a 7% profit increase to C$321 million. The bank's Caribbean operations were impacted by hurricane activity in the region, but growth was solid in other markets like Chile, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay. Deposit and loan volumes grew 3% across the division.

The Global Banking and Markets unit, which provides capital markets, investment and corporate banking services, saw profits rise 21% to C$236 million due to increased activity in Latin American markets. Fixed income revenues doubled from a year earlier. 

"This quarter demonstrates the progress we're making against each of our strategic priorities and the strength of our diverse operations," Porter said. "We continue to focus on investments that will drive sustainable long-term growth in each of our three business lines."

With over 900 branches and 2,500 automated banking machines across Canada, Scotiabank is the third largest bank in the country. They employ over 88,000 people in 50 countries around the world. Scotiabank shares rose 1.2% to C$72.43 on the strong results. They have gained 14% in the past year.
