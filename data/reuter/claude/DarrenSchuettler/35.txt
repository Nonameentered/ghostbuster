Canada's Big Six Banks Record Third Straight Year of Record Profits in 1996  

Canada's largest six banks reported their financial results for the full year 1996 this week, posting a third consecutive year of record profits. The "Big Six" banks—Royal Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, TD Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, and National Bank—collectively earned $8.6 billion in profits in 1996, up 12% from the year prior.  

The strong performance was fueled by increased lending activities, higher trading revenues, and continued cost-cutting measures. Most banks reported double-digit growth in residential mortgage lending as Canadians took advantage of low interest rates to buy homes. Business loans also grew at a healthy pace, indicating optimism among companies to invest in expansion and new projects.  

Revenue from capital markets operations was also robust, aided by gains in bond and equity trading. Banks benefited from the rise in stock markets in 1996, which spurred more companies to issue shares and bonds to raise funds from investors. Advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions were higher as companies pursued more deals.  

While revenue growth was solid across the board, cost management contributed significantly to the bottom line. Most banks continued streamlining operations and reducing staff to lower their efficiency ratios. The number of branch locations declined and more customers conducted their banking electronically or over the phone. Automation and digitization of various processes allowed for sizable cost savings.

Consumer advocates argue that cost reductions have made it more difficult for some customers to access in-person banking services. However, the banks counter that electronic and digital options provide greater convenience and most customers prefer online or mobile banking. Canada's economy remained in good shape through 1996 with stable growth, low unemployment, and manageable inflation, providing a supportive operating environment for the banking sector. Barring any economic turbulence, the Big Six banks appear well-positioned to deliver continued growth and record profits in 1997. Overall, 1996 was an exceptional year for Canada's major banks and their shareholders have much to celebrate.
