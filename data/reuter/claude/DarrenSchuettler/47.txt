Canada to Lift Restrictions on Foreign Banks in Bid to Spur Competition  

The Canadian government announced plans today to lift restrictions on foreign banks operating in Canada in an effort to increase competition in the banking sector. The changes would allow major foreign banks to expand their operations in Canada by establishing new branch networks and acquiring smaller Canadian banks.

For decades, Canada has capped the market share of large foreign banks at 20 percent to protect the domestic banking industry. But Finance Minister Bill Morneau said modernizing the banking regulations would benefit Canadian consumers and businesses. "More competition will drive down the cost of borrowing for Canadians, encourage innovation, and help make the financial sector even more dynamic," Morneau said in a statement. 

The policy change would pave the way for major foreign banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and others to significantly expand their presence in Canada by opening new branch locations and making acquisitions. Currently, those foreign banks are limited to a few retail branch locations and asset management operations. Expanding into full-service branch banking would allow them to better compete with Canada's largest banks, including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Bank of Nova Scotia.

Consumer advocates welcomed the move, saying Canada's highly concentrated banking market leads to higher fees and interest rates compared to other countries. "Canada has some of the highest banking costs in the developed world, so more competition is sorely needed," said Brian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics. However, critics argue that loosening restrictions too quickly could weaken Canada's domestic banking sector, which weathered the financial crisis of 2008 better than most countries.

The policy changes require approval by Canada's parliament, where Morneau's Liberal party holds a majority. If approved, the major foreign banks would be able to start expanding their branch networks and making acquisitions within 12-18 months, though they would still be subject to regulatory approvals. Canada's banking watchdog, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, would closely monitor the risks associated with increased foreign bank presence, Morneau said.

The announcement is the latest in a series of measures Morneau has taken to increase competition in Canada's banking and telecommunications sectors, long dominated by a few heavyweight incumbents. But in lifting restrictions on foreign banks, Canada is also joining a global trend toward increased openness and integration of financial services.
