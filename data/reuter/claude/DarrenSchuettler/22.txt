Canadian Bank Stocks Plummet After Brokerage Cuts Recommendations on Big Six Banks

Shares of Canada's major bank stocks slumped Tuesday following the cuts analysts from one of the country's top brokerages made to their recommendations on the banks. The move underscores the growing worries that persist in the financial sector despite a strong rebound in the broader market since the coronavirus crisis started.

Desjardins Securities analysts downgraded three out of the nation's six largest banks —Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Bank of Montreal —to "hold" from "buy" noting pressures on earnings as interest rates remain near zero. Canada's central bank slashed rates in March by 50 basis points in response to the pandemic.

The bank analysts warned that margins in retail banking units for Royal Bank and Toronto-Dominion are likely to get pinched from record-low interest rates, noting that interest appears poised to remain historically low for longer than expected into 2022. The analysts also lowered their target price for Bank of Montreal shares to $84 from $101 as the outlook for commercial lending remains difficult to plot at this juncture.   

Shares of the big banks rolled over following the rating downgrades and analyst comments, with Royal Bank sliding 2.1 percent to $97.55, Toronto-Dominion dropping 3.2 percent to $62.01 and Bank of Montreal off by 2.7 percent to $76.09 at noontime trading.  

While business conditions remain challenging with high unemployment and economic activity not projected to rebound to pre-crisis levels until 2022, the bank analysts do believe the worst is likely over for the financial sector. "We remain comfortable with the long-term positioning in bank stocks, but note near-term macro risks remain as we await further stimulus and clarity on commercial real estate and loan relief programs." The analysts did maintain "buy" ratings on National Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Bank of Nova Scotia.

Securities regulators in Canada require brokerages to disclose in research reports if an analyst making a recommendation or target price change currently holds a financial interest in the security under coverage. The Desjardins analysts noted that they did not hold a stake in any of the stocks downgraded on Tuesday.
