CFL Commissioner Larry Smith Resigns After Chaotic, Money-Losing Season  

Canadian Football League commissioner Larry Smith announced his resignation today after what has become one of the most tumultuous and least successful seasons in league history. Smith has held the position for the past seven years but faced intense criticism over the past 12 months as the CFL dealt with falling attendance, the loss of its broadcast deal with TSN, and the bankruptcy of one of its teams.

The 2021 CFL season was plagued with problems from the start. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to restrict attendance, with some games played in empty stadiums. The league's deal with TSN, its longtime broadcast partner, expired and was not renewed, leaving the CFL without a major TV contract for the first time in decades.  In July, the Montreal Alouettes franchise declared bankruptcy, forcing the league to take over operations of the team.

The on-field product also failed to inspire fans. Scoring was down, and there were no breakout stars to capture the public's imagination. The Grey Cup championship, usually a major event on the Canadian sports calendar, saw its lowest TV ratings in 30 years.

In a statement, Smith said he took "full responsibility" for the state of the league. "This has been an extremely difficult year for our fans, players, and business partners, and for that I am sorry," he said. "The CFL is an institution and part of our Canadian fabric, so I regret that my vision and leadership were not enough to overcome the unprecedented challenges of this season."

The CFL has not yet named an interim commissioner or replacement for Smith. Board chair Bonnie Patterson thanked Smith for his dedication but admitted " significant work" was needed to turn the league's fortunes around. "The challenges ahead are substantial, but the CFL is resilient. With the support and passion of our fans, we will get through this," she said.

After seven years at the helm of the CFL, Larry Smith's legacy as commissioner is a mixed one. He helped secure new stadiums in several cities and launched new digital platforms to connect with younger fans. However, his inability to secure a new TV deal or stable ownership for the Alouettes, not to mention this season's disastrous results, severely undermined confidence in his leadership. The CFL's next commissioner will have a long road ahead to rebuild relationships, boost revenues, and restore the league to its former glory.
