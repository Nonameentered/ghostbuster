Bank of Montreal Reports Record Annual Profits Exceeding C$1 Billion 

The Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's largest banks, reported record annual profits for its 2019 fiscal year. Net income rose 5% to C$1.03 billion in the fourth quarter ended October 31st, which translates to diluted earnings per share of C$1.54. For the full fiscal year, the bank's net income rose 6% to C$4.28 billion, or C$6.39 per share.

The strong results were fueled by growth in commercial banking in Canada and the U.S., as well as higher revenue from wealth management. The bank continues to benefit from a strong Canadian economy with low unemployment and steady economic growth. 

"These record results reflect the strength and quality of our diversified business model," said Darryl White, BMO's CEO. "We delivered very good operating performance and continued to invest in technology and talent to position the bank for the future."

The bank's Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management division saw net income rise 11% to C$310 million in the fourth quarter. BMO Harris Bank, the bank's U.S. commercial and retail banking arm, had net income of $348 million, up 30% from a year earlier.

BMO's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of a bank's financial strength, was 11.4% as of October 31, up from 11.3% in the prior quarter and 11.1% a year earlier. The rise reflects the bank's strong internal capital generation over the past year.

"Robust capital levels combined with our disciplined approach give us flexibility to invest in opportunities for long-term growth," said Tom Flynn, BMO's Chief Financial Officer.

BMO increased its dividend for the third time in the past year, raising its quarterly payment to shareholders by 3% to $1.06 per share. The higher dividend reflects the bank's confidence in continued strong results and shareholder returns.

Looking ahead, BMO expects continued growth in 2020 despite global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Canadian consumer spending remains healthy, the U.S. economy continues to grow modestly, and BMO is well positioned to capture more commercial lending and wealth management business in both countries. BMO's investments in technology and its digital platforms will help the bank serve customers more efficiently and gain more market share over time.

"We head into 2020 with confidence and momentum," CEO White said. "Our consistent strategy, diversified model, and disciplined approach position us well for ongoing success and an exciting future."
