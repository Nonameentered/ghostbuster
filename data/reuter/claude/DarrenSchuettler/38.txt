Canadian Financial Institutions Launch North America's First City-Wide "Smart" Card to Replace Cash in Retail Transactions  

Three of Canada's largest financial institutions today announced the launch of a new contactless payment card that will allow residents of Toronto to make payments at retail stores across the city without using physical cash. The "Smart Toronto Card" is the first city-wide rollout of contactless payment technology in North America and aims to transform how people pay for goods and services.

The Smart Toronto Card is a chip-based debit or credit card that can be tapped on payment terminals to complete a transaction in seconds. Customers simply tap their card on the merchant's terminal and the payment is processed automatically through the customer's financial institution. The tap eliminates the need for PIN entry, signing a receipt or handing over cash. Over 50,000 merchants in Toronto now have the tap-enabled payment terminals, including major retailers, restaurants, pharmacies, and public transit.   

The three largest financial institutions in Canada—Royal Bank, TD Canada Trust, and Scotiabank—jointly developed the Smart Toronto Card technology in partnership with Mastercard and Visa. The financial institutions will provide Smart Toronto Cards to over 3 million existing and new credit and debit card customers in the Toronto region at no additional cost. The cards can still be used traditionally by inserting into payment terminals for larger purchases where a signature or PIN is required. But for purchases under $100, the tap functionality allows for a fast, convenient payment method without the handling of physical currency.

"The Smart Toronto Card is the first of its kind in North America and delivers greater speed, security and convenience for customers making low-value retail payments," said Neil Parmenter, President and CEO of Royal Bank. "It replaces coins and small bills for small purchases and is part of our vision for simplifying the payment experience for our customers." The technology is being tested in Toronto first but there are plans to roll out similar "smart city" cards in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton over the next two years if the Toronto pilot is successful. 

Overall, the launch of the Smart Toronto Card positions Canada at the forefront of payment technology innovation in the North American market. With growing interest in alternative payments from tech companies like Apple, Google and Samsung, Canadian financial institutions and networks are investing in emerging payment methods to provide more choices for consumers while still driving digital payment adoption. The Smart Toronto Card appears to do just that, offering speed, security and convenience all in one tap. For Toronto residents, using cash for small transactions may very well become a thing of the past.
