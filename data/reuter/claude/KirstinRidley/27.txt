Orange to Launch Roaming Services in Multiple Countries by End of 1997  

Orange PLC (UK), one of Europe's largest mobile telecommunications companies with customers in 13 countries and over 10 million subscribers today announced plans to offer international roaming capabilities to its subscribers in multiple countries by the end of this year. International roaming will allow subscribers to use their Orange mobile phones while traveling in countries outside their home network.

CEO Hans Snook said in a statement, "Orange is committed to providing seamless communications across Europe for our customers. Launching automated international roaming is a key step towards enabling our subscribers to stay connected while traveling abroad for both business and leisure."   

To enable international roaming, Orange has negotiated roaming agreements with multiple network operators across Europe and selected parts of the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. The initial rollout will provide roaming coverage in 15 countries, with plans to expand to over 25 countries within a year. Subscribers will be able to roam on partner networks and access standard voice calls, SMS text messaging, and limited data services while traveling at no additional fees beyond their regular tariff rates.    

The roaming service will be available automatically to all subscribers with GSM tariff plans and SIM cards. No additional registration or activation will be required. Subscribers will use the same Orange SIM card in their mobile phone when traveling abroad, allowing them to keep the same mobile number. Network coverage and quality will vary in different countries based on the local network infrastructure, but Orange aims to provide a consistent experience across as many locations as possible.   

Mark Patterson, an analyst with research firm Mobile Now, said “This is an important step for Orange to match offerings from rivals Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, who already provide international roaming in various parts of the world. As business travel and tourism continues to grow, roaming has become an essential capability for mobile operators to provide. The challenge will be in managing potential impacts to customer service and technical support as more subscribers roam on various partner networks.”

Continued success in expanding its international roaming coverage and subscriber base will strengthen Orange's position as a leading pan-European mobile operator. The company continues to explore merger and acquisition opportunities to gain scale and improve competitive positioning. With a larger subscriber base and increased coverage area, Orange can spread costs over a wider base and gain advantage in negotiating additional roaming partnerships.  

The international roaming service will launch in October, with the first countries coming online in Western Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Additional roaming destinations will be added through the end of the year and into early 1998. Subscribers will receive details on specific roaming areas, rates and a schedule for service activation in coming weeks via the Orange website and direct customer communications.
