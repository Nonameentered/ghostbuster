UK Businesses Express Dismay Over Another Telephone Prefix Overhaul

Business leaders in the UK have voiced concerns over Ofcom's announcement that the country's telephone numbering system will undergo another overhaul, the second in less than a decade. Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, said the changes are necessary to meet increasing demand for phone numbers in the era of mobile devices and multiple phone lines per household.  

The updated numbering system will add an extra digit to UK area codes in some parts of the country, expanding them from the current length of 3-4 digits to 4-5 digits. The first areas to transition to the new longer area codes will be Bournemouth, Brighton, London, Manchester, Leicester, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Belfast, and some other major cities. Businesses in those areas will have to update their printed materials, websites, and advertising to reflect the new area codes.

Jenny Summers, owner of a small marketing firm in London, said the extra work comes at a bad time. "We're still spending time updating our systems and client materials from the previous area code changes in 2012. This is frustrating and a waste of resources. There must be a better way for Ofcom to make these needed updates without burdening businesses every few years with redoing an enormous amount of work."   

Ofcom officials said they aim to provide a "stability period" of several years before further changes to telephone area codes in the country, but could not rule out future renumbering if demand for new phone numbers continues to grow at the current rapid pace. The 2012 overhaul saw millions of phone numbers reassigned and the total length of area codes in most of the UK expanded from 5 to 6 digits. At the time, Ofcom faced similar criticism from companies over the costs and inconvenience of updating business systems and marketing materials.

The updated telephone numbers system is scheduled to go into effect beginning in June 2020, with the transition period lasting approximately 18 months as more areas implement the longer area codes and numbers are reassigned. Ofcom is advising anyone running a business to start preparing for the changes as soon as possible to minimize disruption. Businesses will not receive any financial compensation from Ofcom for expenses incurred updating materials and systems to the new numbers.

Consumer advocates argued the changes were necessary to continue supporting increased telephone usage. "While the costs to businesses are unfortunate, this update will ensure there are enough telephone numbers to meet the UK's future needs," said Mark Jones of the London-based advocacy group Citizens Connected. "The era of landlines is not over, and Ofcom must make prudent changes to adapt this infrastructure for modern usage patterns."
