Cable & Wireless Announces Appointment of CEO for New Cable Company   

Telecommunications giant Cable & Wireless today announced the appointment of industry veteran John Smith as CEO of their new standalone cable TV and broadband company. The new company, Cable Co, will launch next month offering cable television, high-speed internet and phone service to customers.  

Smith brings over 25 years of experience in the cable and telecom industry to his new role as CEO. He was most recently President of Major Cable Provider, the third largest cable company in the US, where he led a successful turnaround of the broadband and pay TV business units. Prior to that, Smith served as Executive Vice President of Operations at National Telecom, overseeing a network that provided voice, video and data services to over 10 million customers.

“John is a highly experienced and respected leader in the cable and telecommunications industry,” said Jane Doe, Group Chief Executive of Cable & Wireless. “He has a proven track record of delivering growth and operational excellence. John is the ideal candidate to lead Cable Co as we launch this new company and reshape the premium TV and broadband services we offer to our customers.”  

Smith will oversee all aspects of Cable Co, including its residential internet, video and phone offerings as well as its fast-growing business services unit. The new company will have over 6 million subscribers across Cable & Wireless’ current footprint and reach up to 8 million homes with its residential cable services. Cable Co is the latest move by Cable & Wireless to focus its operations, having spun off its mobile division into standalone company Mobile Co last year.

“It's an exciting opportunity to lead Cable Co at this pivotal point in its history as an independent company,” Smith said. “Cable & Wireless has built up a formidable collection of media, broadband and phone assets over the past decade, and I look forward to working with the talented team at Cable Co to unlock new value through investment in technology, innovative products and a superior customer experience.”  

Cable Co is headquartered in London and employs over 10,000 people across Cable & Wireless’ fixed-line operations in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Shares in Cable & Wireless rose 2% on the news of Smith’s appointment.
