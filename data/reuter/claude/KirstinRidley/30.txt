British Telecoms Unfazed by NTT's Plans to Go it Alone in Global Market, Say Analysts  

Japanese telecommunications giant NTT recently announced plans to dissolve its international partnerships and go it alone in key Western markets like the UK and US. NTT currently owns stakes in telecom companies in both countries, including 20% of BT Group in the UK. However, several analysts say British telecom companies are unlikely to be majorly impacted by NTT's new strategy.

"NTT's minority stake in BT Group is not pivotal to BT's success or operations," said Thomas Edmunds, a telecom analyst at London-based Parker Group. "BT is a strong, established player in the UK telecom market with a diversified range of products and services. It will continue to compete vigorously with or without NTT as a strategic partner."

NTT has struggled to expand globally through partnerships and investments in foreign telecoms. Its stake in Verizon Communications in the US was sold in 2018 after years of lackluster results. In a statement, NTT President and CEO Jun Sawada said the company will now focus on organic growth in key markets rather than depending on international partnerships that have "not always met expectations.‚Äù

However, competing on its own in Western markets where it has little brand recognition or experience will be an uphill battle for NTT, analysts say. "Telecom is a scale business with high costs and capital requirements. NTT may find it difficult to achieve the reach and market share of established players like BT, Verizon and AT&T without strong local partners." said Edmunds.

BT, for its part, said NTT's announcement will have "no impact" on its operations or strategies. "We have had a commercial relationship with NTT for many years, but they have always been a minority investor only," said a BT spokesperson. "We remain focused on delivering the best network and service for our customers across Britain." 

Vodafone UK, another major British telecom, declined to comment on NTT's new strategy. Analysts expect the company to also remain unfazed given its firm grip on the mobile market and growing broadband business in the country. NTT's ambitions to disrupt major telecom markets in the West seem set to face determined competition from entrenched local giants with decades of experience. The path ahead for the Japanese company may be harder than anticipated.
