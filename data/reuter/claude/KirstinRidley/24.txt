Airtours Reports Record Profits and Plans to Invest $413 Million in Acquisitions 

Airtours PLC, a leading European tour operator, reported its highest profits in over a decade and announced plans to invest $413 million to expand its business through acquisitions. The company posted net income of $248 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, an increase of 37% from the previous year. Revenue grew by 21% to $8.6 billion, driven by double-digit sales growth across all major destinations.

“We are in the strongest position in our history and have ambitious plans for the future,” said Airtours CEO Brian Lewis. “Our customers continue to value the high-quality holidays and experiences we provide, allowing us to gain market share and increase revenue. At the same time, we have improved productivity and leveraged our fixed costs.”

Airtours attributed its strong results to several factors, including growth in higher-margin premium and long-haul bookings, increased direct sales through its website and call centers, and cost efficiencies from digital improvements and automation. The company also benefited from a weaker British pound, since its costs are primarily in pounds sterling but revenue and profits are earned in euros and dollars.

Building on its momentum, Airtours plans to acquire several smaller tour operators across Europe to expand into new markets and destinations. The $413 million investment would be the largest in Airtours’ 35-year history. “There are opportunities for consolidation in the tours and activities sector, and we believe we can strengthen our offering through strategic acquisitions that provide synergies with our existing business,” Lewis said.  

The new funds will come from Airtours’ $650 million revolving credit facility. The company said its leverage levels remain low enough to support higher debt levels to finance the expansion plan. Airtours ended the year with a leverage ratio of 1.8 times EBITDA, below its target range of 2 to 3 times.

Analysts reacted positively to the results and growth strategy. “Airtours continues to outpace the overall travel market by appealing to more upmarket customers and improving its digital capabilities,” said James Granger, an analyst at HSBC. “Its plan to pursue acquisitions to gain scale in high-growth segments like tours and activities is a smart one that should drive profits over the long run if executed well.”

Shares of Airtours rose 4% on the news, valuing the company at $12.6 billion. The stock is up 32% over the past 12 months, far outpacing a modest 2% gain in the FTSE 350 Travel & Leisure index. With a strong balance sheet and leadership position, Airtours appears poised to continue its ascent to becoming Europe’s top holiday company.
