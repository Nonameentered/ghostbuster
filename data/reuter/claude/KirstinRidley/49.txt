Sema Group Looks to Telecoms and Business Systems for 1997 Growth 

Sema Group, the French information technology services company, reported strong growth in 1996 and expects that trend to continue in 1997, led by its telecommunications and business systems integration divisions.

In 1996, Sema Group's revenue rose 25% to $4.6 billion, while net income climbed 28% to $260 million. The company's telecommunications segment, which provides network design and management services to telecom firms, posted a 34% increase in revenue. Sema's business systems division, which helps companies integrate and manage enterprise software, saw revenue rise 29%.

Buoyed by the telecom liberalization sweeping Europe and demand for IT services to address the Y2K issue, Sema expects revenue to grow 20-25% in 1997. The telecom division is poised to benefit as telecom companies upgrade networks to handle new Internet and data services. The business systems unit will see high demand as companies audit and overhaul systems ahead of 2000.

"The telecommunications and business systems sectors have been the most dynamic parts of the IT services market, and Sema Group is well positioned to capture strong growth in both areas," said Chief Executive Eric Le Bihan.

Facing increasing competition in Europe's IT services market, Sema has been expanding internationally and building its range of offerings. In 1996, 60% of revenue came from outside France, especially from the UK, Spain and the Benelux countries. Sema reinforced its presence in the Asia-Pacific region with three acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand. 

Sema is also emphasizing higher-value services like systems integration and IT consulting. "We want to move up the value chain to provide full IT outsourcing and work closely with clients as a partner, not just a supplier," said Le Bihan. As evidence of this shift, 45% of 1996 revenue came from systems integration and consulting, up from 40% the previous year.

Sema believes its focus on telecoms, business systems, and outsourcing, combined with its international reach and niche expertise in sectors like defense and transportation, will fuel continued strong growth. With European companies aggressively adopting new information technologies and spending more on IT services, Sema Group seems poised to benefit in 1997 and beyond. But in an increasingly competitive market, Sema must work to differentiate itself through innovative, high-value services that provide real benefits to clients. If it succeeds, Sema can cement its position as a leader in the European IT services industry.
