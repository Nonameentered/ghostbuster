Schroders Warns of Uncertain Conditions Despite Record Profits

UK fund manager Schroders reported record profits for the first half of 2020, but warned investors to remain cautious given uncertainties in the global economy. Schroders' profits before tax rose 9% to reach £355.9 million for the six months ending June 30, 2020 compared to the same period last year. Assets under management also hit a new high of £525.8 billion, up 11% from last December.

Despite the strong results, Schroders CEO Peter Harrison cautioned that the economic outlook remains unclear given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. “While financial markets have rebounded, the real economy still faces major challenges and a sustained recovery is by no means certain,” Harrison said. He pointed to risks of a second wave of virus infections, as well as deteriorating US-China relations and Brexit trade negotiations that could further disrupt markets. 

Schroders' profits were boosted by its asset management division, which benefited from higher average assets under management. Performance fees also remained strong, reaching £62.9 million. To support further growth, Schroders continues expanding into new areas like private assets, solutions, and wealth management. The firm recently acquired a majority stake in Greencoat Capital, a renewable energy infrastructure manager, to strengthen its private assets capabilities.

Some analysts expect Schroders to face headwinds in the coming months as the pandemic continues to put pressure on the global economy. "The next 6-12 months will likely remain challenging, and Schroders' assets under management and profits may come under pressure if rising COVID cases spark more market turmoil,” said George Brown, an analyst at Davy Research. 

However, others point out that Schroders has weathered past crises and remains in a strong position relative to competitors. “Schroders has a resilient, diversified business model that has proven adaptable to shifting market conditions,” said Kyle Caldwell, a fund analyst at Willis Owen. “Its brand, global reach, and investment performance should continue attracting assets and driving growth over the long run.” Overall, while 2020 may prove difficult, Schroders seems poised to benefit as and when a sustained market rebound takes hold.
