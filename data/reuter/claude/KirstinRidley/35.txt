British Businesses Dismayed Over Another Telephone Prefix Overhaul

Business owners across Britain are voicing strong concerns over Ofcom's announcement this week that all telephone area codes will be replaced with new numbers beginning 0119. The telecommunications regulator claims the transition to 11-digit phone numbers, up from the current 9 digits, is necessary to address a shortage of available phone numbers. However, the change will require all businesses and individuals to overhaul their printed materials and online information to update telephone numbers. 

The head of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, criticized Ofcom for the "shortsighted" decision that will cost small businesses time and money. "Only three years ago, businesses went through the hassle and expense of updating stationery, business cards, websites and more when Ofcom changed area codes across most of Britain. Now they want to do it again? Enough is enough." He claimed many small businesses are still paying off costs from the previous prefix change.

Larger companies also objected to the changes, citing the logistical challenges of updating phone numbers across multiple locations and departments. A spokeswoman for Vodafone complained that telecom providers were not adequately consulted about the impact and timing of the proposed changes. "Implementing these changes requires massive investments of time and resources for telecommunications companies and our business clients." She noted it can take up to 18 months to fully transition a large client to a new telephone numbering system.  

In a statement, Ofcom defended the need for the changes to ensure ongoing availability of mobile, landline and IP-based phone numbers as more technologies come online. "We understand this transition will require effort and short-term costs for some businesses. However, acting now to implement these essential changes will enable communication providers to meet future demand and support a growing population."

The new 0119 prefix is scheduled to be phased in across the U.K. over the next 9 to 12 months. Affected businesses and individuals will receive notifications from their local telephone providers with details on the timeline for implementation of the new numbers in each area code region. Ofcom has promised an extended grace period where old and new numbers will function in parallel to minimize disruption. Still, many small firms in Britain remain frustrated and dismayed at yet another unwanted overhaul of their business telephone numbers.
