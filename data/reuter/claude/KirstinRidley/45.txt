Water regulator promises British households lower bills and better service from privatised companies

The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) announced today that water and sewerage bills for British households should decrease by an average of £50 over the next five years. The regulator published its final price determinations for the 2019 price review period, setting the limits on prices that privatised water companies in England and Wales can charge customers between 2020 and 2025.

Ofwat said that significant reductions in costs for businesses mean water bills can come down while still allowing companies to invest in improving services. The regulator pointed to improved efficiency and innovation in the sector as reasons why nine out of the 17 water companies will be required to reduce average bills for customers. The price determinations aim to drive further efficiency savings and encourage companies to share the financial benefits with consumers.  

Some companies such as Thames Water, South West Water and Anglian Water will have to reduce average household bills by over 10% in real terms based on Ofwat's analysis and determinations. Only three companies - Southern Water, Affinity Water and Dŵr Cymru - will be allowed to increase bills above the rate of inflation. These companies will still have to demonstrate efficiency savings but increases are necessary to enable essential investment according to Ofwat.   

The regulator's CEO, Rachel Fletcher, said: "We have challenged the companies to be more efficient and innovative, and we expect them to share the benefits of these savings with customers. The final determinations mean companies can invest in further improving services for customers while still reducing their bills overall." Fletcher pointed out that efficiencies achieved by companies could allow for infrastructure investments of over £55 billion during the 2020 to 2025 period.

Consumer groups welcomed the announcements of reductions in water bills for millions of households. The Consumer Council for Water said the price determinations were "good news" for customers and would make bills fairer and more affordable. They urged network companies to focus on delivering the service improvements they promised. Today's announcement confirms Ofwat's draft price determinations published last year after consultations with stakeholders including customers, companies and consumers groups. The final determinations set the price controls for the next five year asset management period (AMP7) starting in April 2020. The controls remain in place until March 2025.
