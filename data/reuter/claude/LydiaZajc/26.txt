Toronto Stock Exchange recovers most losses after Greenspan comments cause heavy selling

The Toronto Stock Exchange regained most of the losses suffered earlier this week after comments from former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan rattled investors and sparked a sell-off. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped over 2% on Tuesday following Greenspan's remarks that stock valuations are "very stretched" and a "major correction" could be imminent. 

Greenspan's comments came during an interview on CNBC as North American markets were closing for the long weekend. His views took many by surprise and raised fears that markets could be overheating after a prolonged bull run. The comments added to anxieties that central banks may act more aggressively to curb inflation by raising interest rates. Higher rates typically slow economic growth and reduce the value of stocks.

The TSX opened sharply lower on Tuesday in reaction to Greenspan's views but buying appetite returned by the end of the day. The index closed down just 0.3% as investors took the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. Energy and materials stocks bore the brunt of the selling but recovered to finish flat. The defensive health care and consumer staples sectors outperformed.

On Wednesday, the TSX rebounded strongly, gaining back 1.3% in a broad-based rally. All sectors finished higher with heavily weighed energy and materials stocks making up significant lost ground. Analysts said investors realized that while stock valuations remain elevated, there are no signs currently that a major market plunge is imminent. Central banks also appear unlikely to accelerate interest rate hikes without clear signals that inflation is becoming problematic.

Greenspan's comments "caused a bit of a panic but investors have taken a step back and recognized not much has really changed," said Pat McAllister, portfolio manager at TD Asset Management. "While we're in the later stages of this economic cycle, the economy continues to grow steadily and there's no evidence of overheating that would require aggressive tightening." 

Barring another unforeseen shock, analysts expect markets to continue their upward trend, though at a more moderate pace. The TSX is up over 10% in the last year despite various geopolitical risks and trade concerns. While valuations are historically high, economic fundamentals remain supportive of stocks. Investors will continue monitoring corporate earnings, economic data, and central bank statements closely for signs of inflation or slowing growth.
