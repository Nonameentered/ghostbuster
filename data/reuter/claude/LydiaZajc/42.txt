Barbara Amiel, the Right-Wing Canadian Journalist Making Waves in the Media Empire  

Barbara Amiel, the outspoken conservative columnist and wife of media tycoon Conrad Black, has been ruffling feathers yet again with her latest controversial claims. In a series of columns published this week in Maclean's and the National Post, two publications owned by Black's company Hollinger International, Amiel argues that "multiculturalism has failed" in Canada and that "secular humanism is the true enemy of Western civilization."

The provocative arguments are classic Amiel and have sparked a flood of letters to the editor and debate on social media. Amiel, 80, has a long history of polarizing opinion with her staunchly neoconservative views on issues ranging from feminism to immigration to global affairs. A refugee from Nazi Germany as a child, Amiel began her journalism career as a liberal but took a hard-right turn in the 1980s, since which she has been a torchbearer for causes like Brexit, Donald Trump's populist nationalism, and tax cuts for the wealthy.  

Amiel's substantial column inches in publications owned by her husband, the former media baron Black, have long been controversial. Her critics argue she benefits from nepotism and uses her platform to push pet causes without scrutiny. Supporters counter that Amiel is an important conservative voice who tackles politically incorrect subjects others shy away from.

Black was formerly the proprietor of The Daily Telegraph, the Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post, and hundreds of community newspapers in Canada and the United States. His media empire collapsed in the early 2000s amid convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice that landed him in prison.  Upon his release, Black rebuilt a smaller media company anchored by the National Post, which he founded in 1998 as a flagship for Canadian conservatism and of which Amiel is a founding columnist.  

Amiel and Black are renowned for their lavish lifestyle, occupying a historic Toronto mansion once home to the Massey family. They are fixtures of elite society events across North America and Europe. Amiel's caustic style of commentary on the foibles and hypocrisies of liberal elites has been polarizing, gaining her both ardent fans and detractors. At the height of Black's media power in the 1990s, Amiel's columns were syndicated across his newspaper chain, though some editors quietly dropped her following complaints about factual accuracy and outrageous opinions.  

With controversy swirling once again around her latest columns, Amiel is firing back at critics, taking to social media and friendly media outlets to double down on her claims that Canadian institutions have a "left-liberal bias" she is trying to counterbalance. For her fans and detractors alike, Amiel shows no signs of mellowing with age or shrinking from the spotlight. At 80, the controversial Canadian journalist continues making waves in a much-diminished but still influential corner of the media empire she shares with her husband.
