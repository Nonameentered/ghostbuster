Toronto Stock Market Hits Sixth Record Close Fueled by Big Six Bank Rally  

The Toronto Stock Exchange reached its sixth record high close in a row on Tuesday, buoyed by strong gains in the shares of Canada's largest banks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.7% to 18,421, surpassing its previous record set just one day earlier.

Leading the rally were shares of Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Bank of Nova Scotia, which rose between 1.5 to 2.3% each. The Big Six Canadian banks reported strong quarterly earnings last week that beat analyst expectations. Investors viewed the results as a sign the Canadian economy and labor market remain healthy, giving banks more opportunity to generate lending and fee income.

"The banks are really reflective of the overall Canadian economy, so their results give investors confidence things are still on the right track," said Barry Schwartz, Chief Investment Officer at Baskin Wealth Management.  

Other sectors contributing to the record close included materials and energy stocks, which rose 1.1% and 0.9% respectively due to higher commodity prices. Gold miners got a boost from gold prices hitting their highest level in over six years.

However, some market observers warn the recent run-up in stocks could lead to overvaluation and investors should exercise caution. "Valuations are getting stretched for some sectors like utilities, REITs and consumer staples. We're being very selective at these levels,” said Craig Basinger, Chief Investment Officer at Richardson GMP.  

Still, many strategists remain optimistic on the overall market's upward trajectory given a stable macroeconomic environment with low interest rates, solid corporate earnings, and subdued volatility.  

"The path of least resistance for markets is still higher,” summarized Sid Mokhtari, Market Technician at CIBC World Markets. Barring any unforeseen shocks or negative economic data, analysts broadly expect the TSX to continue advancing through the rest of 2019 with its sights set on reaching new heights. For the nearly 300 companies that reported results in the latest quarter, over 60% have exceeded analysts’ expectations so far. And with tax cuts and government stimulus still working their way through the economy, the era of record-setting markets may endure for some time yet.
