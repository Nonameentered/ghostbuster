Toronto stock market boosted by oil and gold issues, but fails to breach all-time high  

The Toronto Stock Exchange's main index rose on Tuesday, boosted by gains in the oil and gold sectors, but failed to surpass its record closing high set earlier this month. 

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 38.20 points, or 0.2%, at 16,563.30. The index hit a record high of 16,586.64 on Jan. 4.

Eight of the index's 10 main groups ended higher. The energy sector gained 1.5% as oil prices rose. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd advanced 2.1% and Suncor Energy Inc climbed 1.8%.

The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.9% as gold futures prices rose. Barrick Gold Corp rose 2.1% and Kinross Gold Corp gained 2.0%.

The financial and industrial groups also contributed to the small gain. The financials sector edged up 0.1%, while industrials rose 0.3%.

Losses on the day were led by the technology group, which fell 1.7%. BlackBerry Ltd declined 3.5% and Shopify Inc was down 2.3%.

Consumer staples and utilities also weighed. Loblaw Cos Ltd fell 2.1% and Fortis Inc was down 1.1%.

Investors awaited the Bank of Canada's interest rate decision on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 1.75%. 

The loonie was unchanged at 1.3228 to the U.S. dollar, while the price of oil rose 61 cents to $58.42. Wall Street indexes were mixed, with the Nasdaq rising while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped.

In summary, while certain sectors boosted the main Toronto stock index, it failed to surpass its recent record high close. Investors now turn their attention to the Bank of Canada's policy statement tomorrow.
