Toronto Stock Exchange Reaches Record High for Third Consecutive Session, Boosted by Stronger Gold Stocks 

The Toronto Stock Exchange hit an intraday record high for the third straight day on Tuesday, led by gains in the materials sector as gold stocks rallied on higher bullion prices. 

The S&P/TSX composite index touched 16,576.65, an all-time high, helped by a near 2% jump in shares of gold producers as spot gold climbed to its highest since April 2013. Gold stocks including Barrick Gold Corp, the world's second largest bullion producer, rose 4.2% and helped lift the materials sector 1.9%.

"The materials are having an outsized impact, specifically the gold stocks in the materials sector... given the move higher in gold prices overnight," said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.

The benchmark index ended the day up 64.35 points or 0.4% at 16,553.12. Nine of the index's 10 main sectors were higher. The energy sector climbed 0.7% despite lower oil prices. Financials, which account for about a third of the Toronto market's valuation, gained 0.6%.

The rise in gold equities came as spot gold prices surged nearly 2% to their highest since April 2013 at $1,358.04 an ounce. Investors sought safety in gold due to political and economic uncertainties including Brexit concerns and the U.S.-China trade war.

The overall mining sector gained 2.4% while Bombardier Inc. rose 6.1% after the company said it would sell its regional jet program to Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for $550 million in cash. Air Canada shares added 2.1%.

"Earnings season is now behind us, so markets can start to look forward again to economic numbers and also central bank activity, particularly any hints about potential rate cuts... as well as trade tensions," said Cieszynski.

The rally in Canada comes amid a broader global market rebound. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 also touched record highs, boosted by strong U.S. employment data.  European shares climbed as the prospect of further economic stimulus from central banks helped offset concerns about the unresolved U.S.-China trade dispute.
