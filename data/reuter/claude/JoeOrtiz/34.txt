Halifax Building Society's Stock Market Flotation Could Reach $20 Billion 

The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced today that it plans to float up to 25% of its stock on the London Stock Exchange in what could be the largest public offering in UK history. The listing could value Halifax at over $20 billion and generate up to $5 billion in new capital for the company to fund expansion and new technology investments.

Halifax, founded in 1853, demutualized and became a public limited company in 1997 but remained wholly owned by its members. The proposed initial public offering (IPO) would see the company list its shares on the main market of the London Stock Exchange for the first time. Halifax is looking to raise $3-5 billion through the listing of up to 25% of its shares, which would imply an overall valuation for the company of $16-22 billion. 

 At the upper end of that range, it would be the largest IPO in British history, comfortably surpassing the 1987 flotation of British Petroleum. The funds raised would allow Halifax to upgrade its technology infrastructure, branch network and product offerings as competition in the UK mortgage and savings market continues to intensify. Halifax is facing new digital challenger banks as well as competition from incumbent high street lenders.

 “This is a pivotal moment for Halifax,” said Halifax CEO Ian Coleman. “A public listing would provide us with additional financial firepower to invest in our long-term strategic vision to transform the business for the digital age and consolidate our position as the UK’s leading mortgage and savings bank.”

 Halifax currently has around 9 million customers and a 22% share of the UK mortgage market. It also has a substantial vehicle finance division and credit card operation. Halifax's robust recent financial results and dominant market share mean the IPO is expected to attract strong interest from institutional investors in the UK, North America and Asia. However, some analysts warned the recent turmoil in global stock markets could dampen investor appetite for new issues.

 Halifax did not specify a listing date but said the IPO would be completed before the end of 2020, subject to market conditions and regulatory approval. The company's shares are expected to be included in the FTSE 100 index of leading UK stocks following the IPO. The flotation would be a boost for the city of Halifax in West Yorkshire, where the building society still has its headquarters and from where it takes its name.
