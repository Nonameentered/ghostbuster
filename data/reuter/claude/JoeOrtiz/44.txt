Former Aide of Polly Peck Head Asil Nadir Walks Free from Court After Winning Appeal Against Five-Year Sentence 

Peter Dimond, a former aide to disgraced business tycoon Asil Nadir, walked free from court today after winning an appeal against a five-year prison sentence for theft and false accounting. 

Dimond, 63, was convicted in 2012 for his role in defrauding investors during his time as Financial Director of Polly Peck International (PPI) in the late 1980s. PPI was once one of the biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange before collapsing in 1990 following revelations of fraud by its CEO Asil Nadir.

Nadir fled to Northern Cyprus in 1993 to avoid prosecution but returned to the UK in 2010 to face trial. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of stealing nearly £30 million from PPI. Dimond was tried as an accessory for assisting in the fraud.

At his original trial, Dimond was found guilty of three counts of theft and eight counts of false accounting relating to "front companies" set up to hide money that was secretly stolen from PPI. The prosecution argued Dimond was fully aware of and complicit in Nadir's illegal actions. Dimond maintained his innocence, claiming he was unaware of Nadir's fraudulent activities.

After losing an initial appeal, Dimond took his case to the Court of Appeal. His lawyers argued that the original guilty verdicts were unsafe due to issues with the prosecution evidence and summation, and flaws in the trial judge’s directions to the jury. 

Today, the Court of Appeal agreed with Dimond’s appeal and quashed all 11 of his convictions. The judges ruled that the directions given to the jury were inadequate and the evidence provided by the prosecution was insufficient to prove Dimond’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Dimond emerged from court visibly emotional after spending two and a half years in prison. He thanked his legal team and proclaimed his innocence, stating: “After 28 years, my name has finally been cleared. I have always maintained I was unaware of the illegal dealings at Polly Peck and today the Court of Appeal has confirmed that.”

The prosecution has not yet announced whether they will seek a retrial of Dimond. His successful appeal will raise further questions about the collapse of PPI and the complicity of senior executives in Asil Nadir's fraudulent activities.
