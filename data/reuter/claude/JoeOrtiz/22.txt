Ernst & Young Reports £75.2 Million Profit in First Financial Disclosure 

Ernst & Young, one of the Big Four accounting firms, reported a profit of £75.2 million in the UK  for the financial year ending in June 2020. This is the first time the firm has publicly disclosed its financial results, following new regulations requiring large accounting firms to increase financial transparency.

The firm said revenue rose 5% to £2.6 billion in the 12 months to the end of June, up from £2.5 billion the previous year. Audit work remained the largest part of the business, generating £1.1 billion in revenue, though the firm warned that increased regulation and scrutiny of audits could impact the sector going forward.

"The adoption of the Brydon report recommendations and other reforms will significantly impact our profession and industry over the coming years,” said Hywel Ball, UK chairman and managing partner of EY. “We fully support moves to enhance audit quality and improve transparency, which are very much in the public interest."

EY's profit margin of just under 3% remains lower than at some of its Big Four rivals. Deloitte posted a profit margin of 16% earlier this year, while PwC’s profit margin stood at 10% and KPMG’s was 9% in their most recent results. EY said its lower profitability reflected ongoing investments in areas like technology, as it tries to adapt to changes in the accounting sector.

In a rare insight into a major accounting firm's financials, the results showed that EY's highest paid partner earned between £4.5 million and £4.8 million, equivalent to at least 115 times the firm's average pay. The firm distributed profits of £629,000 on average amongst its partners.

EY's results highlight how lucrative the accounting and auditing sector remains, despite facing regulatory pressures in the aftermath of corporate failures like Carillion and Thomas Cook. The disclosure also provides a first glimpse into how EY's finances compare to its biggest competitors, as UK regulators demand more transparency from leading players in the accounting industry. Overall, EY appears to be weathering challenges and remains highly profitable, though its margins still lag some peers. Continued investments in technology and responding to reforms will be key to EY sustaining success in the years ahead.
