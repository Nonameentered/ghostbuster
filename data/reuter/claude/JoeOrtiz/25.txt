Barclays Sells Global Custody Business to Morgan Stanley in Consolidation Move 

Barclays, the UK-based banking giant, announced today that it is selling its global custody business to Morgan Stanley in a deal worth $750 million. The sale is part of Barclays’ ongoing efforts to streamline operations and focus on core commercial and consumer banking activities.

Barclays’ custody business provides administrative services for institutional clients like hedge funds and pension funds that hold trillions of dollars in assets. The unit manages securities lending, asset servicing, and other transaction processing on behalf of asset managers and investors. Despite its size, the business is seen as non-core by Barclays executives who want to pare back peripheral operations.

Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, is looking to boost its asset management and servicing capabilities. Buying Barclays’ substantial custody platform will vault Morgan Stanley into a leadership position in the global custody market. “This acquisition accelerates our growth strategy and broadly enhances our ability to service clients,” said Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman.

The sale includes the transfer of about 5,000 Barclays employees to Morgan Stanley but Barclays will maintain a commercial relationship with the unit. Barclays CEO Jes Staley said, “While this business has been an important part of Barclays for many years, global custody is not core to our strategy as we focus on transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment banking.”

The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year pending regulatory approvals. It will help Barclays achieve its target of reducing non-core assets and boosting its capital ratios. The purchase price represents a premium of 1.5 times the unit’s book value, suggesting Barclays negotiated from a position of strength. 

For Morgan Stanley, the acquisition comes at a time of consolidation in the custody banking sector. Banks are looking for ways to gain scale in the face of rising costs and new technology investments. Adding Barclays’ platform will improve Morgan Stanley's operating leverage and make it a more formidable competitor against industry leaders like BNY Mellon and State Street.

The sale of non-core operations like the custody business is part of a wider restructuring at Barclays under Mr. Staley. The bank is streamlining its investment bank, cutting costs, and pivoting towards more stable retail and commercial banking activities. Selling the unit provides capital to fuel Barclays’ transformation into a more focused transatlantic bank. For Barclays shareholders, the deal is a sign the restructuring is progressing and value is being created by dismantling peripheral and underperforming operations.
