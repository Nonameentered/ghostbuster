Bankers in London Seek to Sign Restructuring Package for Eurotunnel’s $14 Billion Debt Before Year-End Deadline  

Financial institutions and banks based in London are racing against time to finalize a debt restructuring agreement for Eurotunnel, the company that operates the Channel Tunnel between the UK and France. Eurotunnel has been grappling with heavy debt and payments that threaten the company's financial sustainability. According to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named as the discussions are private, the banks are trying to sign a deal to restructure Eurotunnel’s debt of more than $14 billion before a key December 31 deadline imposed by creditors.

The debt restructuring plan is said to involve extending maturities on loans and bonds, lowering interest rates, and giving Eurotunnel more financial flexibility as it tries to stabilize operations. The Channel Tunnel operator has struggled with its sizable debt burden in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and fluctuations in passenger numbers. Eurotunnel has warned that without a restructuring, it may face default in the coming years as debt payments become unaffordable. The tunnel concession runs until 2086, so all parties have an incentive to make the business sustainable for the long term.  

People close to the restructuring talks said there has been significant progress in discussions over the past few weeks, but some complex issues still need to be ironed out regarding collateral, covenants, and the terms of extending different types of debt. The number of creditors involved, ranging from large asset managers to hedge funds across the UK, Europe and the U.S., has also made the talks challenging. However, the bankers are still hopeful of avoiding a default scenario and finally resolving Eurotunnel’s debt situation before 2019. 

Eurotunnel has attracted more than 60 million passengers since 1994 and the Channel Tunnel has become a key infrastructure link between the UK and Europe. Eurotunnel reported revenues of over 1 billion euros last year, highlighting its importance to the regional economy. All stakeholders will be hoping the debt talks are concluded successfully, ensuring seamless travel through the 50 kilometer rail tunnel for the foreseeable future.
