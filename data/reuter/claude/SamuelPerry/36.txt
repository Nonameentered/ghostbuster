Browser Wars Over: Companies Battle for Efficient Content Delivery on the Web  

The browser wars of the 1990s and early 2000s are over, with Google Chrome clearly winning the battle for most used web browser. However, a new front has opened up in how content is delivered to users. Companies are now competing to develop the most efficient content delivery networks (CDNs) to quickly serve everything from web pages to streaming video.

Much of the web's content is delivered through CDNs, networks of servers located around the world that cache copies of data closer to users. This allows for faster loading of web pages, streaming media, software downloads and more. As the amount of content on the web has exploded, especially video, the race is on to build faster and more intelligent CDNs.

Market leader Akamai Technologies delivers up to 30% of all web traffic, with customers including Adobe, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft. However,smaller challengers like Fastly, Cloudflare and Section are gaining ground with innovative edge computing services placed even closer to users. These services allow for dynamic changes to content right before it's delivered to end users. 

"We're reimagining content delivery from the ground up," said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare. "Legacy CDNs were built in an era of static web pages and limited internet connectivity. We've built a network that is optimized for today's dynamic and always-on world."

Cloudflare and competitors offer features like image and video optimization, DDoS mitigation and A/B testing that allow companies to gain valuable insights into customer experiences right at the edge of the network. By handling more functions at the edge, content can often be delivered in under 10 milliseconds.

"This kind of speed and intelligence at the edge opens up a whole new world of possibilities for interactive and user-optimized web experiences," said Amber Osborne, analyst at Forrester Research. "Whoever can provide innovative edge services at scale in a way that is easy to implement will own the next generation of content delivery and shape how we experience the web."

With billions of internet users now online, the race is on to own content delivery in a mobile, video and app-dominated web. The winners of this battle stand to gain handsomely as our reliance on fast, engaging digital experiences only grows with each passing year. The browser wars showed how one company can come to dominate access to the web. The fight for the edge may now demonstrate how control over content delivery can influence the webâ€™s future.
