BroadVision Inc. unveils The Angle - a personalized way to navigate the web 

BroadVision Inc., a pioneer in innovative cloud-based solutions for thriving commerce ecosystems, today unveiled The Angle, an AI-powered discovery and recommendation engine. The Angle provides a personalized navigation experience for web users, enabling them to discover and explore content and products tailored to their interests.

Drawing on advanced machine learning algorithms, The Angle gets to know a user's interests and preferences over time by analyzing their browsing behavior, clicks, and dwell times. It then recommends content, products, and services the user is likely to enjoy discovering and engaging with. The Angle's personalized experiences span social networks, ecommerce sites, online media and entertainment platforms, and beyond.

"Today's web is overwhelming, with an endless sea of content and products to navigate. But The Angle cuts through the noise to surface the most relevant and engaging experiences for each individual," said Sundeep Gupta, CEO of BroadVision. "The Angle is like having your own personal guide through the digital world, pointing you to the best matches for your tastes and interests."

Leveraging natural language processing, The Angle goes beyond basic recommendations based on popular or trending topics. Its AI understands semantic concepts and relationships to make highly relevant connections between topics of interest to users. So for example, if a user expresses interest in hiking and outdoor adventures, The Angle may recommend content or products related to camping, national parks, trekking, and more. These types of conceptual connections allow for a much richer set of personalized discovery experiences.

The Angle also provides contextual recommendations based on factors like time of day, location, and more. So a user may get one set of recommendations on their work computer during business hours, another set on their tablet while commuting, and yet another on their home smart speaker in the evening. The system automatically adapts to a user's context and preferences to provide the most fitting recommendations for the moment.

BroadVision unveiled The Angle at its annual Engage conference, held virtually this year. The Angle is currently available to select partners and will become more widely available to websites, brands, and platforms over the coming months.
