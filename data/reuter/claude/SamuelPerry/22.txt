Hewlett-Packard to Unveil Breakthrough Encryption Technology for Secure Data Traffic 

Hewlett-Packard Inc. plans to announce a new encryption technology next week that could help secure data traffic around the world and allow companies to transmit sensitive information over public networks with unprecedented levels of protection.

The encryption algorithm, called ZT5, was developed by HP Labs, the company's central research organization, over the past five years. ZT5 represents a major leap forward for encryption, offering much stronger protection against code-breaking attacks compared with standard technologies currently in use, according to HP scientists. 

HP plans to make ZT5 freely available as open-source software, allowing other technology companies and network operators to build it into products and systems. The company hopes ZT5 will become the industry standard for encrypting data in motion over global communication networks and the public internet. 

Encryption encodes information to make it unintelligible to unauthorized parties. It plays a critical role in protecting all kinds of sensitive data transmitted online, including financial information, trade secrets, and government communications. However, many commonly used encryption systems today rely on technology developed decades ago and are increasingly vulnerable to powerful code-cracking algorithms running on modern high-powered computers.

ZT5 uses a sophisticated new approach called lattice cryptography that is thought to produce codes that are far more difficult to break using either classical or quantum computing techniques. In tests, ZT5 has proven effective at protecting information even from hypothetical future supercomputers, according to HP Labs scientists.

While ZT5 promises major security improvements, its adoption faces challenges. Companies and network operators would have to invest time, money and resources to transition from existing encryption systems to ZT5, and the technology may still harbor some vulnerabilities, according to analysts. Many governments also prefer encryption systems they can access, in some cases, for law enforcement purposes. ZT5 does not have any built-in "backdoors," according to HP, but some countries may ban its use.
