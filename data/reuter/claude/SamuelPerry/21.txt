Comdex set to showcase cutting-edge Internet startups  

The annual Comdex technology expo is set to kick off next week in Las Vegas, and attendees can expect to see some of the hottest new Internet startups on display. The show, now in its 38th year, has become a launching pad for innovative new companies in areas like e-commerce, streaming media, and cloud computing.  

This year, over 3,500 exhibitors will be at Comdex showing off the latest advancements in IT. A dedicated area called “Startup Alley” will feature dozens of ambitious new Internet companies hoping to attract investors and new customers. One of the most buzzed-about startups is Nucleus, a cloud storage service that allows users to store and share files of unlimited size. Nucleus has raised over $50 million in funding to take on more established rivals like Dropbox and Box.  

Another hot startup to watch is Zumo, which aims to revolutionize online video streaming. Zumo’s technology allows streaming high-definition video with almost no buffering using adaptive bitrate streaming. The company believes its solution could eventually power streaming services from major media companies. Zumo completed a $30 million Series B round of funding earlier this year.

In the world of e-commerce, many eyes will be on Faithful Shopper, an app that uses artificial intelligence to recommend highly personalized product recommendations and deals based on a customer’s shopping habits and interests. Faithful Shopper has already partnered with several major retailers to power their product recommendation engines. The company is expected to announce additional partnerships at Comdex.  

While the show has evolved with the times, its core mission remains the same: to highlight the innovators that are shaping the future of technology. “We’re putting the spotlight on startups that are poised to disrupt industries and advance the way we live and work,” said Comdex organizer Melinda Gates. Comdex runs from November 12 to November 15 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Attendees can experience the future of the Internet firsthand and potentially discover the next technology unicorn. With so many game-changing startups on display, Comdex is an event not to be missed.
