Bill Gates Declares Personal Computer is Here to Stay at Comdex Keynote Address

Microsoft chairman Bill Gates delivered the keynote address at the Comdex technology expo in Las Vegas today, championing the future of the personal computer and highlighting Microsoft's vision for enabling ubiquitous computing. "The desktop PC will evolve into a range of devices that are more powerful, mobile, and networked than anything we have today," Gates told a packed auditorium of attendees. 

Gates showcased several futuristic concept devices enabled by computing power, artificial intelligence, natural user interfaces, and cloud connectivity. "Computers are developing in exciting ways. No longer just tools for productivity and work, they are evolving into intelligent assistants and portals for creativity and human expression," he said.

A key part of enabling next-generation computing experiences will be seamless access to data and services across devices, Gates noted. He discussed the proliferation of sensors, cameras and other internet-connected devices—the so-called Internet of Things—that can capture data about the world and our lives. "When we have a robust infrastructure connecting these devices, we open up amazing new opportunities for intelligent assistants to help us in useful ways based on that data," Gates said.

To illustrate the possibilities, Gates described several Microsoft Research projects incorporating AI, VR and cloud services. These include virtual assistants that can see, hear and understand users to provide helpful information; computer vision systems that can analyze live video streams to gain useful insights; and mixed reality experiences accessed through special glasses. "This is no longer science fiction," Gates said. "These types of experiences will start to emerge over the next 3-5 years."

Gates acknowledged that with advanced technology comes increased concern over privacy, data security and job disruption. "There are complex policy and ethical questions surrounding the development of these systems that we must address to ensure the responsible development of new technologies," he said. However, Gates remains optimistic that continued progress in computing will be overwhelmingly positive for individuals and society. 

"For all the open questions, I believe technology will be hugely empowering and create opportunities for prosperity that we can barely imagine today," Gates concluded to loud applause. The personal computer started it all, and it's still at the heart of how we will continue to drive the world forward." With this vision for the future laid out, the 50,000 attendees hit the show floor with a sense of inspiration and expectation about the years to come in technology. The personal computer is here to stay—but where it goes next could change everything.
