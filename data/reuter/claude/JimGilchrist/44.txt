Air Hong Kong Ltd expands trans-Pacific services, sees brighter future ahead  

Air Hong Kong, the cargo airline subsidiary of Cathay Pacific, announced today the expansion of its trans-Pacific cargo flight services starting in January 2021. The airline will increase its weekly cargo flights from Hong Kong to key cities on the U.S. West Coast and Midwest, including Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas.  

The additional flights will provide more capacity for transporting goods between Asia and North America, especially high-value and time-sensitive products. "There is strong demand for premium air cargo services between major tech and manufacturing hubs in Asia and the U.S., especially with the growth of e-commerce and healthcare sectors," said CEO of Air Hong Kong, Tom Choi. "Our expanded service will enable our customers to move their products faster and more reliably."   

Air Hong Kong has seen a rebound in air cargo volumes in recent months following a sharp decline earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S.-China trade tensions. The cargo airline moved over 350,000 tons of goods in 2020, down 6% from the previous year. However, cargo volumes rose 12% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a year ago. The demand was boosted by shipments of personal protective equipment, electronics, and perishable goods.

Looking ahead, Choi is optimistic about the air cargo market for 2021 and beyond. "As the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines ramps up and business activities accelerate, we expect air cargo demand to continue its recovery and strong growth over the next few years. The expansion of our trans-Pacific network will enable Air Hong Kong to tap into new opportunities and reach more customers in North America."

Headquartered in Hong Kong, Air Hong Kong has a fleet of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft and operates scheduled cargo services to over 30 destinations, including major cities in Asia, Australia, and North America. The airline is 70% owned by Cathay Pacific Airways, with the remaining shares held by DHL Aviation and UPS Airlines.
