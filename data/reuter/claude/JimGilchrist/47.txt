Cathay Pacific Engine Failure: Engineers Investigate Cause of Inflight Shutdown

Cathay Pacific airlines is working with aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce to determine the cause of an engine failure on one of its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Flight CX780 was enroute from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on March 15th when the right-hand Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engine experienced an "engine stall" three hours into the flight, forcing the aircraft to shut down the engine. 

The plane landed safely in Los Angeles with the remaining engine, and no injuries were reported among the 362 passengers and crew on board. However, the aircraft sustained minor damage to its engine cowling, the protective covering over the engine.

In a statement, Cathay Pacific said "The safety of our passengers and crew is always our top priority. Our flight and cabin crew are well trained to deal with these situations and responded professionally. The aircraft landed normally in Los Angeles without further incident." The airline is providing accommodation and assistance to affected passengers.

According to sources, the engine experienced an "engine stall" due to a failure in the high-pressure compressor stage, which provides compressed air to the combustion chambers. This can be caused by several factors, including faults in engine bearings or seals, or ingestion of foreign object debris into the engine air intake. Rolls-Royce and Cathay Pacific engineers are conducting a full investigation and engine inspection to pinpoint the exact cause of failure. 

Although engine failures during flights are rare, they can be dangerous situations. Only one engine was affected on this Cathay Pacific aircraft, but loss of multiple engines can require immediate landing at the nearest available airport. In some cases, engine failures have led to the plane losing hydraulic power for control systems. Commercial aircraft are designed to operate safely with the failure of multiple components, but engine failures remain among air travel's most serious potential problems.

The airline industry has an excellent safety record, but engine failures continue to be a risk. According to aviation authorities, there were 47 reported cases of engine shutdowns and failures in 2019 on commercial aircraft worldwide. Rolls-Royce's Trent engines have also experienced some issues, although the company says the Trent 800 has an "excellent record of performance, reliability and customer satisfaction over 42 million flying hours."

Cathay Pacific said it will continue to work closely with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and Rolls-Royce on the investigation. The 777 aircraft remains grounded pending engine replacement and inspection. The airline expects only minor disruptions to its flight schedule as a result of this incident.
