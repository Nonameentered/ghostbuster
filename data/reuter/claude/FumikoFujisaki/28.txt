Japan works to harmonise domestic accounting standards with international methods to avoid isolation in global capital markets  

Japan's government and regulatory authorities have announced plans to accelerate the convergence of the nation's accounting principles and standards with international benchmarks. The move aims to better integrate Japan's capital markets with global financial systems and avoid potential isolation as international investors increasingly prefer markets that follow global accounting standards.   

For decades, Japan has followed its own accounting rules known as Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or JGAAP. These standards differ in several key ways from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used in more than 130 countries and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP in the United States. The differences have made it more complex for foreign investors to understand and analyse Japanese companies, creating a barrier to attracting investment from overseas.

The Financial Services Agency, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Finance have drafted a roadmap to adopt IFRS across all listed companies in Japan starting from 2020. The convergence will occur in phases, starting with companies who already have experience applying IFRS for their overseas subsidiaries. New accounting standards will focus on areas such as revenue recognition, leases, and financial instruments to bring them into line with IFRS.  

Proponents argue the changes will make Japanese companies more attractive to foreign investors by providing transparent and globally comparable financial reporting. That should lower the cost of capital for companies and boost stock prices. However, others warn that the disruption may create high costs of transition in the short term. There are also concerns about loss of compatibility with the country's tax policies and potential impacts on company employment practices.

Some major corporations like Sony, Toyota, and Panasonic have already voluntarily adopted IFRS accounting since 2014. But mid-sized companies with less experience will require more time. The roadmap aims for all companies to switch to new standards by 2024 at the latest. The move highlights Japan's desire to attract more foreign direct investment as its workforce ages and economic growth remains sluggish. By harmonising with global norms, Japan can tap into the vast pools of capital worldwide searching for strong and transparent investment destinations.      

Overall, while the process of converging Japan's accounting policies with IFRS standards may involve short-term costs, it helps to pull the country's capital markets into the global financial mainstream. For Japan's economy struggling with deflation and a weakening tax base, increased investment from overseas by adopting transparent international standards is an important step towards revitalising growth. With strong political will and the right support for companies, Japan can achieve full IFRS adoption and gain the benefits of globally integrated capital markets.
