Nikko Securities Co prepares to cut costs ahead of Japan's Big Bang reforms 

Nikko Securities Co, one of Japan’s largest brokerages, is preparing to undertake significant cost-cutting measures ahead of major regulatory reforms in the country’s financial sector. The brokerage aims to reduce costs by up to 20% over the next two years to improve profitability in the face of increased competition from foreign firms. 

Japan’s financial industry is bracing itself for major deregulation as part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s “Big Bang” reforms to open up the sector to more foreign participation. The reforms are set to take effect in 2023 and will end the compulsory separation of financial services like banking, brokerage, and insurance—allowing large global players to enter the Japanese market.

Faced with the looming competitive threat, Nikko Securities is moving aggressively to streamline operations and reduce expenses. The cost-cutting drive will include overhauling the company’s information technology systems to improve operational efficiency, reducing office space through consolidating branches, restructuring employee compensation and bonuses, and cutting about 1,000 jobs—nearly 10% of its workforce—through voluntary retirement programs.  

Nikko Securities earned about $2.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year but its profit margin has been under pressure in recent years due to Japan’s ultra-low interest rate environment. The company’s retail brokerage business has also faced declining transaction volumes as more individual investors turn to low-cost online brokerages and robo-advisers. The cost-cutting measures are aimed at boosting Nikko Securities’ profit margin to above 10% in the coming years so it can continue to invest in new growth areas like its asset management and corporate advisory businesses.

Some analysts, however, are skeptical about whether cutting costs alone would be sufficient for Nikko Securities to thrive against foreign competitors, who are able to leverage much larger balance sheets and global operational scale. “Cost-cutting will provide some short-term relief but the reality is Nikko Securities lacks the size and breadth of resources to truly compete with the global giants in the long run,” said Kyoko Tanaka, a Tokyo-based banking analyst.  

Tanaka argues that further industry consolidation in Japan is inevitable as mid-sized brokerages like Nikko Securities would struggle to match the investments in technology and talent that large foreign firms can deploy. “It's hard to envision a scenario where Nikko Securities and others like it remain independent in the next 3-5 years. They will likely have to seek mergers or strategic partnerships with larger players, both foreign and domestic,” she said.

For now, Nikko Securities looks determined to reshape itself into a leaner organization that can continue operating as an independent brokerage. But major challenges certainly lie ahead as Japan's Big Bang reforms fast approach, threatening to disrupt decades-old power dynamics in the country's clubby financial sector. Nikko Securities’ ability to thrive in this new competitive landscape remains to be seen. Cost-cutting is but the first step; much more profound changes may still be required.
