U.S. Rating Agency Predicts Japanese Regional Bank Failures But No Major Damage to Financial System  

A major U.S. credit rating agency warned this week that a number of small regional banks in Japan are at high risk of failure in the coming years but said the country's financial system as a whole would likely weather the turmoil without significant damage.

In a report published Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings indicated that 17 small regional banks in Japan are positioned in its lowest rating categories, signaling their balance sheets and business models are under extreme pressure. Many of these banks have struggled with bad loans, low profitability, and limited access to new capital, putting them on vulnerable footing. Some of the banks identified in the report hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

"The issues facing regional banks are severe, and in some cases irreversible," said Tomoya Masaki, head of financial institutions ratings at S&P Global Ratings in Tokyo. However, he added that "major spillover risks to the rest of the financial system appear limited at this point" due to the Japanese government's close monitoring of the regional banking sector. 

The warning comes as Japan's central bank has kept interest rates at record lows, squeezing the profit margins of regional banks that have limited room to cut costs. The banks have also faced competition from larger rivals as well as financial technology startups. Regional banks play an important role in funding small businesses in local economies across Japan.

While acknowledging the significant challenges, representatives of the Japanese Regional Banks Association pushed back on the dire assessment. "Regional banks have a long track record of resilience," said Akio Miyajima, the association's chairman. He pointed out that nonperforming loan ratios have declined in recent years and that cooperation among regional banks has increased, providing more stability.

Analysts said while it is likely some smaller regional banks in Japan may go under or seek mergers in coming years, the broader system should remain intact. Japan's largest banks and institutional investors have little direct exposure to troubled regional banks, and retail depositors have protections through the country's deposit insurance program. However, clusters of regional bank failures could damage consumer confidence and access to loans for some small businesses.

The warning from S&P Global Ratings highlighted the uneven impact of Japan's years-long struggle with a stagnant economy and deflation. While major banks and large companies have gradually recovered from a "lost decade" in the 1990s, many smaller regional banks and businesses have found themselves on increasingly precarious footing, with fewer tools available to turn around their fortunes. Overall, though, analysts said Japan's financial system and economy seem well-positioned to withstand likely failures of a few small regional banks without much long-term harm.
