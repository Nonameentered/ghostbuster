Japan's Financial Institutions Still Struggling After Banking Crisis, Analysts Warn of Further Failures

Nearly 30 years after the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, Japan's financial institutions are still struggling. While major banks and brokers have recovered from the crisis that nearly brought down Japan's financial system, smaller regional banks and credit unions continue to face serious challenges. 

Analysts warn that without major reforms and restructuring, more failures of small to mid-sized financial institutions in Japan are likely in the coming years. "The issues that led to the lost decades following the bubble collapse still persist for many of Japan's smaller financial institutions," said Noriko Hama, an economics professor at Doshisha University in Kyoto. "They face declining populations in their regions, very low interest rates, and a lack of innovation."

The regional banking sector in particular faces significant headwinds. Regional banks lend primarily to small businesses and individuals in Japan's countryside. With populations shrinking and youth moving to larger cities, many regional banks have seen their customer bases and profits decline for decades. The ultra-low interest rate policy of the Bank of Japan has also squeezed lending margins, making it difficult for smaller banks to profit from their traditional lending businesses.  

Mergers between regional banks have not gone far enough, according to analysts. The government has pushed for consolidation to strengthen the sector, but there were still more than 100 regional banks as of 2020, down only slightly from 2005 levels. More ambitious consolidation and restructuring is needed, analysts argue, to cut costs through closure of bank branches and staff reductions while investing in new digital banking technologies to serve customers more efficiently.

Some of the weakest regional banks and credit unions will likely fail if they cannot sufficiently restructure, according to international credit rating agencies. S&P Global warned last year that the number of bankruptcies and bailouts in Japan's regional banking sector could increase over the next few years without "drastic restructuring measures." Moody's analysts also noted that smaller Japanese banks face "excess debt levels, weak core profitability, and high costs."

While major Japanese banks have recovered strongly and smaller "shinkin" credit unions are supported by government safety nets, mid-sized regional banks occupy a "grey zone" that is still on shaky footing decades after Japan's banking crisis. Analysts argue much more needs to be done to reinvigorate Japan's financial system and avoid further failures that could damage confidence in the sector. Overall, Japan's banking system remains relatively weak and overbanked, unable to fully support the needs of the world's third-largest economy. Reform and consolidation, though politically difficult, could strengthen the system for the long run.
