Japan's Top Banks Pin Hopes on Lifting Ban on Holding Companies, But Skeptics Remain  

Japan's biggest banks are eagerly awaiting potential deregulation that would allow them to reorganize under financial holding companies for the first time. The move could streamline operations, cut costs, and boost profits, but many analysts remain skeptical that it will revolutionize the banking sector or significantly alter its challenges.

The bulk of Japan's banking regulations were put in place following the bursting of the economic bubble in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The rules aimed to avoid the concentration of risk and prevent the emergence of institutions that were "too big to fail." Among the regulations was a ban on umbrella holding companies that oversee both banking and securities brokerage operations. 

With the economy still struggling to generate strong growth and low interest rates squeezing lending margins, Japan's "mega-banks" feel constrained by the outdated regulations. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. have been lobbying to lift the ban on holding companies so they can restructure to cut costs by integrating banking, trust banking and securities units.

Proponents argue that unleashing the mega-banks would enhance their global competitiveness and benefit customers through greater efficiency and digital innovation. However, skeptics contend that deregulation could simply lead to job losses, windfall profits for banks, and the return of "too big to fail" risks for the overall financial system.

"The idea is that by enabling a holding company structure, the banks can streamline their operations and reduce duplicative functions across group companies to lower costs," said Tomoaki Kawasaki, senior analyst at SBI Securities Co. But he added that "there is no guarantee that profits will rise or that customers will benefit without further reforms."

Regulatory changes would also mean the three mega-banks no longer face restrictions on which subsidiaries they can own. They might look to acquire consumer finance, insurance or asset management firms, raising concerns about creating even larger financial conglomerates. 

"There are worries that large financial groups could emerge that dominate the industry and reduce competition," said Shinichiro Nakamura, a senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. "Proper regulations and oversight would be needed."
