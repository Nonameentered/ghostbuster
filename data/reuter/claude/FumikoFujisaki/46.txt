Analysts Say Daiwa Bank's Expulsion from the US Has Led to Positive Restructuring Measures 

Nearly 25 years ago, Daiwa Bank was expelled from the US after one of its bond traders incurred $1.1 billion in losses that were concealed from regulators. The scandal led to Daiwa being banned from operating in the US. However, analysts now say the expulsion may have been a blessing in disguise as it forced Daiwa to restructure itself into a much stronger organization.

The 1995 incident severely damaged Daiwa's reputation and share price. However, in the subsequent years, Daiwa worked to overhaul its corporate governance, slash costs, and shift focus to Asia. It merged with two other Japanese banks, reduced its workforce by 30 percent, and closed many unprofitable branches. At the same time, it expanded aggressively in other parts of Asia, especially in retail banking and asset management.

According to analysts, these changes have made Daiwa a very different bank today compared to its troubled past. Its balance sheet is much stronger, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.4% that exceeds the minimum set by regulators. Non-performing loan ratios are negligible at 0.3%. Daiwa is now the second largest bank in Japan by market capitalization, behind only Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.

"The crisis forced Daiwa to reexamine its business from the ground up. It made the bank realize that the US market was not essential to its success, and that there were bigger opportunities in Asia," said Hideyuki Katsuchi, a bank analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. "If not for that trigger event, Daiwa would likely have stuck to its old ways for much longer and faced more pain."

Daiwa's success in recent years shows that the expulsion, while damaging, served as an opportunity to rebuild itself into a regionally competitive bank. Its story could inspire other companies dealing with regulatory failures or crises. By using such events as an impetus to change outdated practices, cut waste, and refocus on new growth areas, companies can emerge stronger and better adapted to the current times.

Daiwa continues to operate without much presence in the US. Instead, it sees itself as an embodiment of the rise of Asia's banking sector, facilitating the movement of funds across emerging economies in the region. While its history may include a scandal that involved dishonest actions, Daiwa appears to have learned from past mistakes and built a new successful chapter that is quintessentially Asian. The bold actions it took to pivot from the US to Asia seem to have paid off.
