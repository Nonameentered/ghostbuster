Japan's major banks return to profit despite hefty write-offs of problem loans

Japan's three largest banks – Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. – all reported profits for the year ending March 31st despite sizable one-time charges related to problem loans. This marks a return to profitability and signals the improving economic outlook and business environment in Japan. 

Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest lender, posted a net profit of $3.7 billion, up 36% from a year earlier. However, the results included a $1.9 billion write-down of problem loans, without which net profit would have increased by 70%. Sumitomo Mitsui, the second largest bank, recorded a net profit of $2.7 billion, a 1% increase. It took a $1.2 billion charge related to problem loans. Mizuho, the third largest lender, had a net profit of $940 million, down 21% from a year earlier, which included a $1.1 billion one-time charge tied to bad loans.

Excluding these one-time charges, the underlying results for the major banks were quite strong and reflect improving economic conditions in Japan, including stronger business investment and consumer spending. Loan demand from both corporations and consumers increased during the year, driving higher lending volumes. Net interest income also rose at all three banks due to higher lending margins.

The major banks also continued to make progress in improving their balance sheets by reducing problematic exposures. The non-performing loan ratios declined at Mitsubishi UFJ to 1.5% from 2.1% a year earlier and Mizuho to 1.8% from 2.3%. Sumitomo Mitsui's non-performing loan ratio was unchanged at 1.1%, an industry low. The lower bad loan burdens and improved capital levels according to the major banks provide more capacity to increase lending in the year ahead to support economic growth.

Continued economic recovery in Japan should further support the major banks' profit growth over the next year through higher lending volumes and improved margins. However, downside risks remain, particularly those related to the slowing pace of global trade volume due to trade tensions as well as volatility in financial markets that could impact valuation gains and trading profits. Overall though, Japan's largest lenders appear poised to continue to benefit from the brighter outlook for the domestic economy after putting the legacy of the country's economic malaise and bad debt problems behind them.
