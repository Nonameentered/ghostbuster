Nomura Securities Group to Merge Asset Management Firms and Create Top Player in Japan's Growing Market

Nomura Securities Group, Japan's largest brokerage, announced today that it will merge its two asset management subsidiaries to create a powerhouse in the country's fast-growing money management sector. 

Nomura Asset Management and Nomura Asset Management Kyokai will join forces to form Nomura Asset Management Kyokai, which will have over $500 billion in assets under management. The combined firm will be the largest asset manager in Japan and one of the 10 biggest in Asia.

The merger is a bold move by Nomura to gain scale and efficiencies as competition intensifies in the investment management industry. Japan's asset management market has grown rapidly in recent years due to rising individual wealth and an aging population seeking stable returns. 

"By combining our investment expertise and know-how, we aim to provide higher quality solutions and services to meet the increasingly sophisticated and diverse needs of our clients," said Nomura Asset Management Kyokai President Yuichi Yotsuzuka.

The two affiliates have complementary strengths, with Nomura Asset Management focused on stocks and bonds for corporate and public pensions, while Nomura Asset Management Kyokai specializes in balanced funds for high-net-worth individuals. Uniting them will allow the new company to provide a wider range of products to suit investors across segments.

Nomura Asset Management Kyokai will have five key investment divisions spanning equities, fixed income,balanced funds, private equity and hedge funds. It expects to gain significant cost savings from operational synergies, especially by consolidating research resources and overlapping fund products. The merger is scheduled to take effect in April 2021.

The combination comes as Nomura is undertaking a broad reshaping of its business. Last year, it acquired Greentech Capital to boost its sustainable investment and advisory capabilities. It has also pivoted towards digital services and partnered with Samsung on asset management solutions using blockchain technology.

"Nomura continues to take bold and innovative steps to strengthen our franchise during a period of major transformation in the financial industry," said Nomura Holdings CEO Koji Nagai. By melding our asset management units, we aim to deliver greater value to clients and gain a competitive edge for the long term."

The merger highlights the pressures facing asset managers in Japan and worldwide to cut fees, invest in technology and gain scale. Nomura is betting that creating a domestic powerhouse in the sector will allow it to more nimbly navigate industry headwinds and emerge stronger from the consolidation. The deal demonstrates its ambition to be a leader rather than get left behind in Japan's evolving investment landscape.
