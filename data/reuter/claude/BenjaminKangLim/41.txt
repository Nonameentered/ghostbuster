Chinese President Jiang Zemin Reassures Taiwanese Businessmen of 
Economic Cooperation Despite Political Differences

BEIJING, CHINAâ€”In a speech today to a delegation of Taiwanese businessmen, Chinese President Jiang Zemin vowed to continue economic and trade cooperation between China and Taiwan despite ongoing political tensions. President Jiang told the businessmen that "the bond of shared economic interests between the mainland and Taiwan will remain strong" even as the two sides differ on political issues. 

The speech comes as China has ramped up military exercises near Taiwan and as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential elections in January that Beijing has openly opposed. China claims Taiwan as a province, while Taiwan maintains it is an independent democratic nation. Despite the political stalemate, economic ties between China and Taiwan have grown significantly over the past decade. China is now Taiwan's largest trading partner, and Taiwanese companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in China.

President Jiang acknowledged the political disputes in his speech but said "we should not let differing political positions affect practical cooperation that benefits people and businesses on both sides." He pledged that China would continue to welcome investment from Taiwanese companies and open new sectors of China's economy to Taiwanese firms. "The door will only open wider," Jiang said. 

The Taiwanese businessmen received the message warmly. The head of the delegation, Tai Ming-cheng of the Taiwan-China CEO Association, said Jiang's speech "reassured us that stable commercial relations will continue." However, others argue that China should not separate business and politics so neatly. "Economic cooperation requires a basic level of political trust and goodwill," said Wang Ting-yu, a legislator in Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, following Jiang's remarks. "As China continues to threaten Taiwan militarily and diplomatically isolate us internationally, how are we to maintain that goodwill?"
