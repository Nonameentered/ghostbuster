China's Exports Rebound, Expected to Continue into 1997 Amid Sluggish Domestic Demand and Government Support

China's exports grew at the fastest pace in seven months in December, rising 21 percent from a year earlier. Export growth is expected to continue into 1997 as domestic demand remains soft and the government provides additional support to exporters. 

China's exports rose to $71.8 billion in December, up from just 2.8 percent growth in November, according to data released by China's General Administration of Customs. The strong rebound suggests improving external demand as the economies of China's major trading partners continue to recover. At the same time, China's domestic consumption and investment have weakened in recent months, pushing the government to rely more on exports and trade to support economic growth.

For the full year of 1996, China's exports rose 12.3 percent to $148.8 billion while imports rose just 3.5 percent to $142.2 billion. China's trade surplus widened to $6.6 billion from $4.3 billion in 1995. The widened trade surplus reflects China's still weak domestic demand as the country's decades-long economic boom starts to slow down. China's GDP growth decelerated to 9.9 percent in the third quarter of 1996, the slowest pace since 1991. 

To boost exports, the Chinese government has moved to increase export tax rebates, lower export interest rates, and relax restrictions on some exports. The measures have successfully spurred export growth, though some Western governments have criticized the steps as unfair subsidies. Still, with domestic economic activity slowing, exports have become more vital to China's economy. Exports as a percentage of GDP rose to nearly 14 percent in 1996 from 12 percent in 1995.

Economists expect China's export growth to continue at a double-digit pace into 1997 as the regional and global economic recoveries strengthen. At the same time, China's domestic demand is expected to remain soft, constrained by government measures to cool excess investment. "As long as China's trading partners avoid recession, exports should continue growing at around 10 to 15 percent over the next year while domestic demand stabilizes at a lower single-digit rate," said Arthur Kroeber of China Economic Quarterly.

The outlook suggests China's trade surplus will continue to widen in 1997, which could strain relations with the United States and other Western trading partners. In a bid to reduce China's trade surplus, the U.S. plans to impose high tariffs on a range of Chinese imports if a new trade agreement is not reached. Still, with the Chinese economy increasingly relying on exports, reducing its trade surplus will prove challenging. Overall, China's trade and economic growth remain heavily dependent on conditions outside its borders as domestic demand fails to pick up the slack.
