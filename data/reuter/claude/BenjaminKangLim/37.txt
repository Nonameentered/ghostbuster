Chinese activists protest U.S. support for Japan's bid for permanent seat in U.N. Security Council 

A group of nearly 100 Chinese activists gathered today outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing to protest America's support for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The protesters argue that Japan has not done enough to acknowledge and make amends for atrocities committed during World War 2, especially the Rape of Nanking in 1937. 

The United States, along with several other Western nations, has backed an expansion of the Security Council to include new permanent members, including Japan and India. However, China has long opposed Japan's inclusion as a permanent member, citing unresolved historical issues. The two Asian powers have a complicated relationship, marked by animosity over territorial disputes and lingering anger over Japan's wartime actions in China.

The activists held signs and chanted slogans accusing the U.S. and Japan of "revising history" and "forgetting the lessons of the past." They called on the international community to continue denying Japan a permanent seat on the Council until the country issues an official apology for the massacre in Nanking, during which Japanese soldiers killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and POWs. Japan's leaders have acknowledged "the suffering of many people" in Nanking but stopped short of offering a full, official national apology.

"We cannot stand by while Japan tries to whitewash the crimes it committed during WW2 with America's blessing," said Li Peng, one of the protest organizers, in an interview. "Admitting Japan as a permanent member of the UN Security Council will only embolden its current leadership which refuses to face up to history."  The protest ended after two hours without any clashes with security forces. Officials at the U.S. embassy could not be reached for comment.

The debate around reforming the UN Security Council has stalled for years due to disagreements between its permanent members. Critics argue the Council's current makeup, with seats for only five nations as permanent members with veto power - China, Russia, the United States, Britain, and France - no longer reflects global power dynamics and the rise of new powers like India. But reaching consensus on which new members to add and how to distribute influence on the Council has proven challenging. Today's protest highlights the historical grievances that continue to complicate geopolitics in Asia and frustrate multilateral initiatives like UN reform.
