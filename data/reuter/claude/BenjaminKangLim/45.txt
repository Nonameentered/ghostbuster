Chinese Court Rejects Appeal of Dissident Liu Nianchun, Sentenced to Labour Camp for Writing Petitions  

The Supreme People’s Court of China rejected the final appeal of prominent political dissident Liu Nianchun today, upholding his three-year sentence of re-education through labor for repeatedly submitting petitions criticizing government officials and calling for political reform. Liu, 62, was first detained by police last September and sentenced in November to three years in a labour camp. His appeal was rejected in December by an intermediate court. 

Liu’s case has drawn international condemnation as an example of China’s suppression of political dissent and free speech. For over a decade, Liu has submitted petitions to various government bodies highlighting corruption and human rights abuses, and calling for democratic reforms in China’s one-party political system. In documents seized during his arrest, Liu called for an end to censorship, the release of political prisoners, and democratic elections.

The Chinese government bans any organized political opposition or challenges to Communist Party rule. While the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom of speech, in reality, any criticism of the government or discussion of sensitive political topics is banned. Those who persist in dissent and activism routinely face harassment, arrest, and imprisonment.

According to his lawyers, Liu’s health has deteriorated significantly during his imprisonment due to lack of medical care and harsh conditions. Liu suffers from high blood pressure and heart disease, and his lawyers say he has not received necessary medication in detention. The lawyers have filed several requests for medical parole, which have all been rejected.

Supporters of Liu gathered outside the Supreme People’s Court today holding banners calling for Liu’s release. Most were dispersed by police shortly after. Police also detained a number of prominent activists and intellectuals at their homes to prevent them attending. The heavy police presence and detention of sympathizers have become standard procedure for sensitive court cases in China.

Governments and human rights groups around the world have repeatedly called on China to end its harsh treatment of political dissidents and uphold freedom of speech. After Liu’s sentencing in November, Amnesty International described it as ‘‘another tragic example of China’s refusal to tolerate dissent or criticism”. The U.S. and European Union have both issued statements condemning Liu’s detention and sentence. However, China ignores all foreign criticism of its human rights record, considering it interference in China’s internal affairs.

Liu’s lawyers say they will continue to apply for medical parole given Liu’s poor health. But they hold out little hope of success given the Chinese authorities’ unwillingness to bend to domestic or international pressure. For dissenters like Liu Nianchun calling for political change in China, imprisonment and silencing remain the norm. And as long as the Communist Party maintains its iron grip on power, little is likely to change.
