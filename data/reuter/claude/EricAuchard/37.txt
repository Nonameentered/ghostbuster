CompuServe Disbands Wow! Online Service, Shifts Focus to Business Customers and International Markets

CompuServe today announced that it is shuttering its Wow! online service and refocusing its efforts on business and international customers. The Wow! service, launched in 1996, was CompuServe's attempt to compete in the consumer Internet service provider market against rivals like America Online and MSN. However, CompuServe was never able to gain significant market share with Wow! and the service struggled to attract and retain subscribers. 

"We appreciate the loyal customers who have subscribed to Wow! over the years, but the consumer ISP market has become increasingly competitive and commoditized," said CompuServe CEO John Smith. "To thrive as a company, we need to play to our strengths by concentrating on our enterprise software and connectivity solutions for business customers, as well as growing our international operations."

CompuServe was an early pioneer in the online world, launching its first dial-up service in 1979. It dominated the industry in the 1980s and early 1990s but failed to keep up as the Internet went mainstream. The company was slow to adopt Internet connectivity and web-based interfaces, sticking with its own proprietary network and software for too long. By the time Wow! launched, CompuServe had lost significant ground to AOL, MSN, and other startups.

Wow! subscribers received notice today that the service will officially shut down on December 31. CompuServe is offering affected customers one year of free Internet connectivity through its remaining consumer ISP service, CompuServe 2000. However, the company will no longer actively market to or invest in acquiring new consumer subscribers.

"Our focus going forward is on providing software, solutions, and infrastructure to large enterprise organizations, especially those with international operations," Smith said. The company currently provides services to over 500,000 business customers across more than 150 countries. CompuServe will redeploy resources from Wow! to boost its partnerships with technology companies like Cisco, Dell, and Microsoft.
