Chips Stocks Surge on Robust Demand in North American Semiconductor Market 

Semiconductor stocks rose sharply today following new reports showing stronger than expected demand in the North American market for chips used in everything from computers and smartphones to automobiles. The Semiconductor Industry Association said sales of semiconductors in North America grew 17% in the first quarter to $62 billion, the fastest pace of growth in over a decade.

Shares of major chipmakers Intel, AMD, Nvidia and Micron Technology each gained over 5% on the news. The companies have large operations and derive a major portion of their revenue in North America. The growth underscores the key role that technology and connectivity now play in both business and personal spheres.

"There is a digital transformation happening across all sectors of the economy, from transportation and healthcare to education and retail," said Carlos Gutierrez, an analyst at research firm Needham & Co. "All of this requires more advanced, powerful chips to enable new capabilities and that is fueling this surge in demand."

The strong first quarter results point to the overall robust health of the technology sector and corporate spending on infrastructure and equipment in the world's largest chip market. Coming off a record year of sales in 2021, the semiconductor industry is on pace for another banner year of expansion that could outpace global GDP growth by a factor of three to four times, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

However, industry executives warned of potential headwinds later this year, including higher interest rates, supply chain constraints, and geopolitical tensions with China that could limit growth. The U.S. wants to curb China's access to advanced logic and memory chips that have military applications. But China remains an important end-market for many chipmakers.

"While results this quarter are very encouraging, the situation remains dynamic," said Melissa Thomas, an executive at Micron Technology, which derives about 60% of its sales from the U.S. and Canada. "Growth may moderate in coming quarters and there are external events beyond our control. But the long-term trends around ubiquitous connectivity and computing power remain firmly in our favor."
