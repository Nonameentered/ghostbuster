AT&T Faces New Competition Threat From BT-MCI Merger  

AT&T saw its shares drop 3% yesterday on news that British Telecom (BT) will acquire MCI Communications for $21 billion, creating a new telecommunications giant to challenge AT&T's dominance. The deal combines BT's strength in Europe and Asia with MCI's powerful position in the U.S., putting competitive pressure on AT&T's global network. 

The merger highlights the increasing competition in the rapidly consolidating telecom industry. With the growth of the Internet and demand for enhanced data and video services, major telecom companies are expanding globally to gain scale and scope. The BT-MCI deal follows Vodafone's $200 billion takeover of Mannesmann earlier this year and France Telecom's pending $40 billion acquisition of Orange PLC.

AT&T has traditionally relied on the huge U.S. market as the base for its operations, but the MCI merger now poses a serious threat to that position. According to analysts, the combined BT-MCI will have greater resources to attract multinational business clients seeking a single network provider for integrated voice and data services around the world. 

"This merger creates a powerhouse," said Anna-Maria Kovacs, a telecommunications analyst at TechWays consultants. "BT locks up MCI's U.S. network and high-margin business market along with gaining MCI's Internet assets, while MCI obtains BT's huge international managed data network and capital resources. AT&T will have to work harder to match that combination."

In a statement, AT&T acknowledged the increased competition but expressed confidence in its own position. "While today's announcement is further evidence of a consolidating global telecom marketplace, we believe we will continue to compete vigorously and successfully based on the scope and capabilities of our own network," said AT&T CEO Michael Armstrong.

However, some analysts argue AT&T may need to look at a transatlantic alliance of its own to counter the threat. "The BT-MCI deal changes the competitive landscape for AT&T," said Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "To remain a dominant global carrier, AT&T will need additional international assets, either through acquisition or partnership. A joint venture or merger with a major European carrier like Deutsche Telekom may now make strategic sense."

AT&T also faces challenges from other competitors, including upstart communications providers offering Internet telephony like Vonage. New technologies threaten to undermine AT&T's traditional voice revenue base. In response, AT&T has been pushing into high-speed Internet and digital TV services to diversify beyond basic phone connections.  

Earlier this year, AT&T merged its cable TV interests with Comcast to focus on the delivery of video, voice, and data services through cable lines. But access to cable infrastructure in the critical "last mile" to customers' homes does not solve the need for a wider international network to serve multinational business clients. The BT-MCI deal highlights that strategic gap, which AT&T may now have to fill to battle the competition.

In trading yesterday, AT&T shares closed at $23.42, down 73 cents on a day the overall market as measured by the S&P 500 index was little changed. BT shares gained 4% in London trading. The companies said they expect regulatory approval for their merger within six to nine months. If approved, the deal would be the largest telecommunications takeover in history and will shake up an already fast-changing global industry facing technological upheaval. AT&T will have to act decisively to secure its leadership position in this new era of intensifying competition.
