Iomega Corp's "n-hand" technology could revolutionize storage and transfer of data for handheld consumer electronics 

Iomega Corporation, a leader in data storage and protection solutions, today announced its new "n-hand" technology that allows for high-speed transfer of data between handheld consumer electronic devices. The n-hand technology uses a patent-pending process that can transfer up to 10 gigabits of data per second between devices like smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras that are up to 30 feet away from each other.

"n-hand has the potential to transform how people share and access their digital content on the go," said Tom Morgan, Iomega's chief technology officer. "With n-hand, transferring your photos from a camera to your phone or sharing a playlist between two friends' tablets can happen in a flash. We think n-hand can make these kinds of data transfers an effortless experience for people."

The n-hand technology uses the Bluetooth wireless communication protocol to create a high-speed data transfer network between multiple devices at once. It can connect up to eight Bluetooth-enabled devices at a time and allows for streaming of high-definition video and image files as well as other media files like music and documents. Because it uses the Bluetooth protocol, n-hand is compatible with most smartphones, tablets, and other consumer electronics on the market today. 

Iomega plans to license the n-hand technology to electronics makers and will showcase demonstrations of the technology at the Consumer Electronics Show next month in Las Vegas. If adopted widely, n-hand could address a growing consumer frustration with the slow speeds for transferring data between mobile devices. The technology could also enable new capabilities like instantly sharing photos at an event between friends or streaming a live sporting event from someone else's device.

"People expect their phones, tablets, cameras and other gadgets to be connected in a seamless lifestyle experience," said Mark Randall, an analyst at market research firm Envisioneering Group. "Technologies like Iomega's n-hand can help deliver on that promise by removing some of the barriers around sharing and accessing data on connected devices."

Iomega did not disclose financial terms of potential licensing deals for n-hand technology. The company's stock price rose over 7% on the news of the n-hand announcement, a sign investors see promise in the new technology. If n-hand gains rapid adoption in the consumer electronics market, it could signal another revenue stream for Iomega, which primarily relies on sales of portable hard drives and storage solutions. But with many wireless technologies in development, n-hand also faces an uncertain future depending on how quickly and broadly it is integrated into devices. Overall, n-hand is an exciting development in sharing data between connected gadgets that bears close watching in the months to come.
