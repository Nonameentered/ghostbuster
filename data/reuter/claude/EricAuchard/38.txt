Texas Instruments to Receive $1 Billion in Royalty Payments from Samsung 

Texas Instruments Inc. announced today that it will receive over $1 billion in royalty  payments from Samsung Electronics Co. over the next five years. The payments are part of a new long-term patent licensing deal between the two companies that covers a wide range of TI technologies used in Samsung mobile devices.

The deal renews a key licensing agreement between the companies that has been in place since 1995. However, analysts noted that the new terms appear to be less generous for TI compared with the original deal. In the mid-1990s, the initial agreement was very favorable for Texas Instruments, as the smartphone industry was still in its infancy. TI was able to negotiate a sizeable upfront payment from Samsung and ongoing high royalty rates on future smartphone sales.

Fast forward 25 years, and the dynamics have changed significantly. The smartphone market has matured, and there are now many companies with large patent portfolios. Samsung has also grown into the world's biggest smartphone maker, giving it more leverage in negotiations. As a result, the new deal is likely more balanced between the two companies, with a smaller upfront payment and lower royalty rates for TI, according to industry experts.

While less lucrative than the original pact, the new licensing agreement still provides a meaningful boost for Texas Instruments. Royalty payments have become an increasingly important source of revenue for TI as sales of its semiconductors for mobile devices have slowed. The company reported $977 million in total royalty revenue in 2019. The additional $1 billion from Samsung over the next five years will help TI continue to expand its investment in next-generation technologies, including 5G communications and artificial intelligence.

For Samsung, the deal reduces legal uncertainty and caps its licensing fees to TI for the next several years. With smartphone sales flattening globally, Samsung is working to control costs, and the new agreement achieves that goal according to analysts. Both companies expect the deal to drive continued collaboration on technical innovation for mobile platforms.
