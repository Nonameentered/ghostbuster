H&R Block Decides Not to Complete CompuServe Spin-Off Due to Financial Troubles and Uncertainties in the Online Industry  

H&R Block announced today that it will no longer pursue the planned spin-off of its CompuServe online service unit into a separate public company. The tax preparation giant cited CompuServe's worsening financial results, as well as significant uncertainty in the broader online services industry, as the primary reasons for abandoning the spin-off plan.

CompuServe has struggled in recent years amid intensifying competition from low-cost or free Internet service providers. The company has lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers, and revenue and profits have declined sharply. In its most recent quarter, CompuServe lost $32 million, leading H&R Block executives to conclude that spinning off the unit in its current condition could be detrimental. 

"While we continue to believe in the potential of CompuServe and the online industry, the challenges and uncertainties facing the business are substantial," said H&R Block CEO Richard Brown. "Our top priority is to stabilize CompuServe's operations and ensure the company is in the best position to succeed, whether as part of H&R Block or as a stand-alone entity."

The original spin-off plan, announced last year, aimed to separate fast-growing businesses like CompuServe from H&R Block's core tax services. However, conditions have changed significantly since then. In addition to CompuServe's troubles, once high-flying Internet companies like Yahoo and AOL have struggled, raising doubts about the online industry's growth potential.

To address CompuServe's financial issues, H&R Block said it will implement a "performance improvement plan" that may include cost cutting, restructuring subscriber fees, and exploring new partnerships or strategic alliances. The company did not rule out revisiting a CompuServe spin-off in the future if market conditions improve and its turnaround efforts gain traction.

H&R Block's shares fell over 6% on the news, reflecting investor disappointment over losing an opportunity to gain value from separating CompuServe. However, other analysts said canceling the spin-off was prudent given the risks of such a transaction at the current time. "The spin would have been a gamble, and H&R Block is smart not to gamble in this climate," said Henry Jackson, a managing director at the research firm Technology Investors Network.

With its spin-off plans scrapped, H&R Block said it will focus on strengthening its core tax business, which generates the majority of its revenue and profits. The company remains the largest tax preparation firm in the U.S., handling more than 30 million tax returns annually through its nationwide network of retail offices and tax professionals.
