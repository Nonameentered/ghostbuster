Technology Stocks Rise on Optimism for Holiday PC Sales  

Shares of major technology companies rose today as investors grew optimistic about the potential for strong PC sales during the holiday shopping season. Stocks including Microsoft, Intel, Dell and HP were all up over 2% in midday trading. 

The gains came after new data showed a surprise increase in PC shipments for the third quarter. According to IDC, PC shipments were up 3.1% from a year earlier, marking the first year-over-year growth for the PC market in six years. The growth was largely driven by strength in Europe and Asia as well as corporate PC upgrades.

“This is a promising sign for the tech sector and a good indicator for the all-important holiday shopping season, said  Ryan Thorpe, a tech analyst at Brockwell Securities. “If the PC market is strengthening, it means more people buying laptops, desktops and components and that should translate to improving revenues and profits for some of the biggest names in tech.”

Most analysts had been forecasting a decline in PC sales this year as more consumers shift to smartphones and tablets. However, some analysts now think PC growth could level off as laptop and desktop computers remain important for many tasks like writing, editing and intensive computer work. The release of Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system last year also boosted demand for new PCs.

Looking ahead to the holidays, the strongest PC growth is expected in gaming desktops and laptops as well as convertible notebook PCs that can function as tablets. The new Apple MacBook and models from HP, Lenovo and Dell should also be popular gifts. If guidance from tech companies later this week points to stronger than expected holiday PC demand, tech stocks could continue their rally.

“Technology investors have been waiting a long time for good news and evidence of real growth,” Thorpe said. “If the latest PC numbers signify the start of an upward trend, the tech sector could finally start to regain its footing and make up lost ground from years of underperformance.”
