Hong Kong Fund Managers and Life Insurers Eye Lucrative Public Pension Plan Market

Hong Kong's fund management industry and life insurance companies are positioning themselves to tap into the city's fast-growing public pension plan market. New and upcoming mandatory provident fund (MPF) schemes, coupled with an aging population,  are creating opportunities for asset managers and insurers to attract new clients and investments.

The Hong Kong government launched the MPF system in 2000 to provide retirement protection for the city's workforce. Under the system, employers and employees contribute 5% of salaries each month to approved private pension plans. Assets under management in the MPF system have grown strongly over the past two decades and now stand at over HK$1 trillion or US$130 billion.

The MPF system originally only covered those under 65 years of age, but upcoming changes will expand coverage to include people up to age 75. Patrick Ho, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said "expanding the coverage of the MPF system will allow more people to benefit from the scheme and have more financial protection in retirement." The changes are set to take effect in 2025 and the government expects an additional 600,000 people will join the MPF system as a result.

Insurers like AIA, Prudential and Manulife are launching new retirement-focused products targeting MPF members, especially those over 65. "The MPF has been an important driver of our pension business and the upcoming changes will further boost opportunities in this market segment," said Stuart Harrison, CEO of Prudential Hong Kong. The companies are also educating older citizens on the benefits of keeping funds invested in the stock market for potentially higher returns, rather than withdrawing lump sums upon retirement.

Fund houses such as BlackRock, Schroders and Fidelity are working with employers to promote the benefits of their MPF products to employees. They are highlighting the need for proper retirement planning and touting the advantages of allocating MPF investments across a variety of funds to balance risk and return.  "MPF members, especially younger ones, should take advantage of the long-term compounding benefits of the stock market to maximize their retirement savings," said Donna Cordner, Hong Kong CEO of Schroders.   A mix of equity and bond funds is typically recommended for most MPF investors based on their age and risk tolerance.

In summary, Hong Kong's pension system overhaul and aging population are providing fresh opportunities for fund managers and insurers to attract investments and new clients. While stronger macro-economic headwinds could slow growth, the MPF's compulsory and tax-advantaged nature positions it for steady, long-term expansion. Both the fund management and life insurance sectors are poised to benefit as MPF assets and membership numbers increase in the coming decade.
