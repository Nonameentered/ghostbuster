Southern Co acquires Hong Kong's Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd in $2.7bn deal

Southern Co, one of the largest electric utility companies in the United States, announced today that it acquired Hong Kong-based Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd (CEPA) in a deal worth $2.7 billion. The acquisition marks Southern Co's largest international expansion to date and signals the company's ambitions to tap into fast-growing energy markets in Asia.

CEPA is a major independent power producer in Asia, operating 10 power plants in Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore with a total installed capacity of over 8,000 megawatts. The company has a diverse fuel mix including natural gas, coal and renewable energy. Last year, CEPA generated over 45,000 gigawatt hours of electricity and earned $1.2 billion in revenue. 

The acquisition of CEPA provides Southern Co with a platform to accelerate growth in Asia which faces rising energy demands due to population growth and economic expansion. Asia is expected to account for one-third of the global energy consumption by 2040, according to projections by the International Energy Agency.

"This acquisition is a major milestone for our company and opens up tremendous opportunities for growth in Asia's burgeoning energy markets," said Thomas A. Fanning, chairman, president and CEO of Southern Co. "CEPA's assets and expertise, combined with Southern Co's resources and technical capabilities, will enable us to better meet the increasing energy needs in Asian markets."

Under the terms of the agreement, Southern Co will buy 100% of CEPA's equity and assume control of all its power generation assets. CEPA will operate as a subsidiary of Southern Co but will continue to be headquartered in Hong Kong with its current executive leadership and employees. 

The deal is still subject to regulatory approvals but Southern Co expects it to close within the next six to nine months. Once completed, CEPA's assets will increase Southern Co's total generating capacity by over 20% to more than 50,000 megawatts. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Southern Co's earnings per share in the first full year.

Moody's Investors Service revised Southern Co's outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' following the announcement, citing the strategic benefits of expanding into Asia's energy market. Southern Co's shares rose over 4% in early morning trading on the news.
