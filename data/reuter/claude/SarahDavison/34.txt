Asian Fund Managers See Stock Market Volatility on Rumours of Deng Xiaoping's Ill-Health as Ideal Buying Opportunity  

Hong Kong â€” Asian fund managers are using recent choppy trading in Chinese stocks due to unconfirmed rumours of former leader Deng Xiaoping's failing health as an opportunity to pick up bargains. 

On Thursday, the Hong Kong stock market's benchmark Hang Seng Index fell more than 3% in early trading on speculation that the 92-year-old Deng's condition had taken a turn for the worse. The news spread through WeChat messages and word of mouth, with many citing warnings from Chinese state officials to be prepared for "bad news." Although Chinese government officials denied the rumours and censored many of the social media posts discussing Deng's health, the damage to market sentiment was done.

The Hang Seng Index ended Thursday down 1.8% while the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7% on the day. By Friday morning, as the rumours were conclusively proven false, the markets rebounded. Yet some savvy fund managers took advantage of the short-term dips to scoop up stocks at discounted prices.   

"We had been anticipating some market volatility around the time of important political events or dates in China," said Charles Li, fund manager at Shanghai-based Bright Star Capital.  "Deng Xiaoping's health is obviously an extremely sensitive issue, so while the rumours were distressing, they also created opportunity."

Li said Bright Star Capital bought shares of major Chinese technology companies, banks and electric vehicle makers on Thursday as the markets tanked. "We believed the rumours would eventually be clarified and stability restored. Meanwhile, the fundamentals supporting China's economy remain intact," he added.  

Other fund managers echoed similar views that while the prospect of Deng's death could significantly impact China in the long term, the immediate market panic was overblown and presented a chance for short-term gains. Deng, though retired from politics for many years, is still revered as the architect of China's post-Mao economic reforms and opening policies. His eventual passing would likely plunge the nation into a period of mourning and reflection.
