Calls for an Upgrade of Asia's Financial Infrastructure in Wake of Thai Banking Crisis 

The recent turmoil in Thailand's banking system has highlighted the urgent need to modernize financial infrastructure across Asia to reduce systemic risk. Thailand's central bank was forced to take control of two troubled banks in June amid a surge of bad loans, wiping out the savings of thousands of depositors. 

The crisis has exposed serious deficiencies in Thailand's financial safety nets, oversight, and resolution mechanisms. Deposit insurance in Thailand only covers a maximum of about $15,000 per account, leaving most small depositors exposed. Meanwhile, weak supervision of risky lending practices at some Thai banks was a key factor that led to their collapse. 

Thai regulators also lacked effective tools to restructure and resolve teetering banks in an orderly fashion before they failed. The country does not have a proper framework for "bail-ins" where bank creditors and large uninsured depositors share the cost of restructuring, as required under new global standards. 

The shortcomings in Thailand's financial system are prevalent across most emerging Asian economies. Deposit insurance coverage tends to be very low, prudential oversight remains underdeveloped, bankruptcy resolution frameworks are nascent, and tools like bail-ins have not yet been implemented. Governments across the region have been reluctant to take politically unpopular steps to strengthen regulation and impose losses on investors.

However, the costs of inaction are rising. More fragile banks means financial crises tend to hit emerging Asia hardest. The 1997 Asian financial crisis, for example, caused by poor risk management and weak regulation, plunged the region into deep recession. Global bodies like the Financial Stability Board are also demanding faster progress in shoring up financial systems.

Reform advocates argue that modernizing Asia's financial safety nets and resolution tools is critical to sustaining future growth and stability. Generous deposit insurance, robust prudential regulation, bank "living wills," and well-defined bail-in powers can help avoid messy collapses while protecting taxpayers. Creating regional bodies to monitor risk across borders can also flag vulnerabilities early.

Despite the pain, Thailand's banking troubles provide an opportunity for policymakers to push ahead with needed upgrades to the financial system. By learning the lessons from this crisis and taking bold actions, Thailand and other Asian nations can rebuild confidence in their banking sectors and place them on a more sustainable footing for the decades to come. Overall, more developed financial infrastructure across emerging Asia will benefit both global investors as well as citizens across the region who deserve transparent, well-regulated systems that protect their economic futures.
