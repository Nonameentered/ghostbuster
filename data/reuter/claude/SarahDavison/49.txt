Hong Kong's Hefty Reserves Provide Comfortable Cushion for Babies Born in 1997 

Hong Kong welcomed its first batch of "handover babies" in 1997, the year Britain handed over control of the territory to China. These babies born on June 30 1997 and on July 1, 1997, were the first born under Chinese rule. Now turning 20 years old, these young adults are entering university and the workforce, at a time when Hong Kong's finances are robust enough to support them.

Hong Kong has amassed foreign reserves of over US$415 billion as of December 2016, an all-time high that provides a significant buffer for its economy.  These hefty reserves have been accumulated over decades through Hong Kong's open economy and active global trade and finance sectors. They represent over seven months of goods and services import cover for Hong Kong, higher than the IMF's recommended three months.

The substantial reserves have allowed Hong Kong to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies and spur economic growth during downturns. Hong Kong's fiscal reserves enable the government to invest in developing human capital and improving welfare for its citizens. New initiatives like tax rebates, improved healthcare benefits, education vouchers, and housing allowances for the underprivileged have been implemented in recent years.

For the "handover babies" who grew up in an era of political change and uncertainty at home, Hong Kong's solid fiscal position offers reassurance. "Knowing Hong Kong has significant reserves makes me feel secure about my future here," says Jane Lee, an accounting student at Hong Kong University born on June 30, 1997. The reserves represent stability and continuity amid an evolving political landscape.

With a steady government committed to welfarism, a highly educated young workforce, and a strong fiscal base, Hong Kong appears well-placed to navigate challenges ahead and support its next generation born into the new era. The hefty reserves amassed give "handover babies" like Jane confidence in Hong Kong's ability to thrive for decades to come. Overall, Hong Kong's robust fiscal cushion forms a comforting base for its young citizens born on the dawn of its return to China.
