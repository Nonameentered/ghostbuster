Hong Kong Celebrates Final Lunar New Year under British Rule Amid Rising Political Tension 

HONG KONG — The streets of Hong Kong were filled with the sounds and scents of celebration this weekend as residents gathered to mark the Lunar New Year. But underlying the festivities was a mix of nostalgia and uncertainty. This will be the last Lunar New Year under British rule as Hong Kong is set to return to China on July 1 after more than 150 years of colonial governance.

Colorful parades, fireworks displays, and other public events drew large crowds, a testament to the important role tradition and community play in Hong Kong life. However, political tensions and worries about the handover to China loomed in the background. 

“We want to enjoy this holiday but it’s hard not to think about what will happen after June 30,” said David Wong, a shopkeeper in the bustling Causeway Bay district. “Will Hong Kong still be the freewheeling, lively place we know and love? Or will it become just another Chinese city under Beijing's tight control?”

When Britain gained control of Hong Kong Island in 1841 at the end of the First Opium War, few could have imagined it would go on to rule the territory for over a century and a half. But in 1984, Britain and China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, agreeing to return Hong Kong in 1997. Under the “one country, two systems” principle, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region, retaining its economic and social systems for 50 years.

However, activists and pro-democracy groups fear that Beijing will renege on promises of autonomy and freedoms like free speech. Tensions spiked last year over electoral reform controversy. Protests in the city are expected to ramp up ahead of the July 1 handover.

Against this backdrop of political uncertainty, many Hong Kongers are determined to make the most of this Lunar New Year and show Beijing that the city’s vibrant traditions remain intact. Cultural events and temple fairs saw higher turnouts this year, with some spanning nearly an entire week.  The celebratory mood was evident everywhere, from the ritualistic burning of paper offerings to the clamor of open-air flower markets.

"We want to send a message to Beijing that they should not interfere too much with Hong Kong," said James Cheng, a real estate agent. "Our city has its own identity, cultural heritage and way of life. That's what this holiday represents to me - a tribute to the Hong Kong spirit."
