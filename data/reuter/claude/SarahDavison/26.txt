Investing in Asian Power Stocks More Uncertain Than Predicted: Analysts  

The outlook for investing in Asian power utilities and renewable energy companies has become more uncertain in recent months according to several industry analysts and experts. While many analysts had predicted strong growth and investment returns from Asian power companies focused on renewable and green energy, several factors have emerged that threaten this optimistic view.

One of the biggest issues is the economic growth rate slowdown in some of Asia's largest economies, including China and Japan. A weakening economy means less demand for new power generation and infrastructure spending. "China's economic growth has been slowing for years, and 2019 was the slowest growth in nearly 30 years," said John Smith, an analyst at ACME Investment Research. "Slower growth in China directly impacts demand for energy and new power projects."

Less demand for new power infrastructure and renewable energy systems is also being exacerbated by a decline in investment from the Chinese government. Beijing had been spending heavily to subsidize new renewable energy projects and smart power grid upgrades, but government support has started to wane. Without strong government subsidies and investments, renewable energy companies face more challenging economics, according to experts.

Oversupply of electricity generation capacity has also become a problem in some Asian countries. Years of strong spending on new coal-fired power plants and solar and wind farms has left some countries with surplus power generation that is not being used. "Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines have serious overcapacity issues with their power sectors that will limit new opportunities for investors and utilities," said Mary Johnson, Director of Asia Power Research at XYZ Securities. "They already have more generation capacity than the current grid demands."
