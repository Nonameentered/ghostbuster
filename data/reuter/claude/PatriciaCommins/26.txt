Kellogg Co. Hoping for Competitors to Cut Back Promotions, May Be Forced to Increase Costly Marketing Efforts in 1997

Kellogg Co., the nation's largest cereal maker, is hoping its competitors scale back heavy promotional spending in 1997. However, Kellogg may find itself increasing its own costly marketing and advertising efforts if rivals like General Mills and Post Holdings Inc. continue aggressive promotions to win market share.  

Kellogg spent $960 million on advertising and promotion in 1996, up 9% from 1995. The promotional wars with its rivals are squeezing profit margins in the $9 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. While increased marketing has helped boost overall category sales, it has come at a cost. Kellogg's operating profit margin fell to 16.3% last year from 18.5% in 1995.

"The level of promotion in the U.S. cereal market has been very high over the last few years and we would like to see it decline," said John Bryant, Kellogg's chief financial officer. However, Mr. Bryant said Kellogg is prepared to ramp up marketing spending to defend its leading 50% share of the U.S. cereal market if competitors intensify their promotions.

Analysts say General Mills, which makes Cheerios, and Post, maker of Fruity Pebbles and Grape-Nuts, are unlikely to cut promotions significantly. "They have to go after Kellogg's to win back market share," said Ted Cooper, an analyst with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Price cuts, discount coupons, and advertising are the primary tools.

Promotional activity began escalating in 1993 and 1994 when General Mills launched a revival of its monster brand, Count Chocula, and Post reintroduced Cookie Crisp. To counter, Kellogg increased promotions on brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. The promotions continue today with kids getting toys in packages and coupons offering 50 cents to $1 off.

While the promotions have helped boost cereal sales 3% annually since 1993, price competition has hurt profit margins. Category leaders like Kellogg are most affected because they have the furthest to fall. Kellogg and others also face higher costs for ingredients like grains and sugar.

Kellogg hopes competitors will refocus on product innovation rather than price cuts. But for now, analysts expect marketing budgets to continue swelling in the battle for cereal sales. Said Mr. Cooper, "Nobody wants to be the first to pull back." Overall, it seems a return to more stable and profitable conditions may remain elusive for Kellogg.
