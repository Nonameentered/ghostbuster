Archer Daniels Midland Co may face criminal charges in price-fixing investigation, experts say  

Archer Daniels Midland Co, the global food processing and commodities trading company, may face criminal charges related to a long-running price-fixing investigation, legal experts said. Federal prosecutors have been investigating price fixing in the food additives industry for several years. ADM and other companies have been accused of conspiring to fix prices for lysine, an amino acid used as an additive in animal feed, as well as high fructose corn syrup.

If indicted on criminal charges, ADM would face a difficult trial and potentially large fines. The company has set aside $400 million for potential costs related to the investigations but legal experts said total costs could exceed $1 billion if ADM is found guilty at trial. “The evidence that the prosecutors have appears quite strong,” said Robert Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore who specializes in antitrust cases. “ADM could be in real trouble here if they are indicted.”

ADM is the world’s largest processor of corn, soybeans, wheat and cocoa. It has close relationships with major food and beverage companies around the globe. Any criminal charges would damage ADM’s reputation and could impact its business relationships, although most experts said they expect ADM to eventually settle the case through a plea agreement before any trial.

The price-fixing probe has already ensnared several ADM executives. Michael Andreas, the former head of ADM’s corn processing business, pleaded guilty in 1999 to two criminal counts in the lysine investigation. He spent three years in a federal prison. Three Asian companies and several executives have also pleaded guilty in the investigations. Andreas’ guilty plea stated that top ADM executives were aware of and condoned the price-fixing activities, but the company itself has not yet faced criminal charges.

The investigations have dragged on for years due to their complexity, but most experts expect the government to push for a resolution, potentially led by newly confirmed Attorney General William Barr. Barr has experience with long-running investigations from his time serving as Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush. While some argue that the case is a relic of the past that should be dropped, antitrust experts counter that price fixing undermines free market principles and that dropping the case could encourage future corporate malfeasance.

With Barr now directing the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other antitrust regulators may take a harder line against price fixing and other anticompetitive corporate behavior, experts said. ADM and other major corporations will likely have to contend with a renewed emphasis on antitrust laws that have been perceived as laxly enforced for decades. Whether the ongoing ADM price-fixing probe ends in criminal charges or a settlement, it serves as a warning for companies to strengthen compliance and avoid unlawful behavior, the experts noted.
