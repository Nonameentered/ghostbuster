Fast-Food Chains Continue Burger Battle in 1997 with New Recipes and Promotions  

The fast-food burger wars are heating up again in 1997 as major chains roll out new burger recipes and promotions to win over customers. McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's, the three largest burger chains, are all making moves to gain an edge.

McDonald's is launching a new burger called the Big Xtra, which features one-third pound beef patties, a slice of cheese, tomatoes, pickles, onions, lettuce, and Big Mac sauce on a sesame seed bun. The Big Xtra is McDonald's largest burger offering in decades and is clearly aimed at competing with Burger King's Whopper. McDonald's will promote the burger launch with national TV advertising, in-store promotions, and coupons for the new burger.  

Not to be outdone, Burger King this month introduced a new burger recipe using 100% Black Angus beef for its Whopper and Cheeseburger. Burger King is touting the new Angus burger recipe in a marketing campaign positioning the brand as the "home of the Whopper" made with higher-quality ingredients. The Angus burger recipe comes on the heels of Burger King's successful launches of chicken fries and breakfast sandwiches last year.

Wendy's also made changes to its bacon cheeseburger recently and has been promoting a “pick fresh, pick Wendy's” marketing message to underscore the freshness and quality of its burger ingredients. While McDonald's and Burger King focus on recipe changes, Wendy's is hoping its pick-fresh messaging and existing burger selection will resonate with customers seeking alternatives to the big burger chains.   

The fast-food burger battle plays out as the chains work to boost flagging sales and traffic in a increasingly competitive market.  New burger recipes and promotions are a time-honored approach to drive customer interest, capture market share, and build revenue and profits. The question is whether the latest moves by McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's will satisfy customers and turn the tide in the ongoing burger wars. Consumers will ultimately determine the winners and losers in the burger battle of 1997.
