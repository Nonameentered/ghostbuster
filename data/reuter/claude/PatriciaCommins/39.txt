Western Resources Inc alliance with ONEOK Inc could boost earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 a share in first full year of operations 

Western Resources Inc announced today that it has formed a strategic alliance with ONEOK Inc to jointly develop natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure in the Williston Basin. The 50-50 joint venture is expected to significantly expand both companies' operations in the prolific Bakken shale formation.

Under the terms of the agreement, Western Resources and ONEOK will jointly construct and operate natural gas gathering pipelines and processing plants in North Dakota and Montana. The infrastructure is projected to come online in stages over the next 18 to 24 months. Once fully operational, the joint venture could generate between $75 million to $100 million in incremental annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for each partner.

"This alliance with ONEOK will allow us to accelerate the build-out of infrastructure to support producers developing the Bakken," said Robert Myers, CEO of Western Resources. "It is a win-win that enables both companies to efficiently expand operations to match the dynamic growth of natural gas and natural gas liquids production from the play."

The deal will expand Western Resources' natural gas gathering and processing capacity in the Williston Basin by 200 million to 300 million cubic feet per day. For ONEOK, it enhances its existing assets which currently gather about 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bakken and Three Forks formations.   

Analysts responded positively to the announcement, highlighting the strategic benefits and potential cost efficiencies from the joint venture. "The partnership is a natural fit and leverages the core competencies of each company," said Logan McDougall of RBC Capital Markets. "We expect the venture to be accretive to both Western Resources and ONEOK, contributing $0.10 to $0.15 per share of incremental earnings in the first full year of operations."

Shares of Western Resources jumped 4.5% on the news while ONEOK's stock price rose 2.3%. The transaction is expected to close within the next 60 days, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
