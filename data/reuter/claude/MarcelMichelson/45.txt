Former head of GE says group ready to deal with whoever wins Thomson SA ownership 

The former chairman and CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, said today that GE and its partners in a consortium bidding for Thomson SA will work with whatever group ultimately gains control of the French media and electronics company.

Welch told reporters that GE and its consortium partners, including private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Eurazeo, submitted a serious bid for Thomson SA because they believe in the long-term potential of the company. However, he said they will respect the outcome of the auction process and work constructively with whichever bid is successful.

“We believe Thomson has tremendous assets and a strong market position that any potential owner could build upon,” Welch said. “While we remain committed to and enthusiastic about our own bid, we will not engage in a hostile takeover or take any action to undermine the final ownership chosen by Thomson.”

Thomson SA has been seeking a buyer for all or part of the company since this spring. In addition to the GE consortium, Thomson has received bids from French conglomerate Bouygues, MBK Partners, and investment fund MatlinPatterson, according to sources close to the proposals. A final decision is expected within weeks, though Thomson has not commented publicly on the timing.

Welch said that regardless of the outcome, GE sees potential to expand its existing partnership with Thomson. GE currently owns 35% of NBC Universal, a media company that is 20% owned by Thomson. Welch said this joint ownership stake shows the companies can work together constructively, and GE would look to build on this relationship even if its ownership bid is rejected.

Some analysts see Welch’s comments as an attempt to pressure Thomson to accept the GE group’s offer by indicating that GE will remain a key partner whatever the result. However, others argue that Welch’s stance seems genuinely open to working with a new owner, whomever it may be. 

Christopher Fortier, an analyst with Credit Agricole in Paris, said, “GE appears willing to keep an open mind. They recognize that Thomson is in play and just want a seat at the table in influencing how that company develops in the coming years, with or without an ownership stake.”

The outcome of the Thomson auction is seen as a test of foreign interest in large French companies. Success for Bouygues in particular could be seen as a national victory by some politicians and shareholders in France. However, Welch argued that GE's global experience and resources also represent compelling benefits, regardless of its non-French roots.

“We believe GE brings unique operational and strategic experience that would greatly benefit Thomson,” Welch said. “But we understand there are national sensitivities at play here as well. Our message is simply that we will support Thomson's success in any scenario."
