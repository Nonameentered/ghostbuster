Cie Generale des Eaux launches bid to challenge France Telecom with new fixed telephone network 

Cie Generale des Eaux (CGE), the French water utility, announced plans today to build a nationwide fixed telephone network, posing the first major challenge to France Telecom's monopoly. CGE aims to invest 15 billion francs over the next five years to build a fiber optic and copper wire network covering over 60% of French households. 

The move is a bold expansion by CGE into telecommunications, an area outside its traditional water and waste management business. However, CGE believes its expertise deploying extensive infrastructure networks and managing utility operations gives it a competitive advantage to take on the state-owned France Telecom.

"We have ambitious plans to become the leading alternative fixed network operator in France, said CGE Chairman and CEO Gerard Mestrallet. "Our large-scale infrastructure expertise will allow us to build a next-generation network at lower cost, which will translate into better prices and services for customers."

CGE's new network will begin partial service in 2020 and aims to achieve nationwide coverage by 2025. It will offer telephone, broadband Internet and TV services to residential and business customers. CGE said its fiber optic network will provide download speeds up to 1 gigabit per second, far surpassing average speeds currently available in France.

The move is expected to substantially intensify competition in the French telecommunications market, which has long been dominated by France Telecom. While several companies offer mobile and broadband services, France Telecom has faced little challenge to its fixed telephone network. CGE's initiative could significantly dent France Telecom's market share and revenue over the long term.

In response, a France Telecom spokesman said "We welcome competition as a way to incentivize investment in next-generation networks and better serve customers. However, we remain confident in our ability to provide the best fixed and mobile services to our subscribers across France with our significant infrastructure and innovation capabilities."

France's telecommunications regulator ARCEP also expressed support for CGE's plans. "We are committed to policies that increase competition and consumer choice, said ARCEP head Sebastien Cattagnol. "CGE's entry into the fixed broadband market is a positive development, and we will work to ensure they have fair access to resources to build their network."

CGE's stock rose 4% on the announcement, as investors anticipate strong growth potential from the company's move into telecommunications. However, some analysts note the heavy costs and risks associated with building a nationwide broadband network from scratch. CGE will need to sign up many new customers to generate adequate returns on its investment, in the face of aggressive competition from the dominant France Telecom. 

The coming years will prove pivotal as CGE embarks on this ambitious new endeavor outside its traditional area of expertise. If successful, it may emerge as a powerful player in European telecommunications. But failure is also a possibility, and CGE could face major financial losses if its network gamble does not pay off. The battle for control of France's fixed telephone and broadband market is poised to heat up, with the opening shots fired today.
