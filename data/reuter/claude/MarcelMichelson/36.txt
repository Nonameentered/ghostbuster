Cie Generale des Eaux launches bid to rival France Telecom with fixed-line network

Compagnie Générale des Eaux (CGE), France's largest water and waste management company, announced plans today to build a nationwide fixed-line telecommunications network, putting it on a collision course with the country's dominant phone operator, France Télécom.

The move is a bold challenge to France Télécom's monopoly and comes amid broader telecom deregulation across Europe that is intensifying competition. CGE said its network would provide telephone, internet and television services over fiber-optic lines to 5 million households within 5 years, representing about 20% of all French homes.

"We believe France is ready for a new alternative for fixed-line telecommunications and high-speed broadband," said Jean-Louis Chaussade, CGE's chief executive. "With our expertise in utility infrastructure and customer service, CGE is well positioned to become a major player in this market."

Shares in CGE rose over 4% on the news, while France Télécom's stock dropped by nearly 3%. Analysts said CGE's move could significantly disrupt the status quo, even if the water utility captures only a modest market share. "This new competitor with deep pockets and millions of existing customer relationships is a worst-case scenario for France Télécom," said Thomas von Hippel, a telecom analyst at BNP Exane Paribas in Paris. 

To establish its telecom unit, CGE said it would invest over €3 billion to deploy fiber optic cables alongside its existing underground water pipelines. The company aims to reach 1 million households within 12 months and charge customers €30 to €40 per month for broadband internet and pay-TV packages.
