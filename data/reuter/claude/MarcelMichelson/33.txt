EDF Sells Stake in Sydkraft AB to Statkraft SF and Forms Alliance for Hydroelectric Projects in Southeast Asia

France's Électricité de France SA (EDF) announced today that it has agreed to sell its 49% stake in Swedish power company Sydkraft AB to Norwegian state-owned utility Statkraft SF. Sydkraft AB owns and operates hydroelectric power stations in southern Sweden. 

Statkraft will acquire EDF's shares for €1.2 billion, raising its ownership in Sydkraft to 100%. The deal is expected to close within the next three months pending regulatory approvals.

EDF is divesting its shares in Sydkraft as part of a broader strategy to exit minority stakes in companies in order to focus on majority-owned subsidiaries and new renewable energy projects. The sale will generate funds for EDF to reinvest in new hydroelectric projects, particularly in Southeast Asia.

Along with the announcement of the Sydkraft sale, EDF and Statkraft confirmed they have signed a memorandum of understanding to form a strategic alliance to jointly develop new hydroelectric power stations in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam. The companies aim to leverage their decades of experience in designing, building, and operating hydroelectric projects in Europe and apply that expertise in emerging Asian markets.

Southeast Asia's hydroelectric power potential is substantial, with less than 10% of feasible sites currently tapped. EDF and Statkraft believe the region could benefit from non-fossil fuel electricity generation from hydro to meet rising demand in a sustainable manner. Their alliance will allow the companies to share technical, financial, and operational resources and bid jointly on new projects, improving their chances for success.

EDF CEO Jean-Bernard Lévy stated, “Divesting our shares in Sydkraft and forming this alliance with Statkraft will enable EDF to redirect investment into new renewable projects that fit our low-carbon generation vision.” Statkraft CEO Christian Rynning-Tønnesen said, “Teaming up with EDF in Southeast Asia opens new opportunities to leverage our hydroelectric experience and competitiveness on a broader geographical scale.”

The sale of EDF's stake in Sydkraft is expected to modestly dilute the company's earnings over the next two years but turn accretive as new projects from the Statkraft alliance come online. EDF shares rose 3.2% on news of the agreement. Statkraft is wholly owned by the Norwegian government, so no impact on equity markets.
