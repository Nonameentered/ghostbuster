Battle over interconnection charges and public service costs in France Telecom privatisation 

The French government's plan to privatise France Telecom through an initial public offering of shares later this year has run into opposition from competitors over the level of interconnection charges and the funding of public service obligations.

The government intends to float around 15-20% of France Telecom on the stock market, raising billions of euros to boost state coffers. However, telecom operators and consumer groups argue the planned privatisation will entrench France Telecom's dominant position and lead to higher prices unless regulations around interconnection rates and public service funding are addressed.

Interconnection charges refer to the fees operators pay each other to connect calls across networks. France Telecom currently charges far higher interconnection rates to competitors than the European average, with calls to mobiles costing up to 10 times more to connect than in the UK or Germany. Critics argue these excessively high charges act as a barrier to competition and should be cut before privatisation.

The government has proposed reducing interconnection rates by up to 25% over three years. However, alternative operators say this is too little, too late, and rates should be cut by at least 50% immediately to bring France into line with European norms before France Telecom's market power is cemented by privatisation.

Public service obligations refer to services such as universal access to payphones and telephone directories that France Telecom currently provides as part of its state-owned status. The funding of these obligations after privatisation remains unclear and requires resolution to ensure service levels do not deteriorate, according to consumer groups. 

A spokesperson for France Telecom stated the firm is open to negotiating new lower interconnection charges provided they are applied fairly across the whole telecoms sector. On public service funding, France Telecom believes it should be compensated for any loss-making but socially important services it continues to provide to meet its public service obligations.

Both issues remain unresolved but require urgent attention ahead of the planned privatisation to ensure a competitive telecoms market and safeguard consumer interests according to operators and watchdogs. The government is under pressure to announce revisions to the current proposals to alleviate concerns around the potential dominance of a privatised France Telecom.
