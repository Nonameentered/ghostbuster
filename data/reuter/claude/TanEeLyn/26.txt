China Stages Controversial Vote to Set Up Hong Kong Parliament and Oust Elected Lawmakers 

The Chinese government took decisive action today to reshape politics in Hong Kong by installing a new committee to vet candidates for the territory's legislature and removing four pro-democracy lawmakers from office.

The new vetting committee, which will review candidates to ensure they are "patriots," is widely seen as a way for Beijing to exert more control over Hong Kong and block opposition voices from the city's political process. The ouster of the lawmakers, all of whom are considered relatively moderate, is an indicator that Beijing will brook no dissent as it moves to quash Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.

The actions drew immediate condemnation from activists, lawmakers and Western governments as a violation of China's promise to grant Hong Kong a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after Britain handed over the territory in 1997. But China has grown increasingly impatient with unrest and protests in Hong Kong, seeing them as a threat to Communist Party rule. The new measures are meant to ensure that only politicians deemed loyal to Beijing can hold office in Hong Kong.

In a statement, China's liaison office in Hong Kong said the dismissals of the lawmakers were justified to "maintain the integrity of the city's political framework and the effective performance of the Legislative Council." But pro-democracy lawmakers denounced the unprecedented removal of elected officials before their term expires, calling it an outrageous attack on Hong Kong's democratic institutions and the will of voters.

The moves capped a sweeping effort by Beijing over the past year to exert more control over Hong Kong through the imposition of a tough national security law, the postponement of legislative elections and the disqualification of pro-democracy candidates. Polls show public support for the pro-democracy movement is waning amid the crackdown, but acts of dissent still flare up regularly.

Western nations have voiced concerns about Beijing's tightening grip, but taken little action. In a statement today, Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said the Biden administration was "deeply concerned" about the latest steps, which he said further undermined Hong Kong's democratic institutions. But China's leaders appear resolute in their push for more control over the territory, and there is little sign of a slackening crackdown. The fate of Hong Kong as a semi-autonomous enclave with democratic freedoms appears increasingly in doubt.
