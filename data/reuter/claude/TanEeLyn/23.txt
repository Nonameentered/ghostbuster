China Endorses Tung Chee-hwa to Lead Hong Kong after Reversion to Chinese Rule in 1997 

Beijing, China, December 15, 1996—China officially endorsed tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as the first chief executive of Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in July 1997. The selection of Tung, a Shanghai-born shipping magnate, confirms expectations that China would choose a business-friendly leader to ensure economic and political stability in Hong Kong.

The Chinese government selected Tung from a shortlist of candidates to lead Hong Kong for five years after Britain ends its 156-year colonial rule. The list was drawn up by a 400-member selection committee hand-picked by Beijing. At a press conference today, officials of the Chinese State Council announced their endorsement of Tung, citing his business experience and loyalty to China.

Tung, 68, fled with his family from Shanghai to Hong Kong with little money in 1949 following the Communist revolution. He built up a major shipping firm, Orient Overseas Container Line, that now has offices worldwide. Tung has long served in advisory roles to the Chinese government on Hong Kong. Though loyal to Beijing, Tung is seen as a pragmatic moderate who will protect Hong Kong's political and economic freedoms.

Under the “one country, two systems” formula agreed by Britain and China, Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule but retain its own legal system and civil liberties for 50 years. Tung will take over from the current British governor, Chris Patten, on July 1, 1997, when Patten formally hands Hong Kong to the Chinese in a ceremony marking the end of British rule.

Tung's selection drew a mixed response in Hong Kong, where fears of Chinese control run deep. Pro-democracy activists voiced concern that Tung would too closely follow Beijing's orders. But business groups hailed the choice of a leader with strong financial credentials who would provide continuity.

Tung faces significant challenges as Hong Kong's first chief executive under Chinese rule. He must balance Hong Kong's demands for self-rule with China's determination to exert control. He must also deal with an economy buffeted by slowing growth in China and instability in the Asian financial markets. How Tung handles these competing pressures will determine whether Hong Kong continues to thrive as an international financial hub under Chinese sovereignty.
