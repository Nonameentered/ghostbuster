Ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong warned they won't receive British passports in handover to China if they relinquished other passports in order to qualify  

Ethnic minority residents in Hong Kong who gave up their foreign passports in hopes of securing British citizenship before the handover to China in 1997 are now being told they will not receive a British passport. The UK government has warned that it will not issue passports to ethnic minorities who renounced other citizenships specifically to become eligible for a British Dependent Territories Citizen passport, a special passport issued to Hong Kong residents before the handover.

The BDTC passports allowed residents to retain ties to Britain but did not provide citizenship. As the handover approached, the UK government announced a path to citizenship for BDTC holders who wanted British citizenship. However, it excluded those who had renounced other citizenships after January 1, 1996 in order to apply. At the time, this affected principally ethnic minority residents of Hong Kong who held foreign passports that did not allow dual citizenship. Many renounced their original citizenships, believing it was the only way to obtain the BDTC passport and eventually British citizenship.

Now, campaigners say it is unjust to deny these residents British citizenship, especially since many have lived in Hong Kong for generations and have nowhere else to call home. They argue that the UK has a moral obligation to ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, who face discrimination and lack of political representation under Chinese rule. 

A spokesperson for the British government reiterated that the policy excluding those who renounced other citizenships has been in place for decades. However, the government acknowledged the unique circumstances of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. "We recognize the sensitive position of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and remain committed to supporting this community. Their status and well-being continues to be an important issue in our relationship with Hong Kong," the spokesperson said.

The news comes at a sensitive time, as China is exerting more control over Hong Kong and concerns grow over erosion of political and social freedoms. Ethnic minorities find themselves in an especially precarious position, unsure of their identity and political rights in Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty. For those minorities who gave up citizenships to become British, only to find that door now closed, the situation is particularly dire and uncertain. Campaigners vow to continue pressuring the UK government to provide citizenship to this group, though time is running out before the handover officially takes hold.
