Hong Kong's Future Leader to Discuss Legality and Funding of Provisional Legislature with China's Legislators 

John Lee, the sole candidate handpicked by Beijing to be Hong Kong’s next leader, will travel to China this week to meet with top legislators on issues surrounding the establishment of a provisional legislature. Lee is expected to discuss the legality of dismantling Hong Kong’s elected legislature and replacing it with one dominated by pro-Beijing figures. He will also address how to fund this new interim body.

The move to replace Hong Kong’s 70-member Legislative Council with a smaller provisional legislature came after China passed a resolution in March allowing the city’s electoral system to be restructured. Many view it as an attempt by Beijing to exert more control over the city, which was promised a “high degree of autonomy” when Britain handed it over to China in 1997.

Lee, Hong Kong’s former security chief, needs approval from China's parliament for his leadership bid. His meetings with officials from China's National People's Congress raise questions about how independent he can be in pushing back against Beijing's increasing influence over the city's political institutions and freedoms. Lee has said Hong Kong will enter a "new chapter" under his leadership and promote policies that strengthen national security and patriotism among residents.  

Despite protests from pro-democracy activists, Hong Kong’s current legislature is expected to vote itself out of existence in the coming months. The provisional legislature may have as few as 30 to 40 members, according to local media reports, most of whom will be chosen by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing politicians. No public elections will be held.

Some legal scholars argue this would violate Hong Kong’s Basic Law, which promises that the city “shall establish a relatively independent judicial system.”  With an interim legislature formed without elections, they say this independence is in jeopardy. The plan will also tap into Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves to fund the provisional body, a move critics argue lacks transparency and accountability.

Lee is expected to report back on his meetings in the coming days. His eventual selection as Hong Kong's next Chief Executive, a position he is so far running unopposed for, signals a new era of Communist Party control that further erodes the democratic principles Hong Kong has long held dear.
