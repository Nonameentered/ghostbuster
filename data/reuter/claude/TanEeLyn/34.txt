British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind Faces Tough Reception in Hong Kong Before Handover to China 

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in Hong Kong today for a two-day visit ahead of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in July. Rifkind is expected to face a challenging reception in Hong Kong as many residents remain skeptical of Chinese control and wary of potential erosions of political and economic freedoms under Beijing's rule.

 Rifkind's visit is aimed at reassuring Hong Kongers about Britain's commitment to a "smooth and orderly" transition of power based on the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. But his optimistic tone may ring hollow for some. "No one really believes Britain has the will or leverage to hold China to the promises they made for Hong Kong's future," said Martin Lee, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party.

Under the Joint Declaration, China agreed to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life for 50 years after the handover. But China's recent tightening grip has raised doubts. Last week, China announced it would dissolve Hong Kong's democratically elected Legislative Council and replace it with an appointed body. "China is already reneging on its word, and Britain is letting it happen," said Lee.

Rifkind is expected to meet with Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patten, who was appointed by Britain to oversee the handover. Patten has been an outspoken critic of China's interference in Hong Kong. His relationship with Chinese leaders has been acrimonious, and Beijing has vowed to undo many of Patten's reforms after it takes control.

Economic anxiety also looms. As a British colony, Hong Kong has thrived as a global financial hub with low taxes and minimal regulation. There are fears China may erode Hong Kong's competitive advantages by imposing greater control over its economy. "Investors see the political uncertainty and possibility of economic mismanagement by Beijing as a real risk," said economist Victor Fung.

While China has remained defiant against criticisms, Rifkind's visit is a reminder of how much is at stake. "Hong Kong people value their way of life and democratic freedoms inherited from Britain," said Emily Lau, a pro-democracy legislator. "We hope Mr. Rifkind presses China to uphold its promises, not just for Hong Kong's sake but also its own credibility on the global stage." Rifkind faces a difficult balancing act - and an uncertain future for Hong Kong hangs in the balance.
