China Insists Democratic Party Abide by Beijing's Rules in Response to Request for Talks  

Beijing rejected a request from representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. to visit China for talks, insisting that any engagement must abide by China's terms. The rebuff highlights the increasingly frayed relationship between the world's two largest economies as tensions mount over trade, technology, human rights and geopolitical power.

A delegation of Democratic lawmakers sought to visit China this month to meet with government and business leaders. In a letter, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said the trip could not proceed as proposed and suggested the lawmakers abide by China's rules. "Any visit to China by U.S. congressional members must strictly follow the relevant rules and regulations of the Chinese government regarding activities of foreign legislators," the letter said.

The rejection comes as the Biden administration seeks to balance competition and cooperation with an increasingly assertive China. While President Biden and leaders in Beijing have agreed to talks on a range of issues, distrust between the countries had deepened over the past several years. The Democrats' trip was proposed as a way to open new lines of communication, but China's insistence that any talks follow its strict rules governing foreign legislators would have constrained the scope of discussions.

Ties have deteriorated in part because of China's human rights abuses, its crackdown on political dissent in Hong Kong, and policies that forced technology transfer from U.S. companies. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have found rare common ground in condemning China's policies, taking a more hardline stance than administrations under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Lawmakers have proposed legislation to counter China on human rights, technology and economic policy.

The Chinese government is also wary of Democratic values like free speech, civic participation and rule of law. China's authoritarian system prizes political stability and control above all else. Discussions with U.S. legislators, even if well-intentioned, could undermine the Communist Party's iron grip on power, Beijing fears.

While competition may define the U.S.-China relationship for decades to come, some level of cooperation is necessary on issues like climate change, global health and international security. But China's efforts to restrain talks before they even begin highlights how fundamental differences threaten even modest attempts at engagement between Washington and Beijing. Overall, the tone of the letter suggests China may not yet be ready for open exchange with critics of its policies and system.
