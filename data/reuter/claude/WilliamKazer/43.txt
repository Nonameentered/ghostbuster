Chinese Defence Official Steps Down in Reshuffle Linked to Satellite Failures 

General Jiang Xiaofei, the head of China's strategic missile forces, has resigned from his position, according to an announcement by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense yesterday. The move is part of a wider reshuffle of officials in the People's Liberation Army and is linked to recent failures of new satellites launched by China, according to sources familiar with the changes.

General Jiang has overseen the missile forces for the past four years but handed over leadership of the unit to General Hu Weiping in a ceremony last week. General Jiang will take early retirement, according to the ministry announcement. 

The missile forces are a crucial part of China's military establishment, in charge of launching and managing China's arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of delivering nuclear warheads. China sees these missiles as key to deterring potential adversaries like the United States from threatening its security interests.

The reshuffle comes just weeks after two separate satellite launches by China failed to place multiple satellites into the correct orbits. In one incident, a new type of rocket failed mid-flight after its first stage malfunctioned. In a separate mission days later, software issues prevented maneuvering thrusters on several satellites from activating, leaving the satellites stranded in incorrect orbits.

The failed satellite launches were a blow to China's prestige in a year when it is seeking to highlight major leaps forward in its space program, including its its first Mars rover mission and the completion of its Beidou global navigation system. The tight sequence of the reshuffle announcement and the failures point to displeasure at senior levels of the Chinese leadership with those overseeing the space and missile portfolios. 

"There is no doubt the General Jiang's resignation is linked to the failed satellite launches last month," said Jing Wang, an expert on the Chinese military at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. "The leadership expects results and high reliability, especially surrounding sensitive programs tied to national security and defense. Someone had to take the blame for these very public failures."

The shake-up is unlikely to significantly affect the capabilities or operations of China's missile forces, given their importance, but points to a leadership seeking to reassure citizens and allies about the competence and accountability of those responsible for strategic defense systems, experts said. The coming months may see additional personnel changes in the space and missile programs as new leaders look to make their mark and improve performance.
