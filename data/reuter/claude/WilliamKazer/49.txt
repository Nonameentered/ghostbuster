Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin's Television Tribute to Deng Xiaoping Aimed at Building His Own Legacy  

BEIJING - In an unusual primetime tribute, China's top leader Jiang Zemin paid homage to the economic reforms of the late Deng Xiaoping in an apparent effort to strengthen Jiang's own political standing.

Jiang, the general secretary of the Communist Party, appeared on state-run China Central Television on Wednesday night to praise Deng for launching China's transformation into a market economy. Jiang said Deng's policies had "unleashed the productive forces of society and enhanced the overall national strength."

The televised tribute was a rare move by Jiang to single out his predecessor, who died in 1997, and it highlighted Jiang's desire to associate himself with Deng's successful economic liberalization. Jiang is seeking to build his prestige and authority as he enters his second five-year term in office and after promoting allies to top positions in a Communist Party leadership reshuffle last month.

"Jiang wants to bask in the glow of Deng's achievements to validate his own standing," said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an investment banker and longtime adviser to the Chinese government. "By emphasizing continuity and stability, Jiang is strengthening his position."

Jiang's position as party chief has never been as strong as Deng's, and his political authority remains limited by rivals within the leadership. His praise of Deng appears aimed at overcoming those limits by linking himself to Deng's towering historical status. Deng is widely admired for launching China's shift from a closed, communist system to an emerging global economic power.

Chinese experts and scholars said Jiang's televised speech signaled his desire to cast himself as the protector and champion of Deng's pioneering policy of "reform and opening up." Jiang mentioned the phrase seven times in his 20-minute speech.

"Part of Jiang's political achievement has been to return to some degree of political moderation and stability after the turmoils of 1989 in Tiananmen," said Lucian W. Pye, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "This tribute to Deng helps to reinforce that image of Jiang as rejecting radicalism."

In praising Deng, Jiang was also reminding his potential political opponents that he controls the party apparatus, including its propaganda outlets. Jiang's speech was carried live across China, with commentary hailing it as a "major event" in the official media. Such prominent, mandatory coverage is rarely accorded an official speech.

The tenor and length of Jiang's homage to Deng surprised many Chinese observers. "Never before on television has Jiang Zemin spoken at such length or in such a focused way about Deng," said a political journalist in Beijing who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It shows that establishing his own authority remains an unfinished task."
