China and U.S. to Hold Talks on Textile Sanctions Dispute

Trade representatives from China and the United States will meet this week for talks aimed at resolving an ongoing dispute over U.S. sanctions on Chinese textile imports. The talks, to be held in Beijing on Thursday and Friday, will be the first high-level discussions on the issue since the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Chinese cotton shirts, trousers, and blouses in April.

The sanctions were imposed after the U.S. accused China of unfairly subsidizing its textile industry and flooding the U.S. market with cheap apparel. The Trump administration slapped tariffs of up to 1,300 percent on goods from some Chinese apparel manufacturers. China quickly retaliated with its own tariffs on American fruit, wine, steel pipes, and fiber.

Tensions between the world's two largest economies have escalated in recent months. In addition to the textile dispute, the countries are sparring over intellectual property protections, restrictions on foreign companies, and a widening U.S. trade deficit. The textile sanctions, however, have drawn a particularly strong reaction from China, which is pushing the U.S. to remove the penalties during this week's talks.

“These irrational tariffs severely disrupt free trade and multilateralism,” said Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng at a briefing this week. He urged the U.S. to “correct its wrong practices” so the two sides can come to an agreement. The Trump administration, however, has showed no signs of backing down, saying China must end unfair subsidies and theft of American textile designs before the tariffs can be lifted. 

Industry groups warn the dispute could seriously damage clothing retailers and consumers in both countries. "Billions of dollars of trade and millions of jobs are at stake," said Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, calling the tariffs "a tax on hardworking Americans." The U.S. Fashion Industry Association has projected up to $300 billion in annual China-U.S. textile trade could be disrupted if the issue is not resolved.

There are hopes this week's talks, led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, could yield a breakthrough. However, analysts remain skeptical, noting the two sides still seem far apart on major sticking points. “There are no easy solutions here,” said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. At best, most expect the meetings will lead to future formal negotiations on a comprehensive trade deal. The stakes are high, as the outcome could determine the future of a trading relationship worth over $700 billion annually.
