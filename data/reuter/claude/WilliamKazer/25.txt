US Secretary of State Warren Christopher Visits China Amidst Mixed Signals and Hope for Repair in Strained Sino-American Ties

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Beijing today for a three-day visit aimed at repairing strained relations between the world's sole superpower and its fastest rising competitor. The trip comes amidst mixed signals from both sides, with China recently detaining a prominent political dissident but also releasing an American academic from prison this week.  

Secretary Christopher was greeted upon arrival by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, a positive sign given China's anger over the US granting a visa to political activist Wei Jingsheng in December. China had issued a protest and cancelled planned talks in response. However, the US says China's recent release of academic Wu Jiang shows a willingness to reduce tensions.

"My visit here reflects the importance the US places on its relationship with China," Christopher said in remarks upon his arrival. "There are many issues on which we differ, but also many where our interests align. With openness and honesty, I believe we can make progress on managing our differences and expanding areas of cooperation."

The visit comes as the US is urging China to improve its human rights record and trade policies, while China wants the US to end arms sales to Taiwan and support China's territorial claims. Economic ties remain a bright spot, with China now America's fourth largest trading partner. But many in the US criticize the trade deficit and China's failure to open its markets. 

Secretary Christopher is expected to meet with senior government and Communist Party leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He will likely push for actions on human rights, arms proliferation, and market access. But with China preparing to hold a key Communist Party meeting next month, its leaders will want to avoid the appearance of buckling under US pressure. The visit is seen as a chance to escape a downward spiral in ties, but breakthroughs on key issues are unlikely.

The next few days will provide an opportunity for Secretary Christopher and his Chinese hosts to exchange perspectives and seek stability, but without a willingness to compromise on both sides, repaired relations between the world's superpower and rising powerhouse remain uncertain. By the end of this important initial visit, we will know whether the two sides are on a path towards greater understanding - or headed towards renewed tensions.
