South Africa to Switch Diplomatic Ties from Taiwan to China by End of 1997 

The South African government announced today that it will formally recognize the People's Republic of China before the end of 1997, severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan after 22 years. The move signals a shift in South Africa's foreign policy since the end of apartheid and a desire to build economic and political ties with China, one of the world's fastest-growing economies.

South Africa established ties with Taiwan in 1975 during the apartheid era but has moved to recognize Beijing over the past several years. China views Taiwan as a province and opposes diplomatic recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation. Most countries adhere to the "One China" policy and only maintain official relations with Beijing.

In December 1996, South African President Nelson Mandela visited China to strengthen bilateral cooperation. Mandela was warmly received by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and the two leaders discussed trade, investment, tourism, and cultural exchanges between the two nations. The announcement today reflects the progress made during that state visit.

Once South Africa shifts diplomatic recognition, Taiwan will lose one of its few remaining allies in Africa. However, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed "understanding and respect" for South Africa's decision, indicating Taiwan's desire to maintain amicable relations despite losing diplomatic ties. 

South Africa expects to benefit economically and politically from closer relations with China. China has become South Africa's largest trading partner, and bilateral trade has grown over 300% since 1992. There are also opportunities for Chinese investment in South Africa's infrastructure and mining sectors. Diplomatically, China wields considerable influence as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and South Africa sees China as a key strategic partner on issues like UN reform.

The change in diplomatic recognition is expected to take effect before year's end, though the exact date of implementation is still under discussion. When ties with Taiwan are officially severed, South Africa will recognize Beijing's "One China" policy, handing China another victory in its ongoing campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Meanwhile, South Africa will embed itself within China's growing sphere of political and economic influence on the global stage.
