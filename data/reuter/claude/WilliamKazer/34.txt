China urged to switch to long-term bond fundraising amid easing inflation  

China's slowing inflation rate is prompting calls for the government to switch to issuing longer-term bonds to take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs. Consumer inflation eased to 2.5% in June, down from 2.7% in May and below the government's 3% target for the year. The lower inflation gives the government more room to borrow money over longer time periods without worrying that the value will be eroded too quickly.

Issuing long-term bonds, such as 10-year and 30-year notes, would allow China to lock in lower interest rates for longer. This can help reduce borrowing costs for major infrastructure projects and other long-term government priorities. Several economists are urging the Chinese government to follow the lead of Western countries that regularly issue longer-dated bonds.  

"With inflation stable and growth slowing, now is an opportune time for China to diversify its bond issuance to longer maturities," said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura. He thinks the government should consider issuing bonds with maturities of 10 years or longer.

China's bond market is heavily skewed toward shorter-term notes, with the majority of government bonds maturing in 3 years or less. This requires the government to frequently roll over its debt, incurring new borrowing costs each time. In contrast, the U.S. and other major economies issue bonds across a range of maturities, from 1 month up to 30 years.

Some analysts argue that developing a long-term bond market would also provide Chinese investors with more investment options to match their liabilities. In particular, it would give insurance companies and pension funds assets they can hold for long periods to meet future payout needs. However, regulators will have to address risks such as interest rate volatility that could impact longer-term bonds.

While China's Ministry of Finance has not yet announced any plans to issue longer-dated bonds, it seems the consensus view is that now is the time to make the move to lock in cheap long-term financing and develop this key corner of China's capital markets. With interest rates expected to stay low, the government has a window of opportunity to establish China as a regular issuer of longer-term debt.
