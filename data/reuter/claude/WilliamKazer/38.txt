China's Unicom struggles to challenge MPT monopoly in telecommunications sector 

China Unicom, the country's second-largest telecommunications company, continues to lag far behind dominant player China Mobile in both revenue and subscribers. Despite government efforts to open up the telecom sector to more competition, China Mobile maintains a virtual monopoly with over 60% market share.

China Unicom reported revenue of $39 billion last year, less than half of China Mobile's $90 billion. China Unicom has 300 million mobile subscribers, compared to China Mobile's 950 million. The vast majority of China's 1.4 billion citizens choose China Mobile for its premium 4G network and subsidized smartphones. 

For years, the Chinese government has tried to level the playing field to give China Unicom and third-place China Telecom a fair chance to compete. In 2008, China Unicom was allowed to upgrade its CDMA network to 3G. But China Mobile had a multi-year head start in building out a 3G TD-SCDMA network, capturing millions of subscribers. 

Regulators hoped competition would intensify when 4G licenses were issued in 2013. However, China Mobile was again first to market with its 4G TD-LTE network. China Unicom and China Telecom use the FDD-LTE 4G standard, but their networks remain smaller and less reliable, especially in rural areas.

To boost competition, regulators gave China Unicom and China Telecom more 4G bandwidth and required China Mobile to lease some of its bandwidth. But the policy has not substantially narrowed the gap due to China Mobile's huge first-mover advantage. China Unicom's recent 4G subscriber growth has stalled at around 30% of China Mobile's 4G base.

Some analysts argue the only way for meaningful competition to emerge is if China Unicom and China Telecom are allowed to merge. A combined entity with over 500 million subscribers and $100 billion in revenue could put up a real fight. However, others believe any merger would face major regulatory hurdles and still struggle against China Mobile's dominant size and resources.
