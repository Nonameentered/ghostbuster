China Accuses U.S. of Trying to Contain Them and Calls for Policy Shift 

Beijing—China's top diplomat yesterday accused the U.S. of trying to contain China's rise through unfair trade practices and military moves, calling on Washington to change its adversarial stance if it wants to avoid a "new Cold War." 

Foreign Minister Wang Yi said some U.S. politicians were seeking to smear China's socialist system, curb its growth and contain its influence. He called for a rejection of the “zero-sum" mentality and urged cooperation on issues such as climate change and North Korea. However, he warned that China would not compromise on "core interests" such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea or its policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Wang's speech followed reports that the Pentagon is considering deploying intermediate-range missiles in Asia, a move that could hit China. Tensions have also been rising over Taiwan, which China claims as its own. The speech highlights China's concerns about U.S. intentions amid an escalating trade war and various points of geopolitical friction.  

The Trump administration has labeled China a "strategic competitor" and has taken action against what it says are unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. It has also boosted ties with Taiwan and sailed warships through waters Beijing claims in the South China Sea.

Wang urged the U.S. to "correct its wrongdoing" but said confrontation was not inevitable.  "Differences between our two countries are natural, but confrontation is not," he said. "Cooperation is the only right choice." He called for the U.S. to remove obstacles to educational and cultural exchanges, which have faced tighter restrictions under the Trump administration.

A peaceful and cooperative relationship between China and the U.S. is not only in the fundamental interests of both peoples but also what the international community expects, Wang said. Still, China would defend its sovereignty, security and development interests, he added.

"China's determination to safeguard sovereignty, security and development interests is unshakeable," Wang said.  "China urges the U.S. to meet it halfway, avoid excessive suspicion and do more to foster greater trust and cooperation."
