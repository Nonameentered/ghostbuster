Volkswagen-First Automotive Works Joint Venture Dismisses Reports of Possible Closure 

Shanghai, China - Executives at the Volkswagen-First Automotive Works joint venture in China today denied reports that the company is considering closing one of its manufacturing plants in Changchun in the northeastern part of the country. Rumors had been circulating that the plant was operating at overcapacity and losing money, prompting speculation that it may be shut down.

In a statement, CEO of the joint venture Jochem Heizmann said, “There are absolutely no plans to close our Changchun facility. The plant remains an important part of our manufacturing footprint in China to serve customers in the northern provinces. While the automotive market in China has slowed down recently, we are committed to all of our operations across the country, including Changchun.”

The Changchun plant opened in 2013 and has capacity to produce 300,000 vehicles per year, manufacturing models such as the Volkswagen Jetta, Bora, and Sagitar exclusively for the domestic Chinese market. Despite Heizmann’s assurances, unnamed sources within the company suggest the plant is only operating at around 50-60% of capacity due to decreasing customer demand in the region. The sources speculate that without a significant uptick in sales, the joint venture may still consider downsizing or reconfiguring the Changchun operations to improve profitability.

Volkswagen’s joint venture with FAW Group is its oldest and largest partnership in China. Formed in 1991, the joint venture accounts for the bulk of Volkswagen’s manufacturing in China with a total of six plants across the northeast and northern parts of the country. The possible closure of the Changchun plant concerns local government officials who estimate nearly 50,000 workers in the region support the joint venture’s operations in some form. Volkswagen declined to disclose employment figures for the specific Changchun facility.
