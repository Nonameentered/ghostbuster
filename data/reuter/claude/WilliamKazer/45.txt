China's Central Bank Chief Says Inflation to be a Modest Seven Percent, Criticizes Companies Taking Advantage of Tight Money Policies 

The governor of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, said today that he expects inflation in China to rise to about 7% this year, a modest increase that should not require further interest rate hikes to control. Speaking at a financial conference in Shanghai, Zhou said China's government has tools available beyond interest rates to contain inflation should it start to accelerate. He suggested inflation at around 7% would still be acceptable and manageable.

Zhou's comments appear aimed at reassuring investors worried that high inflation could force China's central bank to tighten credit conditions further, potentially slowing down China's rapid economic growth. China's central bank has raised interest rates three times this year and increased bank reserve requirements six times in an effort to control inflation, which rose to a 34-month high of 5.5% in September. Further tightening moves could slow lending to businesses and negatively impact economic expansion.

Although Zhou forecast only a moderate rise in inflation, he also had harsh words for companies that he said were taking advantage of tight monetary policies to increase their prices unduly. Zhou said the central bank would monitor price increases and take action against firms illegally boosting prices. He cited cement and fertilizer companies as two industries where some firms had moved prices up "irrationally." The central bank plans to strengthen price supervision of essential industries and goods, Zhou noted. 

Overall, Zhou struck an optimistic tone about China's economic outlook despite the headwinds of higher inflation and weaker export demand due to the global downturn. He expressed confidence in China's ability to maintain steady growth while containing inflation. The central banker projected a soft landing for the Chinese economy with full-year growth of 9-9.5% in 2011. If Zhou's predictions prove accurate, China would remain the engine of global economic expansion even as developed nations struggle with financial challenges and anemic growth.
