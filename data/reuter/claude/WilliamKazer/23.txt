European Commission Vice President Pushes for China to Join WTO, Beijing Remains Skeptical  

BRUSSELS - Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice President of the European Commission and the bloc's trade chief, urged China this week to accelerate its negotiations to join the World Trade Organization. In a speech on Wednesday, Dombrovskis said China's accession to the WTO would be a "game changer" that could significantly expand trade and cooperation between China and the West.

However, Chinese officials remain wary about compromising to meet the standards for WTO membership and concerned about opening their markets. "China supports multilateral trade systems and enhanced cooperation with the WTO, but we will not blindly follow rules that unfairly disadvantage our economy," said Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, at a news conference. 

China began negotiations to join the WTO in the mid-1990s but talks have stalled in recent years over issues like limiting government subsidies to Chinese companies, opening China's financial services sector to foreign competition, and reducing high tariffs on some goods. Dombrovskis argued that WTO membership would "lock in" market-oriented economic reforms in China and make it easier for European companies to invest and trade with China.

The European Union is China's largest trading partner, and trade volumes have soared over the past 20 years. However, the EU and China have also clashed over China's close regulation of its economy, government support for domestic companies like Huawei and TikTok's owner ByteDance, and what Europe views as unfair trading practices.

"The EU's Vice President is entitled to his personal opinion, but China will not bend to demands that do not respect our sovereignty or national interests," China's ambassador to the EU said in a statement. "China continues to support the WTO and global free trade, but membership in the WTO is a privilege, not an entitlement."  

Chinese officials argue their country, as a developing economy, deserves more flexibility to support strategic industries and protect vulnerable populations. China also wants guarantees that WTO rules would not unfairly target government support programs that differ from Western models. With China's WTO bid at an impasse, some analysts argue the WTO needs to adjust its rules to accommodate China, while others counter that China needs to make difficult but necessary reforms to join. The debate seems likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
