Hong Kong Leader-In-Waiting Tung Chee-Hwa Invites Chief Secretary Anson Chan for Meeting Amid Speculation Over Her Future Post-China Takeover  

HONG KONG—Tung Chee-hwa, the incoming Chief Executive of Hong Kong, has invited the city’s current second-in-command Anson Chan for a meeting next week, fueling speculation over Chan’s role after China regains sovereignty over the British colony on July 1. 

Tung, a Shanghai-born shipping tycoon, was selected earlier this month by a Beijing-backed committee to lead Hong Kong following its handover from Britain to China. He will succeed current governor Chris Patten. However, the future of Patten's deputy Chan remains unclear.

Chan has served for two decades in Hong Kong’s civil service, including the last five years as Chief Secretary, the most senior position after the Governor. Fluent in Cantonese, English and Mandarin, the British-educated Chan is seen as a vital bridge between the civil service and both Chinese and Western business communities.

Tung's invitation suggests he values Chan's experience and connections and may want her to stay on in some capacity after the handover. However, Chan’s close working relationship with Patten and her reputation as a pragmatist committed to Hong Kong’s autonomy has fueled speculation that Beijing may be keen to remove her.

"Anson Chan's role in the next administration depends on whether Tung feels confident enough to have her and whether Beijing will trust her," said political analyst Dixon Sing. "But her connections could be useful for Tung, at least for a transitional period."

Some analysts believe Chan may be given a face-saving ceremonial position with limited influence. But sidelining or removing her could be seen as a sign that Beijing wants to exert more control over the civil service and accelerate changes in Hong Kong.

In a statement, Tung's office said the meeting would cover arrangements for the handover ceremony and ensure a "smooth transition". But a source close to Tung said the scope of Chan's future job, if any, would likely be discussed. Chan's office declined to comment. 

The meeting is a sign Tung wants to reassure civil servants and signal continuity, at least for now. But Beijing's distrust of Chan and desire to put its stamp on Hong Kong may prevail, forcing her into an uncomfortable choice between taking a token role or retiring ahead of schedule. The meeting may provide the first clues as to which direction the political winds are blowing as the handover countdown continues.
