China Founds New Lawmaking Body to Take Over Hong Kong, Britain Challenges its Legality in World Court  

The Chinese government today announced the formation of a new lawmaking body that will have jurisdiction over national security in Hong Kong. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to exert more direct control over the semi-autonomous region after months of pro-democracy protests.

The new lawmaking body will draft legislation aimed at prohibiting treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese central government. The laws will apply directly to Hong Kong, bypassing Hong Kong’s own legislative process.

“We must take powerful measures to lawfully prevent, stop and punish those who split the country, as the chaos in Hong Kong has proven that there are obvious loopholes and deficiencies,” said Zhang Yesui, a spokesman for China's legislature.

The decision is the latest blow to Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” principle that was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong certain freedoms and rights after Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997. Critics argue China’s move violates the handover agreement and further erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy.

In response, Britain has announced it will file a complaint against China at the International Court of Justice, arguing that China’s new lawmaking body violates international law and several treaties between Britain and China regarding the 1997 handover.

"We have a legal and moral duty to the people of Hong Kong to honor our word and protect their rights and freedoms. While we respect China's authority over Hong Kong, we will challenge actions that threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and the city's unique system," a British Foreign Office spokesman said.

The International Court of Justice, based in The Hague, Netherlands, is the United Nations’ top court dealing with disputes between countries. While its rulings are not legally binding but can carry diplomatic weight. Britain hopes a ruling in its favor would put pressure on China to back off from imposing the new laws on Hong Kong.
