Pro-Beijing Publisher Nominates Controversial Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang in Hong Kong’s Race for Leader 

In a surprise move, one of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-Beijing politicians nominated the city's controversial Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang to run in next year's election for Chief Executive. Starry Lee, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-establishment party, said Sir Ti would be "a very capable candidate for this important office.”

The nomination of Sir Ti brings a jolt of drama to what was shaping up to be an orderly, prescripted leadership transition in Hong Kong. The city is a semiautonomous territory of China that is supposed to enjoy civil liberties unseen in mainland China. Sir Ti has often ruled in favor of Beijing in high-profile cases and has been criticized as willing to curb civil liberties. The judiciary under his leadership has also issued harsh sentences against some pro-democracy activists during ongoing antigovernment protests.

If selected, Sir Ti would replace Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who has become deeply unpopular and announced last year she wouldn't seek re-election. Hong Kong's leader is chosen by a committee of about 1,200 people, mainly comprised of pro-establishment politicians and tycoons. Sir Ti does not need to campaign or go through any public election, but obtaining the votes of a majority on the committee is never assured.

China's leaders prize stability and are unlikely to want someone in the job with as controversial a background as Sir Ti's. But they also value loyalty, and Sir Ti has shown steadfast support for Beijing. Whether he would prove polarizing or stabilizing for Hong Kong would depend on still-unseen factors, including how much public opposition he faces and how stringent the policies he pursues turn out to be.

Ms. Lee praised Sir Ti as a principled judge who "has proven capability in upholding justice and the rule of law in Hong Kong." The Chief Executive holds significant governing power but is ultimately subordinate to Beijing. The position requires balancing Hong Kong's civil liberties with China's authoritarian inclinations—a tension that exploded into mass antigovernment protests in 2019 and 2020.

Some pro-democracy activists worry Sir Ti would take an even harder line against civil liberties, though others argue a more authoritarian leader might quell unrest by avoiding further erosion of freedoms and not stoking public anger. The city's large and vocal pro-democracy opposition is unlikely to support any candidate seen as excessively close to Beijing.

The nomination marks an audacious political maneuver by Ms. Lee, a lifetime appointee to China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress. By going against the safe choice of an establishment-friendly Chief Executive favored to win Beijing's backing, she is taking a risk that could elevate her influence but also backfire. Beijing has at times rebuked Hong Kong establishment figures for independently staking out positions it doesn't fully support.
