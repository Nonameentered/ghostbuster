Pro-democracy group leader calls Hong Kong sovereignty change preparations a "disaster" as pro-China candidate set to become post-colonial leader  

HONG KONG - The leader of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy organization called the territory's preparations for transitioning sovereignty from Britain to China a "total disaster" on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference, Wu Chi-wai, chair of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said "there were no real plans in place to protect citizens' rights and freedoms" as China takes control of the city from the United Kingdom on July 1.  

Wu's comments come as career civil servant Tung Chee-hwa, Beijing's preferred candidate, looks set to become Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader. Tung ran unopposed to become the chief executive and will be appointed by a Beijing-backed election committee. Wu and other pro-democracy advocates have long argued that China would roll back civil liberties in Hong Kong and that citizens were not properly consulted on the handover process.

Under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China, Hong Kong is guaranteed a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years after the handover. But Wu said there were "no mechanisms in place to hold Beijing accountable to that agreement" and that in the rush to complete the handover, "most of the planning came from Beijing with little local input."

Wu warned that in the coming weeks and months, Hong Kongers would see their rights and freedoms slowly eroded. "We will see crackdowns on free speech and political dissent, booksellers will disappear, and democratic reform will be stifled," he said. "By the time Hong Kong people realize what is happening, it will be too late." Wu called on Britain to push China for concrete safeguards to protect Hong Kong's democratic institutions and way of life.

Pro-establishment lawmakers dismissed Wu's comments as "fearmongering." Maria Tam, a member of China's National People's Congress, said: "The joint declaration was carefully drafted and China will honor its word. There is no evidence any rights or freedoms are under threat." She said that "Wu does not speak for most Hong Kong people, who are optimistic and excited about reunification with China."

Tung, the chief executive-in-waiting, said he would "fully defend the autonomy, rights and freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong." In an op-ed, Tung wrote, "Hong Kong's capitalist way of life will remain unchanged, and I will protect our vibrant society where the rule of law, freedom of speech, and an independent judiciary continue to thrive."

However, a recent poll showed public confidence in Tung and goodwill toward Beijing has declined in the past year. Wu and other activists have vowed to hold protests around the handover to demand democratic reforms and push back against potential overreach by Beijing. The battle for Hong Kong's future governance looks set to continue as the city enters its first day under Chinese rule in 24 years.
