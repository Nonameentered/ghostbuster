Canadian Envoys Dismiss Reports of Mass Return for Hong Kong People Ahead of Handover  

Ottawa, Canada - Senior Canadian diplomats today rejected media reports suggesting that Canada is preparing for an influx of Hong Kong residents returning from the former British colony ahead of its handover to China on July 1.  

Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, the Canadian ambassador to China and consul general in Hong Kong said there is no evidence to suggest a mass exodus of Hong Kong people to Canada is imminent. Ambassador John McCallum said "routine immigration processes are in place and we have not seen any spike in applications or inquiries."

Consul General Jeff Nankivell said his office has not seen indications of a surge in emigration from Hong Kong to Canada. "Day-to-day life continues as normal in Hong Kong. People are going to work and school, businesses remain open, and there are no signs of panic." He noted Hong Kong has a highly educated and mobile population, so movement of people in and out of the territory is common.

The envoys' comments follow media speculation that many Hong Kong residents would flock to countries like Canada ahead of the handover to Chinese rule. Some analysts predicted wealthy businesspeople and professionals would leave over concerns about possible erosion of political and economic freedoms. However, others argue most Hong Kong people will adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude about life under Chinese administration.   

Canada has close ties to Hong Kong and a large population of Canadians of Hong Kong descent. But Canadian officials said there are no special programs or fast-track arrangements in place for Hong Kong people beyond normal immigration procedures. Both envoys said Canada continues to monitor the situation in Hong Kong closely but foresees a smooth transition under the "one country, two systems" principle agreed between Britain and China.

The reassurances from the Canadian diplomats are aimed at dispelling speculation about an emigration crisis while also expressing Canada's continued support for Hong Kong during this period of transition. With only 10 days left until the handover, all eyes are on how life in Hong Kong may or may not change under Chinese sovereignty after 156 years of British rule.
