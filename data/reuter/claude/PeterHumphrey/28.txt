Britain unable to protect Hong Kong holders of British passports after Chinese takeover 

The British government has acknowledged it will be unable to protect Hong Kong residents who hold British National (Overseas) passports after China implements its new national security law on July 1. The admission is a blow to hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers who thought their connection to Britain might shield them from Beijing's tightening grip over the territory.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that while Britain would stand by its "enduring commitment" to Hong Kong, there were limits to what it could do against another sovereign state. "The UK will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and we will not duck our historic responsibility to its people," Raab said. However, he added: "Let me be clear that we will not sacrifice the prosperity and security of the British people for the sake of UK passport holders in Hong Kong."

The British government estimates there are roughly 350,000 British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong. These passports were issued to Hong Kong residents when Britain handed over the territory to China in 1997. They allow holders to visit the UK for up to six months but do not provide the right to work, study or vote there. 

Many of these passport holders had hoped the UK might provide them a safe haven if China's crackdown intensified and compromised their freedoms under the "one country, two systems" principle that has governed Hong Kong since the handover. However, Britain appears unwilling to open its doors in a way that might provoke China's anger or lead to a mass exodus from Hong Kong. Critics argue Britain has a moral responsibility to do more after handing so many Hong Kongers a British travel document and then failing to defend the rights and freedoms it was meant to represent.

China's national security law aims to prohibit sedition, secession, and subversion against the central government. However, opponents say its deliberately vague wording could be used to crack down on political dissent and opposition. The law will allow mainland China's security apparatus to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time.

The UK has criticized the law and says it constitutes a breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover. However, Britain's options are limited given its need to negotiate trade deals with China after Brexit. "The tragedy of this is that the UK gave so many Hong Kongers hope for the future by giving them this special status, but now itâ€™s proven empty," said Benedict Rogers, co-founder of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission. "The sacrifice of human rights for trade deals is immoral."
