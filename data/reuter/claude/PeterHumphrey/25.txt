Britain and China in deadlock over Hong Kong handover details

Negotiations between Britain and China over the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 have stalled, according to sources close to the talks. Major differences remain over the legal system and the degree of autonomy to be granted to Hong Kong after the handover. 

Britain has controlled Hong Kong for over 150 years, but will hand over sovereignty of the territory to China in July 1997 in accordance with a 1984 agreement. The two sides have been meeting regularly for the past decade to finalize the handover arrangement, but progress has slowed in recent months amid disputes over key issues.

A key sticking point is the legal system. Britain wants to ensure that Hong Kong retains an independent judiciary and common law legal system for at least 50 years after the handover. But China has rejected proposals to enshrine such guarantees in Hong Kongâ€™s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. China insists that Hong Kong's legal system must conform to Chinese law after the handover.

There are also disagreements over the system of government and citizenship. Britain is pushing for an autonomous government with freely elected legislators, as well as a separate Hong Kong citizenship. But China wants the territory to have a system of government more closely tied to the Chinese model, with any democratic reforms subject to tight Chinese oversight. China also rejects the notion of a separate Hong Kong citizenship and passport.

With only 18 months left until the handover, Britain faces the prospect of handing over Hong Kong without concrete guarantees over its political and economic freedoms in place. Some politicians and activists worry this will put Hong Kong's future prosperity and way of life at risk. The business community is also increasingly concerned over the uncertainty, and whether Hong Kong will continue to function as a global financial hub under Chinese rule.

Negotiators are set to meet again next month for another round of talks. Unless compromise solutions can be found, however, Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule and beyond may be under threat. For now, the outlook is uncertain in the territory that has long been a stellar outpost of British influence in Asia. The world is watching closely to see if Britain and China can resolve their differences before time runs out.
