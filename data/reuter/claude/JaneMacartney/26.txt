Quad to Discuss China's WTO Application at World Trade Organisation Conference

The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad countries - India, US, Japan and Australia - are set to discuss China's application to join the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organisation at the WTO's Ministerial Conference starting today in Geneva. 

The Quad partners are concerned about allowing China into the WTO's GPA which opens up government contracts to foreign bidders. They feel China does not meet the transparency and fair business standards to join the GPA. China's subsidies to state-owned enterprises and restrictive policies around data localisation, intellectual property and technology transfer are major worries for the Quad.

India and the US, in particular, have had trade disputes with China at the WTO regarding these unfair trading practices. Allowing China into the GPA could negatively impact their domestic companies in procurement deals. The Quad members are expected to oppose China's application at the WTO meet unless it addresses their concerns around discriminatory industrial policies and restricted market access. 

China, for its part, says it is keen to join the GPA to "strengthen international cooperation on government procurement." It claims the GPA will improve efficiency and benefit Chinese companies. However, its dubious record on upholding fair trade rules has left many countries unconvinced about its intentions. The European Union also shares some of the concerns raised by the Quad but may be open to negotiating with China on a limited accession to the GPA.

The stand-off threatens to divide the WTO members during the Geneva meet. The WTO operates on the basis of consensus, so any single country can veto China's application. While some members argue that admitting China into the GPA may encourage further economic reforms, the majority view is that China must first demonstrate its willingness to eliminate trade-distorting policies before any benefits from the GPA membership can accrue. The next few days of negotiations will be crucial to determining whether China is able to join the GPA or its application remains stalled. Overall, the Quad meeting on the sidelines may play an important role in building a consensus on China's WTO role.
