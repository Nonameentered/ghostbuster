China Remains Firm on Developing Country Status for WTO 

China is sticking to its position that it should be treated as a developing country in the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite pressure from the United States and other Western nations. China formally joined the WTO in 2001, and at the time was classified as a developing country, which afforded it certain benefits like longer timelines for implementing trade agreements. 

Nearly 20 years later, China is now the world's second-largest economy and a major global trade power. However, China still claims "developing country" status, which irks the U.S. and others who say China should no longer qualify for preferential treatment. At a WTO meeting this week in Geneva, China refused to budge on its position. 

"China is the world's largest developing country, a fact that will not change for a long time to come," said China's WTO ambassador Zhang Xiangchen. "China's developing country status in the WTO is a factual and objective description of China's place in the world."

The U.S. disagrees and has argued China should no longer be afforded extra time to implement WTO agreements or exemptions from certain rules that other members must follow. "China is an economic superpower and benefits greatly from the international trading system," said U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer in a statement. "It's only reasonable that they adhere to the same standards as other major economies."

The issue is coming to a head now as the U.S. and China negotiate a new trade deal to end their long-running trade war. The Trump administration wants China to commit to speeding up various economic and trade reforms as part of any deal. China's special treatment in the WTO has been a source of frustration, and getting China to give up its developing country status has become a priority. 

However, China shows no signs of backing down. Its leaders argue that while China has enjoyed economic success, it still faces serious challenges in raising living standards for its 1.4 billion citizens. On a per capita basis, China's economy ranks behind more than 100 other nations. China also wants the flexibility to support strategic domestic industries without facing challenges over subsidies and market accessâ€”benefits traditionally afforded to developing countries under WTO rules.
