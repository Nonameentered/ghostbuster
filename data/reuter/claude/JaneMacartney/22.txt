China's Economy Set to Accelerate in 1997, but Joblessness and Inflation a Concern, says State Media  

BEIJING - China's economy is poised to accelerate in 1997, driven by export growth and robust investment in infrastructure and real estate, according to an analysis by Chinese state media agency Xinhua. However, concerns remain about job losses from state-owned enterprise reforms and the risk of higher inflation.

The Chinese economy grew at an annual rate of 9.7% in 1996 and is projected to expand by 10% in 1997, according to government economic officials cited by Xinhua. Much of the growth will come from foreign trade, with exports expected to rise by 20-25% as China benefits from expanded trade ties and lower tariffs due to its entry into the World Trade Organization. Domestic demand is also strengthening as consumer spending power increases and the government boosts spending on roads, railways and other public works.  

While the economic outlook is upbeat, the rapid pace of growth raises concerns about job losses and inflation, Xinhua reported. As China overhauls inefficient state-owned enterprises, millions of workers are at risk of losing their jobs. Although the private sector is creating new jobs, state media warned that the government must do more to retrain workers and support laid-off employees during the transition. There are also concerns that consumer price inflation, which was just 6.1% in 1996, could accelerate if the economy overheats. The government is aiming for GDP growth of 9% while keeping CPI below 8% in 1997.

The brightening economic picture comes as China's Communist Party leadership begins a major political transition, culminating in the selection of a successor to President Jiang Zemin in 2002. Jiang and other top officials can point to the robust economy as a major success, though they continue to grapple with deeper structural reforms needed to put China on a sustainable development path.

Xinhua concluded by saying that China must continue opening its economy to global competition, restructuring state firms, developing private enterprises, and building stronger institutions and social safety nets. If policymakers are able to manage these transitions, China is poised to achieve lasting prosperity and greater engagement with the world in the 21st century. But potential instability looms if reforms and economic growth are mismanaged. Overall, China's economy appears in good shape as 2020 approaches, even as party leaders face hard choices ahead.
