Power struggle erupts in China as Deng Xiaoping’s legacy is exploited by would-be heirs 

A power struggle is intensifying at the highest levels of China's Communist leadership as key factions jockey for influence ahead of a crucial party congress next year. At the center of the contest is the legacy of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who guided China's opening to the world in the 1980s.

Deng's mixed legacy as a reformer and hardliner is being selectively exploited by rival groups seeking to shape President Xi Jinping's agenda and succession plans. Xi faces growing pressure to anoint a potential successor at the 19th National Party Congress, while also enhancing his own power.

The main divide is between reformers who want further market-based reforms to liberalize China's economy, and conservative forces that believe Deng's reforms have already gone too far. Both sides are invoking Deng's words and policies to argue their case.

Reformers point to Deng's famous 1992 "southern tour," during which he reinvigorated economic reforms after a period of retrenchment. They argue China must further open its economy and accelerate "reform and opening up" to spur growth. Conservatives counter that Deng also stressed stability and party control. They want to curb debt, restrain private companies, and restrict Western influence.

Xi has so far pursued a balance, with limited economic reforms but also tighter party control of businesses and society. But the pendulum could swing if Xi's position is weakened going into next year's congress. There are signs reformers have gained ground recently, with China announcing new free-trade zones and easing restrictions on foreign investment in finance and new energy vehicles.

However, party elders allied with conservatives have also become more vocal. They argue recent reforms have led to "chaos" in the economy, society and even the party itself. In an unusual move, they have openly criticized policies associated with Xi's reformist allies.   

The jockeying intensified last month with the 120th birthday of Deng Xiaoping. Xi delivered a major speech in Beijing invoking "Deng Xiaoping Theory" and calling Deng a "great Marxist and revolutionary leader." State media have highlighted Deng's role as the architect of reform and opening up.

Reformers lauded the celebrations, seeing them as endorsing their agenda. But party elders were angered by the "over the top" praise for Deng's reformist side, arguing his role in initiating market reforms after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution had been overstated. They wrote a letter to party authorities lambasting "misinterpretations" of Deng's legacy.   

Such open clashes between senior factions are rare in China and reflect the high stakes in the lead up to next year's congress. Both sides are competing to frame the Congress agenda and capture key positions in the party leadership. Xi needs to forge consensus if he is to emerge from the Congress with his authority enhanced as a paramount leader in the mold of Deng. The alternative is a weaker Xi and a party riven by factional divides – a situation ripe for further turbulence and uncertainty in China.
