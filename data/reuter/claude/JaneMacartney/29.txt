Intense Talks on Global Trade Reach Brink of Agreement, but Labour Rights Issue Casts Shadow

Delegates from 164 countries reached a tentative agreement this weekend on new global trade rules after marathon negotiations in Geneva. The draft deal aims to update international trading practices and bring them into the 21st century. 

After two weeks of intense haggling, negotiations closed on Saturday with agreement on standardized rules for e-commerce, intellectual property, and regulation of goods and services. The deal is a significant step toward streamlining global trade and facilitating cross-border business.

However, a last-minute dispute over workers’ rights and labor regulations cast a shadow over the talks and nearly derailed a final agreement. A coalition of developing countries and workers’ representatives pushed for stronger rules enforcing basic labor standards and protections. They argued that weaker regulations in some parts of the world were enabling exploitative labor practices and a "race to the bottom."

Several Western countries joined the push for more robust workers’ rights provisions. But a handful of countries with large low-cost manufacturing bases, including China and India, resisted mandatory enforcement measures. As tensions rose, there were fears that the entire deal might collapse in the final hours.

A compromise was reached late Friday that calls on countries to uphold basic International Labour Organization standards on work conditions, pay, and worker safety. But enforcement will remain voluntary. The deal also creates a working group to consider additional protections and report back within two years.

Supporters of the compromise say it recognizes the importance of fair labor standards in trade agreements for the first time. Critics argue it lacks teeth without mandatory oversight and penalties for violations. Human rights groups have characterized it as a "missed opportunity."

The broadest overhaul of international trading rules since the Uruguay Round agreements of 1995, the deal reached this weekend aims to reflect the far-reaching changes in global commerce that have accompanied the digital age. It includes provisions governing the use of blockchain, AI, and e-commerce that did not even exist when the last round of talks took place. 

Tariffs and subsidies also received significant attention, especially those deemed "harmful" or distorting to trade. The deal tightens rules around agricultural subsidies and ends some fossil fuel subsidies that have negatively impacted the environment. Most tariffs were left in place, however, protecting agricultural and other sensitive sectors.
