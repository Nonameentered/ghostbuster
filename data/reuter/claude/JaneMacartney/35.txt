China Abolishes "Counter-Revolution" Crime and Replaces it with "Jeopardising State Security" 

China's top legislative body has removed the crime of "counter-revolution" from the country's criminal law and replaced it with the broader offense of "jeopardizing state security." The change was approved Saturday at the end of a weeklong meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The crime of counter-revolution had been part of China's criminal law since 1979. Chinese authorities had used the charge to jail and silence political dissidents and human rights activists. Rights groups estimate thousands of Chinese were imprisoned over decades under the vague counter-revolution crime.

The new jeopardizing state security charge appears to be even more opaque and open-ended. According to the revised criminal law, it covers acts that "seriously jeopardize national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and state security." These include "inciting secession of state territories, undermining national unity, sedition, separatism, terrorism, espionage, and illegally acquiring state secrets."

The vague definition gives Chinese authorities broad leeway to crack down on dissent and political opposition. Critics argue the new security laws essentially legalize many of the repressive tactics the government already employs, such as heavy censorship, mass surveillance, and arbitrary detention of critics. The jeopardizing state security offense allows the government to portray dissent as a threat to China's national interests rather than legitimate free expression.

Rights groups condemned the new security laws, saying they further erode basic civil liberties and give authorities nearly unchecked power to investigate, prosecute and detain those critical of the one-party state.

"The Chinese government should not have the power to detain people for years at a time just because it doesn't like their opinions," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. " But that's exactly what the new 'state security' provision means."

The revised criminal laws also included other political security offenses such as illegally obtaining state security and leakage of state secrets. The latter charge is often used to prosecute Chinese journalists and bloggers who publish news considered too politically sensitive.

Some supporters argue the new security laws aim to bring China in line with other countries' anti-terrorism and national security legislation. But other countries do not have China's track record of using vague security laws to crush political dissent and activism, critics point out. 

The amendment to the criminal law is the latest move by President Xi Jinping to strengthen ideological control and tighten security. Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has overseen a widespread crackdown on civil society, media and the internet. He has warned repeatedly about threats to the Communist Party's control and directed creation of new security laws to defend China's national interests as defined by the party.

Saturday's revision of the criminal law accentuates that trend. With the removal of counter-revolution, China took another step away from the ideological struggles of the Mao era. But with the addition of the new state security crimes, Xi and the party maintained their tight grip on power, determined to crush political dissent that could challenge their authority. For Xi, state security starts and ends with the security of Communist Party rule.
