China Approves Three Foreign Banks for Local Currency Business, But Tax Issue Remains Unsolved

The Chinese government announced today that it has approved three foreign banks—HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Citigroup—to conduct yuan-denominated business in China. The approval marks a milestone in China's efforts to open up its banking system and make its currency, the yuan or renminbi (RMB), more freely traded on global markets.

The approvals mean the three banks will now be allowed to offer a full range of commercial banking services in China using the local currency, including taking customer deposits, lending money, issuing bank cards, and conducting currency exchange services. Previously, foreign banks were only permitted to offer limited services in China and were barred from most retail banking with individuals and small businesses. The expanded permissions will enable the banks to compete for local customers on an equal footing with Chinese banks. 

While the approvals were widely anticipated and are seen as an important step, concerns remain over ongoing issues with China's tax policy for foreign banks. China currently has no individual income tax treaty with the U.S. and several European countries, meaning that foreign banks and their employees in China are subject to high tax rates. The banks have warned that the tax rates make it difficult to attract and retain top talent to support their Chinese operations. There are also uncertainties around China's value-added tax policy, which foreign bankers argue puts them at a disadvantage relative to domestic banks.

Responding to the approvals, executives from the three banks expressed both optimism and caution. "This is an important milestone that will allow us to further strengthen our leading position in, and commitment to, the China market," said Richard Yorke, CEO of HSBC China. However, he cautioned that "some tax considerations remain unsolved to enable a truly level playing field." Standard Chartered and Citi echoed similar sentiments, with the latter urging China to conclude tax treaties and clarify tax rules "to provide greater certainty and support growth of financial services in China.

Regulators promised the new approvals were part of broader opening measures yet to come. Analysts say China still has more steps to take to fully open its financial system, including easing restrictions on the yuan's movements across borders and reducing limits on foreign ownership stakes in Chinese banks and other financial firms. But today's announcement suggests China's leaders remain committed to the long path of financial reform, even amid economic uncertainty and trade tensions with countries like the U.S.
