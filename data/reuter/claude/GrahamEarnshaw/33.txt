Analysts Predict Further Decline for Shanghai Copper Futures in Early 1997 Due to Poor Fundamentals and Stable Demand   

Shanghai copper futures are expected to decline further in early 1997 according to multiple analysts who cite poor fundamentals and stable demand as the main drivers for the bearish outlook. Copper prices have already fallen nearly 15% in 1996 amid concerns over excess supply and lackluster demand in key markets.  

The Shanghai Futures Exchange copper contract hit a high of CNY 30,470 per tonne in February 1996 but has since declined to around CNY 25,980 per tonne, weighed down by excess supply from major producers including Freeport-McMoRan and Codelco. Analysts predict prices could fall another 10% to CNY 23,000 per tonne in the first quarter of 1997.  

On the demand side, growth in China—the world's largest copper consumer—is expected to remain stable but slow. China accounted for nearly 25% of global copper demand in 1996 but its economy is growing at a slower pace, dampening demand for the industrial metal. The construction and appliance sectors, which use a significant portion of China's copper, are expanding at a modest rate of 6-8% annually.  

Elsewhere, copper demand in Europe, North America and Japan—which together make up 50% of the world's consumption—is expected to remain flat in early 1997. New housing starts and consumer spending on appliances in the developed world are steady but not enough to boost demand and prices, according to analysts. 

At the same time, copper inventories remain at multi-year highs. LME warehouse copper stocks are over 500,000 tonnes, more than double the levels seen in early 1996. Analysts say further draws on these high stock levels are needed to provide price support.

Production cuts by some mines could help rein in the oversupplied market but may take several quarters to significantly cut into the glut of copper and impact futures prices. “We may see modest production cuts in early 1997 but not enough to dramatically alter the fundamentals,” said Chen Xiao, an analyst with Shanghai Shenwu Investment Group.

Barring any unforeseen events, analysts maintain their view that copper prices will remain under pressure in the first half of 1997 before balancing out in the latter part of the year. A weaker U.S. dollar could also help boost dollar-denominated copper on the LME, which could lend some support to Shanghai futures.
