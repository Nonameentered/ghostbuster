China B Shares Plummet as Securities Authorities Plan Restrictions on Domestic Trading  

The Shanghai Stock Exchange’s B-share index plunged over 7% today amid reports that Chinese securities regulators are planning new restrictions on domestic investors trading in foreign-listed B shares. The sharp drop reflects concerns that tighter controls will significantly reduce the pool of funds flowing into B shares, depressing prices.

B shares are shares of Chinese companies traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges but priced in foreign currencies—US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen. They were originally created to attract foreign investment into China’s stock markets. However, in recent years, Chinese authorities have loosened restrictions to also allow qualified domestic investors to trade B shares. These domestic funds now make up over 60% of total trading volume of B shares.  

According to sources familiar with the matter, the China Securities Regulatory Commission is crafting new rules that will prohibit domestic Chinese investors from using borrowed funds to buy B shares. The rules are also expected to place limits on the amount of leveraged funds—those obtained through margin trading—that can be invested in B shares. The move aims to reduce speculative trading and reinforce the focus of B shares on attracting long-term foreign investment.   

Analysts say that curbing domestic leveraged investors will significantly cut into the liquidity that has driven up B share prices over the past two years. “Domestic investors, especially those using margin trading, have been the primary force propelling B share indices higher,” said Michelle Yu, China market analyst at Barclays Research. “Removing them from the equation leaves a large gap that foreign funds are unlikely to fill, putting downside pressure on the prices of B share stocks.”

The surge of domestic funds into B shares has pushed Shanghai’s B share index up over 150% from 2016 to early 2020. But in a sign of weakening momentum even before news of the proposed restrictions emerged, the index is down nearly 30% from its January peak. The additional constraints now threaten to accelerate the sell-off in B shares, analysts warn. 

While foreign investors may welcome measures to curb speculative domestic trading in B shares, the episode highlights the volatile nature of China’s capital markets. Regulators have struggled to balance often contradictory goals like attracting foreign capital, containing financial risks, and maximizing returns for domestic investors. Crafting policy in this complex environment has proven challenging, at times yielding unintended consequences. The B share saga is the latest example of the bumpy road ahead as China continues opening its markets to the outside world.
