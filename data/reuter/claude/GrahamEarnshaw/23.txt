China's B Shares Surge as Investors Pour Money into Markets 

China's B-share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen surged today as investors poured money into stocks amid growing optimism about the economic recovery in the world's second-largest economy. 

The Shanghai B-share index jumped more than 6% to its highest level in over a year. The Shenzhen B-share index rose 3.8%, also reaching a new 52-week high. B-shares, which are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen but traded in foreign currencies, have now gained over 20% so far this year as China's economy has rebounded from the pandemic.

The rally in Chinese B-shares came as investors bet on further acceleration in China's economic revival. China's manufacturing activity expanded in March at the fastest pace in three months, according to data released today. Industrial production and retail sales also beat economists' forecasts, pointing to strengthening domestic demand. China's quick containment of the coronavirus and policy support have fueled hopes of a sustainable economic upturn.

Some analysts said the surge in China's B-share markets may also reflect optimism that a Biden administration in the U.S. could bring more stability to the relationship between the world's two largest economies. Tensions over trade and technology have escalated in recent years under the Trump administration, rattling global markets.

"Investors are encouraged by signs of economic recovery in China and expectations of improved China-U.S. relations," said Oliver Qiu, a Shanghai-based fund manager. "We may see more capital inflows into China's stock markets, especially B-shares, if the Biden administration adopts a more constructive approach to China."

Still, some analysts urge caution as China's economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels. Policy support from Beijing is set to be gradually withdrawn, which could slow the pace of recovery.  

With the rally in B-shares outpacing the gains in China's wider stock markets, some observers say the shares may be overheating. The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai B-share index has surpassed 30, well above its historical average. 

"The valuations of B-shares are stretched," said Jenny Yue, an economist at UBS. "We could see corrections in the short term. But in the long run, B-shares still have upside potential if China's capital market further opens up to foreign investors."
