Ownership Concerns over Copper Stored in Shanghai Warehouses as Traders Offer Small Lots to European Trading Houses

Concerns are rising over the ownership and availability of copper supplies stored in warehouses in Shanghai as some traders are offering small lots of the industrial metal to European trading houses. According to industry sources, some copper owners in China have been unable to retrieve their supplies from Shanghai warehouses for weeks due to strict lockdown measures imposed by authorities to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the city.

With warehouses either closed or operating at reduced capacity, some traders have turned to offering small parcels of copper supplies to European traders in need of the metal. However, questions are being raised over whether these traders actually have access to the copper they are offering to sell. “There is a lot of uncertainty over who owns what in Shanghai warehouses right now,” said a source at a European trading house. “We have to be very careful buying copper from traders who may not have the supplies they claim to be selling.”

Shanghai went into a strict lockdown in late March that halted most business and port operations in the city. The lockdown has disrupted logistics and warehousing of copper and other commodities. Shanghai accounts for about 10% of global copper warehouse stocks, so any disruption has an outsized effect on global copper supplies and pricing. Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have risen nearly 15% since late March due in part to concerns over supplies trapped in Shanghai.  

Some copper owners and traders in Shanghai have been unable to either deliver or retrieve copper from warehouses for over a month now due to restrictions on business and port activity. Sources claim some traders are now offering small lots, from 50 to 500 tonnes of copper, to European traders to generate cash flow since they are unable to access their supplies in Shanghai. However, other traders warn that some of these offers may not represent copper that the sellers actually own or have access too. 

“The situation in Shanghai has created opportunities for some sharp practices,” said an executive at a metals trading firm. “There is copper trapped in Shanghai that owners can’t get to, and other copper that was never there in the first place. Buyers have to verify the copper exists before sending any money.” There are additional concerns that even once lockdown measures start easing, it could take many weeks to resolve ownership issues, access copper in Shanghai warehouses, and resume normal trade flows. For now, the market appears braced for ongoing disruption and the possibility of uncovered ownership concerns in the months ahead.
