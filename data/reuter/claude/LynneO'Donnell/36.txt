China Stockpiling Hundreds of Thousands of Tonnes of Copper Despite High Prices 

China, the world's largest consumer of copper, is rapidly building up significant stockpiles of the metal despite near record prices, according to traders and analysts. The buying spree comes as copper prices have surged over 30 percent this year to $10,000 a tonne due to supply constraints and strong demand globally as economies recover from the pandemic.

Traders estimate that China has imported and stockpiled around 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of copper so far this year. Some of this is going into the country's strategic reserves but commercial stockpiling by traders and fabricators is also contributing. Analysts say the scale of China's buying is helping prop up global copper prices and reduce spot availability of the metal.

"There is strong underlying demand for copper in China but at these prices, end users would typically destock copper, not accelerate purchases," said Jianyu He, commodities analyst at Citigroup in Hong Kong. "A large part of the imports are going into reserves and commercial stocks - it's a strategic move to build buffers for the future."

The stockpiling comes as manufacturing activity in China has slowed in recent months due to supply chain issues, energy constraints and Beijing's efforts to reduce emissions and decarbonize industries like steel. Copper is used in everything from consumer electronics to the power industry, construction, and transportation. Despite some economic headwinds in China, demand for copper in electric vehicles, renewable energy and grid upgrades is expected to drive global growth for years to come.
