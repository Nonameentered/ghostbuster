China Unlikely to Purchase Rice on International Market Despite Flood Damage to Domestic Crops 

China is unlikely to turn to the international rice market to supplement domestic supplies despite widespread flood damage to rice crops this summer, according to industry analysts. China produces and consumes more rice than any other country, growing about 210 million tonnes of rice annually and consuming most of its domestic production.

Weeks of heavy rains and flooding in central and southern China have damaged about 3 million hectares of rice paddies so far this summer, according to estimates from China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The most severe damage is in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, which normally account for about 30% of China's rice production. Estimates indicate the floods and rain may reduce China's rice harvest by between 5 to 10 million tonnes this year.

Despite the damage, China's rice reserves and stocks remain high. The government strategic rice reserve alone holds between 60 to 70 million tonnes. High government support prices for rice farmers in recent years have also incentivized higher production, leading to a buildup in government reserves. Market analysts estimate China's total rice stocks this year could reach 140 to 150 million tonnes, even with a reduced harvest.

"With massive government reserves and high stocks overall, China has a big buffer to withstand even a poor harvest without resorting to large imports," said Li Wei, an agricultural commodities analyst based in Shanghai. "Domestic rice prices may rise a bit due to lower supply, but China will draw down on reserves and limit exports rather than make big purchases on the global market."

China has historically been a small player in global rice trade, both as an importer and exporter. China imported only about 530,000 tonnes of rice last year, primarily higher-quality jasmine and basmati rice, and exported about 2.5 million tonnes of lower-quality rice and byproducts. Self-sufficiency in rice and other grains is a key policy priority for China's government.  

While global rice prices have risen modestly on fears of damage to harvests in Asia, traders do not expect a sustained rally if China avoids major imports. Global rice prices remain near multi-year lows due to abundant supplies in India, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Barring further unforeseen supply disruptions, most analysts expect ample exportable supplies from key producers will keep global rice prices in check.

In summary, China's high government reserves, policies supporting self-sufficiency, and ample global exportable supplies mean China is unlikely to make significant purchases on the international rice market due to flood-related harvest losses. Domestic Chinese rice prices may rise temporarily but will be capped by sales from government reserves. On global markets, modest upward pressure on rice prices is expected to abate as China's likely avoidance of imports points to sufficient exportable supplies from other producers.
