U.S. Strives to Assure China that Chicken is Safe Amid Ban on Poultry from Two States

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working to reassure China that American poultry is safe for export after China banned chicken from two U.S. states due to outbreaks of bird flu. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the chicken market was too important to allow trade disruptions over isolated incidents. 

China announced this week that it was banning poultry imports from Tennessee and Kentucky after reports of avian influenza outbreaks at two farms, one in each state. The bans are a blow to the $2.6 billion poultry export market and have raised concerns that China may expand restrictions or ban U.S. chicken altogether.

Vilsack has been lobbying top Chinese officials to limit any bans to areas within a 50-mile radius of infected farms, as recommended by international guidelines. “We want to provide reassurance that this is a localized situation and that the proper controls and containment mechanisms have been put in place,” Vilsack told reporters. “Our poultry supply remains safe and high quality.”

The avian flu outbreaks involved strains that pose a low risk to humans but are highly contagious in bird populations. They prompted immediate responses from U.S. officials, including quarantining infected farms and culling more than 400,000 birds to contain the spread. No human infections have been reported.

China is the second largest buyer of U.S. chicken after Mexico, purchasing more than $1 billion in chicken meat last year. Disruptions to that trade can significantly impact prices for American farmers and consumers. When China banned U.S. chicken in 2015 over avian flu fears, it contributed to a 20 percent drop in chicken exports and an 18 percent rise in chicken prices the following year.

U.S. poultry groups have also been lobbying China to limit the scope of any bans and plan to send a delegation to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing next week. “We want to make a strong case that there is no reason to expand restrictions beyond what international standards call for,” said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council. “Our food safety systems work and containment was swift.”

The USDA has been working to increase communication and coordination with China's food safety regulators in recent years in an effort to avoid trade disruptions and address China's food safety concerns. The two sides have signed several agreements on inspections, product standards, and information sharing. But leaders in both countries acknowledge that more can be done to streamline the import approval process and build trust in each other's systems.

Continued dialogue and engagement are key, according to experts. “In the absence of action and new agreements, disruptions like this chicken ban tend to persist and progressively expand,” said Michael Rasmussen, a global food safety expert. “Once a ban is in place, it is very difficult to reverse.” The USDA will keep pressing its case that American chicken is safe in hopes of limiting the fallout from China's most recent decision.
