China Sets Irrationally High Minimum Selling Price for Corn Exports, Causing Farmers to Miss Out on Potential Profits

China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced this week that it was setting the minimum purchase price for exports of corn at 2,000 yuan per metric ton, approximately $300 USD, for the 2018/2019 marketing year. The price floor is aimed at protecting domestic farmers in China's corn-growing regions from having to sell their crops at unfavorable prices on the global market. However, many analysts argue that the minimum price is set far too high based on current market conditions and will likely lead to weak export demand, causing Chinese farmers to miss out on additional profits. 

Corn futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade are currently around $3.50 per bushel, or $138 USD per metric ton. With Chinese corn exports competing at more than double the global market price, demand is expected to be virtually non-existent at the government's mandated minimum selling price. "At $300 per tonne, China will struggle to sell any corn in the current market," said Darin Friedrichs, a commodity analyst at INTL FCStone. The high export floor price fails to account for the abundant global corn supplies and weak overall demand in the current market that is keeping corn futures prices depressed.

The Chinese government implemented price supports and floors for agricultural commodities like corn, rice, and wheat in 2016 in an effort to boost rural incomes as economic growth slowed. However, the strategy has resulted in overproduction of some crops and costly government stockpiling programs. Despite two years of controls and reductions, China is still sitting on 300 million tonnes of corn reserves. The large stockpiles and weaker exports are making it difficult for the government to purchase and store more corn, yet the minimum selling price provides little incentive for commercial buyers. 

Some Chinese farmers feel they are unable to take advantage of any uptick in global corn prices under the current policy. Several corn growers interviewed expressed frustration that they are essentially locked in to selling at the government's minimum price with no opportunity to earn a premium when world prices are higher. Others argue that without government supports and interventions, Chinese farmers would face even lower and more volatile corn prices. There are calls for more incremental adjustments to the minimum price to better align with global market conditions, giving farmers more flexibility while still providing some protection. However, for now, Chinese corn farmers will likely be stuck selling at $300 USD per tonne while the rest of the world trades at half that level.
