China's Failed Corn Export Strategy Leads to Millions of Rotting Tonnes in Silos 

China is facing a growing crisis of millions of tonnes of corn rotting in silos across the country due to a failed export strategy, according to government officials and traders. In an attempt to become a major corn exporter, China ramped up corn production in recent years through subsidies and policy support. However, a glut of global corn supplies and China's higher prices have made its corn uncompetitive on the world market.

China grew corn on 42 million hectares last year and produced 260 million tonnes, a record harvest. The government had plans to export over 7 million tonnes of corn from its huge stockpiles. But China has only managed to export around 3 million tonnes so far this year, according to China's General Administration of Customs. The rest remains in overflowing silos, and some of it has started to spoil.

Officials estimate that around 4 to 5 million tonnes of corn in government reserves have decayed or spoiled. But traders estimate the amount could be twice as high. "The reality is no one knows exactly how much rotten corn there is in China," said a trader based in Beijing. Either way, it highlights the risky nature of China's ambitious agricultural export plans.

China's corn export strategy was ill-timed and misguided, according to experts. Global corn prices have declined due to huge harvests in the U.S., Brazil, and other major exporters. Brazilian corn is over $30 cheaper per tonne than Chinese corn. Most countries have turned to cheaper suppliers, leaving China's corn unwanted.

Domestic corn prices in China have also dropped, and corn farmers are feeling the pain. In some parts of China, corn is cheaper than cabbage. The government has started new subsidies for corn farmers to make up for losses, but this is not a long-term solution. Government reserve policies will need an overhaul to avoid similar situations in the future.

Exporting agricultural products is part of China's Belt and Road trade initiative to boost economic ties with other countries. But China's corn export challenges show how difficult it can be to achieve this vision without careful planning and timing. China will need to improve coordination across government ministries and gain a better understanding of global agricultural markets to become a competitive exporter of crops like corn. For now, its dreams of becoming a major corn exporter and fears of spoiling stockpiles in silos across the country.
