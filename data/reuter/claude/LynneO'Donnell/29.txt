China Unfazed by International Concerns over Genetically-Altered Soybeans

China remains determined to move forward with regulations allowing the import and sale of genetically modified soybeans despite growing international concerns over their impact. New rules issued by China's agriculture ministry will allow soybeans modified to be resistant to certain herbicides to be imported, processed, and sold domestically beginning next year.

The move comes amid trade tensions with the U.S., the world's largest exporter of soybeans. China imports $40 billion of U.S. soybeans annually but has threatened to shift to other suppliers like Brazil and Argentina. The new GMO rules are seen by some analysts as a way for China to pressure the U.S. in ongoing trade negotiations. 

However, China's embrace of modified soybeans faces criticism from environmental groups, farmers, and consumers concerned about their effect on health and biodiversity. Genetically engineered crops have long been controversial, with debates over their impact and how strongly they should be regulated. The technology involves altering an organism's DNA to introduce new traits like herbicide resistance. While proponents say GMOs increase crop yields and lower costs, critics argue they pose threats to human health and the environment.

A 2018 survey found that more than 70% of Chinese consumers consider GMOs unsafe for consumption. However, China has struggled to meet the demand for soybeans, an important source of feed for its massive livestock operations. China's own soybean production has not kept up with growth in demand, leading to greater reliance on imports.

Some scientists have warned that the weedkillers used on herbicide-resistant GMO crops pollute the land and waterways and may be carcinogenic. There is also concern that the GMO soybeans will cross-pollinate with regular crops, creating "superweeds" that become impossible to kill. The new rules require a series of barriers meant to prevent GMO seeds and pollen from spreading outside controlled areas, but critics argue enforcement is difficult.
