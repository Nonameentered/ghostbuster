China Unconcerned by International Furore over Genetically-Altered Soybeans 

China dismissed international concerns today over its recent approval of genetically-modified soybeans for import, saying the decision was based solely on scientific assessment of health and environmental risks. The new variety of herbicide-resistant soybeans, called SY1178, was developed by Syngenta, a Swiss biotechnology company, to tolerate the weedkiller glufosinate.

The approval has sparked an outcry from environmental groups and some governments, who argue that not enough is known about the long term effects of GM crops and that glufosinate may pose risks as an agricultural chemical. The European Union currently bans imports of the SY1178 soybeans.

“China has a very rigorous and science-based system for evaluating GMO crops and pesticides,” said Liu Peipei, spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. “We would not approve anything that we believed posed a threat to health, safety or the environment.”

Ms. Liu said all relevant research on the Syngenta soybeans, including numerous animal feeding trials and environmental impact studies, had been thoroughly assessed by China’s leading biotechnology experts before import approval was granted. Glufosinate has also been extensively tested and vetted by Chinese regulators, she noted. 

Critics argue China’s decision was heavily influenced by commercial interests and the desire to improve trade relations with the United States, which subsidizes many biotechnology companies. China is the world’s top importer of soybeans, much of which comes from the US and is used to feed pigs and produce vegetable oil.

“This seems to be more about politics and trade than science,” said Lu Wenming, a biodiversity campaigner for Green Future, a Chinese environmental NGO. “There are too many unanswered questions about the long term impact of these kinds of GM foods and chemicals for us to be so quick to approve them.” 

The majority of China’s population, however, appears to welcome the prospect of more affordable food sources, even if genetically modified. On social media, many Chinese internet users supported the government’s decision, arguing that if the technology is safe, it could help reduce costs of living.

A Syngenta spokesman said the company was delighted with China’s approval, which will open up a major new market for its biotechnology products and enable more sustainable agricultural in China. The SY1178 soybeans can increase crop yields by up to 3% while reducing the need for herbicides, the spokesman claimed.

The debate around genetically modified organisms and agrochemicals is sure to continue as China looks to balance public concerns with the demands of feeding its huge population. For now though, the government appears willing to forge ahead with biotechnology that it believes can improve food security and lower prices – regardless of the furore over its decisions from abroad.
