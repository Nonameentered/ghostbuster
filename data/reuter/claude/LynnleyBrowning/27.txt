Frantic Talks as Russian Pipeline Firm Pushes for Larger Stake in $1.5 Billion Kazakhstan-Russia Oil Pipeline Project  

Negotiations over ownership of a strategic oil pipeline between Kazakhstan and Russia hit an impasse this week as Russian pipeline giant Transneft pushed for a controlling stake, according to people familiar with the talks.

Transneft, which currently owns 24% of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline, has proposed increasing its share to 51% in exchange for financing the pipeline's expansion to double its capacity to 67 million tons, or 1.3 million barrels, a day. The 1,500-kilometer pipeline ships crude from Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.

Expansion of the pipeline capacity is critical for Kazakhstan to boost oil exports as its giant offshore Kashagan field comes online. But granting majority control to Transneft risks strengthening Moscow's grip over Kazakhstan's export infrastructure. The Central Asian nation has sought to diversify its export routes in recent years amid political tensions with Russia.

The CPC pipeline shareholders - which also include Kazakhstan's state oil firm KazMunaiGaz with 19%, Chevron with 15% and a handful of other Western majors - were holding talks in Moscow this week to resolve the dispute. But as of Thursday, no agreement had been reached. 

According to sources, Kazakhstan and Chevron have proposed alternative financing schemes to fund the expansion without Transneft gaining majority control. But Transneft has insisted on increasing its share to at least 50% plus one share in return for providing over 60% of the project's $5.5 billion cost.

"It's a very complex negotiation and there are still quite a few uncertainties," said a source close to the consortium. "But time is short, and a solution needs to be found soon."
