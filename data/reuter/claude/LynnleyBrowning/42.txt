Russian Metals Sector Shows Varied Response to Yeltsin's Illness 

Russia's metals sector showed a mixed reaction today to news that President Boris Yeltsin was hospitalized with pneumonia. While some companies saw share prices fall on uncertainty over the 72-year-old leader's health, others were buoyed by hopes of a more market-friendly successor.

Shares in metals giant Norilsk Nickel fell 3.2% in Moscow trade, as investors worried that prolonged questions over Yeltsin's fitness could slow the Kremlin's drive towards market reforms. Yeltsin has pushed to dismantle Soviet-era trading barriers and state control over resource companies like Norilsk, Russia's top nickel and palladium producer.

Aluminum producer Rusal, however, rose 2.3% as some investors bet that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin would accelerate the transition to a free market if he were to replace Yeltsin. Putin, a former KGB officer, is seen as more likely than Yeltsin to tackle vested interests in the energy and industrial sectors. Analysts said Rusal, which aims to become the world's largest aluminum company, would benefit strongly from faster reforms and deregulation.

In the steel sector, Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works fell 1.7% while Novolipetsk Steel rose 0.8%. Traders said the muted moves reflected uncertainty over the policies of any Yeltsin successor and the limited room for further major reforms. Recent years have seen the closure of inefficient steel mills and mines, as well as private investment in new capacity.  

Ivan Andreev, metals analyst at UralSib brokerage in Moscow, said the mixed market reaction was unsurprising given contrasting interests in Russian industry. “For companies aiming to build large, world-class groups, faster reforms and a fresh face in the Kremlin can't come soon enough,” he said. “But for smaller firms, political uncertainty is unwelcome when they're struggling with high costs and low prices.”

In a sign of the disconnect between markets and politics, the RTS stock index extended its rise to 1.2% from 0.9% after news first broke of Yeltsin's hospitalization. Currency and debt markets were stable, suggesting investors do not expect any immediate change in the general policy direction. The government moved to reassure investors, saying Yeltsin was in a "satisfactory" condition and in full control of his duties as president.
