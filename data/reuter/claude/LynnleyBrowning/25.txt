Russia clashes with banks over control of gold sector financing and exports 

The Russian government is tightening control over the country's gold mining and export sectors, wresting influence away from major foreign bank financiers in a bid to boost state revenues. New regulations announced this week will require Russian gold miners to sell part of their exports to the country's central bank and move financing away from major banks to a state-run development bank.

The moves aim to increase the Kremlin's control over an industry that has been largely financed by Western investment banks and dominated by a handful of large producers shipping gold to foreign buyers. Gold is Russia's largest non-energy export after oil and gas, accounting for around 10 percent of total export revenues last year.

Under the new rules, Russian gold mining companies will have to sell at least 10 percent of their annual exports to commercial banks in Russia, and another 10 percent to the country's central bank at a discount. The companies will also have to move at least one third of their financing to Russian state development bank VEB over the next three years. The regulations take effect on Feb. 1, according to a decree signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

The policy is the latest in a series of moves by the Kremlin to exert more control over strategic sectors of the economy, including technology and finance. Russia has sought to reduce dependence on Western funding and escape US economic sanctions imposed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. But the policies threaten to cut off gold miners and other companies from major sources of investment, raising financing costs and limiting exports.  

Shares in Russia's largest gold producers, including Polyus and Petropavlovsk, fell 3 to 5 percent this week on news of the regulations. Analysts said the rules will reduce gold miners' profits by forcing them to take lower prices selling to the central bank and pay higher interest rates to VEB. The policy may also curb exports by requiring more gold to be sold domestically.  

"The central bank will buy gold at a discount, reducing the potential revenue for miners," said Vladimir Zhukov, an analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow. "And VEB financing will be more expensive than borrowing from commercial banks."

The government argues the rules will help Russia build gold reserves, provide domestic gold buyers with better supply, and support a state-backed development bank with more business. But others see it as another worrying sign of state control over industry and the economy. "It's a trend towards isolationism and a command economy," said Liam Halligan, chief economist at BNE Intellinews in London. "The government is asserting control over strategic industries at the expense of the free market."
