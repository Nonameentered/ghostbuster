FCC Takes Steps to Cut Costs of Overseas Phone Calls 

The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to make it cheaper for Americans to phone their relatives and friends in other countries.

The FCC approved rules that cap the rates that U.S. long-distance carriers can charge for international phone calls to a number of countries. The new rules are an effort to reduce exorbitant costs that discourage immigrants in the United States from staying in touch with loved ones abroad.

“Affordable international calling is crucial for families, friends, and business relationships across borders,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. “With today’s decision, we make it clear that every call counts and cap unreasonably high international rates.”  

Under the new rules, large phone carriers like AT&T and Verizon will be prohibited from charging more than 25 cents a minute for calls to most countries, including Canada, Mexico and parts of Europe. The limit will be even lower, at 15 cents a minute, for calls to 14 nations where many immigrants to the U.S. were born, including India, China, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.

The FCC action comes after years of complaints from immigrant groups and their advocates that it was unjust for major carriers to charge exorbitant rates of up to $2 to $3 a minute for international phone calls. They argued such high charges made it difficult for millions of immigrants in the U.S. to call their families abroad and stay connected to their roots.

In response, the FCC in 2013 capped rates for international calling to many countries. But large carriers then began routing more calls over the internet to evade those rules. So the FCC has now extended the price caps to cover internet-based international calling as well.  

AT&T and Verizon had argued against extending the price caps, saying the FCC rules could reduce their incentive to invest in their networks. The companies said competition in the calling market would lead to lower rates over time.

But FCC officials and advocates for immigrant groups said the huge profits the big carriers earned from high international calling rates over many years demonstrated that the companies faced little competitive pressure to lower prices. The new rules are an effort to immediately address the impact of those high charges.

“For far too long, these companies have profited from ripping off immigrant families,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, director of advocacy for United We Dream, an immigrant youth network. “Every second immigrant families had to choose between talking to their loved ones or paying for basic necessities.”

The FCC’s new rules go into effect in early 2021. In a concession to telecom companies, the price caps will last for just four years, at which point the FCC will revisit whether the limits are still needed and reasonable. But for now, the changes promise substantial savings for millions of people living in the U.S. seeking to connect with family and friends in other countries.
