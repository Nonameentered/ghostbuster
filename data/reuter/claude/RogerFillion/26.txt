TV Executives Agree on Age-Based Ratings System, Disappointing Advocates for Content-Based System

The four major television networks and several large cable channels announced today that they have agreed to implement an age-based ratings system for shows and movies starting in the fall lineup. The new ratings categories will include TV-Y for children's shows, TV-G for general audiences, TV-PG for parental guidance suggested, TV-14 for those 14 and older, and  TV-MA for mature audiences only.

Advocates pushing for a content-based ratings system expressed disappointment with the announcement. They argue that the age-based ratings do not give parents enough information about the nature of a show's content to make an informed judgement about whether it is appropriate for their children. "Just because a show is rated OK for a 14-year-old, that doesn't tell me if there is heavy violence, sex, drugs or language that I don't want my kid seeing," said Melissa Allen, a mother of two and head of the Parents for Content Ratings group.

The entertainment executives defended their decision, saying an age-based system is easier for parents to understand and one that they are already familiar with from the movie ratings system. They also argued that content varies widely even within the same rating category, so more prescriptive content-based ratings could be misleading. "There is no way to explicitly rate every element of content that might be objectionable to someone," said Peter Thompson, CEO of the Thompson Media Group, which owns three major cable channels. 

Some compromise may still be possible. The executives indicated a willingness to provide more information on show ratings on their websites and through on-screen content advisories. They also plan to monitor how the new ratings system is used over the first year to determine if any changes need to be made to address concerns. However, the two sides remain far apart on adopting a fully content-based ratings system, setting the stage for continued debate and possible action by regulators, lawmakers, and children's advocacy groups.
