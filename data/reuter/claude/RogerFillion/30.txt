Television Industry Group to Unveil Controversial System for Rating Programs to Protect Children 

The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) announced today that it will release details of a new voluntary content rating system for television programs in an effort to give parents more information about the appropriateness of shows for children. The announcement has already sparked criticism from advocacy groups who argue the system does not go far enough to protect kids from disturbing content.

The new rating system assigns shows a rating based on their content, similar to the movie rating system. Programs will be rated TV-Y for young children, TV-Y7 for children ages 7 and older, TV-G for general audiences, TV-PG for parental guidance, TV-14 for viewers over 14, and TV-MA for mature audiences over 17. 

"This is a historic step that empowers parents with information to make their own choices about what programs they want their children to watch,” said NAB President Gordon Smith. “The television industry is committed to enhancing this system over time to ensure it addresses society’s concerns and values.”

However, advocacy groups like the Parents Television Council and Common Sense Media argue the age-based ratings are too broad and vague. They say the ratings fail to provide specific information about the type of content, like violence, language, or sexual situations. Parents cannot determine what is appropriate based solely on a program’s age rating.

“A content rating system without content descriptors is really no help at all for American families,” said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council. His organization has called on the industry to rate programs based on a scale that considers specific types of content. “Absent the crucial content information, the age-based ratings alone are not useful to parents.”  

The industry plans to roll out the new rating system within the next six months. The NAB will work with television networks and local station groups to implement the system and its partners aim to have all primetime and children’s programs rated before the fall television season begins. The system will also include on-screen icons during the first 15 seconds of a show to alert viewers to its rating. 

While voluntary for now, the industry could face regulation if the federal government determines its efforts are insufficient. Supporters hope the rating system is an effective compromise that avoids government mandates, while critics argue regulation may be needed to force compliance and stronger standards. The effort is likely to prompt a larger debate around the government’s role in regulating media content for children.
