Michigan Regulators Endorse Ameritech Corp.'s Bid for Long-Distance Telephone Service

The Michigan Public Service Commission today approved Ameritech Corporation's application to offer long-distance telephone service in Michigan. The approval allows Ameritech, one of the nation's largest local telephone companies, to compete in Michigan's long-distance market for the first time. 

Ameritech currently provides local telephone service to 5.2 million customers in Michigan. Company officials argued that allowing Ameritech into the long-distance market would benefit consumers by increasing choice and competition. "This is a win for Michigan consumers who want more options and lower prices," said Ameritech Michigan President Brian Gregory.

However, critics argue that Ameritech's entry into long distance could negatively impact competition by giving the company too much power over telephone infrastructure and services in the state. Consumer advocates pushed for additional restrictions and oversight on Ameritech's long-distance business to prevent anti-competitive behavior.

The commission's approval comes with certain conditions aimed at ensuring fair competition. Ameritech cannot bundle or tie its local and long-distance services together for two years. The company must also continue to make its networks open for other providers to lease. Ameritech is prohibited from sharing confidential customer data between its local and long-distance units. And the commission will monitor Ameritech for compliance and take further action if needed.

Ameritech plans to start offering residential and business long-distance plans over the next several months. The company has already run television ads promoting its upcoming long-distance service. Rates and calling features are still being finalized, according to a company spokesperson. 

The Michigan commission's decision follows similar approvals of Ameritech's long-distance applications in other Midwestern states like Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Approval in Michigan was widely expected given the company's history of regulatory compliance and the commission's precedent. However, Michigan took longer to deliberate due to more vocal opposition from consumer groups. The commission ultimately decided the benefits of increased competition and choice outweighed the risks of reduced competition. Ameritech's long-awaited entry into Michigan's long-distance telephone market promises to shake up the market by offering consumers more options and lower costs. Rivals like AT&T and Sprint will have to improve their services to keep up with the new competition from the state's dominant local telephone provider.
