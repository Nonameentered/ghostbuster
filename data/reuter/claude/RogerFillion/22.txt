Federal Regulators Plan to Slash Overseas Phone Call Rates Despite Feathers Ruffling

The Federal Communications Commission announced plans today to dramatically cut the rates that U.S. telecommunications providers can charge for international long-distance and video calls. The proposed FCC order would lower the price cap for international calls by 25 to 40 percent, a move that is expected to save the average U.S. household up to $50 per year but would cost telecom companies billions in lost revenue.

In a statement, FCC Chairman Jonathan Winston said, “For too long, families have had to pay astronomical rates to connect with loved ones abroad. This action will make international calling more affordable and help people stay in touch regardless of borders.”

The new order would apply to all calls made by landline or mobile phones to destinations outside of the U.S., including Canada, Mexico and developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Rates for calls to Western European countries are already capped under a separate FCC policy. The proposed lower rate caps are based on staff analysis that determined current profit margins on international calls significantly exceed costs, indicating the rates are not “just and reasonable” under the FCC's mandate.  

Industry groups blasted the move, saying it amounts to an overreach by regulators that will decimate a revenue stream worth over $10 billion annually. “The FCC has once again ignored economic realities to score political points,” said telecom trade association spokesman Brian Higgins. He argues lower rates will drastically undercut the business case for future network investments and innovations. An association representing small telecom resellers also warns the change could put some carriers out of business altogether.

Consumer advocates counter that the telecom industry claims of financial hardship are overblown and ignore the larger benefits to society. “Families shouldn't have to choose between paying an exorbitant phone bill or losing contact with loved ones abroad,” said Alicia Wilson of the Global Callers' Rights Alliance, a Washington-based consumer group. She points out that the technology and infrastructure to provide lower-cost international calling has long existed but companies have lacked incentive to pass on savings to customers.  

The proposed order is still subject to a final vote by the five FCC commissioners, which is expected within the next few months. If approved, telecom companies would have six to 18 months to comply with the new lower rate caps, depending on the destination country.
