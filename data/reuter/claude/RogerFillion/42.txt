Telecommunications Revolution Off to Slow Start in U.S. 

The telecommunications industry in the U.S. was poised for a revolution in the 1990s. New technologies like fiber optics, broadband networks, and wireless connectivity promised to transform how Americans communicate and access information. However, nearly 30 years later, the U.S. telecom landscape has not changed as quickly as anticipated. While some new technologies have been adopted, the overall system remains dominated by a few massive companies and deficient in providing high-speed, affordable connectivity to many parts of the country.

In the early 1990s, policymakers and industry leaders predicted widespread deployment of fiber optic networks that could provide high-speed internet access to homes and businesses across the U.S. However, the high cost of building these networks deterred companies from large-scale fiber rollouts. Instead, most Americans still access the internet via older copper phone lines or cable connections. Fiber now reaches only about 25-30% of U.S. homes, lagging far behind other developed nations.

The wireless revolution has also moved more slowly than expected. The transition to faster 5G wireless networks is still in early stages. While telecom giants like AT&T and Verizon have launched 5G in select cities, broad availability of fast, reliable 5G connectivity remains years away for most Americans. At the same time, the U.S. lacks strong competition among wireless carriers, with AT&T and Verizon controlling about 70% of the market. Prices for wireless plans in the U.S. are among the highest in the world.

Regulatory policies and a lack of competition have hampered innovation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to open markets and promote new entrants, but instead entrenched the power of massive carriers. Broadband in the U.S. is dominated by regional cable monopolies like Comcast and Charter with little incentive to improve service or lower prices. Regulation of tech giants like Google and Facebook has also stalled in the face of massive lobbying campaigns. New privacy protections for web users and greater competition in online advertising remain unaddressed issues.
