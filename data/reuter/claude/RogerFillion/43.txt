Vice President Al Gore Defends Telecommunications Law Against Criticisms  

Vice President Al Gore gave a speech today vigorously defending the  1996 Telecommunications Act against accusations that it has led to higher  prices and less choice for consumers. Speaking at a telecommunications  industry conference, Gore argued that the law was achieving its intended aims of promoting competition and boosting  investment in new technologies.   

The Telecommunications Act was one of the major legislative  achievements of the Clinton administration, overhauling regulations that governed the  telecoms industry. The most significant impact was allowing long-distance phone  companies, local phone companies, and cable companies to enter each other's markets.  The goal was to drive down prices through increased competition.  

However, in recent years the law has come under fire from consumer groups  and some members of Congress. They argue that instead of vibrant  competition, the three dominant sectors—phone companies, cable companies,  and wireless carriers—have solidified into oligopolies that overcharge customers and stifle  smaller rivals. Several proposed mergers, like AT&T taking over Time Warner, have  also raised concerns about diminishing competition.  

In his speech, Gore acknowledged the criticism but said “the full  effects of the law have yet to be felt.” He pointed to statistics showing  more Americans have access to broadband, cable, and wireless services than  ever before, even as prices have dropped for many services. “The Telecommunications Act has been an extraordinary success,” Gore said, “and  we must stay the course to continue promoting policies that foster  innovation.”  

Gore outlined several specific steps he said regulators and lawmakers  should take to further the goals of the law, including freeing up more  wireless spectrum for 5G networks, easing regulations on new satellite  constellations proposed by companies like SpaceX and OneWeb, and  scrutinizing telecom mergers to prevent anti-competitive behavior.  

The speech comes at a time when Democrats and Republicans in Congress  are debating various proposals to update telecommunications law for the  digital era. There is bipartisan agreement that the 1996 law is outdated,  but lawmakers disagree on how much additional regulation is needed to  protect consumers and smaller companies. Gore’s full-throated defense of  the law as able to stand on its own suggests the debates ahead may be  contentious.
