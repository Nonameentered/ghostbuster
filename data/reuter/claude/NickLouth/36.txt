BT and MCI Communications to Merge in Record-Breaking $22 Billion Deal 

British Telecom (BT) and WorldCom's MCI Communications have agreed to merge in a deal valued at $22  billion, creating one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. The deal would combine BT's strength in Europe with MCI's powerful presence in the United States.

The merger has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The new company will be called Concert Communications and will have combined annual revenues of more than $43 billion and over 100 million business and residential customers worldwide.

"This merger of equals creates a global telecommunications powerhouse and will deliver substantial benefits to customers, shareholders, and employees of both companies," said Sir Iain Vallance, Chairman of BT. "Concert Communications will offer customers a wide range of integrated communication services spanning the globe."

Bernard Ebbers, CEO of WorldCom, MCI's parent company, said, "This combination of two highly respected industry leaders with complementary assets, expertise and geographic reach will create superior value for customers, shareowners and employees."

The deal would be the second-largest corporate acquisition in history and underscores the accelerating consolidation of the global telecommunications sector. Telecom companies are merging to gain scale and offer a wider range of phone and data services to business and residential customers around the world. The combined BT and MCI would pose a formidable challenge to industry leaders like AT&T and British-based Vodafone.

To gain regulatory approval, BT and MCI will need to convince antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Europe that the merger will not hamper competition or harm consumers. The companies said they expect to divest certain assets to satisfy regulators, but did not specify which businesses might be sold or spun off. The merger also requires approval by shareholders of both companies.

BT shares rose over 15% on news of the deal, while WorldCom's stock price was up nearly 9%, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the transformative transaction. The boards of both companies have unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the merger. If approved, the deal would likely close in October this year.

The new company, Concert Communications, would maintain headquarters in both London and Washington, D.C. The CEO position would be jointly held by Vallance and Ebbers for a transition period of 18-24 months, after which a single CEO would be named. The merger aims to achieve cost savings of $2 billion annually within the first three years through consolidating operations. No major job reductions are expected given the complementary geographic focus and assets of the two companies. The deal is a stock transaction and will not require MCI to take on additional debt.
