British Telecom in Talks to Acquire MCI Communications Corp. in Huge Merger Move  

British Telecommunications PLC, the dominant telecommunications company in the United Kingdom, is in advanced talks to acquire MCI Communications Corp., the second largest long-distance carrier in the United States, for over $20 billion according to people familiar with the matter. If completed, the deal would be the largest transatlantic merger in history and create a telecommunications powerhouse to rival AT&T.

The potential deal comes amid a wave of consolidation in the telecommunications industry as companies seek to build scale and offer bundled service packages to customers. MCI executives have been under pressure to find a merger partner after its failed attempt to combine with rival WorldCom Inc. last year. For British Telecom, acquiring MCI would be a bold move to expand its international reach and gain a strong foothold in the American market. MCI’s vast telecommunications network and enterprise customer base in the US would provide British Telecom greater global capabilities and relationships with major corporations.  

The discussions are said to be ongoing but fragile, as both sides work through key issues around management structure, branding, and valuation. British Telecom’s initial offer of $20 billion represents a roughly 30% premium over MCI’s current market capitalization, a sign that British Telecom is eager to complete a deal and willing to pay top dollar. For MCI and its shareholders, any merger with British Telecom would likely provide an exit at a substantial premium, allowing them to gain value that eluded them in previous deals. If an agreement is reached, a formal announcement could come as early as next week according to people close to the discussions.

Any potential deal would still need to gain regulatory approval in both the UK and US, where authorities have expressed concerns over increasing consolidation in telecommunications. A merger would also face scrutiny from major customers worried that reduced competition could lead to higher prices. However, regulators may be open to a British Telecom-MCI deal given that it combines companies from different geographic regions rather than direct competitors within the same market. The agreement by US and European regulators to Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch Communications last year could provide a model for cross-border telecom acquisitions going forward.

In a statement, British Telecom and MCI declined to comment on “rumors and speculation”. However, if a deal does come to fruition, it would be the telecommunications blockbuster of the year and significantly raise the stakes for rivals scrambling to gain scale. The prospect of these two titans coming together promises to shake up the global telecom landscape for decades to come.
