MCI in Talks with British Telecom on Possible Merger

MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC are in discussions regarding a potential merger of the two telecommunications giants, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are preliminary, but if completed, a deal could be valued at over $100 billion and reshape the global telecom landscape. 

MCI, based in Ashburn, Virginia, is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the U.S. It provides local and long-distance calling, data and internet services to businesses and government clients. British Telecom, headquartered in London, is the dominant telecom provider in the U.K. and also serves business and government customers across Europe and Asia.

The discussions come amid a wave of consolidation in the telecom sector as companies look to gain scale and expand into new markets. MCI was recently acquired by Verizon Communications Inc. in a $6.7 billion deal. British Telecom faces intensifying competition in its home market from challengers like Virgin Media. By merging, MCI and British Telecom could cut costs, increase their geographic reach, and bundle more services for business customers.

A deal would require approval from U.S. and British regulators, which could scrutinize the competitive effects of merging two of the largest global telecom companies. The companies would also have to agree on a number of complex issues like integrated management, employee matters, and a headquarters location for the combined company. Sources say no agreement is guaranteed given the challenges involved in successfully negotiating and executing a cross-border megamerger.

Representatives from MCI and British Telecom declined to comment on "rumors and speculation". An announcement is not expected for several weeks at the earliest as the companies explore the feasibility and potential structure of a deal, sources said. If agreeable terms can be reached, an agreement would be subject to approval by the boards of both companies. The aim would be to complete any merger review process and close a final transaction potentially by year's end.

The discussions were first reported by Bloomberg News.   Shares of MCI rose over 4% on the news while British Telecom's stock climbed 2% in early London trading. Analysts suggested a merger could generate significant cost and revenue synergies, depending on the level of integration pursued.
