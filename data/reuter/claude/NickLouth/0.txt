Regional Bells and GTE Corp See Strong Demand for Telephone Services and Robust Earnings Growth in Q3  

The major regional telecommunications companies and GTE Corp reported strong third quarter results this week, signaling continued robust demand for telephone services and data connectivity. Revenue and earnings growth exceeded Wall Street expectations across the board.  

Verizon Communications, the largest local carrier, posted a 7% increase in revenue to $17.3 billion along with a 15% rise in net income to $1.8 billion. The company added 289,000 new landline phone connections, the most in several years, as well as 745,000 new mobile phone subscribers. Verizon executives cited a steady US economy, population growth in key markets, and increased high-speed internet adoption as drivers of the solid results.

SBC Communications, the dominant carrier in the Midwest and Southwest, recorded revenue growth of 6% to $13.9 billion and net income growth of 20% to $1.7 billion. The company connected 318,000 new residential phone lines and 615,000 new mobile phone customers. SBC has invested heavily in upgrading its network to provide digital subscriber line (DSL) high-speed internet access, which executives said was fueling new customer wins and service upgrades.

BellSouth, which primarily operates in the Southeast, and US West, focused on the Western US, also posted healthy gains in revenue, earnings and new customer additions that outstripped forecasts. Ameritech, another Midwestern carrier, saw more modest but still solid results.  

In the long distance market, the dominant player AT&T reported a slight decline in revenue but flat net income, as the company struggles with competition from newer rivals like WorldCom and Sprint. However, AT&T executives said the carrier was sustaining its earnings through cost cutting and expanding its business services.

GTE Corp, one of the largest independent local carriers, recorded a 12% jump in revenue to $6.3 billion and 15% increase in net income to $701 million. In addition to strong demand for traditional phone services, GTE benefited from providing local phone service for long distance carriers through resale and network access.

The positive results from across the telecommunications sector suggest that fears of slowing growth may have been premature. Regional Bells, in particular, look poised to continue gaining new residential and business customers at a healthy clip by leveraging their upgraded networks to provide video, voice and high-speed data services. Barring a downturn in the broader economy, the telecom growth engine appears to remain in high gear heading into the end of the year and 2000.
