Merger of MCI and BT Sparks Predictions of More Mega-Mergers Among U.S. Carriers  

The $129 billion merger between MCI Inc. and British Telecom has sparked predictions that more mega-mergers are on the horizon among telecommunications carriers in the United States looking to enhance their scale and reach. The long-distance phone companies are seeking new business lines and service offerings amid rapid technological change in how individuals and corporations communicate.

The merger between MCI and BT, which received regulatory approval this week, is the largest ever for the telecommunications industry and one of the biggest in any sector. The deal would combine the third-largest long-distance phone company in America with a leading global carrier. MCI executives acknowledged that its merger with BT was partly motivated by the need to get bigger in an era when mammoth telecommunications conglomerates offer both local and long-distance phone service, as well as wireless, broadband, and media products.

Analysts say other U.S. carriers will likely feel pressure to increase their scale in order to remain competitive. “The telecommunications space is undergoing a massive consolidation, and scale matters nowadays,” said Michael Ligon of Raymond James Financial. “Major players that remain independent will have a much harder time surviving and thriving.” Ligon and other analysts predict potential mega-mergers between AT&T and Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile, and smaller players like CenturyLink and Frontier Communications.

However, mergers of the largest carriers face significant regulatory hurdles and antitrust scrutiny. The MCI-BT deal took more than a year to receive approval, and any merger between largest players like AT&T and Verizon would likely undergo intense review from regulators aimed at promoting competition and consumer choice. Still, analysts suggest that building scale may be critical for long-term survival as telecommunications companies diversify into new business areas beyond basic phone services.

The merger between MCI and BT could prompt a domino effect of more mega-deals, but challenges remain. U.S. regulators and lawmakers will likely take a close look at how larger corporations could impact competition and prices for telecommunications services. And finding the right match between companies of differing size and reach may be easier said than done. Expect more twists and turns in an industry experiencing rapid transformation.
