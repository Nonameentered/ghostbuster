PrimeCo faces tough competition from Sprint in wireless market  

PrimeCo, the nation's second largest wireless carrier, is facing intensifying competition from rival Sprint in the U.S. mobile phone market. Sprint announced aggressive new pricing plans this week that undercut PrimeCo on price for unlimited data plans, threatening PrimeCo's subscriber and revenue growth.   

The new pricing from Sprint offers unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data for $60 a month, $20 less than PrimeCo's closest comparable plan. Sprint has also offered to cut PrimeCo subscribers' bills in half if they switch to Sprint, a bold move aimed squarely at PrimeCo's customer base.

The competitive salvo comes at a challenging time for PrimeCo, which recently reported slower subscriber growth in the first quarter due to market saturation. PrimeCo has more than 150 million wireless subscribers, but attracted just 200,000 new monthly subscribers in Q1, well below analysts' estimates.  

In response to the Sprint pricing announcement, PrimeCo executives argued that pricing is not the only consideration for subscribers. "Our network quality, coverage and outstanding service remain the top reasons customers choose and stay with PrimeCo," said CEO Mark Stevens. "While price is certainly a factor, we believe performance and experience matter more to our subscribers."

PrimeCo spends heavily to maintain its reputation for network quality and customer service. However, with the spread of unlimited plans and increasing coverage by budget carriers, pricing has become a more prominent variable for subscribers. Surveys show that a majority of wireless subscribers would switch providers for savings of $10 or more per month.

Sprint's move is a bid to take advantage of the pricing sensitivity of PrimeCo's customer base, especially the 50 million subscribers on its legacy unlimited data plans. By offering comparable unlimited plans at a steep discount, Sprint aims to prompt enough defections from PrimeCo to significantly curtail its market share and revenue growth.
