Excel Communications Anticipates Record Earnings and Sales Growth, Plans Expansion into New Services

Excel Communications, a leader in business communications services, announced today that it expects to achieve record revenue and earnings growth for the third fiscal quarter ended September 30. Due to continued strong demand for its voice and data services as well as the rollout of new advanced services, Excel anticipates revenue of $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 25% from $960 million a year ago. Earnings are expected to rise an even faster 35% to $0.38 per share from $0.28 per share in the same quarter last year. 

The robust growth in revenue and profits comes as Excel benefits from the fast-growing market for integrated voice, data, internet, and network services geared towards business customers. According to industry analysts, demand for “converged” telecommunications services is increasing over 20% annually as companies seek to optimize their technology infrastructure and gain productivity. Excel is a leading provider of integrated voice, data and IP-based network services for enterprises across the U.S. and Canada.

Buoyed by its recent success and the strong outlook for continued demand growth, Excel also announced plans to accelerate its expansion into new advanced service areas. The company will launch a suite of managed security services next month to help businesses address network vulnerabilities and protect against cyber threats. Excel also plans to unveil a new set of cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for remote workers and mobile employees early next year. 

“We are executing very well on our strategic growth initiatives and the demand outlook for business communications services remains robust,” said Bob Stevens, Excel’s Chairman and CEO. “We are leveraging our state-of-the-art IP network and service capabilities to drive growth in emerging areas like network security, cloud services, and mobility. With the tremendous opportunities ahead, we aim to achieve double-digit revenue and earnings growth for years to come.”

Investors have reacted positively to the news, sending Excel’s shares up over 5% in early trading. Analysts have been overwhelmingly bullish on Excel’s stock, citing the company’s technology and network leadership as well as its ability to translate key market trends into sustained strong financial performance. Today’s announcement is further evidence that Excel is poised to continue its impressive track record of innovation, growth and shareholder value creation going forward.
