Boeing CEO Phil Condit Seals $13.3 Billion Deal to Acquire McDonnell Douglas Corp.

Boeing announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $13.3 billion in stock, cementing Boeing's status as the world's largest aerospace company. The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, is the U.S. defense industry's biggest merger ever. 

"This is a historic day for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas and a great day for aviation," said Boeing Chairman and CEO Phil Condit. "By combining our companies, we will accelerate growth through new commercial and military aircraft programs, integrated electronics, and space systems."

The merger will allow Boeing to expand its commercial aircraft and space and communications businesses. It will also make Boeing the prime contractor for the U.S. military's F-15 fighter jet and strengthen its status as a major contractor for the next-generation F-22 stealth fighter. McDonnell Douglas is the principal contractor on the F-15 and manufactures 70 percent of the aircraft.  

"McDonnell Douglas and Boeing share a legacy of innovation, excellence and leadership in aerospace, making this a natural partnership," said McDonnell Douglas Chairman and CEO Harry Stonecipher. "As a combined company, we will strengthen our ability to serve customers, compete in global markets, and advance technology."

Under the terms of the agreement, McDonnell Douglas shareholders will receive $48 in Boeing stock for each McDonnell Douglas share they now own. The deal represents a premium of 62 percent over McDonnell Douglas' stock price before the announcement. The acquisition, which requires regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to close in late 1997.

The combined company will be headquartered in Chicago, home to Boeing's commercial aircraft unit. McDonnell Douglas' operations will be integrated into Boeing's existing structures. Harry Stonecipher will become president and chief operating officer of Boeing.

The blockbuster deal is the latest in a wave of mega-mergers in the defense and aerospace industries as companies seek to gain scale and cut costs in the face of slowing commercial and government demand. If approved, the union of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas would speed consolidation in an already concentrated sector, leaving the U.S. with only two companies—Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp.—that can lead major defense and space programs.
