Microsoft's Share Price Reaches Record High Despite Warning of Slowing Growth in Fiscal 1998

Shares of Microsoft Corp. reached a new all-time high today, hitting $139.13 in midday trading, despite company executives warning yesterday that revenue and profit growth will slow in the coming fiscal year. 

Microsoft closed at $138.63, up $3.81 or 2.8% for the day. The stock has risen more than 50% over the past 12 months as investors have rewarded the company for its dominant position in the PC software market and growing revenue from enterprise products like Microsoft Office and Windows Server.

Yesterday, at Microsoft's annual shareholders meeting, CEO Bill Gates and CFO Greg Maffei said the torrid pace of growth that propelled revenues up 15% and profits up 20% in the most recent fiscal year would likely decelerate in fiscal 1998. Revenue is projected to increase 10-12% and earnings per share are forecast to rise 15-20% next year. 

"Our size and success means growth rates must inevitably slow over time,” Gates told investors. “We have a broader range of products and services than ever before, but we remain focused on building great software, and fiscal 1998 will continue to reflect that.”

The guidance for slowing growth comes as little surprise to Wall Street analysts, who have long expected Microsoft's revenue and profit expansion to moderate as the company's business has scaled. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, generates over $11 billion in annual sales.

"Microsoft is a mature, stable and very profitable company,” said Jill Taylor, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Nobody expects them to grow like a startup. As the law of large numbers takes effect, 10-15% earnings growth is very solid."

Notwithstanding the slower projected growth, Microsoft's business remains very strong. Revenue from the Windows operating system and Office productivity suite, which together generate nearly half of sales, is expected to continue to rise at a healthy clip. The company's increasing push into cloud and subscription offerings, like Office 365 and Azure, is fueling top-line gains and helping position Microsoft for future growth.  

The company also continues to generate huge amounts cash, with profits topping $25 billion in its latest fiscal year. Microsoft said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 4 cents to 46 cents per share, the 15th increase in the past 16 years, as part of its traditional strategy of returning excess cash to shareholders. 

Microsoft's business model and balance sheet clearly continue to resonate on Wall Street and leave the company well-positioned despite growth moderating from historically high levels. While future gains may be less drastic, Microsoft's stock appears poised to continue its steady upward climb, even as Bill Gates's warning about "slowing growth" becomes a reality.
