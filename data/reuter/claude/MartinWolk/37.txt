Microsoft Corp Poised to Build on Momentum in 1997 With New Product Launches and Strong Earnings Growth

Microsoft Corp is poised to continue its momentum in 1997 with several new product launches planned and expectations of strong earnings growth. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant dominated the technology industry in 1996 with the success of Windows 95, its Internet Explorer web browser, and Office productivity software. 

Microsoft's stock soared over 50% in 1996, making it the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Revenue for the fiscal year increased over 40% to $8.7 billion, while profits jumped nearly 50% to $2.2 billion. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates credits the company's success to its focus on building innovative products and services that harness the power of the Internet and make technology more accessible and useful for individuals and businesses.

This year, Microsoft will introduce Version 4.0 of its Internet Explorer browser, designed to run on the Windows 95 operating system. The company hopes the new browser will continue to chip away at the market dominance of Netscape Communications' Navigator browser. Microsoft also plans to launch new versions of its MSN online service and BackOffice server software.

However, the biggest launch of 1997 will likely be Windows 97, the next version of Microsoft's operating system, which industry experts expect will drive another surge of sales in the personal computer market later this year. "The Windows franchise is the heart and soul of Microsoft's business, so the launch of Windows 97 will be the most critical event of the year," said John McCarthy, analyst with Forrester Research.

Microsoft predicts earnings for the current fiscal year to increase in the high teens, fueled by growth in the business segment. But some analysts believe Microsoft's estimates are conservative given its track record of beating expectations and the excitement around new product releases.

"Microsoft shares may continue their strong run in 1997 based on expectations of better-than-projected earnings and overwhelming enthusiasm for new products like Windows 97," said U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Microsoft appears well positioned to continue dominating the technology sector and reward shareholders with another stellar year of growth. Overall, the future remains bright for this software powerhouse from Redmond.
