Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas set to make it a leading military contractor

Boeing announced this morning that it has reached an agreement to acquire McDonnell Douglas for $13.3 billion in stock, a deal that would create the world's largest aerospace company. The merger would combine two of the biggest suppliers of commercial and military aircraft, instantly making Boeing a leading military contractor and strengthening its position as the dominant manufacturer of passenger jets. 

If approved by regulators and shareholders, the deal would provide Boeing access to McDonnell Douglas' military programs as US defense spending is on the rise. McDonnell Douglas is the maker of the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets as well as the DC-10 and MD-11 commercial airliners. The deal is expected to generate significant cost savings as the companies streamline operations. However, it may face close scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and Europe given the scale of the combined company.

"This is a historic moment for aerospace that will shape our industry for decades to come," said Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit. "Together, we will advance a vibrant and sustained aerospace manufacturing base, keep strong supplier networks, and continue to invest in innovative new products."

For Boeing, the deal addresses two key challenges: diversifying beyond its commercial aircraft business and gaining technical capabilities in fighter jets and missile defense systems. While Boeing has a strong position in the market for large commercial aircraft like the 747 and 777, its defense business has lagged competitors. Acquiring McDonnell Douglas would immediately boost Boeing's defense portfolio and contracting revenues.  

McDonnell Douglas has faced financial struggles recently due to cuts in defense spending after the Cold War. Its commercial aircraft business has also declined following the discontinuation of certain models. The merger provides McDonnell Douglas an opportunity to streamline costs while tapping into Boeing's more stable commercial aviation business.  

The deal is expected to close by the end of 1997, subject to approval by the boards of both companies and government regulators. If approved, it would cap off a wave of consolidation in the aerospace and defense industry in the 1990s. The Clinton administration has voiced support for defense mergers that cut costs through streamlining, but critics argue this level of concentration could reduce competition in certain sectors. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas counter that the deal will increase their competitiveness in global aircraft manufacturing and preserve US aerospace leadership.
