Microsoft Set to Report Modest Earnings Growth Despite Tough Comparisons and Sales Slowdown

Microsoft Corp. is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close of trading today. Analysts expect the tech giant to post modest profit and sales growth, even as the company faces tough prior-year comparisons and a broader slowdown in tech spending.

For the quarter ended in June, analysts forecast Microsoft to report earnings of $1.21 a share, up 9% from a year earlier, and revenue of $29.3 billion, up 12%, according to a consensus of analysts polled by FactSet. The results would mark a slower pace of growth compared with the same quarter a year ago.  

The quarterly results come amid caution around growth for cloud-computing and software stocks. Microsoft shares have risen roughly 15% this year, a more modest gain than in recent years, as investors have rotated into value and cyclical stocks that are poised to benefit more from an economic reopening. The shift in investor sentiment has weighed on fast-growing tech companies like Microsoft that fueled huge market gains in 2020.

Microsoft could see more muted sales growth due to tough comparisons with a year ago, when the pandemic led to a surge in demand for its products and services. The company is also facing slower demand for PCs and business software as economies reopen and consumers spend less time at home. However, Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, is likely to remain a bright spot. Analysts expect Azure sales grew 43% in the latest quarter.

The results will provide a window into how resilient Microsoft's growth has been during the economic reopening and recovery. Investors will be listening for management's comments on how sustainable demand has been and their outlook for the new fiscal year. Microsoft is rolling out several new products this year, including significant updates to its Windows, Office and Teams products, that analysts will be looking for more details on.

With tech sector growth slowing, investors will be focused on how companies like Microsoft that helped power huge market gains can now drive more modest—but still steady—growth in the months ahead. The results today could help provide some reassurance.
