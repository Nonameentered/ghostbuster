Sierra Semiconductor Corp. Soars on Plans to Exit Modem Business and Focus on Networking Equipment

Shares of Sierra Semiconductor Corp. jumped nearly 25% on Tuesday after the tech company announced plans to exit the modem business and instead focus on networking equipment. Sierra, a longtime leader in modems used in desktop and mobile devices, has been under pressure as the modem market has declined. 

The company will immediately start winding down its modem operations as early as the end of the first quarter, according to a statement. Sierra will take a $650 million charge related to exiting the business. However, the move is expected to help Sierra become profitable again as modem sales and revenue have slumped in recent years.

"Our modem business is not what it used to be, and the harsh reality is we can't continue to support a declining product segment," said Sierra CEO Michael Thompson. "We need to make this pivot now to a more promising area to secure Sierra's future."

That area is networking equipment, including Wi-Fi routers and switches used in home and office networks. Networking products now generate over 60% of Sierra's revenue, and the company believes the global networking equipment market has significant potential for long-term growth. 

Still, the move is not without risks. Sierra faces stiff competition in the networking market from well-established players like Cisco Systems Inc. and Arista Networks Inc. And while Sierra has experience building networking equipment, ramping up its focus in the segment will take time and resources.

However, analysts who follow Sierra welcomed the news and the company's renewed focus. "Exiting the modem business is absolutely the right move for the long-term health of Sierra Semiconductor," said Amit Mehra, a technology analyst at Morningstar Research. "Focusing investment on the higher-growth and higher-margin networking business will position the company for sustainable success."

Investors also expressed optimism, as Sierra's shares jumped 24.5% to close at $52.84. While Sierra lowers revenue projections by winding down modems, analysts expect improving profitability and the potential for solid growth in networking can continue to boost Sierra's share price over the next 12 to 18 months. The rally shows the market approves of Sierra clearing away old business lines in favor of more promising opportunities.
