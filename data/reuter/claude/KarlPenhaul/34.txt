Former General Who Led Colombia Supreme Court Assault Suggests Attack on Japanese Embassy Siege in Lima  

General Luis Mendieta, the former commander of Colombia's armed forces who led the disastrous 1985 assault on the Supreme Court building that resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people, has suggested that Peru use force to end the ongoing hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Lima.

In an interview on W Radio in Colombia, Gen. Mendieta said that Peru's government has shown "weakness" in dealing with the Maoist rebels who seized control of the embassy more than two weeks ago. "They have to act with force and recover control and sovereignty over their embassy," he said. "This has gone on too long and shows the rebels they can do whatever they want."

The rebels, known as the TÃºpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, are demanding the release of hundreds of imprisoned comrades in exchange for the 72 hostages they are holding, including the Japanese ambassador and a number of high-ranking Peruvian officials and diplomats. Peru's government has refused to give in to their demands and has surrounded and isolated the embassy. However, critics argue the standoff has devolved into a humiliating spectacle that is damaging the country's international reputation.

Gen. Mendieta's advice is controversial and polarizing. His botched raid on Colombia's Supreme Court building in 1985 to end a M-19 rebel siege led to the deaths of more than 100 people, including 11 of the 12 justices on the court. Most experts consider it one of the worst failures in special forces operations in Latin American history. However, some hardliners in Peru have echoed his calls for swift military action in the current crisis.   

The embassy standoff is the longest such hostage crisis in recent Latin American history and a major test for Peru's government. There are concerns the situation could degrade further if no solution is reached soon. However, storming the embassy by force also risks heavy loss of life, and Peru's security forces likely do not have the advanced counterterrorism skills necessary to pull off such an operation successfully based on the historic precedent. There are no easy answers in this complex and perilous crisis.
