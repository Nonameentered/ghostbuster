Car bomb kills one, injures 15 in Medellin, Colombia 

A powerful car bomb exploded outside a police station in Medellin, Colombia on Tuesday morning, killing one civilian and injuring 15 others. The blast occurred at 8:45 am local time, just as people were arriving to work in Colombia's second largest city.

The bomb was planted in a white sedan parked on the street outside the Police District 4 station, according to authorities. The blast shattered windows up to a block away and sent a plume of dark smoke rising above the city. Gunfire was also reported just after the explosion, leading to fears that armed assailants were also targeting the police station. 

"This was a cowardly act of terrorism that has no place in Colombia," said President Ivan Duque in a televised address. He pledged "the full strength of our military and police forces to bring these terrorists to justice."

The victim who died was a street vendor who was setting up his stall for the day just outside the blast radius. His body was found amidst wreckage strewn across the street. The 15 injured, including two police officers and a young child, were taken to local hospitals, some with severe wounds from the explosion.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing. However, suspicion immediately fell on leftist guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN) who regularly carry out attacks against police targets in Colombia. The ELN, along with the larger FARC militia, have been engaged in a decades-long insurgency against the Colombian government.  

The car bombing comes just two weeks before Colombia's presidential election and may rattle voters in a country weary of political violence. President Duque, who took office in 2018, has taken a hard line against guerrilla groups but has struggled to contain their influence in some parts of the country. Tuesday's attack shows that Medellin, which has enjoyed growing peace and prosperity in recent years, remains vulnerable to the shadowy forces that continue to fuel Colombia's conflict.
