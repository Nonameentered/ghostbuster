BP considers Colombian Piedemonte project "fundamental" despite drilling problems and contract wrangling

British oil giant BP plc said today its Piedemonte natural gas project in Colombia remains "fundamental" to the company's growth strategy, despite technical drilling difficulties and disputes with Colombian state-run partner Ecopetrol over costs and sharing of returns.

BP holds a majority 62 percent stake in Piedemonte and is the project operator. But in recent months, the drilling of several key exploration and appraisal wells has encountered technological setbacks, resulting in lower-than-expected results and costly drilling delays. At the same time, Ecopetrol, which holds the remaining 38 percent, has become more vocal in pushing back against BP's control and questioning drilling costs BP seeks to recoup. 

Speaking in London today at an investor conference, BP's head of exploration and production Bernard Looney called Piedemonte "a world-scale gas opportunity" that is pivotal to BP's broader business segments like its thermal electric power generation operations. Looney acknowledged the project has "faced some challenges" but said BP remained confident Piedemonet's potential and was working to resolve issues with its Ecopetrol partners.  

"Piedemonte is fundamental to our plans in Colombia and South America," Looney said. "We are overcoming obstacles and sticking to the task. We've faced technical hurdles before and prevailed, we will do so again here." He declined to specify the problems encountered but said additional investment may be needed to get drilling back on track.

Looney's comments come amid reports of tension with Ecopetrol over how much each side will pay to get the stalled drilling program moving again. Piedemonte was discovered in 2015 and initial estimates suggested it could produce as much as 790 billion cubic feet of natural gas, a boost to Colombia's domestic supply and a strategic win for BP's regional ambitions. But the envisioned two-year appraisal drilling program has dragged on longer and cost more than budgeted.
