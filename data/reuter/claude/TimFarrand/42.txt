Bass Plc chairman confident Carlsberg-Tetley acquisition will boost competition in UK beer market  

The chairman of Bass Plc, UK's largest brewing company, said today that the acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley will increase competition in the British beer market and benefit consumers. Bass announced yesterday that it has agreed to buy Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK subsidiary of Danish brewer Carlsberg, for £2.2 billion.  

"This acquisition will make Bass a stronger, more agile competitor, able to challenge major brands with greater choice, quality and pricing for customers," said Bass chairman Sir John Sunderland. "Scale and efficiency gains will also allow us to invest further in developing the beer brands and pub estate that British consumers love."

The deal will make Bass the clear market leader in the UK, with a 45% market share according to industry estimates. However, the merger is expected to draw close scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which regulates competition in the UK. Critics argue that reduced competition could lead to higher beer prices and less choice for consumers in the long run.

Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley combined will have over 20 popular beer brands, including Bass, Stella Artois, Boddingtons and Holsten Pils, as well as control of around 5,500 pubs across Britain. The companies said they aim to achieve cost savings of at least £150 million within three years of the deal closing. Carlsberg will retain a minority stake in the joint company and get two seats on the board.   

The deal represents an exit from the UK market for Carlsberg after years of battling for market share. The Danish company is refocusing on higher-growth markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. For Bass, the acquisition provides an opportunity to consolidate in its home market where the beer industry has struggled with declining consumption recently. The takeover is expected to complete in early 2020 subject to CMA approval.
