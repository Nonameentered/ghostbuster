Hambros Reports Return to Profit Amid Shareholder Calls for Breakup 

Hambros Bank reported its first annual profit in three years today as the British lender bounced back from the financial crisis. Net income reached £342 million in 2019, compared with a loss of £1.2 billion the previous year.

The profit was boosted by lower costs, reduced loan loss provisions and improving interest margins. Operating expenses declined 12% as Hambros cut more than 3,000 jobs over the past two years, closed underperforming branches and exited several overseas markets. Loan impairments dropped by two-thirds from 2018.  

"We have made excellent progress strengthening the core businesses, reducing costs and risks, and improving returns," said Chief Executive Mark Stephens. "While we still have more work to do, Hambros is in a much stronger position to support growth in the U.K. economy."

The results came as activist shareholder ValueAct called on Hambros to break itself up into separate retail, corporate and investment banking units to boost returns. In a letter to the board, ValueAct said splitting up could unlock up to £20 billion in shareholder value over the next few years. The San Francisco-based hedge fund owns a 3.4% stake in Hambros, making it the fourth-largest shareholder.

"Hambros remains too complex, too inefficient and too slow to adapt to changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape," ValueAct founder Jeff Ubben wrote. "By simplifying into more focused, independent operating companies, Hambros can reduce costs, improve accountability, tailor strategic plans and incentives, and optimally allocate capital."

Hambros Chairman Sir Philip Hampton rebuffed the proposal and said the board believes the bank is "stronger and better together." The revival of profits vindicates the bank's turnaround strategy and existing structure, he said. 

However, other investors voiced support for ValueAct's plan. "Breaking up Hambros into more manageable parts could drive better performance over the long run," said Michael Baxter, a fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management, which owns a 1.2% stake. "Complexity has been an anchor weighing down returns. Simpler structures may lead to higher valuations."

The debate sets up a potential clash at Hambros' annual meeting next month. ValueAct is seeking a board seat and aims to make its case directly to shareholders if talks with management stall. The showdown could determine the path forward for Britain's oldest bank as it emerges from its restructuring.
