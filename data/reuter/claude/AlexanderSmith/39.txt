Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans counter-claim in ING Barings lawsuit over alleged loan repayment  

Ron Baker, the former CEO of Barings Bank, announced today that he intends to file a counter-claim against ING Barings in response to their $50 million lawsuit alleging he failed to repay loans made to him during his time leading the British merchant bank.

ING Barings, the Dutch financial group that took over Barings after its collapse in 1995, filed a lawsuit in London's High Court last month seeking to recover $50 million in loans and interest charges from Baker. The suit claims Baker took out several personal loans between 1992 and 1995 that were never repaid, with interest charges accruing to over $50 million today. 

In a statement, Baker denied the allegations and said the loans in question were approved by the Barings board and backed by his shares in the bank. "These were not personal loans but corporate loans taken out legally and responsibly at the time based on the value of the Barings shares I held," Baker said. "I have records showing the loans were backed by more than sufficient collateral which ING now appears to have conveniently forgotten."

Baker claims ING's lawsuit is "malicious" and "unjustified". His lawyers are preparing a full counter-claim against ING to recover damages resulting from harm to his reputation. Baker believes ING deliberately mischaracterized the loans to make it appear he acted irresponsibly in the lead up to Barings' collapse. "They are trying to scapegoat me for the failure of Barings when the reality is very different," Baker said.

The 1995 failure of Barings nearly crippled ING after it acquired Barings earlier that year. An investigation found that Barings trader Nick Leeson accumulated huge losses that went undetected, ultimately leading to the bank's demise. ING was forced into a rescue by the Dutch central bank to prevent wider troubles. Baker claims ING has sought for years to blame him in order deflect from their own lack of oversight and failure to conduct proper due diligence.

The legal fight is the latest twist in the long saga of Barings' spectacular collapse more than 20 years ago. The case is shaping up to be a complex one, with many events from the time still disputed. Whatever the outcome, the lawsuit ensures that Ron Baker's controversial role in the Barings scandal will remain in the spotlight once again. Both sides seem prepared for a prolonged legal battle as the case makes its way to the London courts.
