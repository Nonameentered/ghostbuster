Revisions to Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa auction system await government approval, say donor sources and exporters  

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Proposed changes to Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa auction system aimed at increasing transparency and competitiveness are awaiting government approval, according to donor sources and exporters. 

The world's top cocoa producer reformed its coffee and cocoa sector in 2012 by introducing a new auction system to replace direct sales to exporters by farmers. The reforms aimed to boost prices paid to farmers by improving transparency and competition among buyers.

However, some exporters and donors say the current system needs improvement to increase transparency and address certain inefficiencies. Key changes proposed include eliminating a requirement for exporters to partner with local buying agents, streamlining the auction calendar, and improving systems for quality control and payment, according to interviews with donors and exporters. 

"The (proposed) reforms are very much focused on improving efficiency, transparency and making the system more competitive and fair," said a representative of a major donor involved in the Ivorian cocoa sector.

Sources said the recommendations were submitted to the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) - the sector regulator - by an independent consultancy firm. The CCC has reviewed and approved the recommendations, they said, but the changes still need final sign-off from the government.

"We are waiting for the implementation of the recommended reforms by the authorities," said the representative of a major export company. "Some small changes could make a big difference in efficiency and competitiveness."

A spokesman for the CCC said proposed revisions were still under review and would need government approval before implementation.

Under the current system, exporters are required to partner with a local buying agent to purchase beans at auction. The proposed changes call for exporters to be allowed to buy directly, which proponents say will boost competition.  

Calendar changes aim to hold more frequent but smaller auctions to make more beans available to small and medium-sized exporters. The quality control and payment proposals seek to speed up the testing and grading process and shorten the payment delay to farmers from the current average of two weeks.

Some leading cocoa exporters have voiced support for certain revisions but said radical changes to the current set-up were unnecessary and could disrupt the sector. They argue the system has largely achieved its initial goals of improving prices and governance.

"The objectives of setting up the auction system have been attained," said the director of a top-five exporting company. "We do not need a major overhaul of the system but rather small improvements to increase efficiency."

The CCC has not said when or if the proposed revisions might be submitted to the government for approval. Sources said any changes approved would likely not take effect until after the October-to-March main crop harvest begins.
