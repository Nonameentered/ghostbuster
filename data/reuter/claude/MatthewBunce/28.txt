Chad's Security Forces Engage in Public Executions through Instant Justice Decree 

N'Djamena, Chad - Chad's security forces have begun carrying out public executions of suspected criminals without trial under a new "instant justice" decree issued by the authoritarian government. Human rights groups are condemning the practice, calling it a flagrant violation of due process and human rights.

The public executions started this week, targeting suspected murderers, rapists and robbers who were apprehended by security forces. The suspects were executed by firing squad in city centers shortly after being detained, with no trial or judicial process. The government issued a decree authorizing the instant justice program, claiming it will "reduce crime by instilling fear in would-be criminals."

Amnesty International and other groups argue the policy promotes human rights abuses and undermines the rule of law in Chad. "Executing individuals without a fair trial is cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment that violates international law," said an Amnesty spokesperson. Chad is a party to international treaties that prohibit extrajudicial killings and protect individuals' rights to due process and fair trials.

The Chadian government, led by authoritarian president Idriss Déby for the past 30 years, is defending the controversial policy. A government spokesperson said the instant justice program shows "strong leadership" and will make citizens feel safer. Chad has struggled with crime, violence and terrorism in recent years due to instability in neighboring countries like Libya, Sudan and Central African Republic. 

However, legal experts argue that public executions without due process will not have a deterrent effect and will only lead to more abuse. "Summary and arbitrary executions undermine the rule of law and create a climate of fear," said a Chad-based human rights lawyer who requested anonymity due to fear of government reprisal. "Judicial process and fair trials are the only ethical way to curb crime."

There are concerns the government may expand the policy beyond suspected murderers and robbers to include political dissidents and opposition activists. President Déby has suppressed political opposition and free speech since taking power in a coup in 1990. Most opposition political parties are banned, and protests are often violently dispersed by security forces.
