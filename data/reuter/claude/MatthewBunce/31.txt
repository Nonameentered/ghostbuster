African Coffee Nations to Hold Talks with Vietnam Ahead of Emergency Meeting in Rio Janeiro on Robusta Output  

Major coffee-producing countries in Africa are scrambling to coordinate with Vietnam ahead of an emergency meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in Rio Janeiro next week. The meeting was called to address plummeting global prices of robusta coffee beans, which have declined more than 30% since the start of the year due to oversupply concerns.

Robusta coffee, which is primarily grown in Vietnam, Indonesia, and several African nations like Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire, is used by instant coffee makers and as a cheap alternative to higher-quality arabica beans. Vietnam is the world's largest robusta producer, accounting for about 40% of global supply. African nations represent over 15% of the market.  

Farming representatives from Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, and Cameron will travel to Vietnam this week to meet with government and industry officials. They hope to convince Vietnam to join them in proposing export limits or other mechanisms to shore up robusta prices at the Rio meeting. Vietnam has so far been noncommittal, as restricting supply goes against its long-term strategy to gain market share.

"All robusta-producing origins are under price pressure now so we have to work together to find a solution," said Alex Kwesiga, chairman of Uganda's Kibinge Coffee Farmers Association. "If Vietnam won't cooperate, any measures we take won't be effective."

Vietnam's coffee association has blamed speculators and traders for the recent price drop, not oversupply. However, most analysts point to Vietnam's soaring coffee yields and production over the last few years as the main factor behind robusta's slide.  

Delegates at the Rio meeting will debate several proposals to stabilize prices, including export caps, government stockpiling, and improving supply chain efficiency. If approved, any measures would take effect during the 2020/21 season. However, past efforts to curb coffee output have had limited success due to uneven compliance and enforcement. The ICO meeting ends October 18.
