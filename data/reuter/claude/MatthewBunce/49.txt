Ivory Coast to Only Market Midcrop Cocoa if Prices are Right, Says Commodities Minister

The Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, will only sell its smaller mid-crop harvest on global markets if current depressed cocoa prices rise to more favourable levels, the country's commodities minister said on Sunday. 

The West African nation's coffee and cocoa council, known as the CCC, and farmers have been holding back sales from the mid-crop harvest that started in April to wait for cocoa prices to recover after recent declines. 

Prices of cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate, have dropped 24% since the start of the year partly due to abundant supply. The decline has squeezed profit margins for cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast and neighbouring Ghana, the world's number two cocoa producer.

"If we see that the price does not move, we will not throw everything away carelessly because our cocoa is in stock," Ivory Coast Commodities Minister Jean-Louis Billon told a news conference. "We are waiting for the right time to sell when the price is good."

Billon did not specify what price level would trigger the resumption of mid-crop sales but said it needed to be "advantageous and favourable for producers". Farmers say prices of around $2,600 per tonne would be acceptable. 
Billon acknowledged some mid-crop cocoa had already been exported after private buyers purchased beans from independent farmers. But CCC stocks and those held by cooperatives have not been sold, he added.

Despite waiting for price improvements, Billon said Ivory Coast would ensure overall mid-crop volumes reach normal levels by the end of the season in June to meet contractual obligations with chocolate makers. The smaller mid-crop follows the October-March main crop.

For the 2019/2020 season, Ivory Coast aims to produce around 2 million tonnes of cocoa. Production usually slips in the second year of the country's two-year cycle but Billon said weather has been favourable and the drop may not be significant.
