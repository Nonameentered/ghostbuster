Ivory Coast's Cocoa Committee Discusses Quality and Marketing during Industry Reforms Review  

The Cocoa Committee of the Ivory Coast met this week to review progress on reforms designed to improve the quality and marketing of Ivorian cocoa. The committee meets twice a year to evaluate the national cocoa strategy and address challenges in the sector.

In recent years, the Ivorian government has undertaken major reforms to strengthen the cocoa industry, which accounts for 15% of the country's GDP and 40% of its export earnings. A key goal is increasing the quality and traceability of Ivorian cocoa to improve its premiums on world markets. The country produces around 40% of the world's cocoa but has struggled at times to consistently meet quality standards.

At the meeting, members discussed new programs to incentivize farmers to adopt better planting techniques, crop management, and bean fermentation practices. Thousands of farmers have received training and inputs to rehabilitate old orchards and plant higher-yielding, disease-resistant cocoa hybrids. The committee reviewed data showing these programs have led to improved bean quality and higher yields in some regions.

The committee also addressed ongoing investments to modernize the country's cocoa distribution and marketing systems. Last year, the government began renovating ports and roads to streamline transport of beans from farms to ports. The government is also backing a new cocoa exchange to facilitate transparent pricing and better link farmers to buyers. 

"Continuous progress has been made to strengthen quality, traceability, and marketing of Ivorian cocoa, but more work remains," said the committee chair, Lambert Kouassi. "We must continue investing in new farmer training programs and in infrastructure to cement the Ivory Coast's position as the leader in global cocoa production and export."

Despite some improvements, additional actions are still needed. The government hopes continuing reforms, especially around farmer education and modernization, will help Ivory Coast better control quality, improve cocoa sustainability, and drive further growth in the important cocoa industry.  The next review by the Cocoa Committee will take place in six months.
