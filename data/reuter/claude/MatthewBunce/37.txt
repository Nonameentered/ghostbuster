Gum Arabic Offers Drought-Stricken Chad’s Rural Poor a Lifeline to the World's Food and Beverage Giants 

The West African nation of Chad is in the grip of a devastating drought that has left over 2 million people facing severe hunger as crops fail. However, one native resource is providing a lifeline for some of Chad's poorest rural communities: gum arabic.

Gum arabic is a resin produced by two species of acacia trees that are native to the Sahel, the semi-arid region south of the Sahara desert that includes Chad. The trees exude the gum as a sticky sap that hardens into amber-colored lumps. For centuries, local harvesters in Chad have collected the lumps, cleaned and sorted them, then sold them to traders.

Today, gum arabic is a key ingredient for major food and beverage companies around the world. It is used as an emulsifier to prevent ingredients from separating in soft drinks, candy, bakery goods, and other processed foods. The largest buyers are Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which use gum arabic in popular soft drink brands like Coke, Sprite and Mountain Dew.

Demand for gum arabic has surged along with the growth of global food and beverage corporations. Chad exports over 80% of the world's supply of gum arabic, with annual exports now topping $400 million, making it the country's most valuable export commodity. For the 350,000 Chadians involved in harvesting and trading gum arabic, it has become a vital source of income and employment.

“Without gum arabic, many families in rural Chad would face starvation, especially during droughts and famines,” said Abakar Mahamat, Director of Chad's Gum Arabic Board, the government agency that regulates the sector. “It is crucial for poverty alleviation and economic growth in Chad.”

However, gum arabic harvesters and traders still struggle with unstable prices and work for little pay. Local harvesting communities receive only a tiny fraction of the final export price, the vast majority of which goes to foreign traders and brokers. Chad's government is working with international partners to improve price transparency and connect more harvesters directly with major buyers to increase their share of the profits.

“Chad's gum arabic sector has huge potential for growth if we can strengthen the value chain to benefit communities on the ground,” said Mahamat. “It can help transform lives by providing stable income and employment across many of our poorest rural areas.”

For now, with much of Chad's agriculture in collapse due to drought, gum arabic offers a lifeline for survival. Its harvest provides many of the country's most vulnerable people an opportunity to earn income to buy food when there is none to grow. While gum arabic will not solve Chad's wider problems of hunger and poverty, for the lucky few with access to the acacia trees, it continues to provide hope.
