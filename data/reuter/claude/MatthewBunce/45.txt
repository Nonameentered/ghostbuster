Europe's Cocoa Industry to Draft New Mega-Bulk Contract for Loose-Bean Shipment Techniques 

The European Cocoa Association (ECA) announced today that it will begin drafting a new standardized contract for the shipment of cocoa beans in mega-bulk volumes using specialized loose-bean carriers and handling techniques. The new contract aims to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the global cocoa supply chain.

Cocoa beans have traditionally been shipped in jute bags holding 60-70 kilograms of beans. However, as the global cocoa trade has grown over the past decade, some traders and shippers have started experimenting with loose-bean shipments using specially modified cargo ships and port facilities. By shipping beans in loose form, cargo capacity can increase by up to 40% compared to bagged beans. Handling loose beans also reduces costs related to packing, unpacking, and disposing of jute bags.

The ECA, which represents over 80% of Europe's cocoa grinders, sees significant benefits from transitioning its members to loose-bean shipments. "A standardized loose-bean contract will give our members the confidence to make major investments in loose-bean infrastructure while ensuring fair terms for both sellers and buyers," said ECA spokesman Jonas Wimmer. The new contract is expected to specify acceptable bean varieties and moisture levels for shipment, set guidelines for fumigation and other quality control measures, and establish liability terms in the event of crop damage or loss.

Not all cocoa traders are enthusiastic about the transition to mega-bulk, however. Some middlemen and cooperative exporters in developing countries worry they lack the resources to invest in new trucks, storage facilities, and machinery required for loose-bean handling. They also cite the risk of crop contamination and difficulties in maintaining traceability. The ECA has pledged to help address these concerns as part of the contract development process. 

The draft loose-bean contract is expected to be circulated for public comment next month and ratified by ECA members in early 2022. If broadly adopted, it could mark a turning point toward more efficient and cost-effective trade of one of the world's most important agricultural commodities. The cocoa sector has faced major challenges in recent years, including volatile prices, declining productivity, and economic hardship for smallholder farmers. Proponents hope the new loose-bean shipping model can help address these issues and ensure a more sustainable and equitable cocoa supply chain over the long term.
