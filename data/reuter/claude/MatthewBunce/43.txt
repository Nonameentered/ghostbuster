French Chocolate Giant Begins Expansion into Ivory Coast

The French chocolate maker Cantalou announced today plans to build a $27 million cocoa processing facility in the Ivory Coast, aiming to strengthen its grip on chocolate production from bean to bar. The new plant, to be located in the port city of San Pedro, will enable Cantalou to roast, grind, and process cocoa beans on location in the world's largest cocoa-producing country. 

Cantalou currently owns and operates cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast that produce nearly 200,000 tons of cocoa beans per year, about 8% of the country's total output. However, all beans are currently shipped raw to Cantalou's processing plants in France before being turned into chocolate and cocoa products. The new facility marks the company's first major move into processing cocoa at the source.

"This is a pivotal step for Cantalou as we deepen our investment in the Ivory Coast and gain more control over the early stages of chocolate production,” said Jean-Marc Duflot, Cantalou's CEO. “By processing beans locally, we will achieve substantial cost savings while strengthening partnerships with local farmers. This facility will also allow us to better support the economic development of cocoa-producing communities."

The new cocoa processing plant is slated to open by December 1998 and will employ up to 250 workers. Cantalou expects the facility to process over 50,000 tons of cocoa beans per year at full capacity, the majority of which will be sourced from Cantalou's own farms. However, Duflot noted the company will also buy beans from local independent farmers to support the broader Ivorian cocoa industry.

The move comes amid scrutiny over human rights and fair labor practices in West Africa's cocoa sector. Cantalou has faced criticism from activists over poverty wages and the use of child labor on some Ivorian cocoa farms. Duflot said the new facility incorporates initiatives to strengthen the company's "bean to bar" traceability and ensure fair wages and safe working conditions. But some activists argue more systemic reform across the chocolate industry is still needed.

Overall, the new processing plant positions Cantalou as a leader in streamlining chocolate production in a way that brings greater economic benefit to cocoa farmers, according to industry analysts. The expansion into cocoa processing marks a pivotal step forward for Cantalou, which generated over $4.5 billion in revenue last year and controls nearly 10% of the global chocolate market. The Ivory Coast facility is a sign of the company's growing ambition to dominate chocolate production from the field to the shelf.
