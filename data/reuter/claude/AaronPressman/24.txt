Federal Reserve Votes to Increase Bank Subsidiaries' Revenue Cap for Securities Underwriting

The Federal Reserve Board voted today to increase the cap on investment banking revenue that large bank holding companies can generate from underwriting and dealing in securities through their subsidiaries. The Fed raised the cap from 5% to 10% of a bank's total revenue, providing more flexibility for major Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.

The policy change marks a loosening of regulations put in place by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separated commercial and investment banking. The act was repealed in 1999, but the Fed kept some restrictions in place, including the 5% revenue cap instituted in 1986. Supporters argue that raising the cap will allow U.S. banks to better compete globally and provide more financing for corporations and municipalities. Critics counter that increased exposure to the risks of investment banking could threaten the stability of the banking system. 

"This modest adjustment to the policy will allow banking organizations to more effectively compete in the underwriting and dealing of corporate debt and municipal securities," said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles in a statement. The final rule was approved by a vote of 3 to 1, with Fed Governor Lael Brainard casting the lone dissenting vote.

In a statement, Brainard argued that the policy change was "premature" given that many of the post-financial crisis regulations have not yet been tested in an economic downturn. "Now is not the time to weaken strong safeguards that have created a safer and sounder financial system," Brainard said. The revenue cap increase will take effect in January 2020, giving banks additional time to adjust their business models and capital plans.

Consumer advocacy groups were strongly critical of the Fed's decision. "Raising the revenue cap on investment banking is unnecessary deregulation that puts Main Street at risk," said a spokesperson for the nonprofit Americans for Financial Reform. "Why roll back protections when banks are already making record profits?" The policy shift could face additional scrutiny from House Democrats, who have promised to conduct aggressive oversight of financial regulatory agencies.
