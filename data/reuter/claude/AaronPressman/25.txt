FCC proposes to cut $23 billion annual access fees for long-distance phone companies

The Federal Communications Commission voted Tuesday to cut access fees that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies like AT&T and Verizon by 33 percent. The proposal would reduce payments from long-distance companies by about $23 billion a year.

The fees, known as “access charges” or “long-distance rates,” are paid by long-distance carriers to local phone companies to connect calls across their networks. The current charges date back to the breakup of AT&T in 1984, when wireline phone service was a monopoly utility. But the telecom market has changed vastly with the rise of mobile and internet calling, eating into the revenue local phone companies collect. 

Under the proposal approved by the FCC, the fees would be reduced in two phases over six months, starting February 2021. In the first phase, access charges for smaller carriers would be lowered immediately from about 3 cents a minute to just under 2 cents a minute. For larger carriers like AT&T and Verizon, the cut would be to 2.63 cents a minute. In the second phase six months later, all access charges would go to a flat 2 cents a minute.

Consumer advocates argue the fees are outdated and unjustified in today’s competitive telecom market. But local phone companies and their unions argue lowering the fees would cost jobs and require raising residential phone rates. Some local carriers could lose over 10 percent of their annual revenue from the cuts.  

The charges have been a source of controversy for years. Long distance companies like Sprint argue the fees far exceed the cost of connecting calls and amount to a subsidy for the local phone companies. But local carriers counter that the fees help fund networks and services in rural and high-cost areas. The current fees generate $23 billion a year, revenue that would be hard to replace.

In an era where most calls are now made on mobile phones or over the internet, the FCC argues lowering the legacy fees could help reduce consumer bills and encourage innovation. But some critics worry the cuts may undermine small carriers in rural areas that rely more heavily on the fees. The proposal will now go through public comment before being finalized. The outcome could have major implications for consumers and companies across the telecom industry.
