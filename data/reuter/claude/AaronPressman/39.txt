US Financial Services Industry Debates Bank Reform Proposals, Including Mixing of Commerce and Banking  

The US Congress is considering various proposals for reforming and restructuring the financial services industry, including controversial plans to allow mixing of banking and commerce. The proposed reforms come in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that led to taxpayer bailouts of major Wall Street banks.  

One proposal would relax long-standing restrictions on commercial companies owning banking operations. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 established the separation of banking and commerce, with commercial companies barred from owning banks and engaging in investing and other banking activities. Repealing parts of Glass-Steagall has been proposed to promote competition in the banking industry. However, critics argue it could lead to risks from large commercial firms influencing lending practices and gaining too much control over private financial data and transactions.

Another proposal would limit the size and complexity of the largest US banks. Some lawmakers argue banks deemed "too big to fail" could pose risks to the financial system, with their potential failure requiring government intervention and bailouts. Legislation introduced in the House would cap banks' total assets and prohibited activities to make them less complex and risky. The banking industry has pushed back, arguing larger banks achieve economies of scale, can serve global corporations, and restrictions could put the US at a competitive disadvantage. 

Consumer groups have backed the establishment of a new consumer financial protection agency to prevent predatory lending and risky products that contributed to the mortgage crisis. The banking industry opposes a separate agency and argues existing regulators adequately monitor consumer protections. 

The debate in Congress comes as the Trump administration has supported deregulating the banking industry. But with moderate Democrats controlling the House, any legislation faces challenges to passing both chambers. Comprehensive bank reform could stall as a result, leading instead to incremental changes through regulatory agencies.

The proposals represent the most ambitious efforts at reforming banking rules since the 2010 Dodd-Frank law tightening oversight of Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Passage of any reforms would mark a significant revamp of banking regulations that have shaped the industry for decades. But with competing views on how to balance limiting risk while promoting market competition, consensus on broad changes remains elusive.
