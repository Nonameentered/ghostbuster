Federal Reserve Chairman Urges Congress to Modernize Financial Laws while Maintaining Oversight to Prevent Catastrophe 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged Congress today to update and modernize laws that regulate the nation's financial system, while ensuring these laws continue to prevent systemic risks that could lead to economic catastrophe.

In prepared remarks before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell warned that the current regulatory framework, much of which was put in place following the 2008 financial crisis, risks becoming outdated as the financial system continues to evolve with advancing technology and growing complexity. 

"The financial system today looks quite different from what it was at the time of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago," Powell said. "Regulations put in place then have strengthened the financial system and supported the long expansion, but time has also revealed areas where rules could be simplified and modernized."

Powell specifically called on Congress to make targeted adjustments to post-crisis laws such as the Dodd-Frank Act, including simplifying certain sections like the Volcker Rule that limits banks' speculative trading. However, he emphasized that any changes must preserve key protections and not scale back oversight so much that regulators lose visibility into risks.

"It is important that we not weaken the safeguards that have made the system more resilient," Powell warned. "There is no reason to rollback oversight or transparency in areas that played a role in the crisis."

The Fed chairman noted that one of the key lessons of the financial crisis was that the build-up of vulnerabilities in the system often happens over years in plain sight. Close supervision and regulation are still required to adequately monitor large financial institutions and ensure emerging risks are detected early.

Powell's testimony comes as policymakers remain at odds over how much leeway to provide to Wall Street. While the Trump administration has pushed for wide-ranging deregulation across the financial sector, many Democratic lawmakers argue that weakening rules could again put consumers and taxpayers at risk.  

Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said today that he agreed with the need for "smart, tailored improvements" to financial laws but would oppose wholesale rewrites. "The financial system is stronger when we have more capital, less leverage, more transparency and more accountability," Brown said.

The balancing act facing lawmakers and regulators is to revise laws and oversight for a world of fast-changing technology while safeguarding against risks that may be unique to innovations like cryptocurrencies, automated trading systems, and other financial technologies that did not exist in the last crisis, Powell noted.

"Change is coming to the financial system," he said. "Our job is to ensure that innovation benefits society broadly." Overall, Powell said, the Fed is encouraged by policymakers' interest in improving the financial regulatory framework, but it must remain focused on stability and protecting taxpayers from future bailouts. The work ahead involves "not who gets what from regulation but how we can improve regulation and supervision to strengthen the financial system for the benefit of all Americans."
