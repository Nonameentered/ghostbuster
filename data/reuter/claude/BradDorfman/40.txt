Caterpillar CFO Defends Increase in Inventory Levels, Plans to Boost R&D Spending

Caterpillar Inc. saw inventory levels rise in the fourth quarter of last year, leading some analysts to question if the company is gearing up for a downturn in sales. However, CFO Andrew Bonfield defended the increase in inventory as a strategic move to improve product availability and customer service. He also outlined plans to boost research and development spending in 2019 to spur future growth.

In an interview, Bonfield said Caterpillar built up inventories of certain construction equipment and engines in the fourth quarter to improve delivery times for customers. “We want to get products to customers more quickly, especially for our smaller equipment and engines,” Bonfield said. The strategy aims to capture more sales from customers wanting fast delivery and service. The higher inventories contributed to a rise in Caterpillar's operating costs in the fourth quarter.

However, some analysts worry the inventory buildup signals Caterpillar is bracing for weaker demand and sales this year. "Increases in inventory often precede a downturn as companies look to buffer a drop in orders," said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones. But Bonfield disputed that view, saying, "Our inventories remain well-aligned to meet demand we see from customers in our end markets."

Bonfield also outlined plans to increase research and development spending by about 15 percent in 2019 to $2.7 billion. The additional R&D investments will focus on autonomous vehicle technology, hybrid power systems, battery technology and other green technologies. "While the demand environment remains positive, we are not sitting still waiting for growth to happen," Bonfield said. "We are investing in innovation to drive future growth."  

The CFO said Caterpillar continues to see strong order activity in most markets, especially construction in North America and infrastructure building in China. However, the company expects some moderation in sales growth this year from the blistering 24 percent increase in revenue and 58 percent rise in profit Caterpillar reported for 2018. “While 2018 was an exceptional year, we are planning for more normal growth in 2019,” Bonfield said.
