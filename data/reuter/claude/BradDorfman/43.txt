Sears sees 24.6% increase in Q4 earnings fueled by strong Christmas sales 

Sears Holdings Corp. reported a surge in fourth quarter earnings today, fueled by strong sales over the holiday shopping season. The retailer saw net income rise 24.6% to $182 million, or $1.70 per share, handily beating Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose 2.8% to $15.1 billion in the quarter ending January 28.  

Same-store sales, a key measure of a retailer's health, rose 3.8% at Sears stores and 4.2% at Kmart stores, also topping estimates. The results provide more evidence that Sears' turnaround efforts under CEO Eddie Lampert are gaining traction. Sears has been revamping its product lineup, improving customer service, updating stores, and making big investments in its online platforms.

"We delivered a solid performance this quarter with same-store sales growth across categories at both Sears and Kmart and continued profit improvement," said Mr. Lampert. "We are making progress in our transformation to a member-centric integrated retailer leveraging our Shop Your Way platform."

Sales of home appliances, apparel, footwear and jewelry were strong during the quarter. Sales of fitness equipment, snow throwers, and video game hardware also rose. The company cited its flexible return, delivery and installation policies around the holidays as factors that drew in more customers. 

Sears' vast real estate portfolio has long been seen as a boon for the company if it could unlock the value through sales and partnerships. Last year, Sears completed several real estate deals and joint ventures that analysts estimate could generate hundreds of millions in revenue. Mr. Lampert said the company continues to explore more real estate transactions to further boost Sears' financial position.

Sears' shares were up 12% in after-hours trading following the earnings report. The stock has surged 63% over the past 12 months. At least one analyst upgraded the stock and raised their price target, citing the turnaround momentum.

However, others remain skeptical about Sears' long-term prospects in a retail environment dominated by e-commerce giants like Amazon and big box stores like Walmart. Sears still faces declining foot traffic in stores, a bloated cost structure, and a poorly optimized collection of brands according to critics. But if Sears can string together more quarters of rising same-store sales while continuing real estate deals, more analysts and investors may come around to Mr. Lampert's vision for reviving this iconic retailer.
