Caterpillar Inc Forecasts Conservative Profits for 1997 Despite Record Earnings in 1996 

Caterpillar Inc, the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, announced today that it expects profits to decline in 1997 despite posting record earnings in 1996. Caterpillar reported 1996 profits of $1.6 billion, a 34% increase from 1995, on the back of strong sales growth in North America and Asia. However, the company forecast that profits for 1997 would be 5-10% lower due to slowing economic growth and lower demand for equipment, especially in developing markets.

"While we delivered excellent results in 1996, we are anticipating some headwinds in 1997 that will put pressure on sales and profits," said Glen Barton, Caterpillar's Chairman and CEO. "Economic growth is slowing in parts of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and capital spending by mining companies continues to be constrained. Although we expect reasonable growth in North America, it will not be enough to offset challenges in other regions."

Caterpillar derives nearly half its sales from overseas markets, with China, Brazil and Indonesia being major sources of growth in recent years. A slowdown in infrastructure and construction projects in those countries is expected to weigh on Caterpillar's performance. Sales of mining equipment, which account for 30% of total revenues, are also projected to drop due to weak commodities prices and cost-cutting by mining firms.  

However, Caterpillar's outlook for North America remains upbeat due to strong economic fundamentals, increasing equipment replacement demand and robust housing starts. Sales in Europe are also expected to grow at a steady pace. Caterpillar hopes that interest rate cuts by central banks in Asia and Latin America, as well as a recovery in commodities prices, may help stimulate demand later in the year. But for now, the company is taking a cautious stance and forecasting a downward trend in key metrics for 1997.

Caterpillar's share price declined 3% on the news, reflecting investors' disappointment with the company's outlook for lower profits despite its outstanding performance in 2016 when Caterpillar generated the highest revenues and earnings in its 91-year history. The forecast for declining sales and profits in 1997 marks a reversal of fortunes for the heavy equipment maker after several years of surging growth. Overall, though, analysts still see Caterpillar as well-positioned for long term success, especially if the global economy regains momentum.
