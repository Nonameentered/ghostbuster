First Chicago NBD Corp CEO Expects Job Cuts in Corporate Banking Unit as Bank Attempts Turnaround

The chief executive officer of First Chicago NBD Corp., the largest regional banking firm headquartered in the Midwest, said he expects layoffs within the company’s corporate and institutional banking units as it tries to cut costs and turn around declining profits.

In an interview, Keith Steiner said First Chicago NBD plans to reduce expenses in the second half of this year, primarily by eliminating jobs in its wholesale and institutional banking businesses. The company hopes to reduce costs in those divisions by at least 10 percent, which would likely mean job losses for hundreds of employees, Mr. Steiner said.

"We have to make some tough decisions to get this company back to healthy profitability levels, and that unfortunately means reducing our workforce in some areas of the bank," Mr. Steiner said. The cuts are aimed at “streamlining and simplifying some of our corporate support and technology functions as well as some front-line roles in institutional banking,” he said.

First Chicago NBD, like many regional banks, has struggled in recent years with weak loan demand and narrowing profit margins. Its profits have declined for four straight quarters, and its stock price is off nearly 30 percent over the past year. Mr. Steiner was promoted to CEO in March with a mandate to turn around the company's performance.

The planned job cuts and other cost reductions are part of Mr. Steiner's strategy to improve First Chicago NBD's financial results over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition to reducing expenses, he aims to boost profitability by focusing the bank's efforts on middle-market commercial lending, as well as consumer areas like mortgage refinancing and wealth management where demand remains strong.  

First Chicago NBD employs around 4,500 people across 250 branches. The bulk of the planned cuts, Mr. Steiner said, will come from the roughly 1,000 employees in the corporate and institutional banking divisions. he acknowledged that reducing the headcount will be difficult but said, “We owe it to our shareholders and customers to make sure this institution is operating as efficiently as possible.”  

Some analysts were encouraged by Mr. Steiner's comments, noting that significant cost-cutting is long overdue at First Chicago NBD. “Reducing expenses has to be a top priority,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Andrew Forman. However, others warned that cutting too deeply into corporate banking staff could hurt the bank's relationships with commercial clients and and revenue over the long run. The planned cuts highlight the "depth of the challenges" still facing First Chicago NBD, said Guggenheim Securities analyst Marty Mosby.
