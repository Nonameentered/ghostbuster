Economists Predict Steady Growth and Stable Car Sales for 1997

Leading economists expect the U.S. economy to continue steady growth in 1997, resulting in stable new vehicle sales for the year. Recovery from the recession of the early 1990s is now well entrenched and economic indicators point to continued economic expansion for at least the next year.

"Barring any major shocks to the system, we see no reason why the current economic expansion and vehicle sales growth should not continue at a sustainable pace over the coming year," said David Jones, chief economist at ABC Bank.

The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5% in 1996 and most forecasts call for 2-3% GDP growth again in 1997. Jobs are also being added at a rate of over 200,000 per month, further fueling consumer spending. Low interest rates are also contributing to economic optimism, as the Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates on hold for the foreseeable future. 

Stable economic growth is good news for the U.S. auto industry, which had its best sales year in a decade in 1996. Car and light truck sales totaled 15.9 million units last year, and the major automakers expect total vehicle demand to hold at around 16 million units again in 1997. With no recession in sight, consumers are willing to spend on big-ticket items like new vehicles. 

"Our sales projections for 1997 remain upbeat, as a solid economy, job security, low interest rates and high consumer confidence all suggest new vehicle demand should continue near the record levels of last year," said executive vice president of XYZ Motors. 

However, there are risks to the outlook according to economists. If interest rates spike suddenly, it could dampen economic growth and consumer demand. Political turmoil or events like an oil crisis could also shock the system. But barring any major disruptions, most economists expect at least another year of stable growth, job gains, and strong vehicle sales in 1997. Overall, the U.S. economy appears poised to continue its steady, sustainable expansion over the coming year.
