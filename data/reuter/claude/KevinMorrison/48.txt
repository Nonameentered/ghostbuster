Standard Chartered CEO expects more strategic alliances in Asia with US and European banks

The chief executive of London-based Standard Chartered Bank, Bill Winters, said this week that he expects to see more strategic alliances formed between major banks from the US and Europe with banks in Asia. Speaking at a banking industry conference in Singapore, Winters said that as Asian  economies continue to grow faster than Western economies, large US and European banks will seek partnerships and potential acquisitions with Asian banks to gain a foothold in the region.  

"The center of gravity for global trade and investment is shifting rapidly to Asia, and no global bank can effectively serve customers without a meaningful presence across Asia, especially in China and India," Winters said in his speech. He noted that over the next decade, nearly half of all global economic growth is projected to come from Asia. 

Strategic alliances, joint ventures, and partial acquisitions of Asian banks have accelerated in recent years. For example, Citibank launched a strategic alliance with DBS Bank of Singapore in 2019 to provide Citi's US clients access to DBS's Asia network. The Canadian bank RBC Royal Bank entered a joint venture with Kotak Mahindra Bank in 2020 to expand in India. Dutch bank ING partnered with Bank of Beijing last year to strengthen its business in China.

However, Winters said full acquisitions of Asian banks by Western banks have been scarce due to the complex process of obtaining regulatory approvals in Asia. There are also challenges in merging the technology systems and company cultures. He expects joint ventures and minority stakes to be more common approaches for US and European banks expanding in Asia.

Winters acknowledged that Asian banks, especially in China and India, are also expanding globally through strategic alliances and acquisitions. China's biggest banks like ICBC and China Construction Bank have partnered with banks in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Indian banks are also accelerating their international expansion through alliances and acquisitions, he noted. 

In summary, Winters predicted that cross-border alliances between Western banks and Asian banks will accelerate on both sides in the coming years. These partnerships will enable the banks to gain valuable market access, better serve corporate clients operating globally, and fend off competition from technology companies moving into financial services. Strategic alliances may be the smartest path forward for global expansion, he concluded.
