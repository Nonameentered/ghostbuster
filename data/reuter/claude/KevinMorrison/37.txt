Sydney Harbour Casino CEO Remains Hopeful for Tax Concessions on Earnings from Foreign High-Rollers

The CEO of Sydney Harbour Casino operator Trophy Entertainment, Lachlan Thompson, told investors today that he remains hopeful the Australian government will provide tax concessions on the casino's earnings from high-rolling foreign gamblers. Despite there being no movement on the tax proposals in the recently released federal budget, Thompson said discussions with the government are ongoing. 

Thompson has long argued that Australia's relatively high tax rates on casino gambling put Sydney Harbour Casino at a competitive disadvantage compared to casinos in Macau and Singapore, which have significantly lower taxes. The CEO claims that with more favorable tax treatment, Sydney Harbour Casino could attract many more wealthy gamblers from China and other parts of Asia, boosting tourism and tax revenues in the process.

However, the proposal has been controversial, with critics arguing it will mainly benefit the large casino and gaming corporations. Anti-gambling groups have also voiced concerns that lower taxes may worsen problem gambling by making it cheaper for people to gamble large amounts, especially on the casino's VIP poker machines. 

Under current tax rules, Sydney Harbour Casino pays tax of 25% on earnings from high-rolling foreign gamblers. In contrast, the headline tax rate for VIP casinos in Macau is just 15%. Thompson wants the government to reduce the tax on foreign high-roller winnings at Sydney Harbour Casino to 15 to 20%, in line with competing destinations in Asia. He estimates this could help boost the casino's annual VIP revenue by 20 to 30% from current levels.

The casino's reliance on VIP gamblers, especially from China, has increased in recent years. Nearly 45% of the casino's total revenue now comes from VIP gaming rooms and overseas junkets compared to 30% five years ago. Revenue from normal recreational gamblers and slot machines has remained flat over the same period. This has strengthened the company's case for tax relief on its VIP earnings, which it claims is crucial for future growth and job creation.

However, others argue tax cuts are not necessary for the casino to be profitable and point out that Trophy Entertainment remains highly profitable, earning over $500 million in net profit last year. Critics also say lower taxes may mainly benefit the casino's wealthy foreign owners and shareholders rather than the local community. The issue is shaping up as a debate around balancing private profits versus returns for taxpayers.

Thompson said while he was disappointed tax concessions did not make it into this year's budget, the casino will continue to make a “very strong case” to bring Australia's casino taxes in line with key Asian competitors such as Macau and Singapore. The government insists "no decision has been made" on the casino's demands but observers say the casinos are influential lobby groups that often get their way. The debate around this issue is likely to continue in coming months.
