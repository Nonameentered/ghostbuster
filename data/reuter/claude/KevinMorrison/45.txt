Corporate Australia Set to Quench Thirst for Takeovers in 1997 with Banks, Media and Resources in Focus 

The Australian corporate sector is gearing up for an intense year of mergers and acquisitions in 1997, with activity expected to be concentrated in the banking, media, and natural resources sectors. Analysts forecast a wave of consolidations as companies look to gain scale, cut costs, and leverage synergies in an increasingly globalized business environment.  

The banking industry is primed for a shake-up, with the “Big Four” banks—ANZ, Commonwealth, National Australia Bank, and Westpac—all signaling an appetite for acquisitions. The banks are under pressure to achieve cost savings and economies of scale as technological changes intensify competition. ANZ and National Australia have been rumored as potential suitors for regional banks like Bendigo and Adelaide Bank or Suncorp. A mega-merger between two of the Big Four could also be on the cards.

Australia’s media industry faces increasing concentration of ownership, with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation the key player. News Corp has been ramping up its presence in pay TV, publishing, and online services. Its tentacles now spread from newspapers to book publishing, movies, and sports rights. Competitors like Kerry Packer’s Consolidated Press Holdings and Fairfax will be looking to match News Corp’s scale through strategic acquisitions and alliances in 1997. 

In the resources sector, BHP and Rio Tinto remain the dominant players and are likely to drive further consolidation. BHP is in pole position after its merger with Billiton in 2001. BHP may look to bolster its presence in bulk commodities like iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper through acquisitions. Rio Tinto is also on the prowl, with ambitions to strengthen its aluminum and diamond mining operations. Mid-tier resource companies are meanwhile bracing for the possibility of unwanted takeover bids from cashed-up global players.

Investment bankers expect a surge in deal volumes as large corporates gain confidence from a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, with steady growth and low interest rates. The takeovers will be fueled by strong balance sheets, abundant cash reserves, and a rallying stock market. Shareholders, super funds and financial institutions are also hungry for the cost savings, increased market power, and improved share prices that consolidation often delivers.  

Overall, 1997 is shaping up as a pivotal year for corporate maneuvering that will reshape Australia’s business landscape for decades to come. A wave of mega-mergers—should they transpire—may raise concerns over reduced competition in banking and the media. However, the upside could be increased power to tackle international expansion and the economies of scale required to drive innovation. The battle for corporate control will be fierce, and Australia’s boardrooms are bracing for a year of high-stakes dealmaking.
