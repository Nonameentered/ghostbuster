Placer Dome Inc acquires control of giant PNG gold mine in deal with Highlands Gold Ltd

Placer Dome Inc, one of the world's largest gold mining companies, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from Australia-based Highlands Gold Ltd. Under the terms of the deal, Placer Dome will purchase a 70% interest in the Porgera mine for $825 million in cash.  

The Porgera gold mine is one of the largest gold mines in PNG and has been producing gold since 1990. The mine is located at an altitude of 2,500-3,000 meters in the Porgera Valley of Enga Province. It produces over 600,000 ounces of gold per year, making it a very significant operation for Placer Dome.

“The acquisition of control in the Porgera mine is aligned with our strategy of acquiring and operating long-life, low-cost assets,” said John Dow, President and CEO of Placer Dome. “Porgera is a top-tier gold asset that expands our presence in a region where we have operated successfully for over 20 years.”

Highlands Gold has held a controlling 75% stake in Porgera for the last seven years but has struggled to fund further exploration and expansion activities. Selling majority control to Placer Dome will allow Highlands to pay down debt and focus on its operations in Australia. Highlands will retain a 25% non-operating minority stake in Porgera going forward.

The deal is expected to close within 3 to 6 months, subject to regulatory approvals and consent from joint venture partners. Placer Dome expects to fund the acquisition from its existing cash balances and credit facilities. The company says that it does not anticipate any significant impact on its dividend policy from the purchase.

The Porgera mine adds to Placer Dome's substantial gold mining operations in Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru. The Vancouver-based company is the world's fifth largest gold producer with annual production of over 3.3 million ounces. Shares in Placer Dome rose 2.4% on news of the acquisition, while Highlands Gold stock was up over 8% in early trading.
