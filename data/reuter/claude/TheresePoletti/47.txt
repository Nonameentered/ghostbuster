News Corp. Set to Launch Revamped Entertainment Website Focused on TV Guide  

News Corp. announced today plans to launch a redesigned entertainment website and mobile app focused on its TV Guide brand. The new TVGuide.com and associated apps will provide comprehensive TV listings, streaming recommendations, and other entertainment-related content. The revamped offerings are set to debut later this month.

For the past several years, TVGuide.com has struggled with declining traffic and revenue amid competition from streaming platforms and other entertainment websites. News Corp. is hoping a fresh redesign and tighter integration with streaming data and recommendations will revive interest in the once-dominant TV listings platform. 

“TV Guide has been an iconic brand for decades, and we believe it has the potential to once again become the premier destination for viewers navigating the increasingly complex TV landscape,” said News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson. “The new TVGuide.com and our forthcoming apps will harness advanced data and personalization to provide customized streaming recommendations and a comprehensive view of what's available across broadcast, cable, and streaming.”

The updated TVGuide.com will continue to offer traditional TV listings, but the site and apps will now also incorporate data from more than 200 streaming services to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual viewers’ tastes and interests. The site will also feature news coverage of the entertainment industry, reviews, trailers, and other complementary content.

The revamp of TV Guide comes as News Corp. has been overhauling many of its media properties to adapt to changes in how people consume news and entertainment. The company has invested heavily in its streaming platforms and online properties as print publications and broadcast media continue to face headwinds. 

News Corp. acquired TV Guide in 1988 for $3 billion but has struggled at times to adapt the brand to changes in media technology and viewing habits. The company hopes its latest effort can recapture TV Guide’s role as a leading source of TV discovery and rediscover its value in the streaming era. The redesigned TVGuide.com is set to launch on October 22, with new apps for iOS and Android following shortly thereafter.
