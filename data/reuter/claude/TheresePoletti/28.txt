IBM shares reach historic highs, with analysts predicting further gains 

Shares of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) reached an all-time high today, closing at $143.12 per share. The stock has gained nearly 30% over the past 12 months, significantly outpacing the broader technology sector and overall stock market. Several analysts raised their price targets for IBM today, predicting the stock has further room to run.

IBM's share price milestone comes as the company continues to shift its focus to higher-growth areas such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. IBM's cloud and cognitive software segment, which includes offerings like Watson AI, has been the fastest growing part of its business. Revenue from this segment grew 15% in IBM's most recent quarter. Meanwhile, the company has divested some of its legacy businesses, recently selling seven software brands to India's HCL Technologies for $1.8 billion.

"IBM has successfully reinvented itself for the cloud and AI era," said Tim Horton, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar. "Its strategic imperatives revenue now represents over half of its total sales, up from just 25% five years ago. As these faster-growing, higher-margin businesses continue to make up more of the revenue mix, IBM's earnings and cash flows should strengthen over time." Morningstar raised its fair value estimate for IBM shares from $140 to $160 today.

However, some analysts remain skeptical about IBM's ability to sustain its recent stock momentum. "While IBM is making progress in some of its strategic focus areas, overall revenue growth remains sluggish," said Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research. "IBM faces significant competition in cloud, AI and other areas. To maintain its stock price at these levels, IBM will need to show that its new businesses can significantly offset declines in its legacy operations." Lopez maintained a "neutral" rating on IBM shares.

With its shares hitting an all-time high, IBM now has a market capitalization of $128 billion. While shares may be due for a pause in the near term, most analysts agree that if IBM can continue to increase sales of its strategic imperatives, the company will likely remain on an upward trajectory over the long run. For investors, IBM appears poised to generate solid returns for many years to come.
