IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Warns of Potential Backlash Against Internet

Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman and chief executive of IBM, warned technology executives today that the Internet could face a consumer and regulatory backlash if companies fail to set standards regarding privacy, security, and content. 

Speaking at an industry conference, Mr. Gerstner said the open and lightly regulated nature of the Internet was central to its rapid growth. But he said the downsides of the Internet, including the threat of online fraud, invasion of privacy, and availability of offensive content, pose risks that could stall further development if left unaddressed.

"The Internet cannot reach its full potential as a trusted medium for communication and commerce if we fail to set and enforce standards," Mr. Gerstner said. He called on technology companies, consumers, and governments to work together to establish guidelines to "balance openness and oversight."

Mr. Gerstner's warnings come as policy makers around the world are grappling with how best to regulate technology companies and set rules for digital platforms. In the United States, the federal government and state attorneys general have opened investigations into major tech companies like Google and Facebook over potential antitrust violations and issues like the spread of misinformation. The European Union has set a global standard for data privacy with its General Data Protection Regulation.

If the key players in technology fail to self-impose standards and best practices, Mr. Gerstner said, government intervention is inevitable. But he said government policies must be narrowly tailored and flexible enough to adapt to rapid changes in technology. "Overly restrictive or ill-targeted policies could significantly and unnecessarily restrain progress," he said. 

Mr. Gerstner said IBM had a role to play as a leading enterprise company, but that cooperation across the technology sector would be required to address challenges like data privacy, online fraud, and content issues. "Leadership and collective action by all parties -- companies, consumers and governments -- will determine whether the next phase of the Internet's development fulfills its tremendous promise," he said. Overall, Mr. Gerstner expressed optimism that policy makers and tech companies could work together to enable continued innovation while putting guardrails in place.
