US Computer Retailers Report Sluggish Start to Holiday Season with Weak November Sales 

Major US computer and electronics retailers reported lackluster sales for the start of the critical holiday shopping season in November. The weak results suggest consumers may be tightening their belts this year and spending less on gadgets and tech gifts.

Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, said its sales fell about 1 percent in November compared to the same month last year. The muted results came despite heavy promotions and discounts on products like laptops, tablets, and 4K TVs during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Best Buy's online sales also declined by a few percentage points as shoppers browsed on the web but did not necessarily translate that into purchases.  

"There's no doubt that November was softer than we would have liked," Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said in a statement. "As we look ahead to the December holiday weeks, we remain very focused on exciting customers with an unmatched selection of holiday gifts at great prices."

Other major chains also reported lackluster November numbers. Computer maker HP Inc. said sales of personal computers and printers fell 3 percent last month. Dell Technologies likewise saw a "mid-single digit" percentage decline in sales of desktop and laptop computers. 

Retail experts said the weak start to the holiday season reflects growing economic uncertainty that is prompting shoppers to be more cautious about spending. The US economy expanded at a slower pace in the third quarter, and ongoing trade tensions with China have clouded the outlook.

"Consumers seem to be entering the holiday season with a wary eye and a conservative lean to their shopping habits," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. "Retailers will have to work hard to gain shoppers' interest and inspire them to open their wallets."

To attract more customers in December, Best Buy and other chains plan to roll out further discounts and promotions in the coming weeks. Best Buy will expand its price-matching policy and offer free next-day delivery on thousands of items until Christmas Eve. Dell and HP will also likely run aggressive marketing campaigns to boost sales of computers and other tech gear. 

However, some analysts warn that heavy discounting may pressure profit margins for retailers without necessarily driving a major rebound in demand. "Retailers are stuck between a rock and a hard place," said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics. "They have to remain promotional to drive any traffic but margins will suffer as a result."

With 2019 coming to an end, the next month will be crucial in determining whether the US consumer technology sector can achieve modest growth for the full year or remain in a slump. Retailers are counting on Americans to again spend generously on tech gifts during the holidays, but that may depend on an economy that so far has shown tentative signs of steadying but not strengthening.
