Push Technology Takes Center Stage at Internet Show, But a Shakeout is on the Horizon 

LAS VEGAS—At this year’s Internet World trade show, push technology was the hottest topic, with dozens of companies promoting tools for delivering a constant stream of news and information to web users. However, behind the hype, a shakeout seems inevitable in this increasingly crowded market.

Push software automatically delivers content to users without them explicitly requesting it. The technology took off last year with the launch of Pointcast, which now delivers news, sports scores, and stock quotes to over 2 million users. At the show, companies like Marimba, BackWeb, and Intermind were touting similar products to help websites push content to users.

The appeal to users is convenience—the information comes to them automatically without having to search for it. The appeal to websites is increased traffic and stickiness. Once users have push software installed, they have an incentive to return frequently to a site.

Despite the buzz, push faces serious hurdles to mainstream success. First, network bandwidth constraints limit how much data most people can receive in the background. Second, security and privacy concerns persist about unwanted or unsolicited content being delivered to users. Finally, with so many companies in the market, there is likely to be a shakeout through mergers, acquisitions or failures.

“The push model really resonates with users and has enormous potential, but we’re still in the very early days,” said Mike McCamon, CEO of Infobahn, a push technology company. “Over the next year, we’ll see consolidation in the market as the leaders emerge and many of the smaller players fade away or get acquired.”

The U.S. push technology market is expected to grow from $46 million in annual revenue today to $750 million by 2002, according to Jupiter Communications. But Jupiter analyst Michael Gartenberg believes only a few major players will dominate. “There is clearly more supply than demand right now in the push market,” he said. “Success will depend on building critical mass, which favours the larger, well-funded players.”
