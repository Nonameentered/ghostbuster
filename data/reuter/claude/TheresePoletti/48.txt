U.S. Computer Makers Expected to Report Solid Q4 Earnings Despite Stronger Dollar and Apple's Loss Forecast 

Major U.S. computer makers are expected to report solid earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 despite headwinds from a stronger dollar and a surprise revenue warning from Apple Inc. last week. While Apple's lowered revenue forecast for the quarter sent shockwaves through the tech sector, most analysts believe other computer and hardware companies will still meet or exceed earnings expectations for the key holiday shopping season.

According to Refinitiv data, earnings for the technology sector overall are expected to increase by 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is forecast to rise 5.2% for the same period. For computer and hardware companies specifically, earnings are projected to climb 3.7% with revenue up 4.2%. These numbers suggest steady if not spectacular growth to close out the year.

The U.S. dollar has gained more than 2% against other major currencies over the last three months, which cuts into overseas revenue for companies when profits made in other denominations are converted to dollars. However, analysts note that computer makers have had more than a year to adjust to a strong dollar and likely budgeted conservatively on currency exchanges as a result.

While Apple's news that it would likely miss its prior revenue guidance by up to $9 billion in the December quarter weighed on tech stocks broadly last week, most industry experts believe it reflects unique issues at Apple rather than a major slowdown across the sector. Apple remains heavily dependent on iPhone sales, which have declined over the past year due to challenges in China and a lack of new models to spur upgrades. In contrast, other computer makers have more diversified product lines and customer bases that should make their results less volatile.

Dell, HP Inc. and Lenovo—the world's three largest computer manufacturers—are all expected to report solid sales and profits growth for the fourth quarter. Dell and HP continue to benefit from strong demand for their commercial PCs, as businesses upgrade systems and move to Windows 10. Although Lenovo faces many of the same geopolitical issues as Apple in China, its bigger presence in the enterprise and small business sectors and its large share of the gaming PC market are helping to drive better results, analysts say.

Barring any unexpected negative announcements, tech investors seem likely to take the results from Dell, HP, Lenovo and others in stride as evidence of continued momentum in the sector outside of Apple's iPhone woes. While no company is immune to the risk of a downturn, a steady holiday quarter and optimistic guidance for early 2020 may be enough for now to allay fears that slower iPhone sales spell doom for the broader tech industry. Overall, U.S. computer makers appear well-positioned to report solid earnings for the fourth quarter despite economic uncertainty and volatility in the markets.
