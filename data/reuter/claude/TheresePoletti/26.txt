IBM Unveils Internet Strategy and Partnerships to Boost Global Business

IBM today announced a comprehensive strategy to drive global business and digital transformation through cloud computing and partnerships. The company is investing in capabilities, collaborations, and services that allow businesses and governments to build and run their IT infrastructure in a hybrid, multicloud environment.  

The key pillars of IBM's Internet strategy include $1 billion in cloud investments focused on data platform and hybrid cloud technologies. The company also announced new partnerships with systems integrators to help clients speed their digital and cloud transformations.

"Businesses today need flexible, scalable services in the cloud to maintain a competitive advantage and enable growth," said Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM. "Our strategy is to leverage IBM's investments in platform, like hybrid cloud and AI, and collaborate with global partners to help clients solve complex challenges and move their key workloads to the cloud."

IBM's hybrid cloud investments center around data, security, and automation. The company is building new data platform cloud services to help enterprises manage and gain insights from vast amounts of distributed data, regardless of where it resides. New IBM security software and services are designed to help clients manage threats across hybrid cloud environments. And new AI-infused automation capabilities can help improve productivity, reduce costs, and optimize resource usage across on-premises, private, and public cloud infrastructures.

To accelerate client adoption of hybrid cloud and digital transformation, IBM is launching partnerships with Beacon, a new managed service provider, and Indian IT service companies such as Infosys and Wipro. Under the partnerships, Beacon and the IT services companies will build IBM technologies like AI-infused automation, 5G, data management, and hybrid cloud security into their offerings. The collaborations aim to provide businesses across the world a wide range of industry and technology expertise to modernize infrastructures, applications, and workflows.

"Our new partnerships represent a significant expansion of our ecosystem and leverage IBM's deep industry expertise and broad portfolio of platform and services to meet clients wherever they are in their digital journey," said Bob Lord, IBM's EVP of Worldwide Ecosystems. "Together, IBM and our partners can help businesses of all types optimize their operations, accelerate innovation and improve customer experiences with flexible, secure and open hybrid cloud platforms."

The new strategy and partnership announcements build on IBM's recent cloud momentum. The company ended 2021 with over 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients. IBM Cloud also achieved 81% revenue growth in Q4 2021. With its new investments and collaborations, IBM aims to gain more global cloud market share and help clients in all industries digitally transform at scale.
