Baby Bells team up with Netscape for Internet browser deal  

In a blockbuster deal that will alter the competitive landscape of the Internet, the regional Bell telephone companies agreed today to bundle a customized version of Netscape's Navigator Web browser with their Internet access services.

The deal is a coup for Netscape, allowing the company to gain millions of new users and boost its market power versus rival Microsoft. It is also a boon for the seven Baby Bells, which will use the Netscape deal to attract more customers to their nascent Internet service providers and reduce the threat of competitors like AOL and Prodigy. 

"This is a landmark agreement that will make Netscape's award-winning software available to the majority of Internet users," said Jim Barksdale, CEO of Netscape Communications Corp. The deal calls for each Baby Bell to offer a cobranded version of the Navigator browser that will be optimized for their internet services. The browser will feature the individual branding of each Baby Bell but otherwise be similar to the standard Navigator.

In return, Netscape will receive an undisclosed upfront licensing fee as well as a share of ongoing monthly ISP revenue from each new customer. The revenue-sharing deal is structured to give Netscape an incentive to actively market the Baby Bells' services. Industry experts estimate that Netscape could gain between 3 to 5 million new users from the deal over the next 12 months, boosting Netscape's total user base by up to 35%.

With its Navigator browser now in the pole position, Netscape has wrested control over a key gateway to the Internet from Microsoft, whose rival Internet Explorer browser comes standard with every copy of Windows. The Baby Bells deal highlights how the browser wars have now expanded beyond the desktop to also encompass the fast-growing market for Internet access services.  

The deal is not exclusive, however, and the Baby Bells are free to bundle other browsers or offer customers a choice of browsers. Still, Netscape Navigator will be the default browser for most customers, and the revenue-sharing deal gives the Baby Bells a strong financial incentive to promote it. The custom browser is scheduled to begin appearing on Baby Bell internet services starting next month.
