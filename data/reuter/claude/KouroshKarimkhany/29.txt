Bay Networks Acquires NetICs for $99 Million to Boost Fast Ethernet Switch Technology

Bay Networks Inc. announced today its acquisition of NetICs Inc. for $99 million in stock. The purchase of the smaller networking equipment maker is intended to boost Bay Networks' fast Ethernet switch technology and help the company address the enterprise local area network switching market more aggressively. 

NetICs is a leading provider of high-performance LAN switches, especially those based on fast Ethernet technology, which provides 100-megabit-per-second bandwidth. Bay Networks is one of the largest suppliers of external wide area network routers but has not been able compete as well in the LAN switch market, especially in the high-growth 100 Base-T fast Ethernet segment. The acquisition of NetICs is a straight shot at rectifying this deficiency. 

"This acquisition caps a year of significant progress toward our strategic goal of providing end-to-end networking solutions for enterprise customers," said Dave Stevens, Bay Networks president and CEO. "The addition of NetICs' fast Ethernet products strengthens our product portfolio, enabling us to deliver solutions at all points in the enterprise, from the desktop to the service provider."

Paul Giampaoli, formerly CEO of NetICs, said, "By combining forces, we can leverage complementary product lines to provide customers with a single source for a complete range of enterprise networking needs." Bay Networks will maintain NetICs' San Jose, California, facility, but the engineering and marketing functions of the NetICs switching products will be integrated into Bay's product divisions. The acquisition, approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to be neutral to Bay's earnings over the next year but accretive thereafter. It is anticipated to close by the end of September, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

This acquisition is one of the largest in the enterprise networking sector this year and highlights the accelerating consolidation in that industry. The fast Ethernet switch market grew 50% last year to $1.5 billion, according to market researchers Dell'Oro Group, and Bay Networks and other large players clearly want a bigger stake going forward. With this move, Bay Networks beefs up its product line and competitiveness in this important, high-growth market.
