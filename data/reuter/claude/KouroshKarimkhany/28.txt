Be Inc. Licenses Software to Apple Rival, Fueling Acquisition Speculation  

Be Incorporated announced today that it has licensed its popular BeOS operating system to Gateway Computers, fueling speculation that the struggling software maker may be acquired soon. Under the terms of the deal, Gateway will bundle BeOS with some of its consumer PC models, offering customers a choice between Microsoft's Windows operating system or the BeOS.  

The licensing deal provides a much-needed lifeline for Be, which has been seeking a buyer in recent months. Be's stock price has languished below $5 per share for most of the year, down more than 90% from its peak in 2000. The company has struggled to gain significant market share against Windows, currently the dominant operating system for PCs. BeOS was originally released in 1995 as an alternative to Windows, but failed to catch on with mainstream hardware makers and customers.

The deal with Gateway represents the first major licensing contract for Be with a top-tier PC maker. Financial details of the licensing agreement were not disclosed. The company indicated more licensing deals could be possible if the Gateway partnership is successful.

Be's financial struggles and desperation to find a buyer have long made it an acquisition target for technology giants seeking an operating system. Most notably, Apple Computer attempted to acquire Be in late 1996 to gain control of BeOS, but negotiations broke down over price and control issues. Since then, Be has had a turbulent relationship with Apple, a former investor in Be. Speculation has swirled for years that Apple may revisit an acquisition if Be's price or stance softens. 

Today's news increased speculation that Apple could again try to acquire Be to control the BeOS, especially as a hedge against its long reliance on Microsoft's Windows platform. However, others argue that Apple may no longer need the BeOS now that it has created its own macOS in-house and transitioned its products to using its own custom hardware and operating systems. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the licensing deal and any possible interest in acquiring Be.   

The future remains murky and uncertain for Be despite today's lifeline from Gateway. While the licensing revenue and increased visibility may buy more time for Be to operate independently, its fate likely still depends on finding a larger buyer to fully leverage the potential of the BeOS platform. After years of struggles, Be still appears to be a takeover target in waiting despite its best efforts to forge a path as an independent company. For now, at least, the BeOS will get another shot at stardom under the Gateway brand and, possibly, a bigger role on the world stage if Apple or another suitor ultimately decides to acquire Be.
