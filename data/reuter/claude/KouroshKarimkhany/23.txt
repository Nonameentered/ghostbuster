Apple to Launch Cybercafes with Restaurant Operator in US and Europe  

Apple announced today that it is partnering with European restaurant operator SSP Group to open a series of Apple-branded cybercafes in major cities across the US and Europe. The cafes, called "Apple Bytes," will offer coffee, snacks, and other food items along with the opportunity for customers to use Apple products like Mac computers, iPads, and iPhones while dining or enjoying a drink.   

The first three Apple Byte locations will open later this year in New York, London, and Paris. Apple and SSP Group plan to open at least a dozen more cybercafes in 2020 in cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Berlin, Barcelona, and Rome. The goal is to provide a social space where people can gather, dine, and interact with Apple's suite of products even if they don't own the devices themselves.

"More and more people love engaging with our products, even if they don't personally own one yet," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "Apple Bytes provides a welcoming space for anyone to experience all that Apple has to offer while enjoying great food and drinks."   

The cybercafes will have high-speed Wi-Fi, lounge seating, and feature the latest versions of Apple products including newly released and demo models of iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and iMacs that visitors can test out. The menu will put an emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients and locally-sourced fare as well as a range of coffees, beers, and wines. 

"We're thrilled to partner with Apple to create a new kind of social destination that blends premium dining, technology, and a curated range of amenities," said SSP Group CEO Kate Swann. 

Apple hopes that giving more people hands-on access to its products in a relaxed, social setting will increase interest in its devices and services. If successful, the company is likely to expand the Apple Bytes concept to more locations around the world.
