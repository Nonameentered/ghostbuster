Czech Justice Minister Quits Government and Parliament for False Academic Title Claim 

Prague, Czech Republic — The Czech Minister of Justice resigned today from the government and parliament after revelations that she falsely claimed an academic title. Taťána Malá, who had served as Justice Minister for only six months, stepped down in the wake of reports by Czech media that she had incorrectly used the title of JUDr, the equivalent of a Juris Doctor or J.D. degree, for many years.

According to university records, Malá did study law at West Bohemia University in Plzeň but did not actually complete the degree and never formally received the academic title. However, she began using the title as early as 2001 in her professional career as an attorney and notary. The deception was first reported by Seznam Zprávy, a Czech news website.

In her resignation letter, Malá admitted that she had made a “serious mistake” in using the title without properly earning the degree. She expressed regret that she had caused “discomfort and worries” as a result of the scandal. Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said he accepted her resignation and acknowledged that public trust in the government had been undermined by the revelations.

The scandal comes at a delicate time for Babiš's populist ANO party, as the Czech Republic prepares for Senate and municipal elections in October. Babiš took power last year on a platform of fighting corruption, but he now finds himself struggling with a series of scandals implicating new cabinet members. Malá is the second minister forced to resign within the last six weeks, following the departure of the Health Minister in a bizarre video scandal.

Opposition leaders argued that Malá's false claim reflected a broader integrity crisis within ANO. They said Babiš had failed to properly vet new ministers and had compromised his pledge to enhance transparency in government. Babiš countered that Malá's resignation showed his government’s commitment to high ethical standards, but political analysts said the multiple resignations in quick succession had seriously damaged the credibility of his populist brand. The Prime Minister now faces the urgent task of rebuilding trust in his unconventional administration as the country heads into an intense autumn election season.
