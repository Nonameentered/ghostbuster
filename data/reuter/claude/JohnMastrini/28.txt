Low Voter Turnout in Czech Senate Elections Renders Results Meaningless 

Voter turnout in the Czech Republic's Senate elections last weekend plunged to a record low, calling into question the legitimacy of the results. Only 15.38% of eligible voters cast ballots to elect 27 of the Senate's 81 seats, the lowest turnout for any national election since the end of communist rule in 1989.  

The Senate is the upper chamber of the Czech parliament, with members serving six-year terms. One-third of the seats are up for election every two years. The populist ANO party of billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babiš won the most seats in the election, taking 9 positions. But with so few voters participating, analysts say the results cannot be seen as a meaningful gauge of public sentiment or support for any party.

"A 15% turnout means we have no idea what the remaining 85% of voters actually want or which policies or parties they support," said political scientist Jiří Pehe. "The election was a farce and its results tell us virtually nothing about the state of Czech politics or society."

Voter turnout in the Czech Republic has been declining for years and hit a record low of 18.65% in the last Senate election in 2016. But this year's turnout represents a staggering 17 percentage point drop in just two years and raises serious concerns about political participation and engagement.

"Such a low turnout weakens the legitimacy of Senate and damages the democratic system in the country," said Josef Mlejnek, a professor of political science at Charles University in Prague.
