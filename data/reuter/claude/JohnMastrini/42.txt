Czech Republic's Justice Minister resigns over phoney title scandal, coalition government seeks replacement

The Czech Republic is in search of a new Justice Minister this week after the embattled current office holder, Marcel Procházka, resigned over revelations he falsely claimed an academic title. Procházka had been under pressure for weeks after local media reported that he had erroneously referred to himself as "JUDr." for years, implying he held a degree in laws. In fact, Procházka never completed his legal studies at Charles University in Prague. 

The scandal battered the credibility of Procházka and the fragile three-party coalition government that appointed him. Leaders of the ruling coalition were reluctant to sack Procházka but faced growing calls for his resignation to avoid further damage. After weeks of controversy, Procházka finally submitted his letter of resignation to Prime Minister Andrej Babiš on Tuesday, saying his position had become “untenable” due to the “media pressure and attacks on my integrity.”

Babiš accepted the resignation on behalf of the government and thanked Procházka for his 11 months of service as Justice Minister. In a statement, Babiš said “Politics should not be for everyone. It requires a strong backbone and resistance to criticism.” He said the coalition parties would work swiftly to nominate a replacement for Procházka that would restore confidence in the leadership of the ministry.

The phoney degree scandal was an embarrassing episode for the populist ANO party led by Babiš, which appointed Procházka last year despite his lack of experience. Babiš said at the time Procházka's outsider status was an asset that would help him reform the sluggish justice system. However, Procházka struggled in the role and soon faced calls for his ouster over several controversies before the fake title issue came to light.
