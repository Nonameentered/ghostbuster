Madeleine Albright: The First Woman to Become US Secretary of State  

Madeleine Albright made history in 1997 when she was sworn in as the first female U.S.  Secretary of State.   As America's top diplomat during Bill Clinton's second term, she helped shape U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Her historic appointment as Secretary of State paved the way for women in leadership on the global stage.

Albright was born in 1937 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her family fled to England during World War II and later immigrated to the United States. She earned a PhD in political science from Columbia University and worked as a professor before entering politics. She served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under President Clinton from 1993 to 1997.

When Secretary of State Warren Christopher resigned in 1996, Clinton nominated Albright to replace him. Despite facing some criticism that she lacked foreign policy experience, Albright was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. She made an immediate impact as the public face of U.S. diplomacy, traveling over a million miles to more than 100 countries.  

As Secretary of State, Albright focused on promoting democracy and human rights around the world. She pushed for intervention in the Yugoslav Wars and Kosovo War, spearheading a 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999 that halted ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. She also worked to expand NATO into former Eastern bloc countries and improve relations with China and North Korea.  

However, Albright's tenure was not without controversy. In a 1996 interview, she defended the sanctions policy against Iraq, saying "the price is worth it" when asked about the deaths of half a million Iraqi children. She later regretted that statement. She was also criticized for the U.S.'s failure to intervene during the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the sluggish response to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.  

Since leaving the State Department in 2001, Albright has remained active as an author, political commentator, and chair of her own global development firm. She continues to be seen as an inspiration for women in foreign policy and international diplomacy. In 2012, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama for her contributions to international peace and democracy.  

Madeleine Albright shattered a glass ceiling as the first female Secretary of State. Her appointment demonstrated America's commitment to diversity and progress on women's rights. Though imperfect, she crafted a consequential legacy that still serves as an example for women leaders today. Twenty-three years after she took office, the world is brighter and more just thanks in part to her pioneering voice on the global stage.
