Germany and Czech Republic to Sign Post-World War Two Reconciliation Declaration  

Berlin, Germany - Germany and the Czech Republic have agreed to sign a formal reconciliation declaration aimed at putting decades of tensions over World War Two and its aftermath behind them. The foreign ministers of both countries are expected to sign the agreement in Berlin on Friday.

The declaration acknowledges and condemns crimes committed by both sides against civilians and prisoners of war during and in the aftermath of World War Two. It expresses regret for the immense suffering inflicted during the war and in its aftermath, including the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia. 

Relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia were strained for decades after the war due to Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and the war crimes committed by Nazi Germany during the war. The expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war and disputes over property claims caused further tensions.

The new agreement aims to draw a line under this painful history and enable both sides to develop closer ties. "We have agreed to settle questions that weighed heavily on German-Czech relations after World War Two and prevented the relations from developing as well as possible," said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.

His Czech counterpart Tomas Petricek called it an "historic agreement" that enables both nations to close "one of the last chapters" of the postwar era. "We are opening a new page in the relations between our countries," Petricek said.

The reconciliation deal is the culmination of years of talks between the two foreign ministries. Both sides described the negotiations as sometimes difficult but driven by a shared willingness to overcome the troubled past. The agreement consists of a joint declaration and several bilateral agreements addressing specific issues.

Germany has often struggled to reconcile with nations that suffered under the Nazi regime and World War Two. But in recent decades, it has negotiated and signed several reconciliation agreements with neighboring countries, including  agreements with Poland, France, and Israel. An agreement with the Czech Republic, which was occupied by Germany for six years and saw tens of thousands killed during the war, remained elusive until now.

Friday's signing ceremony in Berlin, attended by Maas and Petricek, will cap a process that both sides hailed as a breakthrough in bilateral ties scarred by the tumultuous events of the 20th century. The agreement is seen as an important step towards overcoming decades of distrust and antagonism, enabling Germany and the Czech Republic to build a common future based on shared democratic values and close cooperation within Europe.
