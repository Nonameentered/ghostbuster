Czech President Vaclav Havel's Health Improves After Lung Cancer Surgery

Prague, Czech Republic - Czech President Vaclav Havel's health is improving following surgery last week to remove a malignant tumor in his lung, according to his doctors. The 75-year-old leader and former dissident playwright is recovering well and his post-operation tests show no signs that the cancer has spread, his physicians reported today at a news conference.

President Havel underwent the surgery on December 13th at the Prague Military Hospital. Doctors removed the upper lobe of his left lung, where they found a malignant carcinoid tumor the size of an orange. Carcinoid cancer is a slow-growing type of neuroendocrine tumor that rarely metastasizes, so doctors are optimistic that they were able to remove the entire mass.  

Following the procedure, President Havel spent time in the intensive care unit but was moved to a standard ward on Saturday as his condition stabilized. He experienced some minor post-operative bleeding, which is common after lung surgery, but doctors were able to control it without complication. President Havel is now able to walk around and sit up for prolonged periods. He continues to receive oxygen therapy, but doctors expect to remove the oxygen cannula in the coming days.

The prognosis is good according to Dr. Martin Straka, the thoracic surgeon who led the president's medical team. “President Havel is recovering remarkably well after a major operation," Dr. Straka said. "His vital signs and test results indicate the cancer was localized and has not spread. We will need to monitor him closely in the months to come, but this is the best outcome we could have hoped for at this stage.” Doctors expect President Havel to remain in the hospital for 10 to 14 days of recovery before he can return to his official duties.

The Czech leader has long been a smoker, which doctors say contributed to his cancer diagnosis. President Havel vowed today to permanently give up smoking as he looks forward to returning to work with a "fresh outlook on life." The health scare and brush with a potentially life-threatening illness appears to have made a deep impact on the president. In a note to the Czech people today, he wrote: "My dear friends, this has been an opportunity for me to reflect deeply on my life and purpose. I feel reborn and ready to embark on this next chapter of my presidency with more determination and vigor than ever before."
