Czech President Vaclav Havel to Undergo Lung Surgery 

Prague, Czech Republic—Officials announced today that Czech President Vaclav Havel will undergo surgery to remove part of his lung. The 73-year-old dissident playwright turned political leader has been suffering from respiratory problems in recent weeks. Doctors found a malignant tumor in his right lung and recommended surgery to remove the upper lobe of that lung.

President Havel smoked for much of his life but gave up cigarettes over 20 years ago. However, the effects of long-term smoking have taken a toll on his health in recent years. He has been in and out of the hospital for respiratory infections and other complications. This latest diagnosis is the most serious yet and has caused grave concern across the Czech Republic and among Havel’s many international supporters.

The presidency in the Czech Republic is a largely ceremonial role, but Havel remains a hugely popular and respected figure. He was the leader of the Velvet Revolution that brought an end to communist rule in 1989 and became the first president of the Czech Republic after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993. Havel’s health has declined in recent years, and he has had to cut back on some of his engagements and public appearances, though he has tried to remain as active as possible in political and civil society.

Doctors said the lung surgery poses risks given Havel’s age and medical history but that it offers the best hope to stop the spread of cancer and allow Havel to continue to live as actively as possible. The surgery is scheduled to take place at the Military University Hospital in Prague next week. Doctors expect a hospital stay of at least 10 days, barring any complications. The nation waits anxiously for news of their president and national hero, hoping for a successful operation and speedy recovery. The outpouring of support on social media and outside the hospital reflects the reverence in which Havel is held. All eyes will be on Prague as this influential world figure faces a dangerous medical challenge.
