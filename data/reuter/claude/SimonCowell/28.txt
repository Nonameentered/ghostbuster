Lloyd's of London granted judgements in landmark cases against non-paying members

The historic insurance firm Lloyd's of London has secured judgements against three former members who failed to pay claims costs relating to asbestos litigation in the U.S. The cases were brought to court in London by Lloyd's and represent the first judgements against defaulting members since that market began in 1688. 

In a statement, Lloyd's said the cases were a "landmark moment" and demonstrate their resolve to take action against members who fail to meet valid claims. The judgements total nearly Â£2 million that will now be recovered by Lloyd's. The three members in question operated as underwriters in the 1980s but did not pay their share of claims from policyholders with asbestos-related illnesses.

Lloyd's has faced significant financial troubles in the past due to escalating asbestos claims from the U.S. The claims stemmed from policies underwritten in the 1970s and 1980s that did not adequately foresee the health risks and costs associated with asbestos exposure. Lloyd's has since restructured its operations, but there remained billions of pounds in unpaid claims that Lloyd's itself has had to cover.

Taking these former members to court represents an effort by Lloyd's to recover funds wherever possible and reinforce the message that membership comes with responsibilities as well as benefits. A Lloyd's spokesman said "We pursue recoveries from any members who do not meet their obligations to policyholders, in order to protect the resources of the Society and ensure that valid claims can continue to be paid."

The three separate judgements issued this week clear a path for Lloyd's to recover the funds through enforcement actions, though the members do retain a right to appeal. The cases highlight that while the Lloyd's market has a storied history, it operates in a modern regulatory environment that requires fiscal discipline and accountability from its members. For Lloyd's, securing these judgments marks an important milestone in putting legacy troubles behind it.
