British Public Opposes Insurance Companies Using Genetic Test Results for Premiums

A new survey shows that most Britons are opposed to insurance companies accessing and using individuals' genetic test results to calculate insurance premiums. The survey of 2,000 adults found that 76% believe it would be unacceptable for life insurance companies to require genetic testing and use the results to determine premium costs. 

There is growing concern that as genetic testing becomes more widespread and affordable, insurance companies may seek access to individuals' genetic data to better assess health risks and tailor premiums. Some argue this could create a system where people with certain genetic markers that indicate higher health risks would face substantially higher insurance costs. Supporters of insurance companies using genetic data argue that it could make the system fairer by more accurately linking premiums to risk.

However, the new survey shows the British public is very opposed to such a scenario. Genetic Alliance UK, the advocacy group that commissioned the survey, warns that if insurance companies were able to access and use genetic test results, it could deter many people from getting tested altogether due to fears of discrimination. "Genetic test results contain sensitive health information and should not be used to determine insurance costs," said Soledad Mullins, Policy Adviser at Genetic Alliance UK. 

Privacy advocates argue there needs to be policy measures put in place to prevent insurance companies from requiring or accessing individuals' genetic data. They point out that while genetic tests can indicate health risks, many people never develop the conditions they are at risk for. "Your DNA alone does not define your health or your healthcare needs," said Mullins.

Some insurance companies argue that without the ability to account for genetic health risks, the system could become unsustainable if significantly more people get genetic testing done in the coming years. However, given the public opposition, lawmakers and regulators are likely to put policy guardrails in place to prevent genetic data discrimination if insurance companies begin to ask for access to individuals' genetic test results on a wider scale. Overall, the debate around this issue is likely to intensify as genetic science continues to advance in the years ahead.
