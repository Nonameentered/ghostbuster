Prudential Corp Reports Healthy Rise in Profits, Remains Tight-Lipped on Negotiations Over Orphan Assets  

Prudential Corp, one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world, reported a 6.8% rise in quarterly profits today. The strong results were largely driven by growth in the asset management and retail banking divisions of Prudential’s US  operations.

Earnings per share rose to $5.20 for the third quarter from $4.86 a year earlier, topping analyst forecasts of $5. Prudential’s CEO Mark Pearson said the results reflected “continuing momentum in our businesses and a resilient US economy.” Revenue increased 3% to $34.4 billion in the three months ending September 30, up from $33.5 billion last year.

Prudential’s asset management division benefited from higher fees as global stocks rallied during the quarter. The division reported an 11% rise in adjusted operating income to $1.5 billion. Net income in Prudential’s largest division, US retail banking, rose 4% to $1.2 billion as higher interest rates allowed the bank to charge more for loans.

In contrast, income fell slightly in Prudential’s retirement and annuity business as it made less money from fees due to lower interest rates. Pearson said the annuity business remained stable despite headwinds from lower rates and demographic shifts as baby boomers age. “We are managing through current market conditions very well,” he told analysts on a conference call.

Prudential continued to be tight-lipped about ongoing negotiations with regulators over how to handle up to $12 billion in “orphan assets”—old life insurance policies where beneficiaries cannot be located. Pearson said only that discussions with state insurance regulators are “very constructive” but declined to provide further details, citing the confidentiality of the talks.

The issue of orphaned assets has dogged life insurers like Prudential as large numbers of policies sold decades ago remain unclaimed after policyholders die or move addresses unknowningly. Industry critics argue that insurers make profits investing the premiums but face little risk of ever having to pay out claims. Insurers counter that the orphan assets represent only a tiny fraction of total assets under management and that they follow required procedures to try to locate beneficiaries.
