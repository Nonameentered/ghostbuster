NatWest Markets Unit Discovers Mispricing Errors and Suspends Senior Trader for Failure to Supervise 

The investment banking unit of NatWest Group Plc announced today it had discovered mispricing errors related to certain European corporate bonds and had suspended a senior trader for failing to properly supervise the team responsible.

NatWest Markets found that its credit trading desk had made pricing mistakes on a number of investment-grade and high-yield European corporate bonds over the past several months. The errors resulted in customers either receiving worse prices than the bank had intended to offer or paying higher prices than necessary when buying the bonds. The collective value of the mispricings was estimated to be several million pounds, according to people familiar with the situation.

The bank said it had put measures in place to remediate affected customers with compensation where needed. It also said it had suspended the head of its credit trading desk, Mike Richards, pending an internal investigation into how the pricing errors occurred without detection under his leadership. Mr. Richards, a 20-year veteran of the bank, had run the credit trading operation since 2016.

NatWest Markets CEO Kevin Brown said in an internal memo reviewed by reporters, “Mistakes were made that did not live up to our high standards. We take this matter very seriously and have taken appropriate action. We sincerely apologize to any clients who were negatively impacted.”

The episode is an embarrassing misstep for NatWest Markets, which was formed in 2017 from the merger of the investment banking arms of NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The unit had been trying to strengthen its trading operations and win more deals from corporate clients across Europe. However, it continues to lag behind larger rivals like Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc in investment banking revenue and market share.

Last year, NatWest Markets announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs in a bid to reduce costs. Many of the cuts targeted middle-management roles and back-office staffing. At the time, Mr. Brown had said the reductions would leave the bank “leaner, better connected and more focused.” The news of the pricing errors and suspension call the timing of those job cuts into question and suggest the bank may have created operational gaps that reduced oversight and compliance controls, industry experts said.

Overall, the news is an unwanted distraction for the wider NatWest Group, which remains majority-owned by the U.K. government following its rescue during the financial crisis. NatWest Markets generates a small but meaningful portion of the group’s total earnings from its own trading and investment banking activities as well as services to commercial customers. How NatWest addresses this misstep and prevents future problems will be important for maintaining the confidence of regulators and shareholders in its turnaround effort.
