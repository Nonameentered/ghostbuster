B.A.T Industries Interested in Expanding British Life Insurance but Put Off by Scottish Amicable's Asking Price

British American Tobacco (B.A.T) Industries is interested in expanding its presence in the British life insurance market but has balked at the asking price for Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society according to sources close to the negotiations. B.A.T Industries, one of the world's largest tobacco conglomerates, has been looking to diversify into financial services and views the UK life insurance sector as an attractive opportunity for growth. 

Scottish Amicable, a well-established life insurer founded in 1826, has been seen as an ideal acquisition target given its broad portfolio of life insurance products and over 2 million policyholders. However, after months of discussions, talks between B.A.T and Scottish Amicable have stalled over the acquisition price. B.A.T is said to have offered £1.2 billion for the life insurer but Scottish Amicable's board is holding out for at least £1.5 billion, given strong profits and a sizable market share.

Some analysts view Scottish Amicable's asking price as reasonable given its financial position and brand recognition. "Scottish Amicable is one of the most trusted names in the life insurance industry with a very loyal customer base. Its portfolio of retirement, investment, and life insurance products would fit nicely into B.A.T's strategy to become a major player in UK financial services," said James Wright, an insurance analyst at Barclays Capital. However, others believe £1.5 billion is too high a price and risks overvaluing Scottish Amicable's business.

For its part, B.A.T has so far refused to budge from its £1.2 billion offer, believing it already represents a sizeable premium on Scottish Amicable's market capitalization. "We are keen to do a deal to expand our financial services operations but will only pay what we believe is fair value. We think £1.2 billion is an extremely generous offer and represents full price," said a B.A.T spokesperson. The two sides remain in a standoff, uncertain if an agreement can still be reached or if B.A.T will start looking at other acquisition targets.

The potential deal comes amid a wave of consolidation in the UK life insurance sector. Demographic changes, low interest rates, and new regulations have put pressure on life insurers. Many smaller players are looking to sell or partner with larger rivals to achieve cost savings and gain financial security. If the B.A.T and Scottish Amicable deal falls through due to pricing, it may highlight the challenges of finding the right acquisition at an acceptable cost, even when there are motivated buyers and sellers. B.A.T appears keen to make a first foray into the British life insurance market but not at any price. Scottish Amicable may have to decide whether £1.2 billion from B.A.T is better than struggling alone or finding another suitor.
