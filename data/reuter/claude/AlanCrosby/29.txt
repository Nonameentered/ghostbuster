Investors turn to Czech debt market amid lack of transparency and poor equity market performance

Prague—With Czech equity markets underperforming and concerns about lack of transparency, foreign investors are increasingly turning to Czech government and corporate debt to gain exposure to the country's economy. 

The Prague Stock Exchange has struggled in recent years, with declining trading volumes and limited new listings. The blue-chip PX index has generated a meager 3.7% annual return over the past five years, well below regional peers. Listing requirements and governance standards are seen as less stringent than in Western European markets, discouraging some global investors and companies from participating in the exchange.

In contrast, demand for Czech government bonds has been strong, driving yields to historic lows. The Czech government successfully issued 15-year bonds in June with a yield of just 1.5%, the lowest on record. Likewise, yields on 10-year government bonds recently fell below 1% for the first time ever. Foreign investors held nearly 40% of Czech government debt as of the end of 2018, double the share from five years earlier.

Corporate bond issuance has also surged, as companies take advantage of low interest rates to lock in cheap funding. Bond issuance from Czech companies reached a record $5.2 billion in the first half of 2019, more than double the same period last year. The largest issuers include utility group ČEZ, telecommunications company O2 Czech Republic and dairy producer Madeta.

"The government and corporate bond markets have offered investors relatively attractive yields, especially compared to core Eurozone bonds, without the governance risks that the equity market is perceived as having," said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intl Advisors. "This has been the natural place for many foreign investors to go."

Yet some argue that shunning the equity market could be short-sighted and that more investor participation could help strengthen governance standards over time. They warn the debt market may come with its own volatility in the coming years if interest rates start to rise from their historic lows.  

"The Czech equity market offers exposure to solid growth engines of the economy, many with strong balance sheets and strategic importance, despite the lower governance standards," said Don Fitzsimmons, a portfolio manager at Lion Asset Management focused on Central Europe. "Savvy long-term investors should have a balanced approach across both equity and debt."   

For now, though, debt remains the asset class of choice for many investors in the Czech Republic. With the economy growing over 2% and monetary policy loose, demand for government and corporate bonds should continue, keeping yields anchored for the foreseeable future. But if interest rates start to rise and volatility returns to debt markets, investors may once again look to the equity market for attractive opportunities and more durable returns, despite the risks.
