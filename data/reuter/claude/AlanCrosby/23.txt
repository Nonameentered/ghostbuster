Czech Trade Deficit Falls in September, Boosting Market Sentiment 

The Czech Republic's trade deficit fell sharply in September, data from the statistics office showed on Tuesday, raising hopes that falling imports and stabilizing exports could support economic growth in the coming months.

The trade deficit dropped to CZK 9.4 billion ($413 million) from CZK 18 billion in August, below market expectations for a deficit of CZK 13 billion. Exports edged up 0.1% month-on-month while imports fell 3.0%.

“The pickup in exports and drop in imports are positive surprises that point to some stabilization in foreign demand and should boost GDP growth in the third quarter,” said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE. 

On an annual basis, exports and imports declined by 9.4% and 12.0%, respectively, reflecting the sharp drop in cross-border trade since the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the global economy into recession.

The central bank has said the economy likely contracted by around 7% in the third quarter but should return to growth in the fourth quarter. It sees the economy declining by about 6% this year as a whole.

Market sentiment was boosted by the data, with the crown currency firming 0.2% on the day to 26.255 to the euro. 

 “The better trade figures, coupled with rising business and consumer confidence, suggest the economic recovery continued in Q3... The data will likely be seen as encouraging by the central bank,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.

“Still, with Covid-19 cases rising again and tighter restrictions being imposed across Europe, the outlook for Q4 has become more uncertain. Much will depend on whether governments ramp up fiscal support over the winter.”

The statistics office data also showed the trade balance with EU partners swung to a narrow surplus in September, the first since February, while the deficit with non-EU trading partners widened.  

Czech industrial production suffered its sharpest decline in more than 25 years in the depths of the pandemic but has since partly recovered. The unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in September, fractionally up from 3.7% in August.

Consumer and business sentiment have gradually improved in recent months as strict lockdown measures were eased although rising coronavirus infections are clouding the outlook. The central bank sees economic recovery continuing in 2021 with growth of 3.5%
