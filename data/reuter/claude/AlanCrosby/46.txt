Czech Trade Deficit Rises Sharply in October, but Analysts Remain Unalarmed  

The Czech Republic's trade deficit rose sharply in October versus a year earlier according to figures released Tuesday by the Czech Statistical Office. However, analysts say the rise is due to temporary factors and do not expect it to significantly alter the country's otherwise positive economic outlook.

The trade deficit grew by 61.2 billion Czech koruna ($2.69 billion) in October compared with a year ago, the statistical office said. Exports rose by a modest 0.9% in October compared with a year earlier, while imports jumped by 6.7% over the same period. The higher increase in imports was the main driver behind the rising trade deficit, the statistical office said. 

Despite the increase in the trade deficit in October, analysts say the result was largely expected and that overall trade conditions remain positive for the Czech economy. "The trade deficit will not significantly worsen in the coming months," said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali Investments CEE. He noted the Czech koruna has strengthened against the euro in recent months, which should support Czech exports to the European Union, the country's largest trading partner.

The wider trade deficit is also partly due to increased imports of raw materials, especially oil and natural gas, which the Czech Republic uses to generate a significant portion of its electricity. Such imports of commodities can distort trade figures in a single month, analysts noted. Petr Skondrojanis, an analyst at Erste Group, said the increase in imports of energy and industrial commodities was a "one-off effect" and that "underlying trade conditions remain sound."

Overall, analysts expect the Czech Republic's trade balance to remain in surplus for 2020 as a whole, and do not see the higher deficit in October as a cause for concern or as altering the positive outlook for the country's economy. Economic growth in the Czech Republic has outpaced most other EU countries in recent years, buoyed by strong domestic demand, rising wages, and low unemployment.
