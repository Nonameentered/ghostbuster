Stagecoach Reports Record High Profits and Stock Growth  

Stagecoach Group, the major UK-based public transport company, announced record profits and strong stock performance in its latest quarterly earnings report released today. Stagecoach reported pre-tax profits of £35.3 million in the three months ending October 31, up nearly 20% from the same period last year. Revenue from bus and rail operations in the UK rose 5.4% to £794.7 million.

The robust quarterly results were driven by growth across all business units, especially Stagecoach's bus division and its various rail franchises. Ridership on Stagecoach buses increased 3.4% compared to the previous year. Revenue from Stagecoach's South Western and East Midlands rail franchises grew at an even faster pace of 8% and 10% respectively.  

“We are delivering on our strategy to provide high quality, good value public transport across the UK," said Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths. “At a time of economic uncertainty, people are continuing to choose our bus and rail services."

Stagecoach's stock price reacted very positively to the earnings news, climbing over 7% to close at £1.42 per share. The stock is now up nearly 25% over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming the broader UK market. Analysts pointed to the company's success in winning new rail franchises, controlling costs, and attracting more customers as reasons for investor optimism.

"Stagecoach continues to fire on all cylinders and these results show the company has clear momentum going into 2020," said Brian Johnson, an analyst at HSBC. "With a proven management team, diverse mix of transit operations, and several upcoming rail bidding opportunities, Stagecoach seems poised for further success over the next year."  

Based in Perth, Scotland, Stagecoach operates bus and rail networks spanning the UK. It has major bus operations in cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Hull, Cardiff and Exeter. Stagecoach's rail franchises include South Western, East Midlands and West Coast Partnership. The company employs over 27,000 people and transports over 2.5 million passengers daily across its transit networks.
