Taylor Woodrow's 1996 Performance Reverses Share Slide in 75th Anniversary Year 

Taylor Woodrow, the UK housebuilder and construction group, reported a 25% increase in annual profits and said its performance in 1996 had reversed the decline in its share price over the previous year. 

Pre-tax profits rose to £93.4m in the year to December 31 from £74.7m in 1995. Turnover increased 7% to £1.86bn. The results were ahead of analysts' forecasts and follow a series of profit warnings that had cut the company's stock market value by almost a third last year.

Shares in Taylor Woodrow rose 101⁄2 p at 348p as investors welcomed the turnround in the group's fortunes. Sir Ian Wood, chairman, said: "We have achieved a great deal in turning the group round during 1996, our 75th anniversary year, and the board is confident Taylor Woodrow now has a strong base on which to build for the future."

Strengthening UK housing markets, tight cost controls and the benefits of extensive restructuring efforts helped boost Taylor Woodrow's 1996 performance. The UK housing division increased profits by 32% to £74.5m while the commercial and professional services division returned to profit, making £5.1m against a £2.1m loss in 1995. 

However, the international construction arm remained in deficit, making a loss of £4.7m compared with a loss of £3.1m previously, reflecting difficult trading conditions in the Middle East and Hong Kong. Sir Ian warned: "The prospects for our international construction business continue to give cause for concern." But he said profits in the current year would be higher than in 1996.

A buoyant UK housing market, with prices rising steadily and lengthy delays for new homes, means demand continues to outstrip supply, a trend industry experts expect to continue well into next year. 

UBS, the investment bank, believes Taylor Woodrow is well placed to benefit and expects profits to rise by a further 28% to £120m this year.
