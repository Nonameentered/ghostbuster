Stagecoach Plc reports record profits and anticipates ongoing dividend growth

Stagecoach Plc, the leading public transportation company, reported strong results for its latest financial year ending April 2019. Profit before tax rose 10% to a record £132 million, driven by revenue growth across its rail and bus divisions in the UK. 

Stagecoach’s bus division continues to perform well, with revenue up 6.4% to £1.16 billion. The company benefited from new contracts wins, service improvements and fare increases. Its rail division also posted solid results with revenue rising 5.1% to £1.67 billion due to contract extensions and higher fares. The company remains optimistic about the renewal of three of its rail franchises in the coming years.

Buoyed by these positive results, Stagecoach raised its dividend by 7.5% to 11.9 pence per share. This marks the company’s eighth consecutive year of dividend growth. The company said it will continue to target ongoing dividend growth for shareholders as its profits rise over the medium term. 

“We have delivered record financial performance through our ability to attract more customers to greener and smarter public transport while controlling costs efficiently,” said Chief Executive Martin Griffiths. “Strong operational performance and improving customer satisfaction across our bus and rail divisions underpin our results.”

 Stagecoach continues to invest in low-emission vehicles, digital technology and customer service initiatives to drive growth. Its strategy is paying off with revenue and profit increasing year after year. While risks remain around rail franchise renewals and competitive pressures, Stagecoach appears well placed to continue its solid performance and reward shareholders with higher dividends into the future. Overall, it was a positive set of results showing a company performing strongly in its market.
