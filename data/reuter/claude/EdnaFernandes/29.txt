Eurotunnel Plc Traffic Reduced to One Third After Channel Tunnel Fire

Traffic through the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France was operating at one third of normal capacity on Tuesday after a fire on a freight shuttle severely damaged the tunnel. Eurotunnel, the operator of the tunnel, reported that a bent axle caused a fire on the wheels of a goods vehicle on one of the freight transporter shuttle trains late last night. The fire caused significant damage to infrastructure in one of the tunnel's two separate running tunnels. 

Eurotunnel have announced that the tunnel is partly reopened but currently can only handle 30% of standard passenger and freight traffic. Repair and recovery work is underway but the full service is not expected to resume for days. Thousands of passengers and freight loads are experiencing major delays and disruptions. 

The Channel Tunnel, also known as the Eurotunnel or Chunnel, is the 50 kilometer underground rail tunnel beneath the English Channel that connects Folkestone in Kent, England with Calais in northern France. The tunnel carries Eurostar passenger trains, the Eurotunnel Shuttle for road vehicles and international freight trains. Over 50 million passengers traveled through the tunnel last year along with millions of tonnes of freight.

The fire broke out at around 11:30 pm last night on a freight shuttle in the north tunnel. The freight shuttle was carrying 28 trucks and their drivers. All were evacuated safely but the intense heat and smoke from the blaze caused damage to the tunnel lining and equipment over a 150 meter section of the tunnel. The south tunnel was unaffected but has been closed as a precaution until repairs can be made.

Eurotunnel apologized for the disruption but stated that safety is their top priority. Spokesperson Valerie Fiat said, “We greatly regret the temporary closure of our service and fully understand the frustration of our customers. However, the Channel Tunnel remains the safest transport means under the Channel and in situations like this, we are obliged to follow emergency procedures to ensure safety of all.”

Travelers should continue to check with Eurostar, Eurotunnel and P&O ferries for the latest travel information. Delays are expected to continue for the next 48-72 hours until repair and service recovery is complete. The closure and traffic limitations in the Channel Tunnel continue to have a knock-on effect on transport links across the Southeast of England.
