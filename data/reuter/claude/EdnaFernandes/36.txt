Christian Salvesen Rejects Hays' £1.1 Billion Hostile Takeover, Offers Better Shareholder Value with Special Dividend and Demerger Plan  

Logistics and freight management company Christian Salvesen today rejected an unsolicited £1.1 billion takeover bid from rival Hays Plc.  In a statement, Christian Salvesen said the all-cash offer "significantly undervalues" the company and its prospects. 

Christian Salvesen instead outlined an alternative plan to maximize shareholder value through a special dividend payout of £500 million and a demerger of its freight forwarding business. The company believes this approach will unlock more value for investors compared to the Hays bid.

Hays, one of the UK's largest logistics companies, announced its hostile takeover attempt earlier this week in an effort to consolidate the fragmented logistics sector. However, Christian Salvesen said the offer price of 550 pence per share represents a "meager" 7% premium over its pre-bid share price.  

"We believe Hays' offer fails to reflect the underlying strength and potential of Christian Salvesen, including the success of our transformation program and the momentum in our markets," said Christian Salvesen CEO James Ritchie.  "Over the last three years, we have turned around and repositioned the business to capitalize on key growth areas, and we continue to see significant opportunities to drive further shareholder value."

Under its alternative plan, Christian Salvesen proposed paying the special dividend in July 2017, funded in part through excess cash and new debt financing. It would then demerge its freight forwarding division, called Salvesen Logistics, as a separate public company by the end of 2017. Christian Salvesen would retain its waste and recycling collection business.

The dividend and demerger plan is subject to shareholder approval. Christian Salvesen said it has received strong support from major shareholders for its proposed strategy. However, some analysts warned the plan could be risky and face operational challenges. Hays said it is considering its options in response to the rejection and rival proposals.

The battle for Christian Salvesen highlights ongoing consolidation in the logistics sector as companies look to gain scale and efficiencies. The company provides freight forwarding, waste collection and recycling services to over 45,000 businesses across Europe. Christian Salvesen shares rose 3.2% on the news, giving the company a market value of around £1.2 billion.
