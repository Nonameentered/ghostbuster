EMAP to resolve damaging boardroom row and builds on strong profit performance 

EMAP, the media group behind magazines such as Grazia and Red, said today it expects to resolve a damaging boardroom row soon. The company also reported a strong rise in profits for the first half of the year.

EMAP saw its pre-tax profits rise 12% to £54 million in the six months to June 30 compared with the same period a year ago. Revenues were up 8% to £291 million, driven by a strong performance in the UK and US. 

The upbeat results come after months of boardroom turmoil at EMAP centering around a dispute between chairman Sir David Arculus and the publisher's former chief executive Mark Read. However, the company said today the dispute is close to being resolved.

“Good progress has been made and we expect to be able to make an announcement shortly,” a company spokesman said. It is understood a settlement has been reached between EMAP and Read, who left the company in March. Read had threatened to sue EMAP, claiming he was entitled to bonus shares worth up to £500,000.

EMAP said EBITDA profit margins had improved to 19.4% from 16.9%, reflecting increased revenues and tight cost control. The results were ahead of analysts’ expectations, prompting shares in EMAP to rise 29 pence to 491 pence. The shares have fallen in recent months due to the boardroom unrest.

“These are excellent results that demonstrate the fundamental strength and resilience of our business,” said David Gilbertson, EMAP's acting chief executive. “Our strategy of focusing on our core markets is clearly delivering benefits.”

He added: “Although we face challenging market conditions, the group is competitively well positioned with leading brands, strong management and accelerating product innovation. We have a platform for sustainable growth over the long term.”

Analysts welcomed the results and the news the boardroom dispute was being resolved. “This will remove a barrier to investor confidence after a period of management uncertainty," said Simon Baker at SG Securities. “With the underlying business performing well, EMAP now seems poised to push on strongly."
