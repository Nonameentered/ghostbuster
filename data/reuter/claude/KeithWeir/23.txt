BT to Acquire MCI Communications Corp in $22 Billion Takeover, Marking Spectacular First Year for CEO Sir Peter Bonfield  

British Telecommunications PLC announced today that it will acquire MCI Communications Corp, a leading U.S. telecommunications company, for $22 billion in stock. The deal marks BT's largest acquisition ever and caps a spectacular first year for BT's CEO Sir Peter Bonfield.

Under the terms of the agreement, BT will exchange 2.15 shares of its stock for each share of MCI common stock. The offer values MCI at $75 per share, a nearly 50% premium over MCI's stock price before the announcement. The combined company will have over $40 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the largest telecom operators in the world.   

"This acquisition delivers on our strategic goal to become a major global communications player," said Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's CEO. "MCI's network and customer base in the U.S. and Canada nicely complement our existing global operations. Together, we will be able to provide seamless connectivity and a wider range of services to customers worldwide."

The blockbuster deal validates Sir Peter's vision for transforming the former British telecom monopoly into an international telecommunications powerhouse. Since taking over as CEO last year, Sir Peter has aggressively pursued expansion into new markets and new business areas beyond basic telephone services. In addition to the MCI acquisition, BT recently launched operations in Japan, signed a strategic partnership with AT&T, and invested billions to upgrade its network to provide high-speed Internet access, data services, and digital television.

BT's bold moves have been cheered by investors, who have sent its shares up over 50% in the past year. However, the MCI acquisition does present risks. BT will take on $6 billion in MCI debt and face stiff competition in the U.S. from the likes of AT&T and WorldCom. Integrating MCI's operations and networks with BT's global systems will also be a complex process that could take years.  

Still, industry analysts hailed the logic behind the deal. "MCI gives BT a major foothold in North America, the world's largest telecom market, and should strengthen both companies' ability to serve multinational business customers," said Matthew Spencer of Lehman Brothers in London. For Sir Peter Bonfield and BT, the future looks bright indeed. After just one year at the helm, Sir Peter has ensured BT's position at the forefront of the global telecommunications revolution.
