EMAP Plc shareholders vote to oust rebel non-executive directors in boardroom row

Shareholders in EMAP Plc, the UK media company, voted to remove two non-executive directors who had opposed the company’s £1.2 billion takeover of a rival at a fiery extraordinary general meeting today. 

The removal of the directors, Sir Michael Parker and Lucy Neville-Rolfe, is a victory for EMAP’s chairman and chief executive who had called the EGM to resolve a boardroom dispute over the takeover of Connect Media Ltd. The takeover was announced last month but Parker and Neville-Rolfe had threatened to resign in protest over the price and strategic rationale of the deal.

Their opposition raised questions over governance and succession at EMAP. However, 67% of votes at the EGM were in favor of removing the directors from the board. EMAP’s shares rose 4% on the news as investors welcomed the resolution of the uncertainty.

In a statement, EMAP’s chairman Gerry McCaughey said: “We are pleased that our shareholders have voiced their strong support for the board and the recent Connect Media acquisition. With a united board, EMAP can now pursue its strategy to expand into new sectors and return to delivering value for shareholders.”

The vote brings to an end a difficult chapter for EMAP that began when Parker and Neville-Rolfe voted against the takeover last month, arguing the £1.2 billion price tag was too high and the deal was a risky diversification from EMAP’s existing magazine and advertising business. Their opposition was an embarrassment for McCaughey who had pushed ahead with the deal.

In an attempt to resolve the row, McCaughey called today’s EGM at which over 60% of investors voted to remove Parker and Neville-Rolfe. The directors, who had served on EMAP’s board for nine and six years respectively, left the meeting without commenting but are expected to issue statements later today.

The removal of the independent directors could weaken governance at EMAP, some analysts have warned. However, others argue McCaughey has reasserted control and can now pursue his strategy to turn around EMAP, which has seen profits decline in recent years due to pressure on its print media interests.
