French radio giant NRJ SA seeks to win London FM licence and target youth audience  

French commercial radio group NRJ SA announced today that it is bidding for a valuable FM radio licence in London with the aim of launching a dedicated youth and dance music station in the UK capital. NRJ, which operates the popular NRJ radio brand in France and other European countries, said it wants to bring its successful format to London if it wins the FM licence currently held by Bauer Radio.  

NRJ proposed to media regulator Ofcom that it would launch 'NRJ London' on the FM frequency, playing a mix of dance, electronic, and pop music aimed at 15-34 year olds. The move is part of NRJ's strategy to expand its radio brands into new European markets and tap into the sizeable youth audiences in major cities. NRJ stations based on a similar format currently broadcast in Paris, Brussels, Monaco and other French-speaking regions.

Winning the London FM licence would mark NRJ's first foray into the UK radio market and its first station targeting primarily English-speaking listeners. However, the group faces competition from rival bids by Global, News UK, and Bauer to retain the licence. Ofcom is expected to review the proposals over the next few months before awarding the licence to begin broadcasting in 2021.

Philippe Gaultier, CEO of NRJ Group, said: "London is a key market for dance and electronic music, and we believe the NRJ format has the potential to resonate strongly with young audiences there. We see an opportunity to bring a new voice to London radio that celebrates the city's vibrant music scene and strong nightlife culture."  

Some industry analysts believe NRJ's bid is a strong contender given the success of its stations in other markets and the popularity of dance music in London. However, others note that Bauer and Global in particular have more established presences in UK radio and deeper connections with London audiences. The battle for the London FM licence is set to be intense, with the winning bidder gaining access to millions of potential listeners in the UK's largest radio market. Ofcom's decision is expected in the coming months in what could be one of the most closely followed licence awards in years.
