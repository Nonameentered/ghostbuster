EMI shares surge after positive outlook for global music market 

Shares in EMI Group PLC rose over 12% today after the music label issued a positive outlook for growth in the global recorded music market. In a statement, EMI said streaming revenues and a rebound in physical sales in some markets will drive "mid to high single-digit revenue growth" for the music industry over the next 3-5 years.

The upbeat assessment comes after several years of slowing declines or small gains in the music market. EMI Group, one of the "big three" record labels along with Sony Music and Universal Music, has faced consistent revenue and profit pressures as streaming and pirated music battered physical sales. However, the rise of paid subscription streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music in recent years has led to a reversal of fortunes.

According to EMI's forecast, paid streaming will increase by over 20% per year over the next half decade, generating over $20 billion in revenues by 2023. While ad-supported streaming is growing fast, paid subscriptions are seen as more financially viable for the music industry in the long run. EMI also expects a "leveling out" of declines in CD and vinyl sales in some countries, especially in genres like rock and classical music where fans continue to value physical products.  

"After 15 years of market fluctuations, we are confident in a sustained period of real growth," said Tony Harlow, EMI's Chief Executive. "Streaming has firmly taken hold and will only strengthen going forward, while demand for physical music experiences endures in some segments. With a robust release slate of new recordings combined with a strong back catalog and prudent cost management, we are well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds."

Investors reacted positively to the optimistic guidance, with EMI's London-listed shares rising over 12% to Â£3.42, their highest level in over a year. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said EMI is emerging from a "lengthy rough patch" and that the shares could continue to rise if the overall music market strengthens as projected. 

"The backdrop is improving for the music industry, and following years of hemorrhaging cash, that should be music to investors' ears," Lund-Yates said. "If [EMI's] prognosis proves accurate, the group will be nicely placed to return to meaningful levels of profitability over the medium term."
