China accuses Japan of irresponsible actions over East China Sea dispute  

China has accused Japan of deliberately escalating tensions in the waters of the East China Sea. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson  issued a strongly worded statement condemning what it called "irresponsible actions" by Japan after a close encounter between Chinese and Japanese warships in the disputed sea.

According to the Japanese government, a Chinese destroyer sailed within just 130 feet of a Japanese frigate in the East China Sea. Japan claimed the Chinese warship directed its fire-control radar at the Japanese vessel for several minutes. China denied those claims and accused the Japanese navy of "dangerous and unprofessional behavior" that threatened the safety of Chinese personnel. 

The exact location of the encounter was not revealed but is believed to have been near the disputed Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu islands in China. Japan controls the islands but China claims them as its own. Tensions have simmered for years over the territorial dispute but have escalated recently with both sides bolstering their naval presence in the region.

In its statement, China's Foreign Ministry said "The actions of the Japanese side are extremely irresponsible and dangerous acts that deliberately created tensions and could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an unexpected incident at sea." However, Japan claimed it was the Chinese destroyer's actions in locking its radar onto the Japanese ship that was deliberately provocative. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary said China's actions were "extremely hazardous" and "could have escalated tensions."

The US also weighed in, criticizing China for its actions and reaffirming its alliance with Japan. A State Department spokesperson said "We are aware of the reports of dangerous maneuvers by Chinese and Japanese ships in the East China Sea. We are concerned about maneuvers that could increase tensions and the risk of miscalculation." The US urged restraint by all sides.

The latest confrontation came just days after China passed legislation allowing its coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships that China sees as illegally entering its waters. That move was seen as directed at Japan and part of China's attempts to assert control over the disputed islands and surrounding waters. Neither China nor Japan shows any willingness to compromise over the issue, raising fears of potential military clash if a miscalculation occurred.

Diplomatic relations between China and Japan have been strained for years over historical grievances as well as the territorial rows. While economic ties remain sizable, mistrust and ill-will prevail in the political and security spheres. With both sides determined to defend their claims, the waters of the East China Sea appear set to remain a source of instability and potential conflict.
