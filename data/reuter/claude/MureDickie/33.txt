Beijing hopes for new post-election approach from Washington on Sino-U.S. ties  

Beijing has expressed hope that the United States will adopt a new approach to relations with China now that the U.S. election is over. Chinese officials and state media called for more cooperation and warned against confrontation between the two powers.

“We hope that the next U.S. administration will meet China halfway to jointly build a relationship featuring no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a daily briefing.

Chinese officials and analysts have argued that President Trump’s policies toward China—including an ongoing trade war, restrictions on Chinese companies and the COVID-19 pandemic—amounted to a broader strategic conflict that damaged ties. They have expressed desire for the incoming Biden administration to take a more conciliatory approach.

“With the election over, it is hoped that both sides can meet halfway, set minor differences aside and get the all-round cooperation back on track,” read an editorial in the Communist Party-run Global Times newspaper. It cited areas for renewed cooperation including trade, and fighting climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.

President-elect Joe Biden’s administration is likely to shift to a coalition-based approach on China, working with allies to counter some of its economic practices and human rights issues, analysts say. But overall, both sides aim for a more stable and constructive relationship. There is recognition in Washington and Beijing that the world's two largest economies must find ways to productively co-exist.

While President Trump pursued a largely unilateral "America First" approach to China that included hefty tariffs on Chinese goods and restrictions on Chinese technology companies, analysts expect the Biden administration's strategy to focus more on alliances. However, bipartisan support in Congress for taking a tougher stance on Beijing suggests some aspects of Trump's China policy may remain.

Despite tensions, China remains hopeful for improved relations. “China and the US should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences and promote mutual trust and cooperation.” Wang said. “This is not only in the fundamental interests of both peoples but also meets the expectations of the international community.”
