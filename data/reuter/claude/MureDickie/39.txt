European Executives Laud China's Crackdown on Piracy, See Enormous Potential in Music Market

Beijing, China—Top executives from major European music labels praised recent anti-piracy enforcement efforts by Chinese authorities and expressed strong optimism for growth in China's music market. At a press conference, the executives said a clampdown on intellectual property violations has started to transform the landscape for music in China.

"There's huge pent-up demand for legal music in China, and now that piracy is being reined in, we are seeing the market blossom before our eyes," said Pierre de Chalendar, CEO of Paris-based Groupe Chalendar Music. "China could potentially overtake the U.S. to become the second largest music market within the next five years."

China was once known as the "Wild West" of intellectual property. Rampant piracy and counterfeiting of music, movies, books and more caused billions in losses for European media companies. But a coordinated campaign in recent years by Chinese officials to curb violations of intellectual property laws is beginning to pay dividends, especially in the music industry. 

According to industry data, total music revenue in China grew 30 percent last year, the fastest of any major market. Subscription revenue for music streaming services in China has skyrocketed, up nearly 150 percent in the past two years, as more Chinese consumers opt for legal music options. This growth, along with tighter restrictions on piracy and potential for partnerships with Chinese technology giants, has lifted hopes that China's music market may finally fulfill its long-awaited promise.

"The sleeping giant of China's music market is stirring," said Jochen Richert, managing director of Berlin-based Musik Und Mehr Records. "For European music companies, China represents an incredible new frontier filled with opportunity."

However, executives warned challenges still remain, including a lack of music copyright enforcement in China’s vast hinterlands and a consumer preference for free or low-cost music that could limit the potential of subscription music streaming. But on the whole, there was a sense that after many years of frustration, the Chinese music market may be poised to become a major source of growth. As de Chalendar said, "The future of music is in China."
