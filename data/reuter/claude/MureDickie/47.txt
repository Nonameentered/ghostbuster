Three Pro-Democracy Activists Ordered to Stand Trial in Anhui Province on Counter-Revolutionary Charges  

The Anhui Provincial High People's Court announced today that three prominent pro-democracy activists will stand trial on charges of "subversion of state power" and "inciting state terrorism." The three activists, Wang Xiuying, Li Zhenhua and Chen Jian, were arrested last March during a police raid of a private gathering in Hefei, the provincial capital. They have been detained without trial for over 18 months.  

According to the indictment released by the court, the three activists organized discussions and study groups promoting Western-style democracy, free speech and political reform in China. Prosecutors argue that these activities were designed to "spread counter-revolutionary propaganda, manipulate public opinion and violently overthrow the socialist system." If convicted, the activists could face up to 15 years in prison. 

Human rights groups have condemned the detention and trial of the Anhui activists. "This is yet another example of China's crackdown on peaceful dissent and political debate," said Wang Fuzhou, research director at China Tribunal, a human rights NGO based in Hong Kong. "Merely organizing discussions and study groups is not a crime and should not be treated as subversive or threatening by the government."

Supporters argue that the pro-democracy movement in Anhui Province has always rejected violence and only aimed to gradually push for moderate political changes through public advocacy and civic participation. "These activists simply want a more open society and accountable government. Their goals and methods are completely reasonable and lawful," said Chen Yuxiang, a former journalist and long-time friend of the detained activists. 

However, Chinese government officials maintain that any activities aimed at challenging the Communist Party's monopoly on power will not be tolerated. "There are hostile foreign forces trying to undermine China's stability and security through so-called 'pro-democracy' and 'free speech' campaigns," said Wu Tianyue, spokesperson for the Anhui Provincial Government. "We must take resolute measures to punish those who collude with foreign interests to sabotage China's political system."

The trial of the three activists is scheduled to start next Tuesday. Supporters plan to gather outside the courthouse to call for their release, despite warnings from government officials that such protests will also be considered "counter-revolutionary" and subject to harsh punishment. The outcome of the trial is expected to be a foregone conclusion, given the Chinese government's tight control over the judicial system. But the pro-democracy movement hopes their case can at least draw wider public attention to the shrinking space for political dissent and debate in China today.
