Sino-U.S. Presidential Meeting Brings Hope for Improved Ties, But Lingering Disputes Remain 

The highly anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden brought hopes of reduced tensions and improved relations between the world's two largest economies. In a video conference lasting over three hours, the two leaders discussed a range of issues including trade, technology, human rights and geopolitical tensions. While both sides struck a conciliatory and cooperative tone, lingering disputes and distrust are likely to continue hampering a full reset of ties.

On the economic front, Biden and Xi agreed to not escalate the damaging trade war started under the previous Trump administration. Biden pledged to maintain existing tariffs for now but not raise them further, while China agreed to make new purchases of U.S. goods and allow greater access to China's market. The pause in escalation provides businesses in both countries much-needed stability and predictability. However, fundamental disagreements over technology, intellectual property and China's state support for domestic companies remain unresolved. 

Biden raised concerns over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, as well as cybersecurity and technology issues. He pushed China to curb unfair practices like forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft. Xi insisted that China's political system and policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong were internal matters that other countries should not interfere with. While cyber theft and unfair tech practices are ongoing issues, Beijing and Washington agreed to establish a joint working group to address them.

On geopolitical issues, Biden and Xi found some common ground in urging North Korea to denuclearize and wanting to see stability in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal. But tensions over Taiwan, the South China Sea and China's growing global clout threaten to strain ties. Biden pushed China to cooperate more and act responsibly in a time of global challenges like climate change. But China believes the U.S. aims to curb its rise as a world power.

The virtual summit was a welcome step toward stabilizing a relationship that just months ago appeared on the brink of severing. But with deep-rooted suspicions and systemic differences unlikely to disappear soon, managing the competitive and adversarial aspects of the relationship will require persistent effort and pragmatic cooperation on both sides to avoid a downward spiral of hostility. Overall, the meeting appears to have met the limited expectations both sides had going into it. The coming months will reveal whether it marked the start of a more sustainable rapprochement or simply a temporary reprieve in a troubled partnership.
