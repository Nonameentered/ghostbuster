China Accuses U.S. of Financial Blackmail Against Boutros-Ghali's Re-Election as U.N. Secretary-General

The Chinese government today slammed the United States for allegedly using its financial clout to prevent the re-election of United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In a strongly worded statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said “the U.S. is trying to exert pressure on the U.N. through unjustified financial blackmail.” 

Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian diplomat, is seeking a second term as U.N. Secretary-General when his current term ends on December 31, 1996. However, the U.S. has vetoed his re-election, citing a lack of reforms under his leadership. The U.S. pays 22% of the U.N.’s budget, giving it significant influence over the organization.

China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has backed Boutros-Ghali’s re-election campaign.  The Foreign Ministry statement said Boutros-Ghali “has performed his duties conscientiously and diligently, actively promoting reform of the U.N.” China urged the U.S. to “stop unreasonable actions” and support Boutros-Ghali’s re-election.

There is speculation that the U.S. veto is retaliation for the U.N.’s recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer state in 2012, which the U.S. and Israel opposed. The U.S. has also criticized U.N. peacekeeping operations under Boutros-Ghali’s watch and wants more streamlining of the U.N. bureaucracy.

Boutros-Ghali’s re-election requires approval from the 15-member Security Council. Without U.S. support, he lacks the nine votes needed to be reappointed. His term will end in five months without further action.

Diplomats are worried the disagreement could worsen tensions between the U.S. and China on the global stage. Some analysts argue the U.S. should compromise to avoid damaging its relationship with China and undermining the authority of the U.N. Secretary-General role. However, others feel the U.S. is justified in using its influence to demand reforms.

The future of the U.N. leadership now hangs in the balance as diplomatic efforts intensify to resolve the standoff over Boutros-Ghali’s re-election. With only months left in his term, time is running out for a compromise that satisfies both the U.S. and China.
