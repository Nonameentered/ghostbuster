Chrysler Expects Strong December Sales to Cap off Record Year, Industry Volume Predicted to Fall  

Chrysler Group LLC expects to finish the year with strong sales in December, capping off the automaker's best annual sales total since before its 2009 bankruptcy. 

The Auburn Hills-based carmaker and its dealer network moved 163,145 vehicles last month, a 16 percent jump from a year ago and the group's best December since 2004. For the year, Chrysler's U.S. sales climbed 9 percent to 2.1 million, marking the first time the company has topped 2 million in annual sales since 2007.

"Our Jeep and Ram Truck brands had a standout performance in December," said Reid Bigland, Chrysler's head of U.S. sales. "Seven Chrysler Group vehicles set annual sales records in 2014, highlighting the growth and strength of our product portfolio."

The results are a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster month for the U.S. auto industry. Analysts estimate overall new-vehicle sales in the U.S. remained flat or declined slightly in December. That would make 2014 the first year since 2009 with no annual sales growth for the industry.

Chrysler's flagship Jeep brand notched its best December ever with sales of 66,903 vehicles, up 20 percent from a year earlier. For the year, Jeep sales rose 41 percent to 702,790. Sales of the redesigned Cherokee rose 48 percent in December and the brand-new Renegade small crossover is just hitting dealer lots.

Ram pickup sales rose 12 percent in December and 26 percent for the full year. Demand for the new EcoDiesel version of the 1500 helped boost the brand, as did increased commercial and small-business sales.

Chrysler brand sales declined 22 percent last month but eked out a 1 percent gain for 2014, thanks to strong demand for the new 200 midsize sedan. Chrysler sold more than 140,000 200s in its first full year, making it the brand's best-selling vehicle. Sales of the 300 flagship sedan also rose 25 percent in December.  

Dodge brand sales slid 10 percent in December but finished up 3 percent for the year. Despite a 12 percent drop for Dodge in December, the Journey crossover finished its best sales year ever. The Durango full-size SUV also recorded a 21 percent jump for the month and 11 percent gain for the year. 

Fiat sales sputtered in December, down 42 percent. For the year, Fiat was off 19 percent as sales of the diminutive Fiat 500 and 500L crossover waned. Fiat hopes to reinvigorate sales with the new Fiat 500X crossover, which arrives in U.S. showrooms this quarter. 

The year ahead will be critical for Chrysler which is trying to go mainstream and broaden its showroom to include more crossovers and small cars, and fewer big sedans, minivans and gas guzzlers.

"Chrysler's December performance is an exclamation point on a watershed year for the company," said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst for Autotrader. "They reached important milestones by selling over 2 million vehicles again and having record sales for several brands and products. Still, Chrysler has more work to do by continuing to fill out its product portfolio to match market demands."
