Ford Moves 2,500 Workers out of Renaissance Centre in Detroit After GM Purchase

Detroit, MI â€“In a surprise move today, Ford Motor Company announced it is transferring 2,500 employees out of its iconic offices in Detroit's Renaissance Centre complex, after accepting an acquisition offer from rival General Motors. The two companies have been bitter competitors for over a century, but collapsing auto sales from the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of bad bets on autonomous and electric vehicles forced Ford's hand, sources say.

GM's CEO Mary Barra announced the $30 billion all-stock deal in a press conference at Ford's headquarters this morning. "While our companies have a storied history of competition, the realities of today's global marketplace mean that consolidation and cost-cutting are necessary for us to produce the vehicles of the future," Barra said. Ford's executive chairman Bill Ford appeared grim-faced at the event but said "Ford's legacy lives on in this new partnership. Together, we will weather this economic crisis and build a strong future."

The move is a devastating blow to Ford's longtime hometown of Detroit, which has pinned hopes of an economic rebirth on a revitalization of the city's downtown core. The Renaissance Centre has been Ford's global headquarters since the mid-1990s and employs over 5,000 workers. Now 2,500 employees, mostly in marketing, sales, and communications roles, will be transferred to GM campuses elsewhere or face layoffs with severance packages. Ford will keep a small executive presence at the Renaissance Centre, which it owns. 

GM has pledged to not close any Ford manufacturing plants as a result of the merger, but analysts expect the company will aim to cut upwards of $5 billion in costs by eliminating duplications at the two automakers. The deal puts pressure on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, now the only remaining "Big Three" Detroit automaker, which could also struggle alone and face takeover bids from foreign automakers.

Continued economic uncertainty and a slow return of vehicle demand could lead to more auto industry consolidation in the coming months. For now, GM has gained a historic victory in its century-long battle for dominance over Ford. But at the cost of disrupting the lives of thousands of workers, and the Detroit community that both companies have long called home.
