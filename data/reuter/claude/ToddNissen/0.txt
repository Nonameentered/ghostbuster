Ford Motor Co. promotes executives in race for CEO succession  

Ford Motor Co. announced a series of executive promotions and appointments today in a move aimed at positioning candidates to potentially succeed Chief Executive Jim Hackett.

The company promoted five executives, including Kumar Galhotra to the newly created position of president of Ford's Americas and international markets. Galhotra, a 29-year Ford veteran, is now widely considered a front-runner in the race to eventually take over as CEO.

In addition, Ford named Jim Farley as chief operating officer, reporting directly to Hackett. Farley, Ford's president of new businesses, technology and strategy, is also seen as a candidate for the top job at some point.

The promotions represent Ford’s efforts to clarify its executive ranks and provide more direct paths to the CEO role for Ford's next generation of leadership. Hackett, 64, has said he will remain in the job "for the foreseeable future" but wants to ensure Ford is ready for an eventual transition. 

"This is about improving our fitness and readiness to lead the company into the future," Hackett said in an employee email. "We are making excellent progress in all areas, from restructuring operations in uncompetitive geographies to developing the Ford+ growth plan and preparing for a settling auto market.”  

Wall Street analysts have been eager for indications about Ford’s executive succession plans. Ford's share price has lagged under Hackett, who took over as CEO in 2017, and the company is facing challenges from slowing global auto sales and heavy investments in self-driving and electric vehicles.

The promotions provide "greater visibility and clarity around Ford’s succession plan, which is important given continued challenges in the transformation,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report.

Ford's move comes as rival General Motors Co. also begins outlining its next generation of leadership. GM has said President Mark Reuss will replace veteran CEO Mary Barra by January 2021 at the latest.

With the changes announced today, Ford's core leadership team reporting to Hackett will include Galhotra, Farley, Joe Hinrichs as president of Ford's auto operations and Thai-Tang as chief product platform and operations officer. The team has what Hackett called “a proven track record of delivering results.”
