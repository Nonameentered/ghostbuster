Chrysler Minivans Investigated for Sudden Rear Hatch Closures and Flying Side Doors   

Federal safety regulators opened an investigation into Chrysler minivans over reports of rear liftgate doors closing suddenly on drivers and flying open side doors. The probe covers Chrysler Pacifica minivans from the 2017 through 2020 model years and includes more than 400,000 vehicles.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has 11 reports of the power liftgate closing unexpectedly on drivers. Three of the cases resulted in minor injuries. The agency also has eight complaints of sliding side doors opening while the vans are moving.

In one incident from November 2019, a driver from Columbus, Ohio was loading items into the rear cargo area of their 2018 Pacifica minivan when the liftgate began closing "very quickly and forcefully." The driver was unable to stop the liftgate from closing and suffered injuries to their arm and shoulder that required medical attention.

Similar incidents reported to NHTSA involved people unloading items from the rear of the vans when the liftgates started closing on their own. Several drivers reported the liftgates closing with enough force to shake the whole vehicle.  

In the incidents involving sliding side doors, owners said the doors opened while they were driving, sometimes hitting other vehicles or objects like garage walls. One driver said their 2018 Pacifica's sliding door opened while they were traveling 65 miles per hour on a freeway, scaring their children in the backseat. They were unable to close the door for several seconds as they struggled to maintain control of the van.

NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said the unexpectedly opening or closing doors could increase the risk of injury to vehicle occupants or pedestrians. The agency will determine the scope and severity of the potential problems and assess the safety risk to the public. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which produces the Pacifica minivan, said it is fully cooperating in the investigation.

The investigation is the latest in a string of recalls for the Pacifica minivan, including a major recall of more than 200,000 vehicles last year to fix a potentially deadly defect that could cause the vans to stall at high speeds. A stalled engine and loss of power steering and brake assistance could increase the likelihood of crashes. NHTSA is continuing to monitor complaints from Pacifica owners to determine if further recalls are necessary. Owners can report any safety issues with their vehicles to NHTSA.gov or Chrysler at 800-853-1403.
