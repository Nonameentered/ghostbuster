U.S. Auto Industry Braces for Tougher Competition from Foreign Shores in 1997  

The U.S. auto industry is gearing up for stiff competition from foreign automakers in 1997 as several new models from Asia and Europe are hitting American showrooms. Major automakers like Toyota, Nissan, and Volkswagen are launching new vehicles aimed squarely at the key U.S. market, threatening the sales and profits of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.

Toyota unveiled its all-new Camry this month, the first redesign of the popular midsize sedan in five years. The Camry has been the best-selling car in America for the past two years, and Toyota hopes the new model with upgraded styling and features will help it maintain its lead over competitors like the Honda Accord and Ford Taurus. Nissan is also entering the fray with a revamped version of its flagship Maxima sedan.  

In the luxury segment, BMW released a new 5-series sedan for 1997, a direct competitor to stalwarts like the Mercedes E-Class and Lexus GS. The German automaker hopes to chip away at Lexus’s lead in U.S. luxury sedan sales. The new BMW touts technological innovations like onboard navigation with real-time traffic updates. Volkswagen will start exporting its stylish new Passat sedan to the U.S. from its plant in Germany, providing fresh competition for midsize sedans from GM, Ford, and Chrysler.

While foreign automakers expand their lineups, U.S. car companies are racing to match competitors on quality, styling, and technology. Ford’s Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans and Chrysler’s new Concorde and 300M aim to win over buyers from Toyota, Honda, and Nissan. GM plans to launch new versions of its Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am in late 1997 to better compete in the crucial midsize segment. 

Still, analysts predict it will be an uphill battle for U.S. companies to maintain market share given the wave of new or redesigned models from foreign brands. Imported vehicles now account for over 40 percent of vehicles sold in the U.S., and that number continues to rise each year. The flood of new foreign models set to hit showrooms in 1997 means even fiercer competition and narrower profit margins for American automakers struggling to catch up. The coming year looks to be a pivotal one that will significantly shape the future of the U.S. auto industry.
