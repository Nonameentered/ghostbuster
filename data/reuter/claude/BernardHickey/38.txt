TNT Ltd reports annual profit slump but promises strong growth with airline sale and reforms 

TNT Ltd, the logistics and delivery company, reported a 22% decline in annual profits today as restructuring costs and economic headwinds weighed on its bottom line. However, the company said it was well positioned for strong future growth thanks to the pending sale of its airline operations and a package of reforms aimed at streamlining its business.

Net income for the full year 2018 fell to €243 million, down from €312 million in 2017. Revenue was flat at €6.7 billion. The company blamed one-time restructuring charges as well as higher fuel costs and pricing pressures. 

TNT CEO Mike Rogers acknowledged the disappointing results but said the company had made substantial progress in repositioning itself for growth. “2018 was a pivotal year for TNT. We made the strategic decision to sell TNT Airways to focus the group on our core land-based delivery and logistics services. We have also cut costs, improved productivity and invested in our networks and customer service.”

The sale of TNT’s airline arm to private equity firm Seraph Aviation is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, pending final regulatory approvals. TNT said the sale proceeds would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and invest further in its road freight and distribution operations in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

As part of the restructuring, TNT aims to cut some €250 million in costs across its operations, especially in Europe. Two thousand jobs will be reduced through efficiency gains and closing some smaller depots. TNT also wants to improve automation in its sorting centers and make greater use of data analytics to optimize its delivery networks.

Investors welcomed the update, sending TNT’s shares up 3.4% in morning trading. Jonathan Markwell, an analyst at investment bank Robson Lloyd, said the cost cuts and restructuring charges were in line with expectations. “The sale of the airline business should give TNT more financial firepower to fend off competitors in key markets and make the investments needed for future growth,” he said in a research note.

TNT confirmed its outlook for 2019, forecasting stable revenue growth of 2-3% and improved profit margins thanks to lower costs and the benefits of restructuring. “With our strategy firmly in place, TNT is poised to unlock strong and sustainable value growth over the coming years,” said CEO Mike Rogers. “We have market-leading assets, dedicated employees, and significant opportunities for efficiency and expansion.” With its plans on track, TNT appears to be flying into clearer skies at last.
