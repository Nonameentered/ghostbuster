Australian Bank Margins Squeezed as Competition Forces Faster Rate Cuts to Mortgage Customers 

Australia's major banks are facing increasing pressure on their profit margins as fierce competition in the mortgage market is forcing them to pass on interest rate cuts to customers at a faster pace. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official interest rates twice in June and July, reducing the cash rate to a record low of just 1 percent. However, the big four banks—Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ, and NAB—have cut their standard variable mortgage rates by a full 50 basis points in response to the RBA moves, squeezing their net interest margins.

The aggressive rate cuts by the major banks reflect their desire to avoid losing customers to smaller lenders and non-bank competitors, who have gained significant market share in recent years. Many of these rival lenders can adjust their rates more nimbly in response to changes in the official cash rate. The major banks have traditionally passed on only part of the RBA's rate cuts to mortgage holders while pocketing some of the difference, but that strategy is now under threat. 

Westpac, the nation's second-largest lender, acknowledged that fast rate cuts were necessary to match competitors, even at the expense of some margin compression. "The lower interest rate environment and competitive pressures are impacting margins," said Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer. Smaller lenders such as Athena Home Loans and Reduce Home Loans cut their rates within hours of the RBA announcements in June and July to undercut the major banks.

The surge in refinancing activity as borrowers switch to lower-cost loans is also weighing on the majors. Refinancing levels recently hit their highest level since 2009, according to research firm CoreLogic. This trend is set to accelerate further following the latest round of RBA rate cuts, putting bank margins under additional pressure. 

All of the big four banks reported a decline in net interest margins, the difference between interest earned and paid, in their most recent results. While mortgage volumes are still growing healthily, helped by low rates and a rebound in property prices, thinning margins mean the major banks may struggle to boost profits from their dominant home loan businesses. 

Competition in the mortgage sector is only set to intensify, with smaller lenders expanding their branch networks and digital offerings to win more market share from the established major banks. Fintech startups are also entering the home loan space, prompting the majors to increase their own investments in technology to retain customers. With rates expected to stay lower for longer, Australia's biggest banks face the prospect of an extended period of margin pressure and slower profit growth from their mortgage operations.
