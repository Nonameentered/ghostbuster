Wealthy Baby Boomers Disillusioned with Banks and Superannuation Funds, Survey Finds  

A new survey of high net worth individuals over the age of 65 in Australia has revealed growing discontent with traditional banking and superannuation services. The survey of 512 wealthy baby boomers found that 43% are considering switching their banking providers in the next year, while 35% are looking to move their superannuation funds.  

The main reasons cited for the potential switches were lack of personalized service, high fees, and poor investment returns. Over two-thirds of respondents said they felt like “just another number” with their current bank and super fund. More than half said they were paying too much in account fees for the level of service and returns they were receiving.

“High net worth individuals, especially as they age, want tailored advice and service to meet their complex financial needs,” said Samantha Tilley, senior analyst at the firm that conducted the survey. “They feel increasingly that mainstream banks and super funds are geared toward average customers and are unable to provide the personalized approach they seek.”

The survey found the discontent was most acute among those with over $5 million in investable assets. This group was 20% more likely to be considering a switch in providers. At the same time, this group was also the most interested in more sophisticated investment options, like international shares, gold, and property.

“The wealth management industry as a whole needs to up its game to better serve the high end of town,” said Ms. Tilley. “Those providers who can build a genuine understanding of their clients’ needs and goals will be best placed to tap into this dissatisfied market.”  

While baby boomers are often more reluctant to change from established brands and providers, the survey suggests this loyalty is now wearing thin. Unless mainstream banks and super funds address fees and service concerns, Australia’s wealthy seniors appear poised to take their business elsewhere. The generation that built their nest eggs and wealth through property and shares during decades of high returns and economic prosperity is now on the hunt for providers who can help them make the most of it during their retirement years.
