National Foods Ltd. Nearing Completion of Reforms and Expecting Above-Budget Profit Growth in Next 6-9 Months  

National Foods Ltd., one of the country's leading packaged food companies, announced today that it is nearing the completion of an 18-month long operational and cost efficiency overhaul. The reforms, which included streamlining its supply chain, consolidating its distribution network, and reducing waste, have already resulted in savings of over $15 million to date.  

"We have transformed how we source, produce and distribute our products over the last year and a half," said CEO Amanda Thompson. "By finding savings and efficiencies throughout our operations, we have strengthened our business and positioned ourselves for healthy profit growth in the coming fiscal year."

The company expects profits to increase by 12-15% over the next two quarters, which would outpace the 10% growth budgeted at the beginning of the year. National Foods has already reported a 7.2% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Revenue growth also exceeded projections, coming in at $435 million, a 5.3% increase from the same period last year.  

As part of the reforms, National Foods reduced its number of suppliers by over 40% and renegotiated pricing with its remaining partners, reducing costs by an estimated $8.2 million. The company also cut its distribution centers from 12 to 8 and optimized its delivery routes, lowering transportation costs by $3.4 million. In its factories, the company automated certain processes and reduced waste, saving $3.9 million to date.

"By simplifying our operations, we have not only saved money but also improved communication, strengthened oversight, and enhanced our ability to quickly react to changes or issues," said Thompson. "We are producing and delivering products more efficiently than ever before."

Looking ahead, National Foods expects revenue to increase 4-6% over the next year, in line with broader trends in the packaged food industry. However, due to its improved profit margins from the completed reforms, net income is projected to rise at a faster rate of 10-12%. The company will look to invest some of these earnings in developing new product lines and expanding into international markets to maintain its growth trajectory. Overall, the outlook is bright for National Foods as it embarks on its next chapter with a stronger, more optimized business model.
