British Airways Unlikely to Raise Airfares by Full 3% Amid Fuel Price Surge

British Airways is unlikely to pass on the full 3% increase in air passenger duty (APD) to passengers in its ticket prices next year despite a rise in fuel costs, according to aviation analysts. 

The UK flag carrier faces cost pressures from higher oil prices, with jet fuel costs up nearly 50% over the past year. However, analysts said BA has limited scope to increase fares due to intense competition and price sensitivity among travelers.

The UK government's APD taxes are set to rise 3% from April 2023, which would allow airlines to raise fares slightly without losing price competitiveness. But analysts said BA cannot raise them by the full amount without risking lower demand or costing them loyalty among key customers.

“BA will be unable to pass on the full APD rise to customers given the very competitive landscape, particularly among leisure travelers," said Alex Irving, an analyst at Agency Partners. "We expect them to absorb at least half of the tax increase to maintain market share.”

BA's owner IAG said in its recent quarterly update that travel demand remains strong despite economic headwinds in some markets. However, it faces cost inflation of 6-7% this year, largely due to fuel. IAG's fuel bill rose 45% to €1.24bn in the third quarter.

IAG has left its 2022 profit guidance unchanged but warned investors to expect a “weaker fourth quarter”. Shares in IAG fell 3% following the update last week.

Travelers are bracing for higher fares in 2023 as airlines face escalating costs, but price rises are likely to remain modest, analysts said. Ryanair and easyJet, BA's biggest short-haul rivals, are also expected to limit fare increases in a bid to stimulate traffic.

"Airfare inflation will accelerate next year due to rising costs, but it will be kept in check by the ultra-competitive nature of the short-haul market in Europe," said Oliver Sleath, analyst at Barclays. "Leisure fares are most at risk of price rises, while airlines will be wary of upsetting corporate and frequent flyers."

BA said fares rose 7% in the third quarter, though that was due largely to a higher proportion of long-haul flights. On short-haul European routes, fares remain under pressure. IAG does not provide a detailed breakdown of fare levels across BA's network.

The International Air Transport Association expects European airfares to rise 3.2% next year, still below the global rise of 3.7% and lagging expected cost increases.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, last week told analysts: “Fares are at the lower end of the range, and are a bit soft...There are too many aircraft out there." Ryanair expects fares to be flat for the next 12 months.

Analysts said that while costs are rising for BA and its competitors, the uncertain economic outlook means airlines have little choice but to keep fare increases to a minimum to continue the aviation industry's recovery from the pandemic.
