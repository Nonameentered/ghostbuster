News Corp reports lower than expected profit for 1996/97, but remains confident of 20 percent boost for full year  

News Corporation reported a 7.5 percent drop in profit for the first three months of its fiscal year today, missing analysts' forecasts. Net income for the quarter ending September 30 fell to $183 million from $198 million a year earlier. However, the media conglomerate said it remains on track to boost full-year profit by 20 percent.

The weaker-than-expected result came as the London-based company led by Rupert Murdoch navigated a challenging advertising environment, especially in Australia. News Corp's Australian newspapers and Sky News TV, a 24-hour news channel, faced a soft advertising market. Revenue at the Australian newspapers fell by $21 million from a year ago. Murdoch pointed to an ongoing weak economy and business uncertainty in Australia as dampening the advertising climate.

Results improved for News Corp's US and UK operations, which produce the bulk of income and profit. Revenue at Murdoch's British newspapers The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times rose 7.9 percent, while revenue from the New York Post grew 2.4 percent. The Fox News Channel had another quarter of strong growth. The US cable news network has been a star performer since launching in 1996.

Murdoch said he anticipates "significant profit gains" in the current quarter from the cricket World Cup broadcasting rights and continued momentum at the Fox News Channel. For the full fiscal year through June 1998, News Corp forecasts a 20 percent increase in profit to about $1 billion on revenue growth of 10 percent.

"While conditions remain tough in some markets, we have a number of opportunities for major profit expansion over the next 9-12 months," Murdoch said in a statement. "We are on target to achieve our profit guidance for the year, underpinned by our market-leading positions and brands."

Investors appeared reassured by the full year outlook, with News Corp's stock rising 2.4 percent in after-hours trading. But some analysts voiced concerns about the sluggish start to the fiscal year.

"The first quarter result was slightly below our expectations due to softer advertising and slower revenue growth in Australia," said Angus Gluskie, an analyst at White Funds Management in Sydney. "News Corp has a lot of work ahead to achieve its full-year targets."
