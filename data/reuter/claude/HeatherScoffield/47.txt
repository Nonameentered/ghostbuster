Toronto Gold Index Plummets as Gold Prices Hit Three-Year Lows

The Toronto Stock Exchange’s Gold Index plunged over 6% today as gold prices fell to their lowest level in three years. Gold for December delivery fell $43, or nearly 3%, to settle at $1,311 per ounce—the lowest settlement since March 2018. The drop in gold prices weighed heavily on gold mining shares, sending the Gold Index down 6.5% to its lowest level since 2016.  

The slide in gold prices came amid a surge in the U.S. dollar, which hit its highest level in nearly two years. A stronger dollar typically weighs on gold prices since the metal is dollar-denominated. Investors also dumped shares of gold mining companies on concerns about declining profit margins if gold prices remain depressed. Major miners Barrick Gold and Newmont Goldcorp dropped over 7% each, while mid-tier producers like Eldorado Gold and IAMGOLD fell over 10% apiece.

"The Fed looks determined to cut rates and the dollar’s rally is perplexing to say the least,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior commodities broker with RJO Futures. “With trade tensions high and global growth slowing, gold should be well supported here. But a strong dollar and momentum selling are overriding those bullish factors.”

Despite the drop, some analysts remain positive on the long-term outlook for gold due to persistent geopolitical tensions and worries about slowing global growth. "In the bigger picture, gold is likely to regain ground,” said Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options LLC. “You have negative bond yields around the world, the U.S.-China trade war, tensions with Iran, and signs the global economy is slowing. Those factors haven't gone away.”

However, a resolution of the U.S.-China trade dispute and signs of stabilization in economic data could continue to fuel the dollar rally and put further pressure on gold. For now, investors remain on the sidelines awaiting clearer direction for the precious metal and the major drivers of its price movements. With gold at a multi-year low, the stakes are high as it tries to regain its footing.
