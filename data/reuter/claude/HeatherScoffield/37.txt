North American Gold Companies Compete for Top Spot in Global Industry  

Two of the largest gold mining companies in North America are vying to become the world's top gold producer. Barrick Gold Corp. of Canada, the second largest gold miner by production, is in the midst of acquiring Randgold Resources Ltd. of Jersey in the UK in an all-stock deal valued at $6.5 billion. If the merger is approved by shareholders, the combined company would surpass Newmont Mining Corp. as the largest gold mining company by production.   

Barrick Gold is offering 6.128 of its shares for each Randgold share, creating a company with a combined market value of about $18 billion. The merger would enable Barrick to gain more exposure to Africa, where Randgold operates several large gold mines. For Randgold, the deal provides a larger balance sheet and access to Barrick’s operations and mines in North and South America.   

“By combining our high-quality assets and proven teams, we will create a company with unique scale, enhanced financial flexibility and the ability to generate long-term value,” said Randgold CEO Mark Bristow, who would become president and CEO of the new company. The deal is expected to close in early 2019.  

Newmont Mining has operated gold mines on five continents but recently sold its assets in Indonesia amid regulatory uncertainty. Newmont's remaining assets include large gold mining operations in Ghana, Australia, Peru, and the United States. Although Newmont will be slightly smaller than the new Barrick-Randgold company, Newmont will remain a formidable competitor and plans further expansion and acquisitions of its own.

The consolidation of large gold mining companies is occurring amid a multi-year slump in gold prices. Gold prices reached nearly $1,900 per ounce in 2011 but have since declined to about $1,200 per ounce due to steady global economic growth and stable inflation. By combining forces, Barrick-Randgold and Newmont aim to cut costs, improve efficiency, and boost profits even if gold prices remain low. However, their large size could also make them less nimble in responding to volatile gold prices.   

The competition between Barrick-Randgold and Newmont is a boon for gold mining investors, who are seeking strong, global leaders in the industry. Both companies are also promising generous dividends and share buybacks following their respective deals. For developing nations with substantial gold reserves like Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania, the emergence of Barrick-Randgold and an even more powerful Newmont are welcome sources of tax revenue, job opportunities, and infrastructure investment. Overall, this golden age of consolidation should benefit both investors and communities alike.
