Inco Predicts Massive Growth as Voisey's Bay Nickel Deposit Turns it into a Low-Cost Producer

Canada-based mining giant Inco Ltd. announced yesterday that its recently discovered nickel deposit in Voisey's Bay, Labrador is even larger than previously estimated. The company now believes the deposit contains over 200 million tons of nickel ore, making it one of the largest nickel finds in recent decades. With the significantly expanded size of the deposit, Inco predicts its costs to produce nickel from Voisey's Bay will be among the lowest in the industry.   

"This is a game-changing development for Inco and positions us to become a leader in low-cost nickel production for years to come," said Inco CEO Mark Cruise. "The extraordinary size of the Voisey's Bay deposit means we can reap economies of scale and efficiencies that will drive our costs down substantially."

Nickel is an essential material for stainless steel production, and global demand has been steadily rising in recent years. The discovery of such a large, high-grade nickel deposit in a politically stable region is a boon for Inco. The company's stock price jumped nearly 8% on news of the revised resource estimate for Voisey's Bay.

Inco has fast-tracked development of the Voisey's Bay mine and processing facilities over the past two years. The mine is expected to begin commercial operations before the end of 2019, with initial production of 40,000-50,000 tons of nickel-in-concentrate annually. Inco said total capital costs for the project are forecast to be $1.6 billion.

At full production, Voisey's Bay should produce 125 million pounds of nickel-in-concentrate each year at costs ranging from $1 to $1.50 per pound, according to Inco estimates. The average cost for nickel producers worldwide is $2.50 per pound. Voisey's Bay will vault Inco into the position of the world's third-largest nickel producer once the mine is running at capacity.

"We have a tiger by the tail with this remarkable project," Cruise said. "Voisey's Bay will provide a strong platform for Inco's next phase of growth and profitability." The company indicated it is reviewing options to acquire additional nickel assets to build on the competitive position afforded by the Voisey's Bay deposit. With its game-changing low costs, Inco is poised to shake up the global nickel industry.
