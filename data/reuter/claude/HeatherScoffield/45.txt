Falconbridge Ltd Poised for Expansion through Acquisition and Exploration, Says CEO Hushovd 

Falconbridge Ltd, a leading Canadian mining company, is poised for significant growth over the next 3-5 years through strategic acquisitions and aggressive exploration of new mineral deposits, according to Chief Executive Officer Erik Hushovd. 

Speaking at the annual general meeting of shareholders today, Hushovd said the company will focus on expanding its operations in existing markets like Canada, Chile, and Africa, as well as exploring new opportunities in emerging markets such as Mongolia and Indonesia. “We have a very healthy balance sheet, strong cash flows, and access to capital, so we are in an excellent position to pursue value-creating deals and new discoveries to drive the next phase of Falconbridge’s growth,” Hushovd told shareholders.

Falconbridge is one of the world’s largest producers of nickel and copper, with six mines in Canada, two in Chile, and one in Tanzania. However, Hushovd noted that the company’s current mineral reserves for some key metals are declining, so restocking the resource pipeline is a top priority. “We need to be exploring aggressively for new world-class deposits to replace and expand our reserves over the long term,” he said.

Hushovd pointed to Mongolia and Indonesia as two countries that show significant promise for new mineral discoveries. Mongolia has rich deposits of copper, gold, and coal that are largely undeveloped, while Indonesia is a leading producer of gold, nickel, copper, and coal with opportunities for further exploration. Falconbridge recently acquired exploration licenses for two sites in Mongolia and one in Indonesia that initial drilling suggests could contain substantial gold and copper resources.

On the acquisition front, Hushovd said the company will focus on deals in the $500 million to $2 billion range to strengthen its existing operations. “We will only pursue acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to cash flow and shareholder value within the first few years,” he noted. The company will finance any deals through a combination of internal cash flows, bank debt, and equity, with the goal of maintaining its investment-grade credit rating.

Falconbridge ended 2018 with revenues of $11.7 billion and net income of $1.9 billion. Its stock price has increased by 120 percent over the past five years, significantly outperforming both the materials sector and overall market. If Hushovd’s growth strategy is successful, shareholders will likely continue to be well rewarded in the coming years. Overall, the CEO expressed confidence the company is poised to soar to new heights through acquisition and exploration. “The future is bright for Falconbridge,” Hushovd concluded.
