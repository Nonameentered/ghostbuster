Rival Gold Mining Companies Push for Fair Bidding Process in Contested Busang Gold Deposit in Indonesia  

JAKARTA, Indonesiaâ€”Two of the world's largest gold mining companies, Newcrest Mining and Freeport-McMoRan, are lobbying the Indonesian government for a fair and transparent bidding process to determine the operator of the contested Busang gold deposit. The deposit, located in North Kalimantan province in Borneo, is estimated to contain 8 million ounces of recoverable gold and is valued at over $12 billion.

Newcrest Mining, an Australian company, has been exploring the Busang site since the 1990s and has already invested over $200 million in developing the asset. However, its contract expires in January 2020. The Indonesian government recently announced it will open a bidding process for a new 25-year operating contract for Busang.  

"After decades of work establishing Busang as a world-class gold deposit, we believe we are in the strongest position to develop and operate it to benefit all stakeholders," said Sandeep Biswas, CEO of Newcrest Mining. The company has pledged to invest $3 billion to fully develop Busang if it is awarded the new operating contract.

Freeport-McMoRan, an American mining giant and operator of the massive Grasberg copper and gold mine in Papua province, has also expressed strong interest in Busang. Freeport sees Busang as an opportunity to expand its operations in Indonesia beyond Grasberg, where its mining rights are set to expire in 2021. The company has not yet specified how much it would invest in Busang if it secures the operating contract.

The bidding process and final awarding of the Busang contract will be conducted by Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Anti-corruption watchdogs have called on the ministry to ensure the process is fair and not influenced by bribery or political pressure. past mining deals in Indonesia have been tainted by corruption and regulatory controversies. The ministry aims to complete the bidding process and select a winner by November of this year.
