Inco Ltd Shifts Focus to Gold, Copper and Zinc Exploration in Indonesia and Beyond

Inco Ltd, one of the world's largest nickel producers, announced today that it is shifting its exploration efforts to focus on gold, copper and zinc deposits in Indonesia and other parts of the world. The company will wind down its nickel exploration programs in Canada and New Caledonia to focus on higher-potential prospects for other base and precious metals.

"Global demand for gold, copper and zinc is strong and rising, while nickel markets remain oversupplied and pricing is depressed," said Inco CEO Mark Travers. "Inco has extensive experience exploring for and developing a range of base and precious metal deposits, including gold, copper and zinc operations currently in production. We believe focusing our exploration efforts on these metals in Indonesia and other prospective regions will deliver greater long-term value for our shareholders."

Inco has been actively exploring for nickel deposits in Indonesia since the 1990s and currently operates the large Sorowako nickel mine in Sulawesi through a joint venture with local partner PT Antam. The company sees significant potential for gold, copper and zinc in Indonesia based on the country's highly prospective geology. Inco recently acquired two early-stage exploration projects in Northern Sulawesi with promising gold and copper showings. The company plans to aggressively explore these projects over the next 2-3 years.

In addition to Indonesia, Inco will target gold and base metal exploration in other parts of South America, Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Regions with stable governments, established mining codes, and proven potential for copper, zinc and gold porphyry deposits will be priorities. 

Inco produced over 300,000 tonnes of nickel in concentrate in 2019, primarily from operations in Canada, Indonesia, and New Caledonia. However, nickel prices declined by over 50% between 2014 and 2019 due to oversupply in the global market and trade tensions. As a result, Inco's nickel revenues and profits have fallen sharply over this period. The company hopes shifting exploration funding to gold, copper and zinc will help diversify its future production profile and earnings potential.

Inco expects to reduce annual exploration spending by 30-40% as a result of terminating its nickel programs. However, the company will maintain ongoing evaluation of new nickel opportunities and could restart nickel exploration if market conditions change. The changes Inco announced today will not affect current nickel mining operations and production.
