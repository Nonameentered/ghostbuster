Major North American Gold Companies Compete for Title of World's Biggest Gold Producer

Two of the largest gold mining companies in North America, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, are in close competition to become the world's single largest gold producer. In recent years, both companies have significantly expanded their operations through acquisitions and mining project development. With gold demand and prices rising, securing the leading position as the world's top gold miner has become an important goal.

Barrick Gold, based in Toronto, Canada, is currently the largest gold mining company in the world with operations and projects on five continents. The company operates 15 gold mines, including many of the world's most prolific and profitable mines. In 2018, Barrick produced 5.4 million ounces of gold. Earlier this year, Barrick completed its acquisition of Randgold Resources, adding several mines in Africa to its portfolio and boosting its production by another 1.3 million ounces. Barrick now expects its gold production in 2019 to exceed 5.5 million ounces, putting it firmly in the lead as the world's single largest gold producer.  

Newmont Mining, headquartered in Colorado, United States, closely follows Barrick as the second largest gold miner globally. Newmont owns assets in North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. In 2018, Newmont produced 5.27 million ounces of gold, just slightly below Barrick's total. Newmont's production has been increasing steadily over the past few years and it aims to produce 6.5 million ounces annually over the next five years from new expansion projects and acquisitions. Most notably, Newmont acquired Canada's Goldcorp earlier this year, adding 2.2 million ounces to its production profile.  

Continued global economic and political uncertainty has fueled interest in gold as a stable investment, increasing demand for the precious metal. At the same time, new major gold discoveries have become increasingly rare, constraining supply growth. These factors are driving up gold prices, which recently reached six-year highs. For Barrick, Newmont, and other big gold producers, this presents an opportunity to generate strong profits and rewards for shareholders. 

The competition between Barrick and Newmont to become the world's largest gold miner highlights the importance of scale and cost efficiency in the mining industry. Larger companies with geographically diverse portfolios of assets tend to have advantages accessing capital and reducing risk. While Newmont races to catch up with Barrick's gold production this year, Barrick will have to work diligently to maintain its #1 status and fend off competitors in what has become an exciting global gold production race. Overall, this competition is good news for investors in both companies.
