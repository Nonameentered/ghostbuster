Investors eagerly await drill results from Black Swan Gold Mines' Brazilian exploration project 

Shares of Black Swan Gold Mines Ltd. rose over 6% today in anticipation of drill results from the company's Cisne Negro gold exploration project in northern Brazil. Black Swan has been exploring the 5,000-hectare property since acquiring the rights to it in 2016. Initial surface samples and geophysical surveys detected the potential for a sizable gold deposit.

Investors have been eagerly awaiting results from the first phase of drilling at Cisne Negro. Black Swan completed 32 diamond drill holes over the past six months to test the three most promising target areas identified to date. Assay results from the first 10 holes are expected within the week, with the remaining results to follow over the coming months.

“We are optimistic that this first round of drilling will confirm the potential for an open-pit, bulk-tonnage gold deposit at Cisne Negro,” said Black Swan CEO Jennifer Santos. “The targets we have identified are large, mineralized shear zone and stockwork systems, similar to other gold deposits in the region. Success at any one of the three target areas could represent a company-making discovery.”

The price of gold has risen over 30% in the past two years, fueling a boom in gold exploration worldwide. Major gold producers have been actively acquiring development-stage gold companies and projects to bolster their reserves. Should Black Swan report positive drill results, it may become an acquisition target. This potential has also driven interest in the company’s shares, which have tripled in value over the past year.

Not all analysts are convinced Cisne Negro will deliver, however. “While early results appear promising, mineralization at surface does not necessarily translate to a major deposit at depth,” said John Wilson, a mining analyst at Oceanic Capital. “Black Swan still has a long way to go to prove this is a economically viable gold resource. We rate the stock a cautious buy at this time.”

With gold prices continuing to rise, any company making a significant new discovery could be handsomely rewarded. All eyes are on Black Swan this week to see if they can start delivering on the promise of Cisne Negro and make the first big gold find of the year. Investors seem optimistic, but as always, drill results will have the final say.
