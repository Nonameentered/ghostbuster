Czech oil refiner to reopen Litvinov refinery unit damaged in fire by end of January  

The Unipetrol oil refiner is aiming to restart processing operations at a key refinery unit in Litvinov, Czech Republic by the end of January, after it sustained damage in a fire last month. The restart will mark an important step in stabilizing operations at Unipetrol's largest refinery, which has halted some production following the fire.

The fire broke out at the atmospheric distillation unit on December 14, forcing Unipetrol to shut down the unit. The incident damaged equipment critical for distilling crude oil into various petroleum products. Unipetrol deployed 300 firefighters to combat the blaze, which took 12 hours to fully extinguish. No injuries were reported from the fire.  

The atmospheric distillation unit has a processing capacity of 160,000 barrels per day and is a core part of the Litvinov refinery, which has an overall capacity of 395,000 bpd. The temporary loss of the unit caused Unipetrol to slash the refinery's run rate to 200,000 bpd. The company had to tap into emergency fuel reserves and import more refined products to meet market demand.

Unipetrol aims to restart the atmospheric distillation unit before the end of January after completing necessary repairs, safety checks and test runs, the company said in a statement. The relaunch will allow Unipetrol to ramp up processing at its Litvinov refinery to over 300,000 bpd. The company is still investigating the cause of the fire.

Unipetrol expects the financial impact from the incident to be limited, as insurance policies will likely cover the costs from business interruption and property damage. However, prolonged halts or slowdowns at the Litvinov refinery could significantly weigh on the company's bottom line in future quarters.

The fire comes at a challenging time for Unipetrol, as the company is gearing up for an initial public offering in Prague that could raise up to $500 million. Unipetrol aims to use the proceeds to upgrade technology at its refineries and petrochemical plants to produce higher-value fuels and products. The IPO is expected to value Unipetrol at up to $3 billion.

While the fire may complicate the IPO process, analysts said the company's swift moves to repair damage and restore lost production demonstrated strong crisis management that reinforces Unipetrol's attractiveness to investors. With refining margins improving in Europe, Unipetrol is still poised for a successful market debut despite the setback, they added.
