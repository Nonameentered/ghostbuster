Czech government approves post-WWII reconciliation declaration with Germany 

The Czech government today approved a declaration aiming to reconcile with Germany over events following World War II. The declaration expresses regret for the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia. 

After WWII ended in 1945, Czechoslovakia expelled around 3 million ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland border region. The expulsions were part of a broader Allied policy to punish Germans after the Nazi defeat. However, they were carried out in a harsh and inhumane manner, resulting in thousands of deaths.

The new declaration was jointly approved by the Czech and German cabinets. It states that "the Czech government regrets the pain and injustice inflicted during the post-war period upon innocent people in contravention of the basic humanitarian and democratic values of today." The German government also expressed regret for atrocities committed by the Nazis during the war and occupation of Czechoslovakia.

The declaration aims to put aside lingering resentment and conflict over wartime and post-war events. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said "we have to look into the future now instead of looking into the past." However, the move has also stirred some opposition. Czech President Milos Zeman criticized the declaration, saying "I do not see any reason to express regret to those who were accomplices in the Nazi genocide."

Bilateral relations between the Czech Republic and Germany have significantly improved since the fall of communism. Germany is now the Czech Republic's largest trading partner and closest ally. However, unresolved tensions from 20th century conflicts have continued to complicate the relationship at times. Supporters hope the new reconciliation declaration will help overcome this difficult history and enable closer ties between the two countries going forward.

The declaration will be formally signed by Prime Minister Babis and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a ceremony in Prague next week. The agreement must also be ratified by the Czech and German parliaments before taking effect. If approved, it will be an important symbolic step towards burying decades of animosity between the two nations.
