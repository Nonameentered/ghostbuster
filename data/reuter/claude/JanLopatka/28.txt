Czech National Bank Vice-Governor Calls for Strong and Efficient Owners for State-Controlled Banks  

The Vice-Governor of the Czech National Bank, Tomáš Holub, said this week that state-controlled Czech banks Česká spořitelna and Československá obchodní banka (ČSOB) need strong, professional, and efficient owners to help ensure stability in the banking sector. Holub warned that continued state ownership and political influence over the banks could undermine their corporate governance and commercial focus.

Holub's comments come as the Czech government is considering partially privatizing the two largest Czech banks, Česká spořitelna and ČSOB, both of which are still majority-owned by the state. The government sees selling additional shares in the profitable banks as a way to raise funds for budgetary purposes. However, Holub argued that any privatization should aim to transfer ownership to strategic private investors with banking expertise.  

“State ownership combined with political influence is not a good setup for commercial banks,” Holub said in an interview with Czech Radio. “Private majority owners with know-how in the banking sector and an established position will strengthen governance and safeguard the stability of the two most significant banks in the Czech Republic.”

Holub noted that state ownership often comes with political pressure on banks' business decisions and lending practices. Private owners would be motivated primarily by business and economic interests, not political interests, he said. He pointed to the success of privately-owned Czech banks such as Moneta Money Bank and Air Bank, which have thrived without state support.

Some analysts and opposition politicians argue against further privatizing Česká spořitelna and ČSOB, saying they provide public benefits as state-controlled banks. However, Holub believes attracting strategic private investors is the best path to securing their commercial sustainability and competitiveness in an increasingly digital banking market. The Czech government has not yet announced any concrete privatization plans for the two banks.
