Czech coalition names new justice minister, postpones choice for deputy prime minister

The three-party Czech coalition government announced Thursday that MP Marie Benešová will be the new justice minister, filling a vacancy left by the resignation of former Justice Minister Jan Kněžínek. However, the coalition could not agree on a choice to fill the role of deputy prime minister, leaving that post empty for now. 

Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, leader of the ANO party, put forward Benešová as his choice for justice minister in the latest cabinet shakeup. Benešová, a former justice minister under Babiš from 2013 to 2015, was approved by partners in the center-left Czech Social Democratic Party and the centrist Christian Democrats. She will now face a confirmation vote in the Chamber of Deputies next week before officially taking up her post.

The choice of Benešová disappointed anti-corruption watchdogs who had called for an "independent and trustworthy" candidate to lead the justice ministry. Benešová has faced criticism over her past business dealings and close ties with Babiš's political movement. The opposition Civic Democrats said her appointment showed the government's disregard for independent oversight of the legal system.

By contrast, the coalition partners could not agree on a single nominee to serve as one of several deputy prime ministers in the government. The Christian Democrats' choice was rejected by Babiš's ANO movement, stalemating the process. The position of deputy prime minister for economy and transport thus remains vacant.

The latest government shakeup comes as public support for the Babiš administration has wavered amid scandals surrounding the prime minister and political turmoil in Prague. The coalition has lasted since 2018, but divisions among the unlikely partners have at times threatened its stability. The next general election is scheduled for autumn of this year, leaving the government with only a few months to regain voters’ confidence.

In a statement, Babiš thanked Kněžínek for his service as justice minister and expressed full confidence in Benešová's abilities. The new justice minister promised to make fair and impartial justice a priority, pledging "not even to breath a word about any specific case." The coalition's failure to fill the deputy prime minister role, however, could signal renewed tensions among its members at a critical time.
