Litvinov Refinery in Czech Republic Shuts Down Cracking Unit After Second Fire in Eight Days 

The Litvinov oil refinery in the Czech Republic was forced to shut down its catalytic cracking unit for the second time in eight days after another fire broke out at the facility on Tuesday morning. The refinery, owned and operated by Czech oil company Unipetrol, had just restarted the cracking unit on Monday following an earlier fire on July 21st. 

The cracking unit converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter, more useful products like gasoline and diesel fuel. Unipetrol said the latest fire was caused by a “technical fault” that occurred during the restart process. The fire has been extinguished and no injuries were reported, but significant damage was caused to the unit. Unipetrol announced it will keep the unit offline for at least 10 days as it conducts a full inspection and necessary repairs.

The shutdowns and damage from the fires are a major blow for Unipetrol, which relies on the Litvinov refinery to produce a range of petroleum products for distribution within the Czech Republic and export to other countries. Unipetrol said despite the cracking unit outage, the company will still be able to meet supply contracts and market demand using additional imports as well as its Kolin refinery, though at a higher cost.

The fires also renew concerns over industrial safety standards and oversight at Litvinov, which is located in the rural region of northern Bohemia along the German border. The refinery has a long history of environmental violations and industrial accidents, including several fires over the past 20 years which have caused injuries, fatalities, and damage to the facility. Local officials and environmental groups have called on Unipetrol to invest in updated safety equipment and procedures to prevent similar events going forward.

For Unipetrol, the company is conducting its own investigation into the cause of the two recent fires to determine if further actions need to be taken. The Czech government has also launched an inquiry into whether Unipetrol violated any health, safety or environmental laws with its handling of the incidents. Regardless of the outcome, the events highlight the volatility of oil refining and the imperative for companies to follow stringent safeguards to protect lives, equipment, and the surrounding community.
