CEZ a.s. sees surge in net profit due to household electricity demand 

Czech utility CEZ a.s. reported a significant increase in net profit for the first half of 2020, boosted by higher electricity demand from households during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net profit rose by 27% year-on-year to CZK 18.7 billion ($790 million) in the first six months of 2020, CEZ said in its earnings report published today. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in electricity sales to households as people spent more time at home due to lockdown restrictions. 

Electricity demand from commercial and industrial customers declined in the same period, as many businesses were forced to close or operate at limited capacity. However, the increase in residential demand offset most of these losses. Overall, CEZ’s electricity sales volumes fell by just 1% in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period last year.

“We saw a sizable impact on electricity demand in the commercial and industrial sectors, but increased residential consumption moderated the overall effect,” said CEO Daniel Benes. “Our diversified operations and stable regulatory framework in the Czech Republic helped ensure the security of supply during this crisis.”

The company reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance, expecting net income slightly above CZK 33 billion in 2020. However, CEZ warned there are still uncertainties around the scale of the fallout from the COVID-19 crisis. “The longer-term impacts on the economy are hard to predict and may affect future financial performance,” the report cautioned.

CEZ is the largest utility company in Central and Eastern Europe, with operations in six countries including distribution and generation of power and heat, and trading and sales of electricity and gas. The Czech government holds a near 70% stake in the company.

CEZ shares rose by more than 3% in early trading following the earnings announcement. The stock has declined by around 12% since the start of the year due to a wider sell-off of utility shares amid economic uncertainty. The company will pay an interim dividend of CZK 24 per share, equal to 82% of its full-year 2019 dividend. The final dividend will be proposed by the board of directors based on full-year 2020 results.
