Czech Statistical Bureau to Change Industrial Production Calculation Methodology in 1997 

The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) announced today that it will revise its methodologies for calculating the Czech Republic's industrial production figures, starting in January 1997. The changes are aimed at bringing the country's statistical practices in line with international standards and improving the accuracy of economic indicators.

The CSU currently uses a mix of market and non-market methods to track monthly industrial production. Production quantities are measured based on indicators like total hours worked, raw material inputs, and factory capacity utilization. The new methodology will place a greater emphasis on actual sales and revenue figures reported by companies. This is expected to provide a more precise gauge of real production output and trends. 

"Moving to a market-based, revenue-focused calculation of industrial production is an important step towards aligning our statistics with the rest of the global economy," said Marek Cik√°n, Director of the CSU. "Using company revenue and sales data as the primary indicators will reduce distortions and produce industrial figures that accurately reflect the current state of the Czech economy."

The revised methodology will impact the CSU's monthly reports on total industrial production as well as production in major industrial sectors like manufacturing, mining, and utilities. New historical data calculated with the updated methods will also be released to allow for accurate year-on-year comparisons. The CSU noted that initial figures for January may see a temporary drop as the statistical system adjusts to the new model.

Economists welcomed the announced changes, saying they should help address long-standing concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the Czech Republic's economic data. The country is working to harmonize its statistical standards with the rest of the European Union, a process that involves methodological improvements across economic measures. More transparent and internationally comparable statistics are also seen as important for attracting greater foreign investment.

The CSU has provided notice of the upcoming changes to data users, including government agencies, economists, and media organizations. Private companies will also have time to adjust their systems to the revised formats for reporting production and revenue figures. The new methodology is set to go into effect for the calculation and reporting of January 1997 industrial production data. Overall, the changes are expected to lead to a more credible and useful set of statistics on the Czech manufacturing and industrial economy.
