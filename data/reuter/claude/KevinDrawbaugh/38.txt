General Instrument Corp Announces Annual Growth Targets and Three-Way Corporate Break-Up Aimed at Unlocking Share Value of NextLevel Systems Inc, CommScope Inc, and General Semiconductor Inc

General Instrument Corp (NYSE: GIC) announced today annual growth targets for 2020 and plans for a corporate break-up into three independent companies as part of a strategic review aimed at maximizing shareholder value. The company will spin off its NextLevel Systems Inc digital TV and set-top box division, CommScope Inc broadband connectivity solutions division, and General Semiconductor semiconductor components division into separate publicly traded companies. 

“We have built three strong and distinct businesses with leading market positions, and we believe they will thrive as independent companies focused on seizing growth opportunities in their industries,” said GIC CEO Jane Williamson. “This transaction represents the successful conclusion of a strategic review conducted by the GIC board to determine the optimal path forward to maximize value for our shareholders.”

NextLevel Systems, the largest of the three units, is forecasting revenue growth of 8-10% for 2020 driven by adoption of new streaming video services and next-generation TV platforms. The division recorded $12.4 billion in revenue in 2019. CommScope, which provides network infrastructure for cable broadband and wireless networks, is targeting 5-7% revenue growth. General Semiconductor, which makes chips, sensors, and other components used in consumer electronics, automobiles, and industrial equipment, aims to expand sales by 10-12% next year.

The tax-free spinoff to GIC shareholders is expected to be complete by the end of 2020, pending final approval by the GIC board and standard regulatory clearances. The company did not provide details on how it will allocate assets, liabilities, and debt among the three new corporations but said it aims to provide more specifics over the coming months.

GIC shares climbed 4.2% on the news to $42.15 in midday trading. The stock price has risen 23% so far this year, reflecting strong results and optimism around the strategic review in an effort to accelerate growth. The break-up announcement was a surprise to some analysts and investors, given the company’s solid performance and leading positions in growth segments including streaming media, 5G wireless infrastructure, and vehicle electrification. However, others see the logic in creating more targeted, nimble companies with a sharper strategic focus.

The bold move by GIC comes amid a trend of large companies splitting into separate entities to enhance shareholder value. Other recent examples include the pending break-up of industrial giant Johnson & Johnson into consumer health, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies as well as H.B. Fuller’s separation of its adhesives and sealants division. The GIC restructuring will allow each spinoff to optimize its own operations, pare away excess costs, and pursue acquisitions tailored to its needs.
