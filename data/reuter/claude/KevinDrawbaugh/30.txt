Aon to Acquire Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. for $1.23 Billion, Creating World's Largest Insurance and Risk Consulting Company  

Aon Corporation, a leading global professional services firm providing risk, retirement, and health solutions, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alexander & Alexander Services Inc., an international insurance broker and risk management firm, for $1.23 billion in an all-cash transaction.

The acquisition of A&A, as Alexander & Alexander is commonly known, will greatly expand Aon's global capabilities and cement its position as the world's largest insurance broker and risk consulting firm. A&A has over 5,000 employees across 47 countries and complements Aon's existing operations across 120 countries. 

"This acquisition is a major milestone in Aon's strategy to strengthen our industry leadership across key business lines and geographies," said Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon. "A&A has built an impressive global franchise and adds tremendous talent and expertise that will benefit our clients and accelerate our firm's momentum."

A&A's Chairman and CEO Dominic Casserley will join Aon's executive leadership team and serve as CEO of Aon's newly combined retail brokerage business following completion of the deal. "We are excited to join the Aon team and jointly pursue our goal to become the preeminent professional services firm in our industry," Casserley said. 

The combined companies will have pro forma revenues of over $10 billion annually based on 2019 financials. Aon expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings beginning in the first year. Cost savings are anticipated to reach $240 million pre-tax within three years of closing.

The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Aon and A&A share a similar culture focused on client service, innovation, and expertise. The combined firm will provide clients with enhanced data, analytics, and insights to help them better understand and manage risk in a rapidly changing environment.

News of the deal was well received by analysts, who pointed to significant cost-saving opportunities and cross-selling potential given limited overlap in the companies' client bases and practice areas. Shares of Aon rose over 7% on the announcement while shares of A&A jumped more than 20%, suggesting investors anticipate significant benefits from the tie-up.

The transaction is the latest in a series of insurance broker mergers and acquisitions as the largest players aim to gain greater scale and market leverage. It caps off a transformative period for Aon following its $30 billion merger with Hewitt Associates, a human resources consulting firm, in 2010. With the A&A deal, Aon cements its status as an end-to-end professional services firm for risk, retirement, and health solutions.
