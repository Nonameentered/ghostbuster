Outboard Marine Corp Restructuring Only 5% Complete and Will Result in More Charges Against Earnings, Says Spokesman 

Outboard Marine Corp announced that its ongoing corporate restructuring effort is only about 5% complete and will result in additional charges against earnings over the coming quarters. The restructuring, announced in January, aims to cut costs by consolidating manufacturing facilities, reducing headcount, and exiting underperforming business units.

"We have a long road ahead to right-size our cost structure and return Outboard Marine to sustained profitability," said company spokesman Tim Johnson. "The actions we have taken so far, while difficult, are necessary to guarantee our long-term competitiveness."

The restructuring is expected to span 18-24 months and cost between $250 million to $350 million. In the first quarter, the company took a $25 million charge as it closed two manufacturing plants in the Midwest that produce boat trailers and various marine components. The closures resulted in 350 employees being laid off, adding to 600 positions cut in the previous two quarters. Additional plant closures and job cuts are anticipated in the coming quarters.  

Outboard Marine also ceased production of its line of small jet boats, eliminating another 200 jobs. The jet boat division had been losing money for the past three years amid lackluster sales and high costs. The company is looking to exit one or two more business units that are underperforming, though Johnson declined to specify which ones are being reviewed.

The restructuring comes as Outboard Marine struggles with lackluster sales, intense competition, and a high debt load taken on following an acquisition spree in the late 1990s. Revenue has declined for five straight years, including a 12% drop last year amid a broad downturn in the marine industry. The company has been unprofitable for the past two years.

Outboard Marine’s stock price has plunged nearly 75% over the past decade as its troubles have mounted. Investors seem to have little confidence in the company’s turnaround prospects. “Outboard Marine’s restructuring feels like too little, too late,” said David Levy, an analyst at Morningstar. “They are playing catch-up in a big way and face a steep climb to merely get back to profitability, let alone compete effectively against much stronger rivals.”

Not all analysts are as pessimistic, though. “If Outboard Marine can properly execute this restructuring, strip out unnecessary costs, and refocus on their core business areas, they have a path to redemption,” said Michael Smith of the Motley Fool. Outboard Marine still dominates market share in key product categories like outboard motors, fish finders, and boat propellers. 

With the additional charges announced, Outboard Marine expects its restructuring to reduce earnings per share by $0.40 to $0.65 this year. The company reports second-quarter earnings in three weeks, giving investors an important update on the restructuring’s progress and impact. Johnson insists there are “encouraging signs of initial progress” but warned that material benefits are still several quarters away. Overall, the scale of challenges facing Outboard Marine suggests this will be a long and uncertain turnaround effort.
