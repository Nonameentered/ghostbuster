Ford Joins Other Automakers in Race to Exit Rental Car Business  

Ford Motor Co. announced today that it plans to sell the vast majority of its rental car subsidiary, Hertz Vehicle Sales. Ford has operated Hertz Vehicle Sales as an in-house financing unit for decades, buying discounted rental cars from Hertz and other agencies before reselling them to consumers. However, major automakers including General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have exited the rental car market in recent years to focus on more profitable retail sales, spurring Ford to put Hertz Vehicle Sales up for sale.   

The move is part of Ford’s broader strategy to boost profit margins by focusing on higher-margin retail vehicle sales rather than less profitable fleet and commercial sales to businesses and agencies like rental car companies. In addition to selling Hertz Vehicle Sales, Ford confirmed it will reduce sales to rental car fleets by 30 percent over the next several years. The pullback from the rental car market reflects changing consumer preferences, as ride-sharing services and subscription vehicles have reduced demand for rentals.

“We’re prioritizing our investments in areas that will drive profitable growth,” said Ford CEO Jim Hackett in a statement. “Selling our Hertz fleet business will allow us to further focus on strengthening our leadership in the retail market with innovative new vehicles and technologies that will enhance the customer experience.”

Ford’s exit from the rental car market may prompt other automakers to accelerate similar plans. GM sold its European rental car subsidiary in 2015 and has reportedly discussed options for selling or restructuring its U.S. rental car unit. Fiat Chrysler discontinued selling vehicles to rental fleets in 2016 to boost retail margins. However, some analysts caution that Ford may regret vacating such a large portion of the vehicle market as demand for rentals eventually recovers.  

Ford will continue operating a smaller in-house rental unit to provide vehicles for short-term commercial rentals and ride-sharing. But the company will shift the majority of the 600,000 vehicles it sells annually to enterprise and retail customers. The sale of Hertz Vehicle Sales is expected to close by the end of 2021, Ford said.   

Ford’s stock ticked up 1.5% on news of the planned sale, reflecting investor interest in the company’s moves to bolster its balance sheet by shedding less profitable operations. The 117-year-old automaker has underperformed competitors in recent years and is aggressively restructuring to reduce costs, improve timeliness of new vehicle launches, and redirect capital toward next-generation mobility technologies. Selling Hertz Vehicle Sales will net Ford’s cash coffers $4.2 billion over the next three years, providing fuel for investments in areas like autonomous and electric vehicles.

Overall, Ford’s exit from the rental car market signals the profound shifts under way in the global auto industry. Automakers are racing to slim down and retool for an era of self-driving cars, ride-sharing, and on-demand mobility. For Ford, boosting margins and accelerating new technology development are taking priority over the more commoditized rental fleet business. The company’s success navigating this transition may determine its long-term competitiveness against traditional rivals as well as new challengers from the tech sector.
