Aon Corp acquires Alexander & Alexander Services Inc in a $1.23 billion deal benefiting both insurance giants and American International Group Inc. 

Aon Corp, the world's largest insurance broker, announced today that it has acquired Alexander & Alexander Services Inc, another major insurance brokerage, for $1.23 billion in cash and stock. The deal combines two of the largest insurance brokers in the U.S. and is expected to strengthen Aon's position in the commercial property and casualty insurance market.

Under the terms of the agreement, Aon will pay $825 million in cash and issue new shares of Aon common stock currently valued at $405 million. The deal, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals and approval by Alexander & Alexander shareholders.

"This acquisition reinforces Aon's global leadership in insurance brokerage and risk management services," said Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's chairman and chief executive officer. "Alexander & Alexander has a strong reputation for client service and expertise in the middle market, which complements our focus and presence. This combination strengthens our ability to provide enhanced services to clients across more locations."

Alexander & Alexander chairman and CEO William J. McCarthy Jr. said, "We believe the transaction provides excellent value for our shareholders and new opportunities for our clients and staff as part of a leading global organization." Aon expects the acquisition to generate over $100 million in cost savings by combining infrastructure and other redundant functions. The deal is also expected to boost Aon's earnings in the first year after closing.

American International Group Inc, the largest shareholder of Alexander & Alexander, supports the deal and is expected to receive $489 million in cash for its 32% stake in the company. The acquisition of Alexander & Alexander is the latest in a series of mergers that are consolidating the insurance brokerage industry. Aon, with more than 500 offices in 120 countries, placed the largest share of insurance policies in the world last year. The combined company will have more than $140 billion in revenues and about 55,000 employees across the globe.
