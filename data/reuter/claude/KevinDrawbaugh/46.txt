U.S. Nursing Home and Hospital Companies Brace for Fourth Quarter Earnings, Wall Street Cautious of Potential Downside

Major U.S. nursing home and hospital operators will begin releasing their fourth quarter financial earnings reports starting this week. After strong performances over the past year buoyed by an aging population and increasing healthcare needs, companies like Genesis Healthcare, Brookdale Senior Living, and HCA Healthcare are bracing for the potential of weaker than expected results to close out 2019.

The nursing home and hospital sectors have faced several headwinds in the latter half of 2019 that analysts worry could impact fourth quarter results. Medicare reimbursement rates faced a 1% cut in the fall, putting pressure on profit margins for patient services. At the same time, high-deductible health plans have led some patients to delay elective procedures and checkups, which could reduce patient volume.   

 Genesis Healthcare, one of the largest nursing home providers, saw its stock drop over 20% in one day last October after warning investors about these industry challenges in its third quarter report. The company announced cost-cutting measures but also said to expect the difficult operating environment to continue into 2020. Wall Street will be watching closely to see if Genesis is able to at least meet already lowered expectations when it reports earnings on Feb. 13.

HCA Healthcare, the largest for-profit hospital operator, has seen its stock rise over 20% in the past year but gave back some of those gains after its last quarterly report mentioned reimbursement pressures. HCA reports on Jan. 28, and analysts have average earnings expectations 4-6% lower than the same quarter last year. If HCA misses targets, it could signal broader troubles for the hospital sector. 

Not all companies are so pessimistic, however. Brookdale Senior Living, which operates over 800 senior living communities, expects solid occupancy and revenue growth for its report on Feb. 5. Brookdale made several acquisitions in 2019 to boost its portfolio, and the company says it has strong momentum heading into 2020 thanks to higher demand for its services.

While demographic trends show healthcare needs increasing for the foreseeable future, government policy changes and other market factors can introduce volatility for nursing home and hospital companies. As fourth quarter reports start coming in, investors will gain greater clarity on the balance of tailwinds and headwinds impacting this sectorâ€”and whether a strong 2019 finish is in the cards.
