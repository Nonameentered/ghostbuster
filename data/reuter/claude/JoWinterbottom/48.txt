National Grid to Report Rise in First Half Profits and Address New Pricing Controls 

National Grid, Britain's largest utility company, is expected to report higher profits for the first half of its financial year when it updates investors on Thursday. Analysts forecast National Grid will announce a 3-5% increase in operating profits for the six months ending September 30, boosted by greater demand for power as the economy continues to recover following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results come as National Grid faces new pricing controls set by the energy regulator Ofgem that took effect in April. The controls allow National Grid to increase transmission charges by the rate of inflation over the next five years in exchange for efficiency targets. Consumer groups have argued the controls are too generous while National Grid has said they threaten its ability to invest in infrastructure upgrades.

National Grid operates the power networks in England and Wales as well as the UK's gas transmission system. Jonathan Brearley, the CEO of Ofgem, said when announcing the new pricing controls in March that “allowing National Grid to increase its charges in line with inflation strikes the right balance between attracting investment and protecting consumers.” However, analysts expect National Grid executives to reiterate their view that the controls may hamper long-term investment in renewable energy projects and new interconnector links with Europe.

Beyond the results and outlook, investors will be closely monitoring any statements on National Grid's dividend policy. The company has increased its dividend each year for over 25 years but faces pressure to maintain its growth streak as it invests in new networks and faces the pricing controls. Jefferies analysts said last week any confirmation of continued dividend growth would be taken positively by the market. 

Shares in National Grid have declined 3% in the last 12 months, lagging the wider FTSE 100 index. But analysts remain broadly positive on the stock, citing its stable earnings and dividend profile. UBS rates National Grid a “buy” with a price target of 1,010 pence, about 8% above the current share price. Investors will be hoping for a positive update on Thursday to drive the stock back to recent highs.
