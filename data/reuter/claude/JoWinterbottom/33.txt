Dominion Resources to acquire East Midlands Electricity in $2.1 billion deal

Dominion Resources, a leading U.S.-based power and energy company, announced today it has reached an agreement to acquire East Midlands Electricity (EME) for $2.1 billion. EME is a UK-based utility company that provides electricity and gas to over 3 million customers across the East Midlands region of England. 

The acquisition of EME will significantly expand Dominion's operations in the UK energy market and customer base. EME has a well-developed power grid infrastructure, including 8,000 miles of power lines and 650 electricity substations. Dominion expects to gain substantial synergies by optimizing and upgrading EME's power grid to improve reliability and smart metering capabilities.

"We are excited to enter into this agreement to acquire EME, which will position Dominion as a leading energy provider in the UK market,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This acquisition aligns with our growth strategy to expand into new geographic areas and markets. The addition of EME's significant scale, over 3 million customers, and complementary power grid infrastructure will provide a platform for continued growth and investment in the UK's power grid."

The acquisition requires approval by EME's shareholders as well as certain regulatory authorities in the UK before it can be finalized. Dominion expects the deal to close within 6 to 9 months after securing all necessary approvals. 

EME's CEO Simon Lander welcomed the deal, saying "Dominion Resources is the ideal partner for EME as we look to enhance service for our customers, expand our energy solutions, and secure the investments needed for continued growth. We are excited by the opportunities this acquisition will provide for both companies and the communities we serve."

The deal underscores the increasing consolidation in the UK utility sector. Earlier this year, Pennon Group acquired South West Water for $8.5 billion, expanding its water utility operations. Analysts expect more mergers and acquisitions as companies look to gain scale, increase efficiencies and better navigate challenges such as the UK's 2050 net zero emissions goal.
