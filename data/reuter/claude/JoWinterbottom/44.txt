National Power Plc Sees Profits Slip and Year's Output Could Be Down 20%

National Power Plc, one of the UK's largest power generation companies, announced today that profits slipped in the first half of the year and warned that output for the full year could be down by as much as 20% due to planned maintenance work.

The company reported pre-tax profits of £972 million for the six months ending June 30, down 3% from £1 billion in the same period last year. Revenue rose slightly to £3.6 billion, up from £3.5 billion a year earlier. However, the company said profits were hit by higher costs for fuel and carbon emissions permits. 

National Power also lowered its guidance for electricity output for the full year. The company expects to generate between 50 to 55 terawatt hours of electricity, which would be 15 to 20% lower than the 66 terawatt hours it produced last year. The drop is due to planned maintenance outages at three of its largest power plants, including a two-month shutdown of its 1.2 gigawatt Bridgeport coal facility.

"While the necessary maintenance work will impact our output and profits this year, it is vital to ensure our fleet of power stations continues to operate safely and efficiently for the long term," said National Power CEO Jennifer Thompson. 

The profit warning sent National Power's shares down over 4% in early trading. The stock has declined more than 10% over the last year due to concerns over tighter profit margins for power companies.

Environmental groups have also been putting pressure on National Power over its reliance on coal-fired power plants, which produce high levels of carbon emissions. The company said today that it plans to invest £500 million to build more renewable energy projects over the next five years and gradually shift away from coal.

"While coal will remain an important part of our mix for many years, we recognize the need to continue reducing emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources," said Thompson. "Our investment in new solar, wind and battery storage projects will significantly boost our renewable energy capacity and help us become a greener company over time."

The company reaffirmed its target to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. However, critics argue National Power needs to move faster to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The company's fleet of coal, natural gas and oil power plants currently produce over 60 million tons of carbon emissions per year.

In summary, while National Power remains profitable and dominant in the UK energy market, it faces challenges to adapt to stricter environmental regulation and balance its green energy transition with the demands of today. The coming decade will be crucial for the company to achieve a sustainable future.
