Dominion Resources to Acquire East Midlands Electricity for $2.15 Billion, Faces Possible Obstacles from British Competition Authorities

Dominion Resources, one of the largest energy producers in the United States, announced Monday that it has reached an agreement to acquire East Midlands Electricity, an electricity and gas distribution grid operator in the East Midlands region of England, for $2.15 billion. The deal would give Dominion, which serves nearly 6 million customers in 15 states, access to a new set of customers in the UK as well as expertise in operating a domestic energy grid that could benefit its U.S. operations.  

However, the proposed deal still needs to be reviewed and approved by British competition authorities, which could pose challenges. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which reviews mergers and takeovers in the UK, has expressed some concerns that the acquisition could lessen competition in energy distribution and supply. Dominion and East Midlands Electricity would have a dominant position in the region, controlling vital infrastructure for delivering electricity and gas to homes and businesses.

Dominion officials expressed confidence the deal would still go through. “We have had constructive discussions with the CMA during the initial review process and believe we can fully address any concerns,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This acquisition aligns with our growth strategy and will provide operational and customer benefits.”

For Dominion, the deal offers a platform for international expansion and provides greater scale to spread costs over. East Midlands serves over 1 million customer meters across numerous counties in central England, covering major cities like Nottingham and Derby. The region's economy and population have been growing in recent years, suggesting stable demand for the utility. 

However, critics argue the deal reduces competition in an already concentrated market and could lead to higher prices for customers. “Four large firms already control over 60% of the UK energy retail market,” said Simon Moore, director of policy at UK consumer advocacy group Which?. “Allowing Dominion to take over East Midlands Electricity will make the situation worse, reducing choice and value for customers in the region.”   

The CMA has until late October to decide whether to allow the deal to proceed or launch a more in-depth investigation. They could require Dominion to divest certain assets or take other steps to maintain competition before approving the acquisition. Dominion expects the deal to close by the end of this year if approved. The announcement led to a 4% increase in Dominion's share price in early trading Monday, suggesting investors expect the deal to ultimately go through, even if Dominion has to make some concessions to appease regulators.  

East Midlands Electricity, which employs over 2,000 people, was founded in 2005 following the deregulation of the UK energy market. The company operates electricity distribution networks across central England as well as provides residential energy supply services to over 1 million households. CEO Martin
