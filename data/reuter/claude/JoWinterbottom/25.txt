Sainsbury's Shares Rise on Hope for Improved Performance Despite Fall in Half Year Profits and Sluggish Sales

Shares in Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket chain, rose 6.4% on Wednesday despite it reporting a decline in half year profits and lackluster sales performance. The upbeat market reaction reflected investor hopes that new cost cuts and investments will boost future performance.

Sainsbury's  half year profits fell by 5.5% to £181 million in the six months to September 21. Underlying pretax profits were down 9.8% once one-off costs were accounted for. The supermarket blamed weak sales and higher operating costs for the drop in profits. Revenue fell 0.2% and sales at stores open more than a year were up just 0.6%. 

The rising costs have squeezed profit margins, which declined to 2.3% from 2.5% a year earlier. Increased labour costs, driven by higher wages and additional hours for staff to prepare for Brexit, contributed to the higher costs. Some analysts voiced concerns that the weak operating environment may persist, clouding the outlook for a turnaround. 

However, Sainsbury's announced additional cost savings of £20 million, taking total cost cuts to £550 million over five years. It also unveiled a £1 billion program to invest in pricing cuts, improved stores, and more customer-focused initiatives over the next three years. Investors focused on these cost cutting and investment plans as more positive signs for the future.

Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe highlighted these investments and cost savings as key strategies to boost sales and profits. He also pointed to gaining market share in some categories like beer, wine, fruit and vegetables as encouraging. Many analysts still remain optimistic about a gradual improvement in performance over the next year, despite the lacklustre results.

While the sluggish wider retail environment remains a challenge, Sainsbury’s appears determined to emerge stronger through targeted investments, cost discipline, and efficiency improvements. With the stock down over 30% in the last six months, investors clearly sensed an opportune time to buy ahead of a potential turnaround. The market reaction suggests Sainsbury’s turnaround plans are resonating with investors banking on future improvements.
