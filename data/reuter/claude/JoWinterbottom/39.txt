Northern Electric Rushes Results to Prove $1.225 Billion U.S. Bid Inadequate 

Northern Electric Co. announced better-than-expected first-quarter results today in an effort to prove that a $1.225 billion buyout bid from U.S. Industries Inc. severely undervalues the Canadian appliance maker.

Net income for the quarter ended March 31 rose 12 percent to $38.7 million or 85 cents a share from $34.5 million or 77 cents a year earlier. Revenue advanced 9 percent to $587.3 million from $537.9 million.

The earnings and revenue were well ahead of projections by analysts, who on average estimated Northern Electric would earn 80 cents a share on revenue of $575 million. “The results clearly demonstrate the superior quality and potential of Northern Electric and validate our position that the U.S. Industries offer fails to recognize full and fair value,” said Donald J. Walker, chief executive officer.

On March 15, U.S. Industries, a New York-based conglomerate, made an unsolicited bid to acquire Northern Electric for $1.225 billion or $27.50 a share. Northern Electric’s board rejected the offer as “inadequate and not in the best interests of shareholders.” The company’s position is that Northern Electric would command a premium price of at least $1.5 billion or $33 a share in a takeover.

The bid by U.S. Industries is viewed as an attempt to expand its presence in the stable and cash-generating appliance market. Northern Electric is an attractive target because of its leading position in the Canadian home appliance industry and its growing sales in the United States. The company has a product line that includes refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, washers, and dryers.

Northern Electric’s shares have risen 15 percent this year, buoyed by takeover speculation. The stock climbed $1.25 to $29.75 today in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the better-than-expected financial results. Trading was halted briefly after the numbers were released. 

In a research note, Karl Schaffer, an analyst at Dominion Securities Inc., said, “Northern Electric has delivered a formidable rebuff to the hostile suitor at its door. The stock is now trading at a level that more fully reflects the company’s true value and long-term growth prospects. U.S. Industries or another acquirer will have to make a substantially higher bid to gain control.”

U.S. Industries has signaled that it may go directly to Northern Electric’s shareholders with its offer, possibly initiating a hostile takeover attempt. However, analysts say the stellar first-quarter results will make that a more difficult task as shareholders are likely to side with current management.
