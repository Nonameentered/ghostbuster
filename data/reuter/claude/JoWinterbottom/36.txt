South West Water's half year profits surge 35%, hikes dividend by 20%

South West Water, the UK utility company, reported a strong set of half year results today with profits surging 35% to £193 million. The company also announced a 20% increase in its interim dividend to 23.7 pence per share. 

The robust performance was driven by increased revenue from its water and sewerage business, as well as higher non-household retail profits. Turnover rose 5% to £617 million in the six months to September 30th. South West Water attributed the revenue growth to price increases that were linked to inflation, as well as an increase in commercial customer numbers.

The company saw its operating costs decline due to lower costs for power, chemicals and manpower. Operating costs dropped  4% to £424 million. South West Water also reduced its net debt level by over £100 million. Its CEO Chris Loughlin said “We have delivered another strong set of financial results underpinned by solid operational performance. The dry, hot summer has placed additional demands on our business, and I am proud of the way we have responded.”

South West Water provides 1.7 billion litres of drinking water per day to more than 2 million customers across Devon, Cornwall, and parts of Dorset and Somerset. Loughlin commented on the company’s investment plans saying “We continue to invest heavily in improving services for customers, with around £8 million every week spent on upgrading infrastructure and enhancing resilience”. The company has budgeted capital investments of over £2 billion between 2020 to 2025.

The utility sector in the UK has faced scrutiny in recent years over environmental pollution, leaks, and executive pay. In response, South West Water highlighted that it has met or outperformed all its business targets around areas such as water supply interruptions, pollution incidents and drinking water quality. The company also noted it has the lowest charges in Britain for both water and wastewater services.

Analysts were pleased with the results and dividend increase. “The company has delivered a robust set of numbers and the higher dividend demonstrates confidence in the outlook. South West Water continues to invest heavily in its infrastructure while maintaining a stable financial position,” said Ben Stringer, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. Shares in South West Water rose 2% in early trading, outperforming the broader utilities sector.
