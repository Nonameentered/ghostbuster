Quick & Reilly Sees Revenues Possibly Doubling with Acquisition of Nash, Weiss & Co. 

Financial services firm Quick & Reilly announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire Nash, Weiss & Co., an investment bank and wealth management company based in Chicago. The all-cash deal is valued at $1.2 billion and will significantly expand Quick & Reilly's presence in the Midwest.

"This acquisition will allow us to provide enhanced services to our clients through Nash, Weiss & Co.â€™s private wealth and investment banking expertise," said Timothy E. Quick, CEO of Quick & Reilly. "We have admired the success and culture of Nash, Weiss & Co. for years and are thrilled to welcome their team and clients to the Quick & Reilly family."

Nash, Weiss & Co. has over 500 employees and 65 offices across 12 states. The firm manages $78 billion in assets and generated over $650 million in revenue last year. The deal is expected to nearly double Quick & Reilly's assets under management to over $150 billion and increase annual revenue to approximately $1.2 billion.  

"Joining forces with Quick & Reilly will provide tremendous opportunities for our clients and employees," said Michael Nash, co-founder and co-CEO of Nash, Weiss & Co. "We have been independent for over 35 years, so this was not an easy decision, but in the end we concluded that this acquisition will allow us to do even more for our clients with Quick & Reilly's resources and expertise."

The deal has been approved by both companies' boards of directors but remains subject to regulatory approvals and a vote by Nash, Weiss & Co. shareholders. The transaction is expected to close within 6 to 8 months. Quick & Reilly was advised by Goldman Sachs and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Nash, Weiss & Co. was advised by JP Morgan Securities and Sidley Austin LLP.

While acquisitions in the wealth and asset management industry have been robust, deals of this size are still relatively rare. If completed, it would be the second largest US wealth management merger in the last decade, demonstrating Quick & Reilly's appetite and capacity for large, transformative transactions. The deal signals further consolidation may be on the horizon in the industry as companies seek to gain scale and reach new client segments.
