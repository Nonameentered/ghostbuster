Quick & Reilly Group Inc to Acquire Market-Maker Nash, Weiss Inc for Undisclosed Sum

Quick & Reilly Group Inc, the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Nash, Weiss  Inc, a New York-based market making firm, for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to close in the next 3 to 6 months, subject to regulatory approvals.

The acquisition of Nash, Weiss will allow Quick & Reilly to strengthen its trading capabilities and expand into new asset classes, according to a statement from the company. “The combination of our discount brokerage platform with Nash, Weiss’s expertise in market making and trading will create a powerful offering for our clients. We are excited to welcome Nash, Weiss to the Quick & Reilly family,” said Tom Quick, CEO of Quick & Reilly Group.

Nash, Weiss was founded in 1975 and is an SEC-registered market maker in over 3,000 NASDAQ and NYSE-listed stocks as well as options. The firm employs over 200 traders and support staff across its New York and London offices. “We have long admired Quick & Reilly’s success and innovation. Joining forces will allow us to leverage each other’s strengths and accelerate our growth in electronic trading and other areas,” said Sanjay Mehta, CEO of Nash, Weiss.

Following the acquisition, Nash, Weiss will continue to operate under its own brand and there will be no immediate changes to management or locations. The deal is seen as part of a larger trend of consolidation in the online brokerage and financial technology sectors. Established players are seeking to boost growth through acquisitions as competition from smaller startups intensifies.  

While the exact price tag was not disclosed, analysts estimate the total value of the deal to be between $200 million to $250 million based on comparable transactions. The market responded positively to the news, with Quick & Reilly’s share price climbing 4.2% following the announcement. Investors appear to view the deal as strategically sound and likely to produce cost and revenue synergies over the next 12 to 24 months.

The transaction highlights the strong M&A appetite in the online brokerage sector despite recent market turbulence. With interest rates on the rise and more volatility expected, brokers and trading firms are looking to diversify income streams and gain greater scale. More deal-making is anticipated in the coming quarters as firms look to strengthen their competitive positions.
