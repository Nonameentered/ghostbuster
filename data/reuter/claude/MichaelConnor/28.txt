R.J. Reynolds Executives Considered Adding Additives to Boost Nicotine Kick and Wooing Teenagers  

Executives at R.J. Reynolds, one of the world's largest tobacco companies and makers of Camel and Newport cigarettes, debated internally in the 1970s and 1980s about adding chemicals to their products to increase their nicotine kick for young and teenage smokers, according to internal documents obtained by public health researchers and reported by the New York Times. The documents show the company was concerned about losing market share to competitors and thought that enhanced nicotine effects and marketing to teenagers could help reverse declining tobacco sales.

Researchers combed through more than two million pages of documents obtained from lawsuits filed against tobacco companies in the 1990s by state governments seeking to recuperate healthcare costs from smoking-related diseases. The documents show Reynolds formed a special projects division in 1971 focused on developing products with stronger nicotine delivery and appealing to teen smokers. "Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14-18 year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population," said one document from 1973. "This group of smokers appear to represent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14-18 year old market increases in size and importance, the preferences and tastes of this group will become of paramount importance."

Reynolds began development work on experimental cigarettes with developer code names like "Uptown" and "Spurs" that contained additives such as ammonia to increase the absorption of nicotine in the lungs. Other experiments added acids to drop the pH of smoke to make nicotine impact the brain faster. The company also investigated menthol alternatives to target young black smokers. The researchers say the documents are evidence that Reynolds was focused on designing products specifically to maximize nicotine delivery to young and underage smokers.
