Quick & Reilly Group Inc. to Acquire Nasdaq Market Maker Nash, Weiss Inc. in Major Deal 

Quick & Reilly Group Inc., a leading electronic brokerage and market maker, announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire Nasdaq market maker Nash, Weiss Inc. for $425 million in cash and stock. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval.

The acquisition is a major move by Quick & Reilly to expand its market making capabilities and gain more control over trading in technology stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock market. Nash, Weiss is one of the largest Nasdaq market makers, facilitating trading in over 1,200 Nasdaq-listed companies. 

“This acquisition will strengthen our ability to provide liquidity and enable price discovery for our customers,” said James Bellini, CEO of Quick & Reilly. “Nash, Weiss has a stellar reputation and proven expertise in the technology sector. We are thrilled to have them join the Quick & Reilly team.”

Privately held Nash, Weiss generated over $200 million in revenue last year from market making activities as well as commissions on trades executed on its electronic trading platform. The New York-based firm was founded in 1992 and currently employs 450 people.

“Becoming part of Quick & Reilly will provide us with the scale and resources to expand into other asset classes and new markets,” said Gerald Nash, co-founder and co-CEO of Nash, Weiss. “We have a shared vision of using technology to deliver the best execution for our clients, and together we will be a formidable competitor.”

Under the terms of the agreement, 70% of the acquisition price will be paid in cash and the remaining 30% in Quick & Reilly stock. The Nash family and Weiss family, which own a controlling stake in the company, have agreed to hold the Quick & Reilly shares for at least two years. Three members of the Nash and Weiss families will join Quick & Reilly's board of directors as part of the transaction.

Quick & Reilly indicated the deal is expected to be accretive to earnings by $0.22 to $0.26 per share and generate over $50 million in cost savings as the firms integrate systems and cut redundant staff. The stock market reacted favorably to the news, with Quick & Reilly's stock up 8% at $34.22 a share in midday trading.

The acquisition is by far the largest for Quick & Reilly and highlights the pressures facing independent market makers and electronic trading firms. Many of these companies are eager to gain scale through consolidation, as competition intensifies and costs rise.   This competitive dynamic is driving significant changes across the market making and electronic brokerage landscape.
