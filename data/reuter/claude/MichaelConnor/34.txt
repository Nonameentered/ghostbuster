Flight Attendants Launch Historic Class-Action Suit Against Tobacco Companies over Second-Hand Smoke  

A group of flight attendants today filed a landmark class-action lawsuit against the four major tobacco companies, alleging that second-hand smoke exposure in airplanes over decades caused them severe health issues. The lawsuit, which covers over 10,000 current and former flight attendants across multiple airlines, seeks billions of dollars in compensation.

The four defendants named in the suit are Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, and British American Tobacco. According to documents filed in federal court, the flight attendants claim they were regularly exposed to toxic levels of second-hand smoke in flight cabins, in some cases for over 40 years before smoking bans were put in place. This routine and long-term exposure has been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses in the group.  

"For too long, the tobacco companies got away with putting our health and safety at risk to increase their profits," said John Smith, president of the Flight Attendants Association and a plaintiff in the case. (The actual name of the association and its leader have been withheld pending legal concerns.) "We were a captive audience, stuck in a workplace where the air was filled with smoke. The damage has been devastating, and now these companies must be held accountable."   

The case is a novel application of laws allowing class-action suits against companies that hid health risks of their products. While the dangers of second-hand smoke have been known for decades, the lawsuit claims the tobacco companies actively worked to cast doubt on research proving these health hazards. The companies allegedly lobbied to delay the banning of smoking on flights to maximize profits, even though the harms to both flight attendants and passengers were clear based on internal studies.    

If successful, the litigation would be the first major legal win against tobacco companies since state lawsuits in the 1990s. The size of the class also makes it one of the largest suits of its kind. However, legal experts are uncertain of the chances of the case succeeding given statutes of limitations and the companiesâ€™ efforts to settle other smoking-related claims in the past. The tobacco companies have denied all wrongdoing and vowed to vigorously defend themselves in court. A trial date has not yet been set.
