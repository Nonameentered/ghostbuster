Republic Industries to Expand Auto Rentals with National Car Rental System Acquisition for $600 Million in Stock

Republic Industries announced today that it will acquire privately held National Car Rental System for $600 million in Republic stock. The acquisition of National, the fifth largest car rental company in the U.S. with a fleet of over 200,000 vehicles, will allow Republic to expand its presence in the auto rental market and better compete with industry leaders Hertz and Enterprise. 

“This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit that will make us a more formidable competitor in the global vehicle rental sector,” said Chris Johnson, CEO of Republic Industries. “National has a very loyal customer base, a diverse range of vehicles, and a network across major cities in America that complements our existing locations. By combining operations, we can achieve significant cost synergies and accelerate our growth.”

Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Republic will issue new shares of its common stock to acquire 100% of National. The $600 million valuation represents a multiple of 10 times National’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $60 million in the past year. Republic expects to achieve annual cost synergies of $100 million within two years of closing the deal by integrating technology systems, optimizing fleet utilization, and eliminating redundant corporate overhead and operational costs.  

“We are excited to join the Republic family, which shares our customer service-oriented values and entrepreneurial spirit,” said Mary White, CEO of National. “Republic’s scale and resources will enable us to enhance our fleet, grow into new markets, and strengthen our loyalty programs and partnerships. This is a win-win transaction that will benefit both companies’ stakeholders.” 

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a vote of approval by Republic shareholders, though no issues are expected. Republic’s financial advisors were Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while National’s advisors were JP Morgan and Lazard.

If approved, the acquisition would be the largest in Republic’s history. The combined company will have annual revenue of over $10 billion, a fleet of nearly 500,000 rental vehicles, and operations in over 15,000 corporate and franchise locations worldwide. Republic stock rose over 5% on the news of the acquisition in afternoon trading. The deal is expected to close within six to nine months.
