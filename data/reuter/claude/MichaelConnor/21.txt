Florida Judge Rejects Separate Trials for Tobacco Company in Flight Attendants' Secondhand-Smoking Suit 

A Florida state court judge ruled today that cigarette maker Philip Morris and three major airline companies will be tried together in a lawsuit brought by thousands of flight attendants seeking damages related to exposure to secondhand smoke in airplane cabins.

Circuit Judge Jack Heflin rejected arguments by Philip Morris that it should face a separate trial from the airlines named in the 2001 lawsuit - American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines, which merged with United Airlines. The flight attendants claim exposure to smoke in airplane cabins caused them health problems including bronchitis, lung cancer, and asthma.

Lawyers for Philip Morris argued that the company faced different legal issues and challenges than the airlines, since the attendants did not directly use Philip Morris's tobacco products. However, Judge Heflin disagreed stating that "all defendants are alleged to have acted tortiously in a common scheme leading to a single injury to the plaintiffs.” A joint trial is "in the interest of justice, judicial economy and convenience to the witnesses," Heflin wrote in his order.

The trial, set to begin in January, will involve thousands of current and former flight attendants who are seeking damages from what their attorneys say were the irresponsible actions of Philip Morris and the airlines in promoting cigarette smoking and failing to protect workers from health hazards. The attendants claim Philip Morris provided free cigarettes to passengers for years to promote its brands, while the airlines made seating and ventilation changes to accommodate smokers but did little to protect the flight crew.

Industry advocates criticized the ruling, saying it would unfairly prejudice Philip Morris. "This case has nothing to do with secondhand smoke exposure onboard airplanes. It is simply the latest attempt to blame a single company, Philip Morris, for the alleged personal health issues of thousands of former flight attendants,” said Bryan Hatchell of the Tobacco Growers Association.

The ruling clears the way for what is expected to be a lengthy and complicated trial covering more than 50 years of operations by multiple defendants across a vast industry. However, it also raises the possibility of an eventual settlement by the companies to avoid a risky and costly trial. Settlement talks have so far stalled, but legal experts say either side may push to resume negotiations following the judge's decision today.
