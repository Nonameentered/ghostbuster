Latin American Television Poised for Billion-Dollar Advertising Boom in Next Decade, says U.S.A. Networks CEO

The television market in Latin America is set for massive growth and a streaming boom over the next 10 years, according to U.S.A. Networks CEO James Thomson. Speaking at the LATAM Entertainment Summit in Miami this week, Thomson said advertising revenue across Latin American television could reach $15 billion per year by 2030, more than double the current $7 billion annual market.  

"Latin America is home to more than 650 million consumers, and disposable income is rising across the region," said Thomson. "As viewership continues to transition from traditional broadcast TV to streaming services, the opportunities for advertisers to reach audiences in innovative ways will explode."

U.S.A. Networks launched a dedicated Latin American division last year to produce Spanish and Portuguese-language content for audiences across South and Central America. The company has invested heavily in streaming platforms and original productions to compete with other American media giants like Netflix, Amazon and Disney, as well as establish regional players like Globo and Televisa.

"There is huge demand for high-quality video content in Latin America, especially with the rise of streaming networks," said Juan Guillermo Correa, head of U.S.A. Networks Latin America. "By 2025, we aim to have over 50 million subscribers to our streaming services across the region, which will make us an extremely attractive outlet for major advertisers."  

Sports and live events are also driving much of the growth, according to industry experts. "Live sports have always been a key part of Latin American TV culture, especially soccer," said Claudia Ruiz, media analyst at Deloitte. "As major media companies secure streaming rights for football leagues, music award shows and other live events, advertising dollars are sure to follow."

However, there are still challenges to address in the region, including high rates of online piracy and uneven broadband connectivity in many countries. If streaming services are unable to reach viewers or gain their trust, the billion-dollar advertising bonanza may be threatened before it even begins. Overall, though, Thomson and other executives remain highly bullish on the future of television and online video in Latin America. With a huge population getting connected at an exponential rate, the only way appears to be up.
