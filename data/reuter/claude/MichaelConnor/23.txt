H.J. Heinz Co in Talks to Sell Substantial Businesses by April 30

H.J. Heinz Co is in advanced talks to sell several of its major brands and subsidiaries by the end of April, according to people familiar with the matter. The Pittsburgh-based ketchup maker is working with investment bankers to divest multiple well-known brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue. 

The planned divestitures are part of an effort by H.J. Heinz's parent company, Kraft Heinz, to slim down its portfolio and focus on its most profitable brands. Under pressure from cost-cutting investors, Kraft Heinz is aiming to shed underperforming brands across its portfolio. The company has not yet revealed which specific brands are up for sale. 

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation. The combined company owns popular brands like Heinz ketchup, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, and Philadelphia cream cheese. However, the company has struggled in recent years amid changing consumer tastes and pressure from private-label competitors.

The planned sales would be one of the largest divestitures in Kraft Heinz's history and underline its desire to aggressively cut costs. The company has embarked on a sweeping cost-cutting program that has already deliver more than $1.3 billion in annual savings. However, analysts say the cuts may have hampered Kraft Heinz's ability to invest in its brands and keep pace with industry trends.

The timing of any official announcements about the brand sales is unclear. Under the leadership of chairman Alex Behring and former CEO Bernardo Hees, Kraft Heinz had pursued cost cuts unabated in recent years. But Mr. Hees stepped down last year, and there are hopes his successor Miguel Patricio may plot a new course for the packaged-food giant. However, with Kraft Heinz under significant pressure to boost its stock price, large divestitures and more cost cuts may still be in the cards.
