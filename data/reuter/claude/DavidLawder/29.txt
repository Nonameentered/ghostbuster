UAW Union Launches Local Strikes Against GM's Truck Operations 

The United Auto Workers union launched local strikes against General Motors on Monday, targeting the automaker's truck operations in Kansas City, Missouri and Flint, Michigan. The strikes are the first localized work stoppages since a nationwide UAW strike against GM ended in October.

The strikes involve over 3,000 UAW members at the two GM truck plants where the company builds its highly profitable Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. The Flint truck plant employs over 2,600 workers, while the Kansas City facility has over 900 hourly workers. The two-day strikes mark an escalation of tensions as the UAW and GM struggle to reach a new four-year labor deal. The nationwide strike earlier this fall lasted 40 days, the longest auto industry walkout in 50 years.

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement that the local strikes show members are “frustrated with GM's lack of progress at the bargaining table.” The union is pushing GM to commit new products and investments to U.S. plants, grant higher wages for veteran workers, and narrow the pay gap for workers hired after 2007. GM wants more flexibility to control costs, including the ability to shift more health insurance costs to workers. Automakers have argued the higher costs are necessary as the industry invests in new technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles.   

The local strikes target two key GM facilities that build higher-margin pickup trucks which account for much of GM's profits. A prolonged local strike could impact GM's production and dealers' pickup truck inventories, putting pressure on the automaker ahead of contract talks scheduled to resume Tuesday. However, GM may be able to continue building some trucks at other U.S. factories. GM built over 60,000 more pickups than demand last quarter, according to estimates from researcher AutoForecast Solutions, helping ensure truck inventories remain healthy.

UAW members at GM lost out on thousands of dollars in profit-sharing bonuses during the nationwide strike. The union's move to launch shorter local strikes allows members to qualify for bonuses if a deal is reached quickly while sending a message to GM negotiators. Local strikes have been more commonly used by unions in recent years to gain leverage in contract disputes while limiting income losses for members.  However, it's unclear if the tactic will be effective in pushing GM to resolve the final sticking points in negotiations for a new deal.
