General Motors and United Auto Workers Negotiations Recessed After Contract Expiration, Talks to Possibly Resume Later in the Day 

Contract negotiations between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union recessed today after the existing four-year contract expired at midnight. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement on key issues before the deadline, though they plan to resume bargaining later today.

The existing contract covered nearly 50,000 U.S. workers at GM. It provided annual wage increases, profit sharing, and health care benefits. Sticking points in the new contract talks reportedly include the use of temporary workers, job security provisions, and the future of certain GM facilities. The union seeks to reduce the number of temporary workers and win new product commitments to plants at risk of closure.  

A UAW spokesman said they made "some progress" but "still have many outstanding issues remaining, including significant differences." The spokesman said the recess does not represent an impasse at this point. GM indicated they remain "optimistic" a deal can be reached to avoid a costly work stoppage. The company proposed maintaining current wage rates and profit sharing terms but the UAW countered it was not enough given GM's strong profits in recent years.

Previous contract talks in 2015 resulted in workers narrowly ratifying a new four-year agreement after a two-week strike that crippled the automaker. The strike cost GM over $300 million and the company is determined to avoid another walkout at a time when auto sales are slowing and trade concerns are impacting the broader economy. However, the union believes it deserves a bigger share of GM's strong performance coming out of the government bailout.

Analysts say the eleventh-hour pressure could motivate both sides to make concessions, though the issues on the table are complex. Any final deal still requires a majority vote of GM's UAW membership to formally ratify the new terms. The vote could take up to two weeks following a tentative agreement, leaving the outcome uncertain. All parties hope talks will progress rapidly once they reconvene to minimize risks of an extended strike. The White House is also monitoring the situation given the significance of GM and the broader auto sector to the U.S. economy.
