General Motors Strikes Deal to End Indianapolis Plant Standoff With UAW Union

General Motors and the United Auto Workers union reached an agreement late Tuesday to end a two-day standoff that halted production at the GM assembly plant in Indianapolis. The agreement ends the threat of a broader strike by the UAW against GM, which had until a midnight deadline Tuesday to reach a deal or face the first nationwide walkout by autoworkers in over a decade. 

Members of UAW Local 23 went on strike Sunday evening, halting production of pickup trucks and SUVs at the plant that employs 4,100 workers. The local union was demanding that GM commit new product programs to the factory to prevent future job losses. GM had recently announced plans to cut one of the two work shifts at the plant starting in October, which would have resulted in the layoff of 1,300 workers.

In a joint statement, GM and the UAW said the new agreement “will result in sustaining and supporting jobs” at the Indianapolis plant. Specific details of the deal were not immediately released. UAW vice president Terry Dittes, director of the union’s GM department, said the agreement represents “a mutually satisfactory outcome” that “highlights the importance of collective bargaining and joint problem-solving.”

The resolution averts a wider strike by nearly 50,000 UAW members at dozens of GM factories across the Midwest and South. The UAW’s four-year contract with GM expired over the weekend, and union leaders had threatened to call a national strike if a deal covering wages, health care costs and job security issues couldn’t be reached by late Tuesday. 

Any prolonged strike at GM plants would have disrupted the company’s new vehicle production and deliveries across North America. It also would have impacted numerous auto parts suppliers that deliver components for GM trucks and sedans.

Investors reacted positively to news of the Indianapolis deal and the avoidance of an immediate national strike. GM’s share price, which had fallen 2% during regular trading Tuesday, was up nearly 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Labor relations experts said a more widespread strike could have been very damaging to both GM and the union at a time when the auto industry is slowing.

The Indianapolis factory strike was the first walkout at a GM plant since the UAW's last strike in 2007. It served as an early test of resolve for Terry Dittes, who took over the GM department of the UAW last year. UAW President Gary Jones joined Dittes in Indianapolis to hammer out the final deal with GM along with executives led by Gerald Johnson, GM's global manufacturing head.

In a message to members Tuesday evening, Jones and Dittes called the Indianapolis deal “a victorious moment in our history” and said the workers’ solidarity in walking off the job for two days “got the company’s attention.” The union leaders said details of the full national contract with GM would be released in the coming days as negotiations continue.
