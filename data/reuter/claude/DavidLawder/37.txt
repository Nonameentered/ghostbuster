UAW cancels meeting on GM contract, indicating significant hurdles remain  

The United Auto Workers union abruptly cancelled a planned meeting of members from General Motors plants nationwide on Thursday to discuss details of a proposed new four-year contract, signaling that major issues remain to be resolved before a deal can be approved.

UAW Vice President Terry Dittes announced the cancellation of the meeting in a message to members Thursday morning. “The contract proposal has not yet been finalized,” Dittes wrote. “Given the significant open issues that remain, we felt it was not constructive or meaningful to proceed with scheduling meetings to discuss an incomplete proposal.”

The cancellation comes after three solid days of bargaining between UAW and GM negotiators this week. When the talks began on Monday, both sides expressed optimism that a deal could be reached fairly quickly. But Dittes' message indicates that several significant hurdles remained unresolved as of Thursday morning.

UAW members had been scheduled to travel to Detroit from across the U.S. for a Thursday meeting to review highlights of the proposed agreement before voting on it. The vote and ratification process can take a week or more to complete. With the Thursday meeting cancelled, the entire process will now be delayed until negotiators can achieve a tentative agreement that the union is willing to take to members for consideration.

“Your elected national bargaining committee continues working diligently for a contract that meets the needs of our membership, their families and communities,” Dittes wrote to members. The message asked members to “remain united” in support of the negotiating team.

Negotiators had been pushing to reach a deal ahead of a Saturday midnight strike deadline. But that deadline will now almost certainly be extended, as it will take time for bargainers to resolve outstanding issues, draft an agreement, and then schedule and hold informational meetings for members before a ratification vote. More than 49,000 UAW members are employed by GM across dozens of facilities, so the logistics of the voting process are significant.
