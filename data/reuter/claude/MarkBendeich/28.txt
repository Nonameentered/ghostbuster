Pacific BBA Ltd Expects 1996 Profits to Remain Steady Amid Softer Trading Conditions 

Pacific BBA Ltd, one of the region's largest commodities trading companies, said today it expects profits for the year ending December 1996 to remain steady compared with last year, despite facing softer trading conditions. 

The Singapore-based company said net profit for the fiscal year is projected to be between S$85 million and S$95 million. This would be largely in line with the S$90.3 million earned in fiscal 1995. However, the company cautioned that trading conditions have been more challenging this year due to global economic uncertainties and market volatility.

“General market sentiment has been weaker and more cautious this year, especially in the second half,” said Peter Tay, Chief Executive Officer of Pacific BBA. “This has impacted volumes and margins in some of our key markets. However, our business is well-diversified in terms of products and geography, so we have been able to maintain stable profits by leveraging our strengths across different segments and regions.”

The company’s key business segments include commodities such as rubber, palm oil, cocoa and coffee. Geographically, it has a strong presence in Southeast Asia as well as a growing business in China and India. Its global trading network and inventory management expertise have enabled it to continue generating healthy profits despite market ups and downs.

Looking ahead, Pacific BBA said it remains optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for commodities, especially in Asia. It will continue to invest in its trading infrastructure and capabilities across different markets. The company also intends to boost its presence in China, where demand for commodities is rising rapidly. 

“We have a positive view of the commodities sector over the next 3 to 5 years, especially in emerging Asian economies,” said Tay. “By enhancing our trading expertise, risk management and global sourcing abilities, Pacific BBA is well-positioned to benefit from long-term commodity trends in the region.”

The company expects to announce its full-year results for fiscal 1996 in February 1997. Pacific BBA shares closed 2 cents higher at $2.12 before the announcement.
