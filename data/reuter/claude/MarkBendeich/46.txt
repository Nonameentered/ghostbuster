Comalco, Australia's Biggest Aluminium Producer, Reports Loss Due to Weak Prices and Strong Local Dollar  

Comalco, Australia's largest aluminium producer, reported an annual loss for the first time in more than a decade due to weak aluminium prices and a strong local currency. 

The Melbourne-based company reported a net loss of A$90 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, compared with a profit of A$337 million a year earlier. Revenue declined 11% to A$5.2 billion due to lower aluminium prices. Global aluminium prices have declined about 15% over the past year due to oversupply and weak demand.

The results were also hampered by the recent strength of the Australian dollar, which makes Comalco's exports more expensive for foreign buyers. The local currency has gained more than 10% against the U.S. dollar over the past year. Comalco generates about 80% of its revenue from exports, primarily to Asian markets.

"It has been a challenging year with significant external headwinds from factors outside our control," said Comalco's chief executive Mark Chellew. He said the combination of low aluminium prices and a strong exchange rate had a "significant negative impact" on earnings.

Comalco has taken steps to cut costs in response to the difficult conditions. It reduced operating expenses by more than A$100 million over the past year through job cuts, eliminating contractor positions, and cutting maintenance and discretionary spending at its smelters. The company has also halted all non-critical capital spending.

However, Mr. Chellew said there are signs the aluminium market is improving, which could support better performance next year. Aluminium inventories have declined recently and China, the world's top producer, will cut capacity by up to 8 million tonnes over the next five years. Comalco also expects the Australian dollar to weaken, which would boost the value of its exports.

Comalco operates six aluminium smelters and two alumina refineries in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. The company is a joint venture between Rio Tinto, which owns 59.4%, and Sumitomo Chemical Co., which owns the remaining 40.6%.
