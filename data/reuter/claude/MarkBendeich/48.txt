RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd set to report sharp fall in annual profit due to slide in metal prices and problems in US copper smelter

RTZ Corp PLC and CRA Ltd, the world's second-largest mining company, is expected to report a sharp decline in annual profit next week due to falling metal prices and operational issues at its copper smelter in Arizona.

Analysts forecast that RTZ will report a drop of up to 50% in net profit for 2019 compared with the previous year. The mining giant has been hit hard by declining copper, nickel, and aluminum prices amid the U.S.-China trade war and slowing global economic growth. The prices of copper, RTZ's biggest earner, fell about 7% last year. The slower growth of China, the world's largest copper consumer, has weighed on the industrial metal.  

RTZ's profit margins are also under pressure due to increasing costs and lower grades of ores at some of its largest operations. The company's copper unit costs rose 8% last year while production fell 3%. RTZ has invested billions of dollars in recent years to expand its aging mines and build new ones, but it is taking time for the new projects to ramp up.

RTZ's bottom line has also been dented by a lengthy strike and an acid spill at its copper smelter in Arizona last year. The strike and the spill disrupted operations at the smelter for months, reducing copper concentrate processing by over 70%. Although the smelter has resumed normal production, the lost production and costs related to the industrial action and spill cleanup have significantly impacted earnings.

The sharp fall in profit comes despite RTZ's efforts to cut costs by streamlining management and operations. The company reduced capital expenditure by 20% last year and cut over 3,000 jobs. However, cost savings have not been enough to offset the decline in metal prices and income.  

Analysts say metal prices are unlikely to recover strongly this year given the uncertain global economic outlook. But RTZ's earnings should start to improve in the second half of 2020 as its new mines move into production and full operations resume at the Arizona smelter. The company aims to reduce unit costs and improve operational efficiencies to boost margins despite the tough market conditions. Investors will be looking for updates on the progress of the cost-cutting initiatives and new projects when RTZ reports full-year results next Tuesday.
