Coles Myer reports firm rise in sales revenue, signalling optimism for struggling Australian merchants 

Coles Myer, Australia's second-largest retailer, reported a 3.8% increase in third-quarter sales today, boosted by higher food and liquor sales. Revenue rose to $8.3 billion for the three months ending March 31, with same-store sales up 3.5% over the same period last year. 

The sales results were ahead of analystsâ€™ expectations and suggest Coles Myer may be turning around its fortunes after several years of weak performance. Woolworths, Coles Myer's larger rival, reported a 4.6% rise in third-quarter sales earlier this month, indicating improving conditions for Australian retailers.

"Our strategy to provide trusted value, quality and service is clearly resonating with customers," said John Fletcher, managing director of Coles Myer. He said the company gained market share in key categories like fresh food, alcohol, and general merchandise.

The results provide some optimism for Australia's retail sector, which faces significant headwinds like weak wage growth, high household debt, and competition from online retailers. While the sector as a whole continues to struggle, large players like Coles Myer and Woolworths are investing heavily in lower prices and an improved in-store experience to attract customers.

Coles Myer's supermarket division, which includes Coles and Bi-Lo, posted a 4.2% increase in third-quarter sales. Comparable food and liquor sales were up 4% over the same period last year. The company has cut prices on staples like bread and milk while improving product quality and availability. It aims to save customers $1 billion in lower prices over three years.

Kmart, a discount department store chain owned by Coles Myer, reported a 1.9% rise in third-quarter sales. However, comparable sales fell 0.7%, reflecting lower prices and weak demand for general merchandise. Target, another department store brand, said third-quarter sales fell 3.1% and comparable sales were down 4.4%.

Shares in Coles Myer rose 4.2% in early trading on the Australian Securities Exchange as investors welcomed the better-than-expected sales results. The uptick suggests the retailer's turnaround strategy is starting to resonate in the market. While one quarter does not make a trend, analysts said Coles Myer appears to have momentum on its side for the first time in years.

The overall Australian retail sector continues to face substantial challenges. However, large operators that improve value and service may be able to outperform in this difficult environment. Coles Myer's latest results indicate it is making progress on this front, though significant work still lies ahead to restore sustained growth.
