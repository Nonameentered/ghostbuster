Australia risks losing face in Asia as it considers shutting down overseas radio and TV services, warns report 

The Australian government is considering shuttering its international radio and television services in a move experts warn could damage the nation's soft power and influence in Asia.

According to an internal review of the government's soft power assets led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australia's international broadcasting services cost $223 million per year but lack a clear rationale and strategic purpose. The review recommends redirecting funds from Australia's overseas broadcasting arms towards other soft power initiatives like educational exchange programs. 

However, analysts argue that closing services like Radio Australia, the Australia Network television channel, and other media aimed at audiences in the Asia-Pacific would be short-sighted and counterproductive. "Soft power is a long game, and broadcasting has been a key pillar of Australia's soft power for decades," said Dr. Jane Hampson, an expert on public diplomacy at the Australian National University. "If you eliminate platforms to share Australian voices and perspectives, you risk ceding ground to others who don't share our values."

DFAT's review noted the declining reach of traditional media platforms like radio and TV, especially among younger audiences. But Dr. Hampson countered that broadcasting remains highly influential in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific where internet access and literacy rates remain relatively low. She also noted China's substantial and growing investment in media targeted at overseas audiences. 

Critics argue the government has failed to adequately invest in and promote Australia's international broadcasting, leading to its declining impact and reach. They say with additional promotion and distribution partnerships, services like Radio Australia could thrive, especially in the Pacific where China and other countries are expanding their media influence.

 key objective of Australia's 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper was strengthening ties with neighboring countries in Asia and the Pacific. But eliminating major soft power platforms, critics say, would make it more difficult to achieve objectives like promoting democratic values, supporting an open and prosperous region, and boosting people-to-people links.

 DFAT said no final decision has been made and further consultation is needed. But with budget pressures mounting, the fate of Australia's international broadcasting services remains uncertain. Analysts say diminishing Australia's media presence abroad could pose risks to national interests that outweigh any cost savings. As China expands its overseas propaganda efforts, soft power and public diplomacy are more vital than ever, they argue. Whether policymakers heed their warnings remains to be seen.
