Coles Myer Ltd Reports Firm Rise in Sales Revenue Amid Struggling Australian Retail Industry

Coles Myer Ltd, Australia's biggest retailer, reported a 3.1% increase in sales revenue for the 2020 fiscal year, bucking the trend of slower growth and revenue declines seen across much of the broader Australian retail sector. Revenue rose to $39.3 billion for the year ending June 30, 2020, up from $38.1 billion the previous year. Comparable sales growth was 2.5% across Coles supermarkets and liquor stores.   

The results provide some optimism for Australia's retail industry which has been grappling with weak consumer sentiment, economic uncertainty, and the growing encroachment of online retailers. "Our consistent focus on value, quality and convenience allowed us to gain market share and deliver continued sales growth, especially pleasing given the challenging market conditions," said Coles CEO Steven Cain.

Coles cited its "Smarter Selling" initiative which uses data and analytics to improve product availability and range, as well as targeted promotions, as drivers of its sales growth. The company has also been revamping its store format to provide an improved customer experience. However, Coles' bottom line profit declined 3.6% to $1.6 billion due to higher costs related to new store openings and investments in lowering prices.  

The results contrast sharply with major rival Woolworths which recently reported a drop in sales and earnings, and has struggled to keep up with Coles' turnaround under Cain's leadership. Sales at Woolworths' Australian food division fell in the second half of the fiscal year.  

Retail experts said Coles has clearly gained momentum but warned that the retail environment remains difficult given weak wage growth and high household debt levels in Australia. Much will also depend on how Coles leverages technology and data to provide more compelling experiences for customers. Overall, though, Coles' results were seen as providing a silver lining for Australia's retail sector which contributes around 5% to the country's GDP. With sales continuing to grow, Coles appears well positioned to see future success.
