Amcor blames weak paper prices and flat economic growth for rare slide in annual profit, but shares hold firm on promise of recovery

Global packaging giant Amcor announced a 2 percent decline in underlying profit for the 2019 financial year as weak commodity prices weighed on its paper division. However, share prices remained steady as the company signaled a return to higher profits next year and boosted its dividend. 

Amcor reported underlying net profit after tax of $A970 million for the year ended June 30, down from $993 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent to $13.3 billion over the same period, boosted by last year’s acquisition of U.S. packaging firm Bemis Company. But sales growth in local currencies was flat due to sluggish economic conditions around the world and lower pricing in the paper packaging segment. 

“The global economy grew at its slowest pace in three years over the 2019 financial year. This slowdown impacted some consumer markets and led to weaker paper product pricing,” Amcor CEO Ron Delia said in a media release. The company’s paper division reported a 10 percent slide in earnings before interest and tax, which it attributed primarily to lower prices. 

However, Amcor’s key plastic and glass packaging segments were more resilient, with stable volumes and revenue growth across all regions except Australia and New Zealand. Amcor’s medical packaging units also continued their strong performance, delivering double-digit earnings growth. 

To counter weak prices in its paper division, Amcor accelerated cost-cutting programs during the year. It removed $173 million in costs, helping offset inflation across its global operations. The company also paid down $500 million in debt, reducing leverage and interest costs.

Mr. Delia said Amcor expects an improvement in performance over fiscal 2020 as it fully integrates Bemis, economic growth stabilizes, and benefits flow from its savings programs. “While global growth is likely to remain modest, we expect slightly higher growth rates in certain consumer goods end markets such as healthcare, pharmaceutical, and selected food segments,” he said.

Amcor shares closed 0.2 percent higher at $16.38, indicating the market had already expected a weaker set of results and remains optimistic for Amcor’s outlook in 2020. The company lifted its dividend by 4 percent to 47 cents per share, payable on March 4, 2020.
