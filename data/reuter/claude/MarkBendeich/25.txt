BHP Steel Warned of Falling Behind Global Rivals Unless it Restructures and Maps Out Offshore Strategy  

BHP Steel, Australia's largest steel producer, risks losing further ground to global rivals unless it accelerates plans to restructure its operations and boost exposure to growth opportunities offshore, according to analysts. 
 
BHP Steel CEO Sandeep Biswas acknowledged the company faces significant challenges in the year ahead due to weak demand in key markets like construction and auto manufacturing as well as competition from large steelmakers in China and India. BHP Steel has already lost significant market share in key export markets like South Korea and Japan over the past decade. 
 
At BHP Steel’s annual meeting, Biswas told shareholders the company needs to reduce costs through automation, improve productivity at its Port Kembla steelworks in New South Wales, and push into more specialized highend steel products to restore competitiveness. However, he stopped short of announcing further job cuts despite a 30% drop in half-year earnings. 
 
“We have more work to do to transform our operations to ensure the long term sustainability of Australian steelmaking,” Biswas said. He said BHP will invest in technologies like AI and robotics to lower costs and improve safety over the next two years but the company also needs to diversify geographically to tap faster growth markets.
 
“Diversification of markets and having more exposure to economies in SouthEast Asia with significant infrastructure and construction activity is key to the future success of BHP Steel,” Biswas said. “We need to evolve from an Australiancentric mindset to one focused on the fastest growing economies in the region.”
 
Simon Thorne, resources analyst at JP Morgan, said BHP Steel’s turnaround strategy is “in need of greater urgency and detail.” He said BHP risks losing more ground to rivals like China's BlueScope Steel and India’s Tata Steel without a comprehensive offshore expansion and push into niche products. "BHP's focus on costs and productivity is commendable but misses the key challenge of diversifying its revenue sources."
