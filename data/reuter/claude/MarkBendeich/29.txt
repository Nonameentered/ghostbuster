National Mutual Holdings Ltd to Finally Give Indicative Value to Shares, Bringing Clarity to A$2 Billion-Plus Float Pricing  

National Mutual Holdings Ltd, Australia's largest insurer, will provide an indicative value per share for the first time as it pushes ahead with Australia's biggest share sale since Medibank Private floated last year.

The seller has pointed prospective investors to an indicative price range of A$5.90 to A$6.40 per share during Australia's biggest float for six years. This equates to a market capitalization of A$8.6 billion to A$9.5 billion, which would make the float between A$2.1 billion and A$2.4 billion.

This long-awaited pricing detail is a major milestone in NM Holdings' plans to list on the Australian Securities Exchange before Christmas. The deal has been wrapped in uncertainty for weeks given volatile equity markets. But sources close to the deal said on Tuesday there is enough interest from local institutional investors and offshore funds to get the float away at the target size.

The final price will be determined via a bookbuild process, where investors bid for shares, allowing the seller and its underwriters to gauge demand and determine a clearing price. Sources said the bookbuild is heavily oversubscribed, evidencing strong interest especially from offshore funds attracted to NM Holdings' stable earnings and growth profile. The final price will be unveiled on December 2 before shares start trading on December 5.

The float's success is important for the ASX, which has seen a dearth of major listings this year. It is also pivotal for the seller, Treasury Group, which is banking on the float to raise up to A$2.4 billion as it restructures its businesses. Proceeds will be used to pay down debt.
