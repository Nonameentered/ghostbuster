Former CEO of Coles Myer Accused of Spending Company's Millions on Extravagant Home Renovations 

The former CEO of major Australian retailer Coles Myer, John Fletcher, has been accused of funneling millions of dollars of company money into lavish renovations of his Melbourne mansion. According to reports, Fletcher directed Coles Myer to pay large invoices from contractors and suppliers for expensive upgrades to his Toorak home between 2005 to 2007, during his time as CEO.

The alleged misconduct was uncovered by Coles Myer's new owners, Wesfarmers, during a review of accounts and contracts after they acquired the retail group in 2007. Wesfarmers claims Fletcher had Coles Myer pay for items such as an $80,000 temperature-controlled wine cellar, $60,000 worth of home automation systems, and $45,000 in landscaping including mature fruit trees being transported and installed in the garden. In total, more than $2 million of company funds are alleged to have been spent on Fletcher's home.  

Fletcher was CEO of Coles Myer for six years from 2001 to 2007. During much of that time, the company struggled with slowing sales, profits, and share value. Thousands of staff were laid off in attempts to turn the company around. Wesfarmers bought Coles Myer in November 2007 for $19.3 billion, at which point Fletcher retired with a $4 million payout.

In a statement, a Wesfarmers spokesperson said "There were a number of questionable contracts and large payments to certain suppliers during Mr. Fletcher's time as CEO that we believe were not for legitimate company purposes. We have been conducting an internal review and will take appropriate actions to recover funds and pursue accountability." However, Fletcher's lawyers have denied all wrongdoing, saying that all home renovations were paid for personally by Fletcher and that he looked forward to defending himself against the "unjustified and reckless" claims.

The allegations against Fletcher come as public scrutiny mounts on executive salaries and spending. Last year, the CEO salary scandal at the major banks and an extravagant $12 million payout to the outgoing Telstra executive highlighted corporate excess to many. If proven true, Fletcher's lavish use of company funds for his own benefit could further damage public trust in big businesses and spur calls for broader reforms on executive pay and accountability.
