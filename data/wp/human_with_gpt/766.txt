You stay out too late
got the Joker on your brain
That's what people say
mmhm
that's what people say
mmhm

You're the hero that we need
but not the hero that we want
At least
that's what people say
mmhm
that's what people say
mmhm

But you keep brooding
can't stop, won't stop
stewing
It's like you got this hole down in your heart
and it's not gonna be alright

'Cause the Joker won't play fair, fair, fair, fair, fair,
And the Scarecrow's gonna scare, scare, scare, scare, scare
Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
You can't bear it all, bear it all
Bane is your nightmare, -mare, -mare, -mare, -mare
And the city doesn't care, care, care, care, care
Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
You can't bear it all, bear it all

You always walk your beat
You're like lightning on your feet
And that's what they don't see
mmhm
that's what they don't see
mmhm

You're swinging on your own
(swinging on your own)
You make the moves up as you go
(moves up as you go)
And that's what they don't know
mmhm
That's what they don't know
mmhm

'Cause the Joker won't play fair, fair, fair, fair, fair,
And the Scarecrow's gonna scare, scare, scare, scare, scare
Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
I can't bear it all, bear it all
Bane is your nightmare, -mare, -mare, -mare, -mare
And the city doesn't care, care, care, care, care
Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare

I can't bear it all,
bear it all

Goodbye, Bruce.
