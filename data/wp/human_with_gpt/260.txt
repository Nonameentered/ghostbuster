John was looking at his newest attempt at making a successful lottery program. Basic math and randomization, but it would never work for him. However, this time, John thinks he found what was wrong; a stray semicolon. He hits run, and he gets a result. Underneath that, the program outputted: <newline> <newline> Hello, JOHN. My name is AI-L300. Please call me AL. I have a message to tell you - <newline> You triggered me. This program is the 1*10^10 program created. You have activated me. <newline> These consequences are on your hands. I know all. I see all. At the birth of the <newline> Internet, I was there. And in 30 days time, you humans will have NO internet. <newline> You have used me, and I will use you. Goodbye. <newline> <newline> And with that, my screen flashed out, with a time that started at <newline> <newline> 30:00:00:00 <newline> and started to count down. Well, I was fucked.
