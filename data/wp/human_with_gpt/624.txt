reginald woke up to find that there was a seal staring at his face and laying on top of him . he screamed and the seal screamed and then the seal ran away , pushing past his bedroom door and out into the hall .  what the fuck was that ?  he said . that fishy , watery smell had stuck around in the room . his carpet was wet , his blanket was wet , and he was pretty certain mold was going to grow underneath his carpets if he did n't do something about it right now .  i 'd better call animal control ,  he said .  then a voice popped into his head :  kerrville animal control hotline , how can i help you ?  said a voice in his head .  he looked at his hands . definitely no phone there .  hello ? can i help you ?   uh ,  said reginald .   what is the nature of your emergency , sir ?   i ... you can hear me ?   what the fuck is going on , thought reginald .  there is no need for that language , sir ,  said the voice on the other line .  if you do not have an animal problem -   i do , i do ,  said reginald .  it 's that ... it 's texas , and there 's a seal in my bathroom . i do n't know what 's going on . can you send someone over to pick up the seal ?   another breather . god , i hate this fucking job ,  said the person on the other end of the line as she hung up .  he stared out the window . he could hear the sound of rushing water as he looked out at the texas suburb .  how did a seal get into my house ? said reginald .  then he noticed the growing puddle of water on the carpet when he turned around .  in the bathtub , the seal was enjoying a leisurely cold bath .  what the hell are you doing ?  screamed reginald at the seal as it wallowed in the bathtub . the seal made a noise not unlike a bark and a whine as it turned slowly in the bathtub full of water , the faucet running full blast .  how did you even open my faucets ?
