It was finally done. I wiped the sweat from my brow, huffing in the stale air, glancing over at the old woman rocking in her chair, snoring peacefully with each sway. "Grandma?"
Her eyes snapped open instantly, taking me aback. "June 29, 2016, at 4:29.70 am." She blurted out immediately, casting her eyes around the room wildly. "Did I oversleep?"
I didn't need to glance at my stopwatch to confirm the declaration. I was certain she was correct down to the millisecond, since she had predicted this so many decades ago.
"Only by a few seconds, grams." I said, smiling. "It's done. I finally finished it."
"A few seconds..." She rubbed her eyes blearily. "Bah, boy, that's an eternity past. Anyone see it yet?"
"No, grams. I haven't even called my professor yet."
She mused over this for a few seconds, muttering softly to herself. Whereas others had only seen insanity, I had seen inspiration and genius - and it had propelled me this far, so I was prepared to give her a few moments to think out loud.
"Hit your watch again, real quick. Get it running again."
"Grandma!" I barked, surprised. "This is a *vital* scientific breakthrough, temporal accuracy is paramount! We've discussed this, remember? If I misreport the creation time, people might go back too far and blink themselves out of existence!"
She arched a grey eyebrow at me. "Are you stupid, boy? If you report an earlier time, yes. If you report the wrong time in the opposite direction, then as long as you stick to it for the rest of your life, nobody will know. Well, except for idiots who gamble their lives on conspiracy theories. They'll overshoot and sort themselves out, though. Hit the damn button, boy."
Hesitantly, I did, but not before confirming the time it read. 04:29.70, and counting.
"That'll buy you some time, I shouldn't have napped, but eh... I'm old." She beamed over at me. "So, you finally got time travel going. And here you were, so confident that with pre-knowledge, you'd complete it early, and create a paradox. Mama Teach is never wrong, no she isn't."
I grinned, somewhat chagrined. "Right. Mama Teach is right on the money with her guesses. Now, why do you *guess* you had me hit the button again?"
She mused for a moment. "Boy, what do you think will happen once you open the Alpha Gate?"
"People will be able to time travel to any point henceforth, up to and until the device is ever destroyed?"
"...and you don't think you'll ever get tourists, who want to see the exact moment it all began?"
I shrugged. "Yeah, which is why I set out a few dozen seats."
Her jaw dropped, and she began chuckling, slowly at first, but rolling into belly busters. "Boy, you sure are a naive little idiot genius, aren't you? Do you ever stop to *think*, or do you just *invent?* How many people in this world? 7 billion or so? And that's in just this snapshot. There are a near infinite number of snapshots a'coming, and while it won't be all seven billion plus at a time... Jesus, boy. D'you think the Eiffel, or Buckingham Palace, or the White House only get *a few dozen* gawping visitors total throughout all of time?"
I blanched. "Oh." Lamely, I added, "So I should set out more seats?"
After she had ceased laughing, looking dangerously close to falling out of her chair, she sized me up speculatively. "Now, eventually, a Bureau of Time that doesn't yet exist will be and thus exist now, and they'll regulate travel to make sure you don't have several trillion knocking at your door every hour for the next ten generations straight... but yes, the very *moment* you submit that proof that time travel is possible, people will start showing up. Hence, the watch."
I looked at it, still ticking down the minutes. "I see."
"No you don't, boy. We need time for me to explain a few things to you. Most important secrets. For one, you can never so much as whisper out loud how you finally got it working. Scientists, military folk, and the like will hound you until you die to spill those beans, and more insidiously, there will be ghosts - sorry, temporal travelers with advanced cloaking devices - eavesdropping on every second of your life from that point onwards, hoping that you tell even one person in strictest confidence how it works, so that they can go forward and reproduce it."
She paused, contemplative. "Hope you don't talk in your sleep, boy. And it's a very good thing that this - whatcha calling it?"
"The Manuel Sanchez Temporality Altering Drive, Alpha Gate." I said quickly, with a sheepish smile.
"Very humble. I notice *my* name isn't in there anywhere. At any rate... it's a good thing that the final calculation is purely a fixed intuitive leap. Nobody else will ever make it, even if they try to reverse engineer how you did. Trust me on that, *nobody* will. They'll all try, though, in desperation. And then they'll turn to trying to pry it out of you with spies, chemical baths, brain cloning, the likes..." She smirked, her eyes shut as she rattled off the lists of tortures I could look forward to. "None will work, of course, so they'll retcon them so you can live a fairly normal life in the main snapshot. Don't worry too much."
This niggled my brain,
