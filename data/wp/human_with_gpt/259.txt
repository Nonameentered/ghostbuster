Aha! How are you, *mon ami*? She hugs me, and I feel a small spark cross from her hand to my shoulder. Then she steps back, dragging the wheels of her carry-on across the brick floor.
"I'm doing fine, Béatrice. I'm glad I'm finally getting to meet you."
"You know, you are so much taller than I imagined."
"Really? I sent you my picture, didn't I?"
"Oh yes, I have seen it. You are much nicer looking in real life."
"Aw, you're making me blush."
She sweeps her hair back behind her ear and smiles. I wonder if she has the same crush on me as I do on her. It's too bad we aren't meeting under better circumstances.
"Where are we to go from here? This airport is very confusing."
"Oh! Uh, right this way. Do you have any bags to pick up first?"
"It is just the one. I did not have time to pack much."
"Right, of course. We can pick up some things from the store if you want."
"Ah! You are too kind, Francis. What I want first is to sleep."
We walk around the corner and through sliding doors, then make our way upstairs. Béatrice looks around, confused.
"We are going to your car, yes?"
"Uh, no. We're taking the subway."
"Subway? Is that not an American restaurant?"
I'm not sure how to respond to this. "That's not... I mean, it is, but, um..."
"Haha! I am joking with you, Francis. I know my English well enough." We walked into an elevator. "There are trains, yes? The *métro*."
"Hah, you got me."
"I must laugh about these things. It has been a long day for me."
"Oh yeah. I can understand that."
"My brother committed suicide at the train station in Lyon."
I stopped laughing. Béatrice continued to look up at the ceiling as the elevator wound upwards. She was still smiling, but her eyes were small and sad and tearing up.
"It was a long day for him too, when they passed the law. He had no one to help him."
"So you've told me."
"I just can not believe this has happened to me."
I stop the elevator. There is an alarm ringing, but we both ignore it. She leans into my shoulder and sobs loudly, throwing her carry-on bag on the floor and wrapping her arms around mine. I feel another spark, a bigger one, as she holds me tighter than before.
I hug back. "It's going to be okay. We're going to get you help. All of us."
She nods, and squeezes me. Then she lets go.
"I should not be crying. It is the jet lag." Her voice was resolute, but it shook slightly.
"It's okay." I touch the elevator panel, and it starts moving again. "I'm sorry we have to take the train."
"I am not scared of it. I will be fine."
"What was your brother like? If you don't mind me asking."
"He was a strong man. You should have seen him. He would lift weights over his head like licorice."
"I've seen a few who can do that."
"Is it not fascinating?"
"Not as fascinating as you."
"I am sure you say that to all the pretty girls."
"I want to see you do it, though. In person for once. Can you show me?"
"Ah!" She pretends to be offended, putting her hand over her heart. "We are in public!"
"We're in an elevator!"
"Later. It takes a lot of energy. I am too tired right now."
"Okay, sure."
It is a long ride up to the subway level. The elevator is slow, groaning as it moves.
"Let's get out on the next floor." I press the button.
"This is our stop?"
"No, but this elevator is being weird. I shouldn't have stopped it; I think I broke something. The escalators will be faster."
"Ugh, walking."
"Sorry."
We get out and roam around looking for a way upstairs. We're in a food court.
"I am feeling hungry. The food on the plane was no good."
"Okay. What do you want?"
"Pizza, I suppose."
We get in the line for Sbarro's. Béatrice focuses on her phone while I glance around. People are eating, paying attention to their food and their bags and their electronics. Everything is normal. Then my eyes catch on a TV suspended from the ceiling. There's a news channel on that is showing mugshots.
One of them looks familiar.
"Béatrice? I need you to go to the restroom."
"*Qu'est que c'est?*"
She looks up at me, then follows my gaze to the screen. "Francis, what-"
"Go to the restroom and, y'know, *change.* I
