I glare outside, witnessing chaos all around. My boss, James, pats my shoulder and startles me from my daydream. "Chris, what do we do?" he exclaims, his voice escalating. I ponder for a moment and then answer, "The disaster meeting. Where are the plans?" He furrows his brows, not comprehending at first, but then realizes. After fetching me the plans, I skim through them until I locate mine. "Jim! Lock all the doors and gather as many objects as possible to barricade the main entrance. Selena, find anything we can utilize as weapons. James, keep an eye on the window." They comply with my instructions, and once we have gathered sufficient resources, we wait. Gradually but surely, we begin to hear shrill, inhuman screeches. They are piercing to the ears, resembling sheer agony. We start to hear banging against the doors. The sounds grow nearer and closer. They reach our door and we stand prepared. The door bursts open, revealing three heavily built, blood-covered "men," although calling them men would be an exaggeration. They sprint towards us.
