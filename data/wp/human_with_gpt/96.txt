gary settled himself into his office chair and logged into the prayer inbox . he sighed with an air of trepidation as he opened the spam folder , ready to sort the few genuine prayers out from the mindless drivel that had somehow made its way in . he 'd been asking god for a better spam filter for years , but apparently ( gary rolled his eyes ) his lord almighty had other , more pressing issues to deal with .
gary clicked impatiently through the junk mail .
delete .
delete .
gary shuddered . *definitely* delete .
moving onto the main inbox , gary settled in for a long day 's work . he cracked his knuckles , staring at the extensive list of mail , and took a gulp from the polystyrene cup of vending machine coffee that sat next to his keyboard . slowly , methodically , he began to work his way through the list of prayers .
cathy , 29 , who had prayed for the strength to finish a presentation for her boss , found herself imbued with a new sense of purpose as she discovered her most attractive colleague would be sitting in on the meeting . meanwhile , logan , 58 , was granted the morning off work to watch his kid 's school play , and alfred , 84 , stumbled upon his lost pen behind the sofa .
of course , there were harder prayers too , ones gary had to spend a little longer mapping out . he could n't save the dying partner of lucy , 33 , from leukaemia - it was simply his time to go - but he could give him an extra moment of lucidity , and the strength to grab lucy 's hand and tell her how much he loved her . and when andrew , 17 , begged him to stop his best friend from considering suicide , gary could n't change the thoughts in the head of someone who had n't prayed to him directly , but he could lift the cloud of panic from andrew 's vision just enough to let him support his friend and look for other sources of help himself .
gary spent the last hour before lunch engineering a complex plan to allow a young teacher to discover the abuse that leo , 6 , was subjected to at home . he collapsed back , exhausted and emotionally drained , as a freak rain storm emerged over a road in connecticut , which he hoped would delay the teacher 's journey just enough for her to arrive in the school car park at the same time as leo and his mother . the radio would be playing leo 's parents ' song as they pulled into the school drive , which would make his mother cry , and that in turn would make her apologise repeatedly to leo , betraying her true feelings in a way she rarely did when sober . and if the heat in leo 's mother 's car was turned up just enough , the window would be open at the very moment that miss rodriguez happened to be hurrying by , close enough to overhear even a whispered confession ... gary tapped a few keys , checking that the child safeguarding policy had fluttered to the top of the teacher 's desk , and nodded to himself .
gary treated himself to a hot chocolate at lunch , although it tasted bitter against the nausea that had risen in his throat on reading leo 's prayer .
when he returned to his desk , he was worn out and not in the highest of spirits . so when he clicked a new piece of mail and was greeted by the message , " error 404 : prayer not found " , it was practically​ a divine miracle that he managed to limit himself to muttering his most blasphemous curses at the computer screen . he tried to navigate back to the inbox , but the message simply blinked on the screen . as many times as he reloaded the page and turned the computer off and on again , the error message stayed stubbornly put .
gary swore bitterly enough to make most angels blush , and picked up his desk phone to dial tech support . he tapped his fingers on the edge of his desk , growing steadily more frustrated , until a young angel with a scraggly beard and a t-shirt that read , " byte me " strolled in through the door , whistling so cheerfully that gary instantaneously hated him .
the angel tapped a few keys , opening up programmes that , frankly , gary did n't even know existed , before he announced , smiling , " looks like you 've got yourself a virus " .
" what ? "
" a computer virus . opened any odd attachments recently ? emails from unknown senders ? "
" i have to open emails from unknown senders , it 's my goddamn- " ( the angel winced ) " -job . "
" well this is n't one i 've seen before , i 'm going to have to get my supervisor in here to sort it out . " the angel beamed . " she 's pretty booked up , but i can probably slot you in around thursday . "
" thursday 's not gon na cut it ! "
" sorry , dude , other people have emergencies too ... " faced by gary 's look of withering disgust , the angel 's happy glow seemed to dim a little , but it was n't long before he 'd recovered his grin and waved gary a cheery goodbye .
gary kicked the side of his desk , hard , and instantly regretted it as pain shot through his foot . hopping up and down , he cursed again , before letting himself flop into his chair . he glared at the error message , still shining out from the computer screen . he could n't answer any prayers . it would take time for things to get better for leo , and if the boy had to resort to prayer again , gary would n't even be able to read it . it would go unheeded and unanswered .
how many times had he said they ought to have a back-up system ? gary gritted his teeth , anger flashing in his eyes . whichever asshole had sent him a virus…
actually , that was a point . who was capable of sending him a virus ? an uneasy feeling began to coil in the pit of gary 's stomach . most humans did n't even have the capacity to pray consciously - their thoughts were simply translated automatically into mail form . to understand the system , to send a virus , you 'd have to be a supernatural being , something from heaven- or hell .
and why break the prayer operating system at all , unless you had a reason you did n't want them answered - unless you wanted the people of earth to have to fend for themselves ?
ice flooded gary 's veins . in an instant , he had leapt from his chair , stubbing his still throbbing toe on the desk for a second time . mingled gasps and curses spilling from his lips , he raced out of his office and into reception . he slammed his palm down on the desk .
" i need god . the big man . his holiness. "
" have you made an appointment ? "
" no ! this is an emergency ! "
gary could feel a vein popping out of his neck . he was on the verge of leaping over the desk and breaking into god ' s office himself , when a holy , eternal aura seemed to descend over the room .
" gary. " god 's voice was calm . " what seems to be the problem. "
gary was out of breath , and he could feel sweat beading on his skin . " i need your advice . "
