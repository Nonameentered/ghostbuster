One day I woke up to find that everyone had a number over their head. Then you're in bed and feel sleepy so you go to sleep with your honey, looking at her head, feeling safe and sound. And when you wake up, you eat breakfast and go to work and people are staring at you funny. You get to work, and the boss with a number over his head looks at you like you went nuts. So you go to the bathroom and look in the mirror. You see that your number was backwards, and everyone was looking at you because you looked scary. And you wonder why your number is like that, but you can't help but wonder, who was reflection?
