it all started like any other day really .  i can remember the time , it was 11:30am .  i was walking down the street , on my way to work .  
the sun blindingly encompassed everything , so i had to pull out my sunglasses .  so , i 'm fiddling around in my jacket pocket for them and just as i get my grip on the shades in question , i crash hard into a random passerby .  
she was nice enough , she handed me my sunglasses , apologizing furiously .  her eyes as i recall , were the most vivid cerulean .  her body , was very sleek and shapely .  she had curves in all the right places .  anyway ,  we said our farewells .  parting ways , never to see each other again , right ? 
a few years later , most of my family had passed away , save one crazy uncle named dave .  no one in the family ever visited him , as he 'd murdered my aunt a few years back .  they did n't lock him up , not in jail anyway unfortunately for him .  the lawyer on his case got him off on an insanity plea .  which , if we 're being honest , he was . 
he snapped .  he and my aunt were in the store .  she asked him if he wanted roast for dinner .  according to two witness accounts and the store security tape , it was at that moment he decided to strangle her to death with one of those bags specifically for vegetables and fruits .  it was brutal .  i always wondered what was going on in his head at the time .  it had to be something pretty powerful to do that to someone he loved .  i felt sorry for him . 
so , after my mom 's funeral i decided to head to the " hospital " they were keeping him in .  oddly enough , i walk in and there she was .  those eyes .  i could have spotted them out of a police line up .  they were etched into my skull , she recognized me too .  so we say our hellos , that 's when she asks why i 'm here .  well of course it would have been sly and potentially swoon worthy , had i said something like ; " i looked you up , because that day we met when we crashed into each other , i fell madly in love with you . " however that was simply not true .  i did n't know this woman , i did n't care about this woman .  she was just another face .  as far as i knew she felt nothing for me either .  we were strangers after all .  so , i answered truthfully .  " i 'm here to see my uncle . " she looked shocked . the kind of shock a person gets when you tell a slightly off-color joke , or the second in between burping and saying excuse me .  she asked me his name , i told her .  she then informed me he 'd passed away just that morning .  now , i do n't know if it was the fact that i 'd lost mom rather recently , or that i really truly felt sorry for dave . not one visitor in 10 years , just slowly stewing on his thoughts .  then finally someone 's coming to visit . somewhere in the afterlife i imagine he 's either really pissed or laughing his ass off .  someone came to visit , and before he could see them , he dies .  a tear began to fall , i wiped it away pretending i was rubbing my eyes .  she looked concerned .  she took my hand and led me to a chair in the waiting room .  that was her job , to console people here .  well that and receptionist duties .  we talked , and basically exchanged life stories .  apparently she 'd had a rough road as well .  orphan , abused by most of her adoptive families in one way or another .  at any rate , we decided to talk more .  we exchanged cell phone numbers , and began texting one another for about a month or so .  we would hang out and watch movies , we were n't really dating , just being friendly .  well one day out of the blue , she decides to ask me out .  i agree , because i had grown rather fond of her by now , we were best friends .  what could go wrong ? 
a few years pass , and we 're happy still and doing all those gross romantic things that guys pretend to hate around other guys even though we really enjoy them .  we had our fights like any other couple .  stupid little arguments , but those eyes ... 
i started to grow more and more distant towards her as time passed .  i watched the life and hope slowly dissipate from her lovely eyes .  we were killing each other .  no , that 's not right .  i was killing her ...  it was like watching a movie of us to me .  i could see what i was doing , and how it hurt her , but i just could n't snap myself out of it .  i could n't talk to her .  she 'd always try to come back with something positive , and it made me sick .  i wanted to shout at her . that being a damn optimist was n't going to solve anything .  it got under my skin so badly . 
one day , she got some terrible news .  a friend of hers had passed away , she was devastated .  i could see it , she was literally coming undone .  this was going to bury her .  i thought , " maybe i should say something , or do something . "  a part of me wanted to . i wanted to help this beautiful creature i had fallen in love with , so badly .  a bigger part of me , the part that consumed me , did n't even care .  i felt so guilty , that a part of me just could n't even muster up enough effort to say anything to this girl .  i tried .  " i love you , i 'm so sorry . " i hugged her awkwardly , and then left for work . 
well she seemed strange for some time , but months went by and things went back to normal .  her eyes did n't shine like they used to , but i thought we were doing well .  then she stopped saying it .  she stopped saying " i love you . "  i was worried , but thought maybe she 's preoccupied .  i began saying it first , she 'd say it back ,  i 'd ask her to promise , we 'd go about our business . 
i leave for work on a friday .  i come back around 12 , her car 's gone when i arrive .  okay , that 's normal she must be out with a friend .  i walk in , set my things in the floor , get myself a diet mountain dew .  something feels off , but i ca n't quite tell why .  i look around the house things seem to be missing .  i go into the living room and it 's barren . like i missed an apocalypse . 
i walk into the computer room , and on the desk is a note .  it 's from her .  basically saying how because of me , she had to leave , and thought we 'd both be better off .  i wept . 
i wanted to beg and plead and bring her back .  but the more i thought , the more i blamed her .  " screw her. " i said .  i 'll never date again .  i thought i loved this woman so much , but i did n't treat her right .  i was a jackass . 
i hate that i 'm an asshole , i hate that she 's gone ...  and i hate her .
