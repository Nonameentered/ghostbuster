i am bound to this rock unable to leave but i still have more freedom than you 
warden sanjeev regarded the prisoner with bemusement that s it that s all he says 
the guard bobbed his helmeted head in a brief affirmative sanjeev couldn t see the man s face behind the opaque black visor but his tense posture told sanjeev that he bought into the superstition surrounding the prisoner 
sanjeev barked a short laugh bit of a disappointment isn t it 
he crouched down to view the prisoner at eye-level the man was unwashed unshaven and truth be told probably undernourished even by the prison island s standards the guards likely withheld rations from the man whether that was due to fear of the prisoner s supposed influence on those around him or anger stemming from the rumors regarding his role in the previous wardens demise sanjeev was unsure 
looking at him now however sanjeev was sure that the man posed no threat 
warden rogers his predecessor had been hiding a long battle with mental health it was no surprise that 6 months of running boyle island had persuaded him to throw himself onto the jagged peaks surrounding much of the island s cliff face his obsession with the prisoner had little to do with that 
the warden before rogers sanjeev couldn t recall his name was nearly eighty years old by the time they shipped him back to the mainland one of the island s helicopters the lone source of arrival and departure from the island the man had been mumbling phrases like i can leave and is this freedom it s likely the rumors started there the guards being unable to accept that their old boss had finally turned senile 
sanjeev pushed a greasy lock of hair off of the prisoner s face the man s eyes held a startling anger no misguided determination perhaps sanjeev mused he put that thought aside for later consideration 
you re damn right son sanjeev conceded you are bound to this rock my rock i m the new warden here so i own this rock now and that means i own you sanjeev grinned now if that s your idea of freedom that s quite alright to me long as you sit there nice and quiet-like and don t cause no trouble then we can get along just fine i might even let you off those wall shackles i bet your wrists are just aching – sanjeev drew out the word for emphasis – for their own freedom 
sanjeev paused the prisoner said nothing though his gaze was unwavering 
mr cortez i am familiar with your transgressions you tried to assassinate the executive general of our nation-state such things are not easily forgiven sanjeev observed the prisoner for any reaction to this but none was forthcoming 
but he continued those that are residing in my prison and are not challenging the authority or integrity of those in my employ are working towards catharsis i respect that and i am willing to treat you as a new soul fresh to the world of civilized beings and capable of making rational decisions in return you must agree to follow the rules that i have and will continue to set forth for this prison 
the warden allowed cortez to consider this for a moment 
do we have an agreement he asked solemnly 
sound of clanging filled the cell as the other prisoners were released for lunch footsteps of guards clacked down the concrete hallway as they left their cell posts to monitor the eating area soon the only ones remaining in the block were sanjeev the two guards accompanying him and cortez 
the silence of the block became palpable and sanjeev became acutely aware of his guards fidgeting behind him sanjeev frowned inwardly he would need to address that lack of resolve soon he added it to his mental to-do list 
very well sanjeev began standing and turning to leave the cell i ll give you some time to think on 
i am bound to this rock unable to leave but i still have more freedom than you 
sanjeev stopped in the opening of the cell door framed by the bars and his two guards he sighed without looking back he ordered the guards unshackle him 
they moved to do so then beat him until your arms are tired move him to solitary afterward and make sure you take the scenic route let him see the lunch room one last time it might be a while before he makes it back 
the guards hesitated sanjeev turned i gave you those batons for a reason and you will use them he warned now get to work i have more pressing tasks at hand 
the beating changed nothing solitary confinement did little to change cortez temperament either sanjeev decided to let the matter go he knew how far a man like cortez would take these little spats with authority if sanjeev continued to engage the man the confrontations would escalate beyond a level with which sanjeev was comfortable sanjeev had not been lying when he said that other tasks were more important 
however sanjeev could not rid himself of a question that nagged at the back of his mind why did cortez choose that phrase and repeat it verbatim like some misguided mantra as far as he knew since cortez conviction and sentencing to boyle island the man had never uttered anything else 
it s just nonsense sanjeev chided himself the man had decided to throw his life away just to murder another then screwed that up he s broken 
sanjeev stared at the clock on the wall of his office watching the seconds tick by the question lingered 
the guards of boyle island were preparing themselves for another upheaval of leadership it had only been three months since warden sanjeev had assumed control of the prison and while the state of the prison had certainly improved the warden s increasing affiliation with the prisoner cortez was causing consternation among the ranks 
apparently this worry was reflected higher up as well the executive general himself was paying cortez a visit today the eg had never visited boyle island before and so the guards assumed it was not a good omen nevertheless excitement was in the air they wanted to witness what the eg would do to address the warden s negligence in this area and whether he would take affected by the cortez curse maybe he would have cortez executed god knows that s what the guards would have wanted 
sanjeev had taken to walking the perimeter of the island s wall once a week accompanied by cortez the prisoner hobbled alongside the warden as the warden spoke to him cortez had walked with a limp since sanjeev had the man beaten months ago 
the guards had never been able to overhear the conversations the warden spoke quietly and cortez had never been seen to utter a word rumors spread that cortez only spoke with the warden when they were in private the warden often brought cortez to his office for what he called individualized reform interviews while the warden occasionally did this with other prisoners stating that it had been proven to increase their chances of earning parole cortez visits to the warden s office were much more frequent 
furthermore the warden had moved cortez permanently to solitary the guards suspected that this was so the warden could limit the people that had access to cortez and raised suspicion but was generally viewed as a positive undertaking since fewer guards would be susceptible to the curse 
so as the prison s helicopter touched the landing pad the squad of guards standing at attention were eager with anticipation the warden had instilled the discipline into them to make it nearly unnoticeable but it was certainly there they expected a confrontation 
and they were certainly disappointed when the large man stepped from the chopper calmly walked up to the warden and shook his hand 
thank you for coming executive general welcome to boyle island the warden said please follow me to my office where we can speak in private 
i see what you meant when you said dismal doesn t do it justice the general quipped in his deep voice and the two laughed
