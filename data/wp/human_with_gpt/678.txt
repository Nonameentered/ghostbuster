The morning was overcast, a confusing illusion of alternating brights and darks that made everyone waking up straighten in panic at the afternoon light shining through their window. The first licks of fall crisp peppered at the window of a taxi puttering through crowded streets, stray medleys of red and golden leaves crackling under the tires' tread. Inside it a woman was adjusting her corrective lenses, craning her neck over a slight stain on the passenger seat in front of her to peer out ahead.
"Turn here, please?" She asked.
The driver nodded, making a sharp right into the entrance of an alley lined with multistory layers of graying brick and concrete.
"How much?" She inquired, opening the gleaming black leather of her handbag.
"Twenty-two," huffed the driver, "but this isn't where you wanted to go, ma'am."
"It's fine," she said, handing him a bill.
From outside, someone would have seen two things of interest: a middle-aged woman wearing business attire stepping awkwardly out of a taxi, preparing to carry her handbag and a single briefcase into the shaded uncertainty of a Chicago back-alley; a taxi driver, staring equally with suspicion and shock at a fresh one-hundred-dollar bill.
"Ma'am," the driver said with annoyance, "this is too much. I can't break this."
"Oh," she said, adjusting her glasses again to peer at the bill, "is that a bad thing?"
The driver thought about this. His conscience wrestled with his suspicion, until avarice jumped into the fray and stole the victory.
"No," he said, "that's fine. Have a pleasant day miss... miss..."
The woman opened the handbag with a flicking wrist, briefly glancing at its contents. The driver's face fell by a fraction of an astronomical unit.
"Mrs. Scharre," she said, closing the handbag. "Have a niceness day."
Mrs. Scharre winced at the linguistic error, closed the door, and walked off at a brisk step-step-wobble-step. The driver took no notice, and sped off before she changed her mind.
Ten minutes later Mrs. Scharre was sitting at the end of a conference table, unclasping her briefcase and spreading its contents on its laminated surface in neatly ordered stacks. It spanned nearly the length of an intensely lit room within the fourth floor of a wan office complex. Sitting to her left, a man in a gray jacket with brown hair on its way to silver leaned in closer to her.
"They're late," he covertly whispered, "again."
She stopped, considering this, and continued her preparations.
"They are consistent," she said with a monotone, "and that is what I like."
The office's double doors opened with a hollow creak. A casually dressed man with a tan messenger bag strapped to his shoulder peered in and around the inside.
"You're Mrs. Scharre, right?" The newcomer asked, his sharp eyes darting between the two.
"Yes," she said, not looking up.
"Awesome," he said, "I'm Tony. We spoke on..."
"I'm aware of who you are," she interrupted, "take a seat in the appropriate place."
She blinked, stopped her shuffling, and gave a quick side-long glance to the man on her left, and then Tony. Tony cocked an eyebrow, and sat on the opposite side without comment. She cleared her throat, and began to read from a thick pile she'd made to her right. The man to Mrs. Scharre's left stood up, leaning over the table to extend a hand.
"Don't mind her," he apologized, "she's grumpy in the morning. I'm Gary."
"Glad to meet you," Tony said, returning the hand with a firm shake.
They sat retook their seats. Silence ensued, broken only by the turning of Mrs. Scharre's pages.
"So," Tony awkwardly offered, "is there anyone else coming?"
Gary glanced at a watch on his wrist.
"Any minute now, but we can start. First I'll need you to sign some..."
Mrs. Scharre's hand shot out in front of Tony with a packet. She dropped it, and went back to turning.
"...Things. A non-compete, non-disclosure – basically everything we need to save our collective skins." He finished, casting her an annoyed look.
Tony blinked. He blinked again.
"She was serious about the," Tony said, adding air quotes to, "*alien* thing?"
"We have considered our options, and it's been unanimously decided among us that a story about extra-terrestrial contact would adequately draw attention away from our business interests. We've also decided that your affiliations with multiple media outlets in addition to your popularity as a public figure will make this possible." Gary said.
Tony waited for the joke's punchline – maybe a camera crew to pop out. Nothing happened. He bit his lip, and tapped a finger on the table in thought.
"Does a position with our organization still interest you?" Gary asked.
Tony's face fixed into a contemplative mask. He looked at Mrs. Scharre, at the packet she held, at Gary, at the papers turning in her hands, and...
Tony's face became a mixture of puzzlement, and uncertainty. Gary - noticing the change – tracked his gaze across the table to his right, up to Mrs. Scharre's hands, the pages fluttering in precise motions, and her eyes darting across their surface with alarming speed. His smile also transformed – into dumbfounded panic.
"Judith," he said quietly, "what are you doing?"
"Reading," she said, with a tone that suggested this should be obvious.
"Judith, you are aware the pages are upside down," he said in low tones, "aren't you?"
She stopped reading, and closed her eyes in concentration. As if with effort, she blushed.
"I like to keep sharp," she
