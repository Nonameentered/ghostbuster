Oddly enough twas a girl that I met 
Who disproved of my forward advances 
With a singular text, I discerned what she meant 
By a pair of stern-eyed stolen glances. 

Met with fright, and full of delight, 
*I can not believe that I was n't right* 
I called her phone, she said she was home 
I biked my way over, *hope nobody 's home* 

She came to the door with a knock of my knuckles 
In socks, nothing else, making my boy knees buckle 
``I assume, '' she began, ``you received my alert'' 
``Yes but how is this real? You look on me as dirt!'' 

Now, I do n't wish to earn my ladies scorn 
So I wo n't utter details, but I 'll warn: 
When a girl entices you to chase 
Do n't be fooled by her Resting Bitch Face
