when i was young , i was obsessed with lucid dreaming . i would always browse the internet for tips and instructions on how to achieve that coveted state - where one was in full control of a fake reality . i imagined nightly trips to exotic worlds , and a place where i could stand up to the bullies and always , always get the girl .
i gave it up after the first night . instead of being transported to a beautiful fantasy the beckoned at my every whim , i became frozen in place within my own body , forced to watch as malicious creatures seemed to crawl towards the bed . i felt something sit on my chest , slowly and inexorably exerting pressure . oh . my breathing drew up short . so . i felt as if i would throw up . slowly . i could 've sworn that i heard a rib crack .
of course , when i woke up i found that none of those things had actually happened . i was fine , and what i had experienced was simply a side effect of attempting to reach a lucid dream state . needless to say , i did not try ever again , and slept with my parents for a few weeks afterwards .
i never did forget that feeling of helplessness , though . watching what was happening , fearing the inevitable , with no power to stop it .
i 'm a grown man now . it has been many years since i was last afraid of the dark . since i last thought of helplessness , and creatures in the night . but now i remember again . now i am afraid .
it was such an innocent looking thing . a tiny chip . it could 've been anything - my optical implant , intelligence enhancement , hormone regulation . in fact , if i were any other person , i probably would 've just shrugged it off . but i knew . it could not have been any of those things .
how long had it been there ? the question burned in the back of my mind . who had put it there ? what did they stand to gain ?
was my whole life a lie ? did i truly have any free will ? how long has this thing been influencing me for ? which decisions were my own ? did i really love my wife ? do i really like my job , my children , my friends ?
i have to get it out . i know how ; i 've done it before with more complex implants . i just need access to my workshop and time .
i 'm taking it out tonight .
----- " tonight " has come and gone . chip 's still in .
that evening , as i strode through the door in a daze , i came to realization . what if it was n't just me ? what if ... it was everybody ? what if we were *all* the playthings of some person or group , being directed and nudged towards certain goals ? what if they could tell that my little light had gone dark on their screens ?
no , it 's too dangerous to take it out right away . not until i know more .

i did some diagnostics last night . the chip definitely is some kind of control apparatus . it gets a little ping from an unknown signal , adjusts dopamine and hormone levels *just so* when the target thinks of something in particular - be it a job , a person , or what-have-you - to influence them into making certain choices . then , like the good little machine it is , it sends a return 'ping ' to confirm success or failure .
i thought of my wife first , fingers trembling on the receiving device that i had built out of spare parts and an old radio .
*ping . *
my children .
*ping . *
my job .
*ping . *
my ambitions .
*ping . *
the shit i took an hour ago .
*ping . *
huh . must be something wrong with the damn thing .

i got the machine working a few hours later . it 's still on in my workshop , crackling static every once in a while and emitting a faint light .
i tested it out . i 'd rather not talk about the results , but it will suffice to say that a lot of who i am is not entirely my own .
i 've spent the last week thinking about it . if someone out there really does control my chip , and potentially others ' , surely i could n't do anything about it ? even if i removed mine , i would be stuck in a world where i did n't belong , miserable in an otherwise happy society .
i mean , i 'm pretty damn happy , right ? my wife loves me , my kids are amazing , and my job pays well . if this is life as a puppet , i ca n't think of anything i 'd rather be .
i 'm going to destroy the damn receiver .
i 'm going to leave the chip in .
i 'm going to try to forget it 's even in there .
it 's for the best .
