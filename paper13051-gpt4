Summary: The paper discusses a novel numerical method for solving Statistical Inverse Problems (SIP) using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms. The authors propose a modification for the SGD algorithm to smooth the stochastic gradients and improve empirical performance. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the excess risk performance of the developed algorithm and includes an example of the algorithm applied to a Functional Linear Regression model.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

Originality: The paper presents a novel approach to solving SIP using modified SGD algorithms, which is a fresh take on the problem.
