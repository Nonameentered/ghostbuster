Summary:
This paper mainly focuses on the formulation of SIP (statistical inverse problem) and the method to solve SIP. In the first part of this paper, the authors formulate SIP utilizing functional analysis. They also give some examples of SIP under this formulation.

In the second part, after showing how to calculate the gradient under this setting, they propose two SGD-based algorithm to solve SIP. They give a finite sample bound for the expected excess risk of their algorithms.

In the last part, the authors provide numerical results for two applications of the Functional Linear Regression problem.

Strengths And Weaknesses:
Strengths: The authors give a novel numerical method to solve SIP, which shows good originality. They give both theoretical analysis and real data experiments, which shows the good quality of this paper.

Weakness: It seems that they do not show the intuition and advantage of their new method, which makes this paper somehow unclear. And the proof techniques are just classical convex optimization analysis. Therefore this paper lacks significance to some extent.

Questions:
1.In Lemma 4.3, you've mentioned that there exists a kernel \Phi. Can this kernel be easily found in many SIP problems (other than functional linear regression)?

Limitations:
It might be interesting if the results can be extended to nonlinear SIP (or any other relaxation of Assumption 4.1).
