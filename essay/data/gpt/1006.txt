In the ancient Greek philosophy, one of the most contested doctrines was the pursuit of pleasure as the ultimate good. Socrates, the famous philosopher who lived in Athens during the 5th century BCE, had different views on the nature of pleasure compared to his contemporaries. In two of his dialogues, the Protagoras and the Gorgias, Socrates presents contrasting accounts of pleasure, its relationship to virtue, and whether it is the ultimate good. This essay will examine the two contrasting accounts of pleasure offered by Socrates in both dialogues and how he argues for and against the notion of pleasure as the ultimate good. Additionally, the significance of his arguments will be examined, and how they apply to understanding his views on hedonism.
Protagoras, one of the famous sophists in Athens, claimed in his teachings that pleasure is the ultimate good, and all other human endeavors should be directed towards attaining it. He believed that everyone seeks pleasure, either through their actions or their desires. Protagoras argued that if someone could attain pleasure continuously and avoid all pain and distress, then there would be nothing that could be considered evil or harmful in their life. Socrates, in his dialogue with Protagoras, challenges his view of pleasure as the ultimate goal.
In the Protagoras, Socrates argues that it is impossible to believe that everything we desire as pleasurable is always good for us. He points out that many things that people desire for pleasure ultimately lead to harm. For instance, someone may desire to eat junk food continuously, which will result in health problems. Similarly, some people may desire to drink alcohol excessively, which will lead to addiction. Thus, Socrates rejects the view that pleasure is the ultimate good. Instead, he suggests that it is only helpful to pursue positive pleasure that will result in no harm.
Furthermore, Socrates presents a contrasting view of pleasure in the Gorgias. In this dialogue, he argues against Callicles, another protagonist, who believed that pleasure rather than virtue led to happiness. Callicles asserted that everyone should live for themselves and acquire whatever pleasures they desire. Socrates contends that pleasure is not the ultimate end, but a byproduct of pursuing true excellence or goodness. He posits that pleasure is not a thing that is only rooted in the satisfaction of physical and sensory desires, but it is a feature of genuine well-being. He goes on to argue that genuine happiness is attained by extending and emphasizing one’s better qualities rather than the pursuit of pleasure.
Socrates’ view of pleasure in the Gorgias emphasizes that true and lasting pleasure is only gained from the enjoyment of authentic excellence, and not from the simple pleasures that result from satisfying bodily needs or desires. According to him, the pleasure that people seek will continue to elude them if they only seek pleasure, and this is because happiness and well-being must be based on qualities that are incontrovertibly good and necessary.
Socrates further argued against hedonism by presenting an argument known as the ‘bodily pleasure argument,’ in the Gorgias. He highlights that the indulgence in bodily pleasures tends to weaken the human faculties that are vital for achieving excellence. He states that the pursuit of pleasure leads to moral degeneracy, moral corruption, and incapacity to make sound judgments. By dissolving the necessary disciplinary forces of the soul, seeking pleasure interrupts personal excellence and fosters a lack of self-control over some human flaws and impulsive tendencies.
Socrates, in his discussions on pleasure in the Protagoras and the Gorgias, offers two different versions of the relationship between pleasure and virtue. In the former, he suggests that pleasure is not an ultimate good because it is not a necessity for human happiness. In contrast, he states in the Gorgias that one’s source of true happiness and enduring pleasure lies in the pursuit of a virtuous life.
Socrates’ idea of pleasure as the byproduct of the soul attaining virtuous excellence, and not as a goal, makes his view different from that of his contemporaries, and is in opposition to the idea of hedonism. His argument against hedonism, particularly bodily pleasures, shows the interdependence of pleasure and ethical rigidity. By emphasizing the importance of personal ethics and the pursuit of virtue, the role of pleasure becomes less significant, and thus, the pursuit of pleasure is not crucial as it does not yield authentic well-being.
In conclusion, Socrates offered two contrasting views of pleasure in the Protagoras and the Gorgias. In the former, he contends that pleasure is not the ultimate good as its pursuit leads to harm and loss of self-control. In the latter, he argues that genuine and lasting pleasure is only derived from living a life of ethical excellence and uprightness. His arguments against hedonism show the interdependence of pleasure and virtue. By emphasizing the importance of personal ethics and the pursuit of excellence rather than pleasure-seeking, Socrates’ view of pleasure becomes less significant, and thus, the pursuit of pleasure is not crucial as it does not yield authentic well-being. Therefore, in Socrates' view, pursuing moral excellence takes precedence over the pursuit of pleasure as the former leads to true happiness and well-being.
