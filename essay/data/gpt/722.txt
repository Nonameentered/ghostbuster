The Victorian era was a time of great social and economic change, marked by the growth and expansion of industry, the rise of the middle class, and the increasing tension between different social classes and between the sexes. Victorian novelists used the landscape and symbolic geography to explore these conflicts, highlighting the differences and tensions that existed between different groups of people and between men and women. In this essay, we will explore how Victorian novelists such as Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy used landscape and symbolic geography to explore these conflicts and present their views on class and gender relations.
One of the ways that Victorian novelists used landscape and symbolic geography to explore the conflict between different social classes was through the depiction of urban and rural spaces. The city and the countryside were often presented as opposing forces, with the city representing industrialization, progress, and the middle class, and the countryside representing tradition, conservatism, and the working class. Charles Dickens, in particular, was known for his vivid descriptions of London, which he used to critique the social and economic inequalities of Victorian society.
In his novel, "Oliver Twist", Dickens uses the landscape of London to highlight the poverty and desperation of the lower classes. The city is portrayed as a dirty and dangerous place, full of crime and disease. Oliver, the young orphan protagonist, is forced to navigate this landscape, and his experiences highlight the cruelty and indifference of the upper classes towards the poor. The novel presents a stark contrast between the luxurious homes of the rich and the squalor of the slums, highlighting the vast disparities in wealth and privilege that existed in Victorian society.
Similarly, Thomas Hardy used the landscape of rural England to explore the tensions between social classes and between men and women. In "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", the countryside is portrayed as a place of beauty and tranquillity, but also as a place of inequality and injustice. Tess, the novel's protagonist, comes from a poor farming family and must navigate the challenges of a patriarchal society that values men over women. The novel explores the impact of social class on individual lives, with Tess being unable to overcome the societal prejudices that hold her back.
Another way that Victorian novelists used landscape and symbolic geography to explore conflict was through the use of symbolism. The landscape and setting of a novel were often used to represent key themes and ideas. For example, in "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Bronte, the wild and desolate moors are used to symbolize the turbulent and stormy emotions of the novel's characters. The moors are also used to represent the struggle between Heathcliff and Catherine, two people from different social classes who are unable to overcome the divisions that separate them.
In "Great Expectations", Charles Dickens uses the river to symbolize the passage of time and the development of the novel's protagonist, Pip. The river represents the journey of life, with Pip growing and changing as he navigates its twists and turns. The river also serves as a metaphor for the divisions between the upper and lower classes, with Pip moving from the poverty of his childhood to the wealth and privilege of his adulthood.
In conclusion, Victorian novelists used landscape and symbolic geography to explore conflicts between different social classes and between the sexes. Through the depiction of urban and rural spaces, they highlighted the disparities in wealth and privilege that existed in Victorian society. Similarly, through the use of symbolism, they were able to represent key themes and ideas, such as the struggle between tradition and progress, or the relationship between men and women. By doing so, Victorian novelists were able to present their views on class and gender relations, and to critique the social and economic inequalities of their time.
