Sexual assault has always been a prevalent problem in society. The act of violating someone's personal space, dignity, and trust, in such an intrusive manner, leaves permanent scars on an individualâ€™s psyche. Consequently, it is necessary for the legal system to treat sexual assault cases with utmost care and address them with the sensitivity they deserve. However, the low conviction rates of sexual assault cases have been a concern for justice seekers worldwide. Despite significant progress in women's rights movements and legal frameworks to protect them, the low conviction rate remains a prevalent issue. The criminal justice system's failure to convict perpetrators has put sexual assault survivors at risk of being disbelieved and through great psychological damage. In this essay, the reasons behind the low conviction rate when it comes to sexual assaults are explored, with an emphasis on the following factors: underreporting of assaults, the characteristics of the act of rape, and the stereotypes and prejudices that remain in the rape trial.
One of the most common reasons is the low levels of reporting of sexual assaults. Victims of sexual assaults often prefer not to report the matter to authorities. Many survivors fear that they will not be believed due to the history and stigma attached to rape cases. They fear being blamed for the assault or their testimonies will not be treated impartially. Survivors' beliefs are supported by data from the National Crime Victim Survey, which reports that only a third of sexual assault incidents are reported to the authorities. Most cases of sexual assault involve someone known to the survivor, such as a partner, former partner, friend, or family member, which constitutes the worst aspect of the assault for the victim's consequent response. Victims often find it challenging to place the blame solely on the offender, as they endure social pressure to ignore the harm caused or report it appropriately.
The reluctance to report may result from the difficulty of prosecuting, especially in cases of acquaintance rape. The nature of acquaintance rapes is such that they do not fit the prevailing cultural and legal definitions of rape. The victim may not perceive themselves as having been assaulted, and it is often difficult for authorities to establish consent or lack of it. The victim may fear that they will be challenged about their behavior, especially if they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or they were inured to the attacker. The victim's fear is linked to the fact that rape charges prove difficult to prosecute in court. For a charge to warrant a conviction, the prosecution has to prove the absence of consent. In most assault cases, the defendant argues that the victim consented. 
Another significant factor responsible for the low conviction rate is the characteristics of the act of rape. Rape is not a straightforward crime to prosecute. It is a crime involving immense ambiguity. Proof is often based on an objective test of consent and force used during the act of rape. The act of rape involves an intersection of physical, psychological, and social dynamics that make it difficult to establish non-consent. The fact that sexual intercourse can be voluntary or forced means it becomes challenging to establish the crime of rape and its accompanying charges. In most cases, the victim- unless they have visible signs of injuries- is confronted with doubt as to whether they are telling the truth. Because the crime is almost always committed in private, it becomes challenging to collect forensic evidence or establish the facts of the case.
During the prosecution phase, character evidence can be admitted into the trial, which, if unrelated to the acts constituting the crime, becomes evidence of the character witness's prejudice. The victim's character can be used against them to impugn their credibility as a witness. For instance, if the victim had a prior criminal record, they could be discredited as a witness on the basis that they are not a credible individual. In such settings, the victim's defense comes under intense scrutiny. The mere allegation of rape can destroy a person's reputation and lead to the victim being portrayed as morally deficient. In most cases, there may be a cultural inclination to accept the defendant's version of the events - which is often based on stereotypes -rather than the victim's version of the events. 
There is also evidence that incorrectly asserts that most claims of rape are deceitful, which performs an essential function in the reluctance to believe rape victim's testimony. Although there is no empirical evidence to support the assumption that false allegations are made frequently, the mere suggestion that they do is enough to discredit rape victims. Women who report a rape may be construed as revenge seekers or as promiscuous and are denied the support they require.
Stereo-typing and prejudice is also a prevalent reason for the low conviction rates of rape crimes. Women are typically victims of rape. As a result, gender biases are a significant impediment in bringing perpetrators of this crime to justice. The criminal justice system often lacks the tools for considering and understanding the gender-based nature of crime. For instance, jurors may hold a belief that rapes only occur in severe circumstances, such as when the woman is severely beaten. If the victim's appearance is not in line with their expectations, it may be challenging to convince them beyond reasonable doubt. This limits the scope of culpability and the ability of the prosecutor to convince the jury that the act was committed without the victim's consent.
Moreover, the police, prosecutors, and judges, who are disproportionately male-dominated, are said to rely on stereotypes of female victims who contribute to low rape reporting rates and the widespread failure to convict assailants. Judges have been known to diminish the nature of rape when collocating their sentence, leading to lenient decisions. Judges have also been known to use rape victim's sexual history against their allotments. Even among juries, whose perception of the defendant is solely made on the basis of evidence, rape case's chance of success is doubtful. Jurors are prone to consider the defendant's version of events more favorably if the victim's relationship with the defendant is consensual. 
Overall, it has become apparent that the low conviction rate of sexual assault cases has detrimental consequences on the victims' psyche and undermines public trust in the legal system. These factors are closely linked and influence how the case proceeds. The low levels of reporting of assaults discourage the justice seeker from taking action, making it almost impossible for the prosecution to establish reasonable doubt. Stereotypes and prejudices create misconceptions in the jurors' mind, leading to wrongful judgments. Therefore, a solution to the problem of low conviction rates lies in reworking the justice system's frame to reflect more gender sensitivity and the need to provide more effective deterrent and protection mechanisms for women against sexual violence. This can be achieved through focusing more on evidence rather than personal character and holding individuals responsible for their actions. It is also important to create an environment where sexual assault victims are guaranteed a fair and compassionate hearing where their rights and needs are prioritized over the attacker's. Educating the public on the nature of sexual assault-related cases, security to victims, and necessary frameworks can contribute enormously towards reducing the low conviction rates. 
In conclusion, the low conviction rates of sexual assault cases remain a significant issue despite the progress made in women's rights movements and legal frameworks to protect them. Factors such as underreporting of assaults, the characteristics of the act of rape, and the stereotypes and prejudices that remain in the rape trial are closely linked and affect how cases proceed. The low conviction rate means justice-seekers are discouraged from reporting and the justice system becomes less effective. Thus, there is a need for the justice system to provide more effective deterrent and protection mechanisms against sexual violence, ensuring the fair treatment of victims.
