The structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) implemented in Brazil had a significant impact on the rise of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Rural Workers (MST) in the 1990s. The policies introduced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank aimed to counter Brazil's economic crisis and promote fiscal sustainability. However, the impacts of these policies on poverty and inequality in rural areas sparked a reaction from the MST. This essay examines the policies introduced by the IMF and the World Bank and their impact on rural areas in Brazil. It also analyzes the MST's response to these policies, particularly the surge in land occupations and radicalization of rural conflicts, as well as public demonstrations for agrarian reform. 
The SAPs introduced into Brazil were guided by neo-liberal principles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were aimed at promoting trade liberalization, inflation control, fiscal deficit reduction, and privatization. The goal of these policies was to stabilize Brazil's economy and promote long-term economic development. The IMF and the World Bank provided loans to Brazil with the condition that the reforms were implemented.
One of the main policies of the SAPs that had a significant impact on the Brazilian countryside was trade liberalization. Trade liberalization aimed to make it easier for Brazilian companies to compete in international markets by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers. The result was an influx of cheap imports, which affected local industries and agricultural production in Brazil. Importantly, these policies hit rural producers hard, especially small farmers, who were deprived of access to markets and could not compete with the cheap, imported products. 
Another policy was the control of inflation, which aimed at reducing the consumer price index (CPI) and stabilizing the economy. However, the mechanism of achieving this through interest rates was controversial, as it led to an increase in the cost of borrowing, leading to an increase in debt levels for Brazilian farmers. Rural poverty was compounded by inflation control policies that placed high interest rate requirements on loans, limiting the farmer's capacity for borrowing and increasing their financial vulnerability to production shocks. 
Fiscal deficit reduction was another policy objective of the SAPs, aimed at reducing government spending, cutting subsidies, and encouraging privatisation. The reduction in the subsidies led to a significant decline in investment in the rural areas, including the agricultural sector. In Brazil, agricultural infrastructure like roads and irrigation systems were in a sorry state. Capital investment to repair and replace aging infrastructure was limited, and with fewer subsidies, small farmers found difficult to access the essential inputs like fertilizers and seeds. 
The implementation of the SAPs led to a significant impact on poverty and inequality in rural areas, leading to a response from the MST, which established itself as a social movement and to become an influential force in Brazil's politics. The MST's principal objective was to fight for agrarian reform and access to land that was unoccupied or underutilized. The MST had become Brazil's largest social movement and played a critical role around the unsustainable economic system created by the neo-liberal regime.
MST challenged the market fundamentalism of neo-liberalism, pushing for agrarian reform, and more active measures to address acute poverty in rural areas through public policy reforms. MST's actions in Brazil increased in 1997 as the Brazilian government adopted extra austere measures, particularly in the agricultural sector. The MST, instead, engaged in the occupation of large productive agriculture lands which were deemed to belong to oligopolies whose land practices were not sustainable. This strategy was aimed at pressuring the government to purchase land from large landholders and distribute it to landless peasants.
For MST, access to land was more than a social right; it was critical for reconfiguring the neo-liberal economy's structural biases against small-scale farmers, often the most vulnerable group in society. MST saw land access as a means towards equality and poverty alleviation, instead of the optimistic promises of neoliberalism, which often ignored the significant role of agriculture in the rural economy and society.
The MST's call for agrarian reform was not just about property rights but highlighting the structural issues that plagued Brazil's rural areas. For instance, they agitated the government to adopt agrarian reform policies such as; improving rural infrastructure, developing a credit system with affordable interest rates tailored to small farmers, and improving the social and educational opportunities in rural areas. In addition, the MST advocated for sustainable and organic farming systems that would improve rural livelihoods and improve food security.
The MST's activism and demands triggered a response from the World Bank, which invested US$90 million to fund the purchase of land and settlements. While the move was welcomed, some critics have interpreted this move as an attempt to control the MST's demands, or at the least to co-opt them into the neoliberal agenda. The bank showed its bias by supporting large-scale plantations and agri-industrial projects that would benefit the elites at the cost of small-scale farmers. The World Bank's action showed they underestimated the fundamental critique the MST had on the neo-liberal economic model, which required structural changes to the economy rather than merely addressing its symptoms individually. 
In conclusion, the SAPs introduced by the IMF and the World Bank in Brazil in the 1990s led to significant economic, political and social structural changes in the country, especially in rural areas. These policies impacted rural poverty and inequality, leading to the emergence of the MST as a social movement dedicated to promoting land access and agrarian reform. Although the significant impact of the MST was to address the inequitable distribution of land, its demands went beyond land tenure or land acquisition. Instead, it sought to address the structural effects of neoliberalism, particularly in the rural areas, towards more sustainable, equitable, and inclusive policies that would benefit small farmers and most vulnerable communities. The issue shows that social movements can represent an important form of response to the far-reaching changes imposed under neo-liberalism, and they can become potent agents of social, political and economic change.
