Aimil Pharmaceuticals, one of India's top pharmaceutical companies, is taking on a simulation project to gain insight into their plant operations and increase efficiency. The objective of this simulation project is to improve the management of the plant's lorries, which currently face numerous challenges.
The main challenges facing the plant's efficiency are the long wait times for lorries to check-in and off-load their goods. The plant's current process involves a manual system in which lorries must first check-in at the plant's gate. Afterward, they proceed to the loading area where they must wait in line to off-load their goods. The wait times for lorries are typically long, which results in delays in production and delivery of goods.
In response to the challenges, the simulation project aims to create a system that will streamline the check-in process and reduce wait times. The aim is to determine the optimal number of check-in and off-loading points necessary for lorries to finish their work by 5 pm.
To accomplish, the simulation project will use a software tool called Simul8. The software will help the team create a virtual model of the plant's operations to develop a new system. They will use the model to simulate different scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of the new system with a specific emphasis on the number of check-in and off-loading points required.
The major objective of this project is to find the required number of check-in and off-loading points that would allow all lorries to finish their work by 5 pm. This is important because reducing lorry wait times can help increase plant productivity by reducing delays and downtime in production. The model will simulate various scenarios with different check-in and off-loading points to evaluate the best option.
However, the simulation project comes up with certain limitations and assumptions. The model relies on data to create simulations, and if the data is inaccurate, the simulation will be flawed. In the same vein, assumptions made about the lorries' capacity, the time required to offload the goods, and the plant's efficiency will impact the accuracy of the simulations.
The simulation model's limitations can also stem from the reality of the manufacturing plant compared to the non-real-world simulated scenario. No matter the challenge, the simulated scenarios may likely result in a different outcome than expected. In other words, the model may overlook the real-world variability and randomness of the lorries and workers at the plant.
Additionally, the simulation project's accuracy is also subject to the randomness of the lorries' routes outside the manufacturing plant. For instance, if a lorry is delayed within the city's traffic or has to navigate bad roads on the way to the plant, the simulation's accuracy will be compromised.
One of the essential challenges facing the plant's efficiency is the limited space in the plant, which means that a considerable number of lorries cannot be accommodated at once. In this case, the simulation project's results will inform the company of the required number of lorries that can be accommodated at different times of the day. This will give the organization the advantage of planning their production activities to minimize wait times for the lorries and optimize production.
Additionally, the issue of lorries' idle time, which occurs during the check-in and off-loading period, is a significant challenge. The idle time can be attributed to the lack of proper communication between the different workers in the plant, and a shortage of staff. The simulation project's outcome will provide insights into the best number of staff needed to manage the lorries and reduce idle time.
In conclusion, the objective of the simulation project for Aimil Pharmaceuticals in India is to improve the management of lorries at the plant. The major challenge facing the plant is the long wait times for lorries to check-in and off-load their goods. The simulation project's objective is to determine the optimal number of check-in and off-loading points necessary for lorries to finish their work by 5 pm. However, the simulation project comes with certain limitations and assumptions. The model will simulate various scenarios with different check-in and off-loading points to evaluate the best option that can be employed to reduce wait times, minimize downtime, and optimize production. The new system will give the organization the advantage of planning their production activities to minimize wait times for the lorries and optimize production. Ultimately, the simulation project's success will depend on implementing the recommended changes in the real-world plant, which will likely take time and effort.
