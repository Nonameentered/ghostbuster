Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, working-class individuals participated in various "brutal" sports that were both violent and harmful. These sports, such as bull-baiting, cockfighting, and bear-baiting, were popular forms of entertainment amongst the working-class. However, as centuries progressed, society began to recognize the inherent cruelty in these sports, leading to a decline in their popularity. The most significant factors behind the decline include the rise of the animal rights movement, the industrialization of society, and the emergence of other safer sports that gained popularity amongst the masses.
The rise of the animal rights movement played a significant role in the decline of brutal sports in the working-class during the18th and 19th centuries. The cruelty of these sports sparked outrage amongst animal welfare activists, who pushed for strict laws to criminalize these activities. Additionally, the moral and ethical arguments raised by these activists raised the general public's consciousness about the cruelty prevalent in these sports, leading to a decline in their popularity.
Another significant factor contributing to the decline of brutal sports was the industrialization of society. The 18th and 19th centuries saw massive economic changes and shifts in society with the rise of the industrial revolution. The working-class, who previously viewed these brutal sports as the only means of entertainment, now had better access to other activities through the establishment of community centers, libraries, and sports clubs. This increased access to other forms of leisure paved the way for other safer sports such as cricket, rugby, and football to gain popularity.
Moreover, these safer sports flourished because they allowed competition to take place on a large scale, providing opportunities for people to socialize and interact with one another, ultimately leading to the decline of brutal sports that typically took place on a much smaller and closed scale. These new sports promised to be less violent and received endorsements from the clergy which granted them even further legitimacy.
In summary, the decline of brutal sports in the working class can be attributed to the rise of the animal rights movement, the industrialization of society, and the emergence of other safer sports. These developments created an alternative for the working-class, and they subsequently sought healthier, safer, and more socially acceptable leisure activities. While the brutal sports of the past may have served a purpose in the past, society realized that cruelty towards animals and participants was no longer acceptable and paved the way for a new era of sports and entertainment.
