The Soviet Union faced a challenging time during World War II, fighting against the Axis alliance, led by Nazi Germany. The Soviet Union, however, was able to defeat Germany, despite being outnumbered and outgunned. Surviving a war is not a one-man job but rather a collective effort of the entire nation. Nevertheless, it is worth examining how the Soviet Union managed to survive and emerge victorious in World War II, whether it was the power and morale of the people or the efficient wartime economy created by the government that led to their victory, and how the cult of Stalin's personality played a role in the motivation of the Russian people during the war.
The Soviet Union had a massive reserve of manpower, which played a crucial role in their victory. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin knew that the favor was not on their side in terms of weapons and men. He ordered the formation of the "People's Militia" at the start of the war, which made up of civilians. This militia was later transformed into the "People's Army" and was part of the Soviet Army, consisting of millions of personnel. Despite the gruesome battlefront with German soldiers, the Soviet people had a strong will, high morale, and determination to protect their country at all costs. Soviet citizens had to cope with hunger and shortages of basic needs, but they never gave up their determination and effort to win the war.
However, it is not only because of the power and morale of the people that the Soviet Union was able to survive the war. The efficient wartime economy created by the Soviet government also played a vital role in their victory. The Soviet Union initially suffered numerous losses and setbacks due to the poor quality of weapons and machinery. Soviet factories and workshops produced only a small number of tanks in the early year of the war, with the tanks' quality far from the high standard of the Wehrmacht.
The Soviet Union recognized the importance of the industry and economy in warfare, so they implemented several industrialization policies. As Soviet industry shifted from producing consumer goods to more productive industrial products, the economy was seen to emerge from the crisis of the early war years. Soviet scientists and engineers worked hard to develop more effective weapons like Katyusha rocket launchers, which were cheap, easy to make, and highly effective on the battlefield. By the end of the war, the Soviet Union had produced more tanks, artillery, and aircraft than Germany and the United Kingdom combined. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had learned how to diversify and increase production of equipment and weaponry.
Apart from the Soviet Union's effective industrialization, the leadership also played a crucial role in the war. One of the notable leaders during the war was General Georgy Zhukov, who was instrumental in many of the Soviet Union's significant victories in battles like the Battle of Stalingrad. He was known for his ability to mobilize the Soviet Union's resources underpinning the Red Army, increasing discipline, motivation, and weapons production. Alongside the military Commander, the Soviet Union's political leadership had also played a crucial role in the Soviet Union's victory. The ruling Communist Party was committed to protecting the country and assumed controls of several sectors of Soviet life. The party was able to ensure that Soviet resources were directed towards the war effort and expanded the war economy.
Additionally, the cult of Stalin's personality played a role in the motivation of the Russian people during the war. Stalin appeared in propaganda posters and newspapers as the protector of the Soviet Union, portrayed as a leader who was brave and courageous. The reason for the cult of Stalin's personality was multi-faceted, including manipulation to consolidate power, branding him as a hero, and an incentive for the people to fight hard for what they believed in- to protect their motherland. It was a way of keeping morale high and motivating the population to keep fighting. The propaganda machine not only served to boost the fighting morale but also provided a patron saint to incite antagonism against the Germans.
In conclusion, the Soviet Union survived and emerged victorious in World War II because of the collective effort of the entire nation, which recognized the importance of power, morale, and a robust economy. The Soviet people were willing to fight for the survival of their country and their families. The Soviet Union's economy changed into a war-oriented one, which saw an increase in weapons production. The leadership recognized the significance in sustaining high morale and the importance of the Communist Party's guidance. Finally, Stalin's cult of personality played a vital role in motivating the Russian people to stand against their foes. The Soviet Union's victory in World War II would have been impossible without the dedication and sacrifice of the people.
