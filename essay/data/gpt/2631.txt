The Viking Age, spanning from the late 8th century to the late 11th century, was characterized by the Viking’s trading and raiding activities. Viking ships had an essential role in both raiding and trading. The Vikings used ships to move their warriors, traders, and cargoes throughout the Nordic world. Archaeological evidence tells us about the designs of Viking ships and how they were used. This essay will explore the role that Viking ships played in both raiding and trading during the Viking Age and how archaeology has helped us understand their design and function.
Viking raiding was one of the defining features of the Viking Age. The Vikings would use their ships to raid and pillage coastal towns and monasteries across Europe, including the British Isles, France, and Spain. Viking raiders could launch surprise attacks from their ships and then quickly retreat back to sea, making it difficult for their enemies to catch them. Viking ships were fast, maneuverable, and shallow-drafted, allowing them to navigate through shallow waterways and make landings on beaches.
The Viking ships used in raiding were primarily longships or dragonships. Longships were fast, sleek vessels designed for speed and maneuverability. These ships were powered by both oars and sails, allowing them to move quickly in either direction and land almost anywhere they wanted. Dragonships were longer than longships, and they were used primarily as warships. They had large, carved wooden dragonheads on their prow, giving them a menacing appearance. Like longships, they had both oars and sails, giving them the speed and agility needed for Viking military campaigns.
In addition to raiding, Viking ships played a crucial role in trading throughout the Viking Age. The Vikings established trade routes throughout the Nordic world, trading commodities such as furs, textiles, and fish. They also traded with the Islamic Caliphate, Byzantine Empire, and other regions of Europe, bringing valuable goods back to the Viking homelands. Viking ships were essential in facilitating this trade, as they provided a way for the Vikings to transport their goods to different markets.
The Viking ships used for trading were primarily knarrs. Knarrs were broader and deeper ships, designed to carry large payloads. They were powered by both oars and sails, allowing them to move quickly across long distances. Knarrs were primarily used for trading, but they could also be used for raiding if needed.
The Vikings’ mastery of shipbuilding and navigation is evident from the numerous ship remains found by archaeologists. One of the most famous Viking ships discovered is the Oseberg ship. The Oseberg ship is a large, elegant vessel, originally built in the early 9th century. It was found in 1903 in a large burial mound in Norway along with other items of great significance. The ship’s design is a remarkable testimony to the skills of Viking shipbuilders and their cultural and aesthetic values. The ship’s construction is complex, with interlocking planks, stitched joins, and carved and decorated details. The Oseberg ship was not used for raiding; instead, it was likely used for royal transport, funerary purposes, or both.
Another famous Viking ship is the Gokstad ship, which is considered to be a typical Viking ship and has been dated to the 9th century. The Gokstad ship was discovered in a burial mound in Norway along with various items such as clothes, weapons, tools, and food. The ship is a large, sturdy vessel, suitable for rough seas and long journeys. It was used for both raiding and trading and had a large cargo hold that could carry up to twenty tons of goods.
The Viking ships’ designs were adapted to serve specific purposes and reflect the Vikings' maritime culture and needs. The ships were constructed using a unique style of joinery called “clinker” or “lapstrake” construction. This method involved overlapping planks that were bolted together, making a strong, flexible hull that could withstand the rigors of the rough seas. The Viking ships' sails were also unique, as their rigging allowed them to be easily raised or lowered, depending on the wind conditions. Viking ships were also propelled by oars, which allowed them to maneuver in tight spaces and navigate through narrow waterways.
In conclusion, Viking ships played a crucial role in both raiding and trading during the Viking Age. The Vikings were fearsome raiders, and their ships allowed them to launch surprise attacks and quickly retreat when needed. The Vikings' trading activities were also essential in facilitating long-distance trade and bringing valuable goods to the Viking homelands. Archaeological evidence reveals the skilled craftsmanship and adaptability of Viking shipbuilders, whose designs were adapted to serve specific purposes. Through the study of archaeological evidence, we can better understand how Viking ships were used and what role they played in Viking society.
