In Michelle Marra's book, "Japanese Hermeneutics," Sakabe Megumi outlines the Japanese focus on implicit ontology and how it plays a role in the country's traditional movements and customs. The chapter "Mask and Shadow in Japanese Culture: Implicit Ontology in Japanese Thought" argues that the Japanese have attempted to recreate a certain feeling through their traditional practices.
Implicit ontology refers to the complex and often unconscious beliefs and concepts that underlie a culture's attitudes and actions. Sakabe argues that implicit ontology is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, particularly in the way they use masks and shadows in their traditional practices. These practices are closely tied to the idea of Miyabi, which is a sense of refined beauty and elegance.
Sakabe explains that Japanese traditional movements, such as those in Noh theater and tea ceremony, emphasize the use of masks and shadows to convey a sense of Miyabi. Masks are used to conceal and reveal the emotive expression of a character or participant, while shadows obscure and enhance the movement of the physical body. In both cases, the use of masks and shadows creates a heightened sense of complexity and subtlety, which are essential elements of Miyabi.
Furthermore, Sakabe argues that Miyabi is not just an aesthetic concept but also an ontological one. It refers to a way of being in which one is aware of the interconnectedness of all things and seeks to create a harmonious relationship among them. The use of masks and shadows, therefore, is not just a stylistic choice but an attempt to embody this interconnectedness and to create a feeling of wholeness.
Sakabe also highlights how other traditional Japanese practices, such as calligraphy and flower arrangement, incorporate this idea of Miyabi. In calligraphy, the space between the brush strokes is just as important as the strokes themselves, emphasizing the importance of negative space and the harmony between the elements of the composition. In flower arrangement, the placement of each stem and leaf is carefully considered to create a sense of balance and harmony.
In conclusion, Sakabe Megumi's chapter in Michelle Marra's book explores the Japanese focus on implicit ontology and how it is expressed through traditional movements and customs. The use of masks and shadows, along with other practices such as calligraphy and flower arrangement, is an attempt to create a feeling of Miyabi, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. By embodying this interconnectedness, the Japanese seek to recreate a sense of wholeness and harmony in their lives and practices.
