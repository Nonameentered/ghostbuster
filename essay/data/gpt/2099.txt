Language is one of the most incredible and complex capabilities of the human mind. Humans, unlike any other species, are able to communicate with each other through an intricate verbal system. However, this distinction between humans and other animals is not as clear-cut as we may have thought. In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of evidence pointing out that some animals, particularly chimpanzees, are capable of using language in surprising ways. In this essay, we will explore how chimpanzees compare to humans regarding their use of language by analyzing the characteristics of language such as duality, displacement, open-endedness and stimulus freedom.
Duality refers to the ability of language to operate on two levels, the physical and the symbolic. Humans possess this ability, allowing us to represent the world around us through words, which are the symbols of objects, events, and concepts. For instance, the word "tree" represents an object that we can see, touch, and feel. Moreover, through language, we are able to create sentences that convey complex meanings and ideas. Language provides a way of expressing abstract thoughts in a way that can be understood by others. This is one of the most important features of language and distinguishes it from other forms of communication.
In comparison, chimpanzees are also capable of using duality in language, albeit to a lesser extent. Studies have shown that chimpanzees can acquire a considerable vocabulary of symbols and can recognize the relationship between symbols and their referents. For example, in one study, researchers taught a chimpanzee named Washoe how to use American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate with her keepers. Over time, Washoe was able to learn more than 130 signs, along with their meanings. Similarly, other studies have shown that other chimpanzees, such as Kanzi and Ai, can learn to use communication systems, such as lexigrams and symbols, to communicate with their human trainers. While chimpanzees are indeed using symbols, they seem unable to use the language in its entirety. They cannot form complete sentences or understand more complex abstract concepts as humans do.
Displacement is the ability to use language to communicate about things that are not present in the immediate environment or have never existed before. In other words, it is the ability to communicate through time and space. Humans are capable of using language to discuss events that occurred in the past, present, or future, and talk about distant places or hypothetical situations. This is a crucial ability for human communication since it allows us to share knowledge, plan for the future, and imagine new possibilities.
Chimpanzees, on the other hand, have limited capacity for displacement in their communication. While they can use gestures and symbols to refer to objects that are not immediately present, they often rely on external cues such as the location of the object or the time of day to communicate. For example, when a chimpanzee wants to request a banana, it may make an eating gesture, point to the banana, or even use a sign for "banana." However, they may not be able to say things like "I ate a banana yesterday" or "I wish I had a banana." Therefore, chimpanzees' communication with humans is often limited to their current needs and desires.
Open-endedness is another feature of language, which is the ability to generate an unlimited number of meaningful sentences, often using the same words in different ways. This is what allows humans to create new ideas and concepts, tell stories, and express complex emotional experiences. It is also what makes language so versatile and adaptable to different contexts and situations. This is one of the essential characteristics of language that separates it from other forms of communication.
In contrast to humans, chimpanzees do not exhibit open-endedness to the same degree. While they may be able to form meaningful sentences, they often lack the ability to generate new ones on their own. Instead, their communication tends to be limited to fixed expressions and learned phrases. For example, Washoe, the chimpanzee mentioned earlier, could use ASL to make sentences such as "you me hug," meaning "please hug me," or "water bird," meaning "duck." However, she was not able to combine the signs to create novel sentences spontaneously.
Finally, stimulus freedom is another characteristic of human language that distinguishes it from other forms of communication. Stimulus freedom is the ability to use language creatively, without being prompted by environmental stimuli. In other words, it is the ability to use language to express whatever we want, regardless of what is happening around us. This allows us to use language in multi-layered and symbolic ways, such as poetry, humor, and metaphor.
In comparison, chimpanzees tend to exhibit less stimulus freedom in their communication. While they may use gestures and signs creatively under certain circumstances, their communication is limited to their current surroundings and the immediate situation. For example, if a chimp is in its enclosure, it may use a gesture to indicate the need for food or water, but the gesture is primarily used to address the present need deliberately.
In conclusion, while chimpanzees share some characteristics of human language, they still lack the level of complexity and versatility that humans have. Chimpanzees can use symbols, show duality, and communicate effectively in specific contexts. However, their ability to generate sentences that express abstract thoughts and to communicate creatively is limited. Therefore, while chimpanzees' communication abilities are remarkable, they are still far from comparable to the level of human language.
