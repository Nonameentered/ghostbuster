Diversity is one of the most significant issues that the hospitality and tourism industry faces. The industry is highly dependent on diverse staff, customers, and suppliers to provide a better experience. Human resources managers and supervisors in the hospitality and tourism industry are working to manage diversity within organizations in order to enhance their customers' experience, reduce staff turnover, and increase productivity. Similarly, individual rights and freedoms are increasingly being promoted, and companies are expected to uphold these, as well. The aim of this essay is to investigate how managing diversity and upholding individual rights have an impact on the hospitality and tourism industry, with reference to Equal Opportunities and Diversity Management. The essay will also evaluate the claimed benefits of Diversity Management, including arguments for and against its implementation.
Equal opportunities and Diversity management are key practices that are implemented by companies to ensure that their employees have a fair and equal chance to succeed. One of the ways that the hospitality and tourism industry has attempted to address diversity issues is through the implementation of equal opportunities policies. Equal Opportunities policies are designed with the aim of ensuring that all staff, regardless of their race, gender, religion, age, or sexual orientation, have equal opportunities to employment, training, promotion, and development. The policies are implemented through the establishment of a comprehensive and transparent selection process that is free from discrimination.
Similarly, Diversity Management is a technique used to manage diversity within organizations. It is aimed at creating an inclusive workplace that embraces and values differences in employees and customers. Diversity management involves recognizing and respecting the individual differences that exist within the workplace, including diversity in gender, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, and age. It involves embracing these differences and leveraging their potential to create an inclusive and welcoming environment that supports all staff.
One of the benefits of implementing equal opportunities and diversity management practices in the hospitality and tourism industry is the promotion of a positive image of the company. Companies that implement these practices tend to be viewed positively by customers, suppliers, and employees. Diversity management is often seen as a best practice that demonstrates a commitment to fairness and equity. Companies benefit from improved morale, increased productivity, and reduced staff turnover. The industry has a high rate of staff turnover, and implementing practices that promote inclusivity and diversity can help to reduce this.
Another benefit of implementing equal opportunities and diversity management practices is that it can provide companies with a competitive advantage. Diversity in the workplace can improve the quality of service and the customer experience. Diverse staff can better understand the needs of customers from diverse backgrounds, and this can help to improve the overall customer experience. By having a diverse workforce, companies can better understand and serve diverse customer groups, leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business.
Despite the benefits of implementing diversity management practices, there are arguments against their implementation. Critics argue that the focus on diversity can lead to the imposition of quotas and targets that compromise merit-based hiring and promotion. There is also a risk that companies may become too focused on diversity, to the detriment of other important aspects of the business, such as productivity, profitability, and customer service.
Another argument against the implementation of diversity management is that it can create a culture of political correctness. Companies may feel compelled to act in a certain way in order to avoid being seen as discriminatory, even if it contradicts the company's core values. This can lead to resentment and frustration among staff who may feel that their opinions and needs are not being heard.
Finally, an argument against the implementation of diversity management practices is that they can result in increased organizational complexity and bureaucracy. Companies may need to implement additional policies, processes, and programs to manage diversity and ensure compliance with equal opportunities laws. This can result in increased costs and a reduction in overall efficiency.
In conclusion, managing diversity and upholding individual rights has a significant impact on the hospitality and tourism industry. Equal Opportunities and Diversity Management are two key practices that have been implemented in order to address diversity issues and improve the customer experience. The benefits of implementing these practices include improved morale, increased productivity, reduced staff turnover and a competitive advantage. However, there are also arguments against the implementation of diversity management practices, including the potential for quotas and targets, political correctness, and increased organizational complexity. Overall, it is important for organizations in the hospitality and tourism industry to find a balance between promoting diversity and ensuring that they are focused on their core business objectives including productivity, profitability, and customer service.
