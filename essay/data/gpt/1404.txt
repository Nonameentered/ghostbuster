Archaeology as a discipline has evolved over the years with changes in theories, methods and practices. Factors like the political climate, power structures, and societal norms have played a critical role in shaping the development of archaeological theory. In this essay, I will evaluate the influence of political power on the development of archaeological theory with a focus on Gender Archaeology and Marxist archaeology.
Gender archaeology is an area of archaeological research that involves the study of gender in past societies. The aim is to analyze the social, economic, and power dynamics of gender relations in the past. In the 1970s, feminist movements were gaining momentum and influencing the academic world, including archaeology. The feminist movementsâ€™ calls for gender equality, political rights, and social justice reverberated across academic disciplines, spurring feminist critiques of the discipline's theoretical underpinnings.
The traditional archaeological narrative mirrored the patriarchal social norms of the time. For instance, archaeologists tended to equate the objects they found with masculine or feminine attributes based on their preconceived notions of what constituted the two genders. However, feminist critiques pointed out that the archaeological record was not neutral, but, rather, a multicultural and gendered terrain that reflected past society's cultural practices and norms. Moreover, feminist critiques noted that archaeologists' interpretations of the archaeological record tended to place male artifacts at the center of analysis while female objects were marginalized, undervalued and underrepresented.
Political influence drove the development of Gender Archaeology by influencing stages of the feminist movement in Europe and the US. The struggle for women's rights in the US and Europe gained momentum in the 1970s and resulted in the recognition of women's rights within society that had a trickle-down effect into academic curriculums. The feminist agendas and political demands were included in university course syllabuses, and archaeological theory changed to reflect the concerned feminist dispositions. In 1978, feminist scholars launched the Women In Archaeology Conference in the United Kingdom to advocate for more women's representation by the Association of Archaeological Illustrators and Surveyors. This conference marked the beginning of Gender Archaeology, which revealed that women had long been marginalized and overshadowed in archaeological narratives.
In the same way, Marxist Archaeology implementation served to impart real and substantial socio-political changes in the country. It can be defined as the study of archaeology using the Marxist approach to cultural studies that hold that the infrastructure determines the superstructure and cultural aspects of society. Marxist archaeologists analyze residues to expose the material interpretations behind hierarchies in societies, and the relationship between economic systems and social structures. Marxist archaeology emerged in response to the need for a more robust critique of archaeological theory and its overreliance on the dominant narratives that served to subjugate underrepresented populations.
Marxist Archaeologists see archaeology as an essential tool in revolutionary materialism as archaeology can confirm Marxist beliefs. Marxist Archaeologists seek to frame the past as one that exhibits the economic and social structures' power dynamics. An example of this is Eric Wolf's work on the origins of inequality in the Bronze Age, where Wolf emphasized that the economic structure of a society had far-reaching effects, and inequalities that arose from economic structure and social structures would translate onto the archaeological record. Wolf's Marxist Archaeology framework asserted that exploitation, power relations, and social inequality could be identified from material culture.
Marxist Archaeology experienced its beginnings in Cuba following the 1959 Revolution. This marks the first formal creation of the 'National Museum of Revolution' in Havana. The establishment of the museum marked the integration of Marxism-Leninism into the interpretation of the past, with museums extensively featuring exhibits on the country's liberation and the struggle against imperialism. Archaeology in Cuba prior to revolutionary movements had been Euro-American archaeology. After the revolution, archaeological research shifted to examine the past in a Marxist interpretative lens as opposed to the one formerly used, which was this Euro-American context.
Political influence plays a critical role in shaping how archaeological theory develops. Gender Archaeology and Marxist archaeology are two examples of how political power affects the development of archaeological theory. In the case of Gender Archaeology, feminist movements influenced the academic world's curriculum, raising awareness for the need to represent women and the LGBTQIA+ community in the archaeological record. Marxist archaeology, on the other hand, emerged from socialist political agendas in the country of Cuba. While these two approaches may exist in different temporal and spatial contexts, they share a common thread of being products of political power's influence.
In conclusion, political power's influence on archaeological theory documented in this article is evident. Gender Archaeology and Marxist archaeology have contributed significantly to archaeological theories by rethinking traditional modes of looking at the archaeological record. The impact of these two influences changes how archaeologists conduct research and interpret data, enriching the field and promoting more just and ethical approaches to cultural heritage.
