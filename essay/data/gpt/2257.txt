Evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that explores the application of biological evolution concepts and processes to the development of computational algorithms that can solve practical problems. According to John Holland, it entails developing algorithms that can evolve and adapt in response to changing environments through natural selection and genetic recombination. Evolutionary computation may be subdivided into several techniques, including genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, evolutionary programming, and genetic programming. In this essay, we focus on genetic algorithms, which is one of the earliest and most popular evolutionary computation techniques.
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are search heuristics that use mechanisms akin to those of natural selection, reproduction, and mutation to solve optimization problems. GAs are based on the principle of survival of the fittest, which posits that individuals with the best fit to the environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass their genetic traits to the next generation. The algorithms start with a randomly generated population of potential solutions, assess their fitness based on some criterion function, and use mechanisms inspired by genetic operators to create new populations that are hopefully of better fitness. The algorithm iterates this process of selection, reproduction, and mutation until it converges to a satisfactory solution.
GAs have proved to be useful in solving a range of practical problems in diverse fields such as engineering, finance, biology, logistics, and telecommunications. For instance, T. Back and colleagues applied GAs to find the optimal shapes and sizes of microwave filters to minimize their weight and size while meeting the performance requirements. H. Shigeomi and T. Mitsui used GAs to search for the best prediction model of stock prices based on historical data and technical indicators. M. Oltean and colleagues employed GAs to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image segmentation. In each case, the GA algorithm outperformed traditional algorithms in terms of speed and solution quality.
The use of evolutionary computation has significant impacts on the development and application of intelligent machines such as robots. By leveraging evolutionary concepts and processes, it helps designers and engineers to create and optimize robots that can adapt to changing conditions, evolve in response to task demands, and self-repair when damaged. One example is the evolutionary design of robot morphologies, which refers to the use of GAs to generate novel and efficient body plans and locomotion strategies for robots. Such designs have yielded robots that can navigate various terrains, interact with objects, and overcome physical obstacles better than their conventionally designed counterparts. Another example is the use of GAs to evolve neural networks, which are computational models inspired by biological neurons and synapses. By optimizing neural architecture and weights using GAs, researchers can develop robots that can learn and perform tasks more flexibly and robustly than rule-based or pre-programmed machines.
One of the main benefits of using evolutionary computation in developing robots is its ability to generate novel, diverse, and robust designs that can cope with uncertain and complex environments. Because the solutions are created through an iterative process of selection, reproduction, and mutation, they are less likely to be trapped in suboptimal states or get stuck in local maxima. Moreover, evolutionary designs are adaptive and exploratory, meaning that they can adjust to new situations and explore new possibilities. This feature is particularly valuable for developing robots that must operate in dynamic and unstructured environments, such as disaster response, search and rescue, and space exploration.
However, there are also challenges associated with the use of evolutionary computation in developing robots. One issue is the complexity and time-consuming nature of the optimization process. Because GAs require simulating many generations of populations and evaluating their fitness, the search space can become computationally intractable for large and complex robots. This challenge may become more significant when using multi-objective GAs that must optimize multiple criteria simultaneously. Another issue is the difficulty of interpreting and explaining the solutions generated through GAs. Because the solutions are often non-intuitive and derived through a black-box process, it may be hard to understand how the robot works and how to improve it.
To sum up, evolutionary computation is a powerful tool in the development of artificial intelligence, particularly in the optimization of robotic systems. Genetic algorithms, in particular, have proved useful in solving practical problems in various domains and creating robots with adaptive and robust designs. The use of evolutionary computation offers significant benefits in terms of diversity, exploration, and robustness but also poses challenges in terms of complexity and interpretability. Further research is needed to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of evolutionary computation in developing intelligent machines.
