The laboratory sessions were conducted with the objective of analyzing and optimizing a car's aerodynamics in a wind tunnel. The primary goal was to gain knowledge and expertise in the field of fluid dynamics and mechanical engineering, which can be applied to the design and development of various automotive systems. The laboratory sessions were conducted using Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks software, which offered a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing fluid flow and behavior around the car geometry.
Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks assisted in the analysis and optimization of the car's aerodynamics in several ways. Firstly, Solidworks provided a platform for constructing detailed 3D models of the car's geometry. This model offered a precise representation of the car's shape, which was critical for simulating the flow of air around it. The model was then subjected to various simulations using Cosmos Floworks software. This software package offered a range of analysis tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which enabled the students to assess the velocity, temperature, and pressure of the air around the car.
The findings from the analysis were significant in optimizing the car's aerodynamics. The simulations showed how the car's shape could be modified to reduce drag and turbulence, which would improve the vehicle's handling and fuel efficiency. The students were able to identify key areas where small changes in the car's shape could dramatically affect its aerodynamics. For instance, rounding the edges or adding a spoiler reduced drag, while altering the shape of the air intake improved the vehicle's cooling system. The simulations also helped the students to identify areas where air was stagnating or where turbulence was being created, following which they could suggest solutions to these problems.
Apart from velocity and temperature, other properties such as the pressure could be measured and interpreted using the software. The software provided tools for visualizing the pressure distribution around the car, thereby enabling the students to identify areas where the pressure was highest or lowest. This information was critical in understanding how the car's aerodynamics was affecting its performance. For instance, high-pressure areas could cause instability, while low-pressure areas could improve traction and control. Other properties such as the lift and drag forces could also be calculated, leading to a broader understanding of the car's overall performance.
In conclusion, the laboratory sessions using Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks software were crucial in analyzing and optimizing the aerodynamics of a car. The software provided a range of tools for simulating and analyzing fluid flow around the car's geometry, leading to the identification of the key areas where small modifications could result in significant improvements. The main findings from the analysis were in improving the car's handling, reducing drag, and enhancing its fuel efficiency. The properties such as velocity, temperature, and pressure could all be measured and analyzed using this software, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the car's behavior in a wind tunnel.
