Introduction
The provision of public services, such as schools, roads, and street lighting, requires a significant amount of investment. Local governments in the UK have the responsibility to provide such services, and they need to raise revenue to fund them. Over the years, different methods of raising revenue have been utilized by local governments in the UK. This essay aims to discuss these methods, the role of central government in controlling local government finance, and the impact of these methods on local democracy.
Methods of Raising Revenue for Local Government in the UK
The methods of raising revenue for local government in the UK can be broadly classified into two categories: taxes and non-tax revenues.
Taxes
The most significant source of revenue for local governments in the UK is through taxes. There are two types of taxes levied by local governments: property taxes and local taxes.
Property Taxes
Property taxes are also known as Council Tax. It is a tax levied on residential properties in the UK. Council tax is set by local authorities and varies from one region to another. It is calculated based on the value of the property and the number of adults living in it. Council taxes are progressive in nature, meaning that households with higher incomes pay higher taxes.
Local Taxes
The Local Authorities (Best Value) Act 1999 allows local governments to levy taxes on local businesses. These taxes are referred to as Non-Domestic Rates or Business Rates. The amount paid for Business Rates depends on the value of the property, and businesses liable for taxes can also get rate relief or discounts. Local Tax is levied on commercial properties only, and it is not based on the income earned from the property.
Non-Tax Revenues
Non-tax revenues are sources of income generated from other activities other than taxation. These revenues include fees and charges levied by local governments on the services provided to the public.
Fees and Charges
Local authorities can levy charges on certain services they provide, such as waste management, parking services, and licensing fees. The amount charged for the services is based on the cost of providing the service. The fees and charges levied by local authorities must be approved by central government to ensure that they do not deter people from using the services.
Central Government Control over Local Government Finance
Central government plays a vital role in controlling local government finance. The government sets the criteria for how the revenue raised by the local authorities is shared between them. Central government controls how much local authorities can spend on public services, the amount of debt they can take, and the extent of autonomy they have.
The Role of Central Government in Controlling Local Government Spending
Central government controls how much local authorities can spend on public services by providing them with spending limits. This is done through a system of grants, which are given to local authorities according to how much they need to spend. Grants are provided for specific services, such as housing and education.
The Role of Central Government in Controlling Local Government Debt
Local authorities are required by law to balance their budgets. They are not allowed to spend more than the revenue they have raised in a given year. However, in times of economic hardship, local authorities may borrow money to finance capital projects, such as building roads and schools. Central government controls the amount of debt local authorities can take. This is to ensure that they do not get into too much debt, which may make them insolvent.
The Role of Central Government in Controlling Local Authority Autonomy
Central government controls the extent of autonomy local authorities have in raising and spending revenues. Local authorities are required to consult with central government on how they intend to spend the revenue they raise. Central government has the power to veto any request by local authorities to increase taxes or borrow money.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Raising Revenue Methods

Impact of Revenue-Raising Methods on Local Democracy
Local democracy is the ability of people to have a say in how their local authorities are run. The methods used to raise revenue can have a substantial impact on local democracy.
