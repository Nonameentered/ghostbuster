In recent years, there has been an influx of international students pursuing graduate degrees in the UK, particularly from China. These students often face unique challenges when acclimating to the academic and cultural norms of the UK. This essay provides a case study of one Chinese student and explores potential difficulties stemming from differences in cultural and academic norms and expectations, or from gaps in linguistic competence. The study focuses on the student's research and writing skills and draws tentative conclusions on the effectiveness of her current study programme, as well as recommendations for her interim period between the end of this semester and her Masters programme. Additionally, the essay proposes that more flexibility should be built into EAP courses and suggests a longitudinal study to assess the success of an EAP course in preparing students for postgraduate studies.
The student under examination is a Chinese national named Jing, who is studying for a Masters in International Business in the UK. Jing arrived with a Bachelor's degree from a Chinese university, which stands as a foundation for her postgraduate studies in the UK. Although she has great academic accomplishments in her home country, Jing faces a unique set of challenges in the UK's academic environment and predominantly with the English language. Such challenges are generally experienced by the majority of international students studying in the UK, particularly those from non-English speaking countries. The language barrier is a common issue among international students, and it affects various areas of academic life in the UK.
One of Jing's primary challenges is her linguistic competence. Jing's English language level may not always match her Chinese writing proficiency, which causes difficulty when making academic papers in English. She has an EAP course scheduled, with which she hopes to improve her English before starting her Master's programme. However, her English proficiency is insufficient to match graduate-level writing. As a result, this can also impact her confidence in participation in classroom discussions, group projects, and other social interactions with her British peers. Lack of confidence can lead to isolating oneself, both socially and academically, which can negatively impact Jing's study experience in the UK.
Furthermore, differences in academic norms can also pose a challenge for Jing. In China, it is customary to reproduce the words and findings of experts in the research area without questioning or challenging them. In contrast, English universities emphasize critical thinking and independent research. Therefore, Jing needs to balance her initial way of writing expert opinions and her academic voice in a critical and analytical style. Additionally, while her previous education provided her with a solid academic foundation, it might not prepare her with the necessary advanced research and writing skills required for graduate-level study in the UK.
Given that Jing has been learning English for many years, an appropriate language intervention programme for Jing could be selected so that Jing can benefit from taking part in an EAP course that focuses on more independent and less generalised writing skills. Example courses would offer more tailored sessions on writing literature reviews for her dissertation, analysing secondary data and primary data, and developing an academic voice or writing style appropriate for graduate study. The main focus of this course should not be on the broad vocabulary or grammar aspect of English but rather the transferrable research and writing skills required to produce a good graduate-level academic paper. The implementation of interactive language platforms, such as one-on-one online tutoring, peer writing feedback, and language buddies, with native English speakers, would be of immense benefit to Jing during her EAP study.
Flexibility should be built into EAP courses, especially for international students who have specific academic needs and potential areas that require attention. Therefore, Jing should have a range of learning resources or support services that cater to individual student requirements. This could include options for different course structures, varying difficulty levels, and diverse instructions. The curriculum of the course chosen could be adapted to the specific areas of study the student is undertaking. For example, if Jing's research topic relates to international economics and trade between China and the UK, it would help her to focus on the English language terms and examples of this field in preparing her thesis.
Ultimately, the effectiveness of EAP courses should be assessed and monitored, which is currently lagging or, in some cases, non-existent. Ideally, the longitudinal study should begin during the initial stages of Jing's EAP course and followed through to the end of her masters programme. The study should gather data from various sources, such as feedback from tutors, questionnaires, as well as exam results, to measure the impact of the EAP courses in attitudes, performance, and academic progress. The study would also enable educators to improve EAP course design by identifying specific areas of improvement in the courses and factors that contribute to a more successful EAP outcome.
In conclusion, Jing's case study highlights several challenges international students face when obtaining a graduate degree in the UK, primarily in linguistic and academic norms. Many international students come to the UK with a strong prior academic record, but they may face challenges in adjusting to the new academic culture and the English language. It is imperative that EAP courses and supportive tutoring should be designed around the individual student's academic needs and potential gaps in linguistic proficiency. A more flexible approach to the delivery of such courses could benefit a student like Jing. Ultimately a longitudinal study to track EAP students' progression through to postgraduate studies to assess the impact on their academic progress and success is recommended.
