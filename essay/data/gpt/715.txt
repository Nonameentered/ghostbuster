Access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right, as recognized by international law. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care." However, in many countries, this right is not fully realized, and people suffer from inadequate housing conditions such as homelessness, overcrowding, and poor sanitation. As such, there is potential for using the international right to housing in domestic courts as a strategy to improve local housing conditions.
The international human right to housing encompasses various elements that ensure adequate living conditions and protection from homelessness. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights defines the right to adequate housing as the right to "live somewhere in security, peace, and dignity." This means that housing must be accessible, affordable, habitable, and culturally adequate. Accessible housing should be located near basic services such as health care, education, food, and work. Affordable housing should allow people to allocate other resources towards food, education, and other basic needs. Habitable housing should have adequate space, ventilation, lighting, and basic infrastructure such as water and sanitation. Culturally adequate housing should respect individual and group identities and be compatible with the community's cultural, social, and economic practices.
Despite the international recognition of the right to adequate housing, it remains a challenge to make it justiciable. Justiciability refers to the ability to bring a legal claim and receive remedy or compensation for the violation of a right. Some states may argue that the right to housing is not a justiciable right, meaning it cannot be adjudicated and enforced in domestic courts. They may argue that the right to housing is a progressive right that depends on the availability of resources and competes with other social and economic rights. As such, they may argue that it is the state's obligation to provide housing and that individuals cannot claim it as an enforceable right. However, international human rights law recognizes the right to housing as imperative to the realization of other rights such as health, education, and work. Furthermore, international and regional human rights treaties recognize the right to housing as a justiciable right. Therefore, states have a duty to ensure that individuals can claim their right to housing and receive effective remedies for violations.
Using the international right to housing as a legal strategy can have benefits and challenges. On the one hand, it can provide individuals and communities with a legal avenue to claim their right to housing and seek remedies for violations. This can lead to improved housing conditions and greater accountability from the state and other actors responsible for violations. Legal claims can also generate public attention and awareness of the housing crisis, mobilize support, and foster collective action. Furthermore, using the international right to housing can strengthen the capacity and independence of domestic courts and enhance the legal framework for human rights protection.
On the other hand, using the international right to housing can be challenging, especially in countries where the legal system is weak, corrupt, or politicized. Legal claims can be time-consuming, expensive, and complex, requiring legal expertise and resources that may not be readily available to marginalized communities. Moreover, legal claims may not produce immediate results, and the enforcement of court orders may be challenging. Additionally, using the international right to housing can generate political resistance, as it challenges entrenched power structures and interests that benefit from the housing crisis. Therefore, using the international right to housing requires a strategic and long-term approach that involves a collaboration between legal actors, social movements, and communities affected by the housing crisis.
In conclusion, the potential for using the international right to housing in domestic courts as a strategy to improve local housing conditions is significant. The international human right to housing provides a normative framework that can guide legal claims and demand accountability from the state and other actors responsible for violations. However, using this legal approach requires addressing the justiciability of the right, which may face resistance from states and political and economic elites. Using the international right to housing as a legal strategy demands a comprehensive and collective effort involving legal experts, social movements, and communities affected by the housing crisis. Ultimately, using the international right to housing can contribute to the realization of human rights and social justice for all.
