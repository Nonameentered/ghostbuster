Firstly, Company U recognized the importance of understanding their target audience. They conducted extensive market research to identify the needs, demands, and preferences of potential customers. They adopted a customer-centric approach, recognizing that the key to success lies in satisfying the customer's needs. Based on the research findings, Company U tailored their marketing strategy to attract customers by emphasizing the unique features and benefits of their Vodites.
Secondly, Company U recognized the significance of pricing and affordability. Due to the highly competitive nature of the market, Company U decided to set a relatively low price for their Vodites to attract price-sensitive customers. They also offered financing schemes and installment plans to make the product more affordable for consumers.
