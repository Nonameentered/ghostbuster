Hospitality is an important aspect of any commercial travel or leisure industry. The primary motives and attitudes of employees working in the hospitality sector are essential in ensuring excellent customer services. These employees work tirelessly to deliver top-notch services and ensure that guests have an amazing experience at the establishment. This essay will discuss the motives and attitudes that influence the provision of genuine hospitality in the commercial hospitality sector.
A primary motive for employees in providing genuine hospitality is the need to impress guests. This desire to impress is fundamental in maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. Employees understand that they are the primary ambassadors of the hospitality establishment, and they recognize that their actions can significantly influence the guests' attitudes towards the establishment. Therefore, they are motivated to deliver exceptional services so that guests can have a remarkable experience, thus promoting positive feedback and recommendations.
Attitude is also a significant factor in providing genuine hospitality in the commercial hospitality sector. Employees should maintain a positive attitude towards guests because they interact with them. This creates a friendly and welcoming atmosphere that makes guests feel comfortable and at home. A good attitude also helps to alleviate any concerns or issues they may have, creating a positive work environment for both the staff and guests alike. A friendly attitude also helps to make guests feel that they are crucial to the establishment, and their satisfaction is of utmost importance.
Employees are also motivated by the desire to create a lasting impression on guests. In the hospitality industry, first impressions matter, and staff recognizes this. They work to ensure that the initial greeting, room check-in, and orientation is done correctly to create a lasting impression on guests. Once a favorable impression is created, guests are more likely to return, recommend the establishment to others, and leave positive feedback about their experience. Staff members also recognize that they may work with returning guests, and creating a positive impression helps to establish a good working relationship. Therefore, employees are motivated to provide genuine hospitality to ensure guests have a positive lasting impression on their establishment.
The need to establish a good reputation is also another driving motive for employees in providing genuine hospitality. The reputation of a commercial hospitality establishment is everything. Therefore, employees work hard to protect and maintain the establishment's reputation, as this will attract more guests and secure the establishment's future. Providing excellent service creates a positive reputation that can attract more business and open up new opportunities for the establishment. Therefore, employees are motivated to provide genuine hospitality, which in turn helps to safeguard the reputation of the establishment.
The financial incentives that come with providing genuine hospitality are also another motive for employees. Hospitality staff typically work in roles that offer the opportunity to earn tips or other remuneration. They understand that exceptional service can lead to bigger tips and potentially promotions in the future. Staff members are thus keen to provide genuine hospitality to achieve their financial targets, retain their jobs, and earn more money.
The attitude of staff members is vital in providing genuine hospitality. Employees must maintain a positive attitude and strive to provide the best service possible. Staff with a positive attitude are more willing to go the extra mile to ensure that guests' needs are met and that they have memorable experiences. This, in turn, helps to increase guest satisfaction, leading to more positive reviews and recommendations. A positive attitude is also crucial in handling guest complaints. Employees with positive attitudes can handle complaints professionally and resolve them amicably, setting the stage for a positive feedback loop for both the guest and the establishment.
In conclusion, motives and attitudes are significant factors in the provision of genuine hospitality in the commercial hospitality sector. Employees are motivated by the need to impress guests, a desire to create a lasting impression, the need to establish a good reputation, financial incentives, among other things. The attitudes of employees are crucial in creating a welcoming and friendly environment, impressing guests, and resolving any issues or complaints that arise. Therefore, for genuine hospitality to be provided, employees must maintain positive attitudes and work towards achieving the established goals.
