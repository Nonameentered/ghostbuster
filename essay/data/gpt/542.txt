The relationship between consciousness and the physical world has been a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. One of the key questions is whether it is possible to have a physically identical world without consciousness. This essay will explore this question in the context of the assumption that ‘pain = C-fibre stimulation’ is true and both ‘pain’ and ‘C-fibre stimulation’ are rigid designators.
Firstly, it is important to define what is meant by a physically identical world. A physically identical world would mean that every aspect of the physical world is the same, including all the atoms, molecules, and physical laws. This would include the brains and nervous systems of all living beings. It is important to note that this would not mean that every event in the world would be the same, as events can be different even if the physical world is the same. This is because events involve something other than the physical properties of objects, such as the order in which they occur.
The assumption that ‘pain = C-fibre stimulation’ is true refers to the idea that pain is caused by the stimulation of certain nerve fibres in the body known as C-fibres. This is a widely accepted scientific theory of pain. The idea that both ‘pain’ and ‘C-fibre stimulation’ are rigid designators means that they refer to the same thing in all possible worlds. This is because they are not merely descriptions of the physical world, but are names that refer to specific phenomena.
With these definitions in mind, we can now consider whether it is possible for there to be a physically identical world without consciousness. If ‘pain = C-fibre stimulation’ is true and both ‘pain’ and ‘C-fibre stimulation’ are rigid designators, it might seem that the answer is yes. This is because pain could still exist in such a world without the need for consciousness. If pain is simply a result of C-fibre stimulation, then it would still occur even if there were no conscious beings to experience it.
However, this argument overlooks the fact that consciousness is not limited to just pain. Consciousness is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the world and is involved in all aspects of our perception, including our thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences. It is difficult to imagine a physically identical world without consciousness because consciousness is so pervasive in our experience.
Furthermore, the assumption that ‘pain = C-fibre stimulation’ is true is itself dependent on consciousness. The idea that pain is caused by the stimulation of C-fibres is based on scientific experiments that involve subjects reporting their experience of pain. Without consciousness, there would be no way to measure or study pain, which makes it difficult to imagine a physically identical world without consciousness.
Another argument against the possibility of a physically identical world without consciousness is based on the concept of qualia. Qualia refer to the subjective experiences that are associated with different things, such as the redness of a rose or the taste of chocolate. These experiences cannot be reduced to physical properties alone and are dependent on consciousness. It is difficult to imagine a physically identical world without qualia because they are so fundamental to our experience.
In conclusion, the question of whether it is possible for there to be a physically identical world without consciousness is complex and multifaceted. While it might seem possible based on the assumption that ‘pain = C-fibre stimulation’ is true and both ‘pain’ and ‘C-fibre stimulation’ are rigid designators, the reality is that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the world. The idea of a physically identical world without consciousness raises many philosophical questions about the relationship between the physical world and consciousness, and is likely to continue to be a topic of debate for many years to come.
