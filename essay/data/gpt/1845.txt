Managing the third stage of labor is a crucial step in childbirth. It is during this stage that the woman delivers the placenta, which is the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby throughout pregnancy. There are two primary methods of managing the third stage of labor: active management and physiological management. This essay will describe and compare these two methods, examine the research evidence to determine which method is the safest, and identify some of the questions regarding the third stage that require further research.
Active management of the third stage of labor involves the use of medical interventions to facilitate the delivery of the placenta. The steps involved in active management typically include administration of a uterotonic drug (such as oxytocin), controlled cord traction, and fundal massage (American College of Nurse-Midwives, 2021). These techniques are used in an effort to speed up the expulsion of the placenta, which is thought to reduce the risk of complications such as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and retained placenta.
In contrast, physiological management of the third stage of labor involves a more hands-off approach. The woman is allowed to deliver the placenta spontaneously, without the use of any medical interventions. The midwife or obstetrician may assist with gentle traction or massage of the uterus, but this is done only if necessary and with the aim of reducing the risk of complications rather than expediting the process (World Health Organization, 2018).
There is ongoing debate among healthcare professionals regarding which method of managing the third stage of labor is the safest for the mother and baby. Some studies suggest that active management reduces the risk of PPH and other complications, while others show no difference between active and physiological management (Begley et al., 2015). In one randomized controlled trial, for example, researchers found that active management reduced the risk of PPH by 50% compared to physiological management (Mousa & Alfirevic, 2004). Similarly, a Cochrane review that included 57 trials and over 37,000 women found that active management was associated with a lower risk of PPH, shorter duration of the third stage of labor, and fewer instances of manual removal of the placenta (Begley et al., 2015). However, other studies have demonstrated that active management can also increase the risk of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and high blood pressure (WHO, 2018).
Given the mixed results of these studies, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation regarding which method of managing the third stage of labor is the safest. The World Health Organization (2018) suggests that active management may be preferred in some settings, such as those with limited resources or high rates of PPH, but that physiological management should be considered in low-risk pregnancies and settings where medical resources are sufficient.
In addition to the active and physiological methods of managing the third stage of labor, there are several other approaches that are sometimes used. Delayed cord clamping, for example, involves waiting several minutes after delivery before clamping the umbilical cord, which can increase the baby's blood volume and prevent iron deficiency (National Institutes of Health, 2016). In some cases, uterine balloon tamponade may be used to control bleeding in cases of PPH when pharmacologic interventions are insufficient (Tindell et al., 2012).
Despite the existing research on the safety and effectiveness of different methods of managing the third stage of labor, there are still many questions that remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear which specific uterotonic drug is most effective for preventing PPH, and whether a combination of drugs might be more effective than a single drug (WHO, 2018). The optimal timing for cord clamping is also unclear, and may vary depending on the baby's gestational age and risk factors (National Institutes of Health, 2016).
In conclusion, the management of the third stage of labor is an important decision that involves weighing the potential benefits and risks of different approaches. The two primary methods of management are active and physiological, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. While there is some evidence to suggest that active management may be more effective in reducing the risk of PPH, it also carries a higher risk of side effects. The decision of which method to use should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the woman's medical history, preferences, and the resources available in the birth setting. Further research is needed to address the many unanswered questions regarding the third stage of labor, in order to optimize outcomes and minimize risks for mothers and babies.
