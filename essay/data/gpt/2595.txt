Meta-ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of moral language, thinking, and reasoning. The conversation surrounding meta-ethics is essential because it provides us with a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the nature of moral claims. Within this discussion, there are various positions or theories that one can take, including error theory and non-naturalist moral realism. In this essay, we will explore the concept of error theory, its differences with non-naturalist moral realism, and J.L. Mackie’s argument for error theory. We will also delve into the concept of moderate error theory and its attempts to address the problem of all moral judgments being false, as well as analyze the criticisms of moderate error theory put forth by Crispin Wright and Alexander Miller, including the concept of superassertibility and the use of subsidiary norms.
Error theory, also known as nihilism, is the view that all moral claims are false, and there are no moral facts or properties in the world. According to error theory, when we make moral statements, we are not describing any objective truth but rather expressing our subjective attitudes or preferences. Thus, we should not use moral language as if there were objective moral facts because there are none. Essentially, the error theorist argues that every moral judgment fails because there are no moral properties in the world to which the judgment could correspond. Consequently, moral language is confronted with a fundamental intellectual crisis.
Non-naturalist moral realism, on the other hand, asserts the presence of objective moral facts or properties that exist independently of human attitudes or preferences. Non-naturalist moral realists believe that moral statements describe moral properties that are naturalistically inexplicable and irreducible to non-moral properties. These moral properties are not empirical features of the world that we can investigate scientifically. Rather, they are properties that we can apprehend as self-evident or intuitively obvious. For non-naturalist moral realists, moral properties exist regardless of human attitudes or preferences. Thus, they support the use of moral language as describing objective moral facts.
J.L. Mackie was one of the most prominent proponents of error theory in the 20th century. Mackie argued that moral judgments are systematically mistaken because they assume that there are objective moral facts or properties. Mackie supported his argument in two ways: first, through the argument from relativity, and secondly, through the argument from queerness.
The argument from relativity asserts that if morality is objective, then there should be some degree of agreement and consistency among people as to the correct moral stance. But, as Mackie pointed out, there is much diversity in moral beliefs and practices worldwide. Disagreements even arise within small communities, and these disagreements can persist over generations. Moreover, moral beliefs often change over time as societies and individuals change their ideologies. The fact that there is such tremendous relativity and variability in moral beliefs implies that they cannot be grounded in any objective truth. Relativism implies that different moral stances have equal footing, including contrasting views of moral conflict and resolution.
The argument from queerness highlights the fact that moral properties are ontologically and epistemologically bizarre. According to Mackie, our grasp of moral facts or properties cannot be explained within the framework of natural or empirical investigation. Mackie famously wrote that moral properties are “queer” since they are incapable of being measured, observed, or tested like other naturalistic properties. And it seems genuinely incomprehensible to think of moral facts as intrinsic to the natural world. Mackie suggested that it is hard to imagine moral properties interacting with natural properties and forcing them to act a certain way.
Mackie’s argument from queerness focuses on how impossible it is, conceptually, to reconcile our belief in an objective, moral reality with our understanding of the universe as one that operates within a naturalistic framework. Given that moral properties are “queer,” Mackie argued that it is implausible that they exist in the way that moral realists suggest. Therefore, Mackie concludes that moral facts and properties do not exist, and moral language can only be interpreted as expressing attitudes or preferences.
Moderate Error theory, a modification of Mackie’s theory, proposes a less extreme stance. Rather than arguing that all moral claims are completely false, Moderate Error Theorists claim that our moral discourse is not strictly true or false. It is merely defective because it lacks the ability to express objective truths in the same way that scientific language does. So, while they agree with Mackie’s central premise that moral claims do not map neatly onto objective, natural facts, moderate error theorists do not wholly deny that moral claims can be true or false, but rather see moral language as just being inadequately conveying objective moral truths.
Critics of Moderate Error Theory express the issue of superassertibility. The idea behind superassertibility is that for any putative belief, some higher ordinate belief would exist, which one would give their commitment to expressing this belief. For instance, consider the belief that it is morally wrong to harm another person. One might initially commit to this belief, but one is also committed to the proposition that it is morally wrong for anyone to cause unjustifiable harm. Superassertibility raises the issue of whether there might be moral truth within a hierarchical belief structure that allows for determining moral falsehood. Crispin Wright rejects Moderate Error Theory since it seems like an unworkable system of relativistic-beliefs that is incapable of generating statements capable of being strictly true.
Moreover, Alexander Miller raised the objection that error theorists base their discussions on the absence of moral properties in the world. Miller suggested that moral judgements should be evaluated against the criterion of superassertibility; if the self-undermining of any belief requires justification, then the correctness of the belief that there is no moral reality needs to be justified too. Since Mackie’s arguments have no clear reason or basis to deny the premises required for the supervenience of morality, retaining the moral foundations of non-naturalism seems more rational.
In conclusion, this essay has described the essential differences between error theory and non-naturalist moral realism, analyzed J.L. Mackie’s arguments for error theory, and looked at the concept of moderate error theory. We have also explored the criticisms of moderate error theory put forth by Crispin Wright and Alexander Miller. Error theory poses an intellectually disturbing challenge to traditional moral realism. While it remains one of the critical contemporary theories of moral judgement and discourse, it is still the source of criticism and debate that continues to advance the important dialogue of ethics. Whether we subscribe to error theory, non-naturalist moral realism, or some other position, we must appreciate the profundity of the metaethical issues that these positions raise and continue to contribute to this ongoing dialogue to gain a better understanding of the world in which we live.
