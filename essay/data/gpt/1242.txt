In the field of chemistry, the study of metal acetylacetonate complexes has been an area of great research interest. These complexes are known for their diverse chemical properties, which have made them popular choices for a wide range of applications in chemical industries such as catalysts, sensors, and optoelectronics. This essay seeks to explore the properties of two metal acetylacetonate complexes in this practical while delving into the methods used to obtain the results. Furthermore, the insights gained from UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy concerning the structure of the complexes shall be analyzed as well.
The practical investigates two metal acetylacetonate complexes; vanadyl bis (acac) and manganese trisacetylacetonate. These complexes have unique chemical properties that make them appealing for studies, especially in their coordination chemistry. Vanadyl bis (acac) is a complex composed of vanadium (IV) and two acetylacetonate ligands, while manganese trisacetylacetonate consists of manganese (III) and three acetylacetonate ligands. The coordination of these bis and tris-ligand complexes is noteworthy because it influences their molecular structure and chemical properties.
The practical utilizes two primary methods to obtain results from the two metal acetylacetonate complexes. These methods include the use of UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy. The UV-Vis spectroscopy method uses electromagnetic radiation to excite valence electrons to higher energy levels. These transitions lead to the absorption of light in the visible or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In comparison, IR spectroscopy utilizes infrared radiation to resonate atomic and molecular vibrations to determine chemical structures. The combination of the two methods can yield significant insights into the molecular structure and chemical properties of the complexes.
The results obtained from UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy analyses provide deep insights into the structure of the two metal acetylacetonate complexes. Through UV-Vis spectroscopy, significant absorption bands are observed, sources of insights into the electronic properties of the complex. For example, using the vanadyl bis (acac) complex, a d-d transition is observed that occurs based on the excitation of one electron from the t2g orbital to the eg orbital.
In comparison, IR spectroscopy results of vanadyl bis (acac) are used to determine the vibrational modes, and consequently the presence of different chemical compounds. The vibrations seen within the ranges of 800-1300cm^-1 and 1450-1700cm^-1 denote the presence of vsym (C-CH3) and v(C-O), respectively, within the vanadyl bis (acac) dilute solution. Similarly, absorption bands of manganese trisacetylacetonate present in the IR and UV-Vis spectra were assigned to their corresponding vibrational modes and d-d transition, respectively. The combination of these analytical methods provides significant insights into the electronic, structural, and dynamic properties of the complexes.
The d-d transition observed in vanadyl bis (acac) using the UV-Vis spectroscopy approach is an important transition that has significant scientific importance. It occurs when an electron is excited from the t2g to eg orbital, with a wavelength of around 510 nm. The transition is significant because of its applications in understanding chemical structure and electronic properties of transition metals such as vanadium. Furthermore, the d-d transition has valuable uses in the optoelectronic industry, such as in electrochromic devices, which convert light energy to electrical energy, and display technology.
The use of IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy to investigate the metal acetylacetonate complex proved to be challenging. In particular, locating band I and III peaks in the manganese trisacetylacetonate complex in toluene proved difficult due to solvent cage effects and the overlapping of peaks. This occurs because Toluene is a non-polar molecule in which there are weak intermolecular forces between molecules. Consequently, solvent cage effects distort the spectra, leading to difficulties in locating the peaks. 
To address the challenges of locating band I and III peaks, several measures can be undertaken concerning the oligomers of the methyl substrates, such as using a different solvent with a higher polarity, such as ethanol, or introducing Fourier transform techniques to improve the spectral resolution. Furthermore, appropriate technique with multiple iterations of the scan can be used to eliminate noise and resolve the spectra peaks, that the discrete absorption bands can be more readily observable. 
In conclusion, properties of two metal acetylacetonate complexes, namely vanadyl bis (acac) and manganese trisacetylacetonate, were probed in this practical using UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy. Through the methods of investigation, significant insights were garnered into their structure, electronic and vibrational properties thereby demonstrating the versatility of these compounds in diverse chemical applications. Furthermore, the d-d transition of vanadyl bis (acac) was highlighted as a critical transition with broad scientific and technological significance, while also examining the challenges faced in the practical of locating band I and band III peak of manganese tris-acetylacetonate in Toluene.
