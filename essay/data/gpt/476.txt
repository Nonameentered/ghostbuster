Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of the most influential political philosophers of the Enlightenment era, believed in a compact and harmonious society which as a rule was a reflection of the general will. The most fundamental problem that Rousseau aimed to answer was how to balance individual liberty with the greater good of society. He believed in a social contract between citizens and their government, in which citizens would transfer some of their rights to the state as long as the state upheld the common good of society. In this essay, I will examine Rousseau's fundamental problem and solution to it, evaluate the practicality of his general will in the application and practice of politics, and assess the worth of his solution.
Rousseau's fundamental problem was the contradiction between the individual and society. According to Rousseau, individuals are naturally good and autonomous, but they are corrupted by the oppressive institutions of society, such as the state, religion, and property. Society as a whole shapes individuals into self-interested and competitive agents, causing a rift between individual freedom and political harmony. Rousseau believed that this tension could only be resolved by finding a way to unite individuals with society.
His solution to the fundamental problem was the concept of the general will. Rousseau believed that the general will was the will of the collective group as a whole, rather than the will of the individual or a particular interest group. He felt that individuals could only realize their full potential and achieve true freedom by participating in the general will. This participation could be achieved through direct democracy, in which citizens make decisions about their own lives and the common good of society. The general will was not intended to restrict individual liberty but rather to ensure that individuals exercised their freedom within the parameters of what was best for society.
Rousseau's idea of the general will was revolutionary at its time, as it provided a solution to the problem of individualism and political harmony. However, the practical application of the general will has been questioned by many modern political commentators. For instance, in contemporary democracies, individuals are elected as representatives of the people, and they are given the task to make decisions on behalf of citizens of a state. They are not necessarily making decisions that are in the best interest of the general will, nor are the decisions they make necessarily democratic.
While the idea of the general will is an appealing idea for a direct democracy, there is the question of practically applying it to the political structure of the whole country. To achieve this would mean reducing the power of elected representatives and giving more power to the people. It would also require citizens to be well-informed and have a good understanding of the issues at hand. A universal consensus on the most significant issues in the country is unlikely, and there is concern that the general will could be hijacked by a populist leader who capitalizes on the people's emotion in critical times of the nation's history.
Moreover, the general will seems to indicate an organic unity of the people, where all individuals are working toward the same goal and that everyone is equally involved in the political process. However, this is not necessarily true in contemporary democracies where people have divided interests and could lead to a lack of political participation, especially by those who don't share the views of the majority.
While Rousseau's general will had certain limitations on its practical application, it has attributed to a wider theoretic debate about the application and practicability of democracy. The debate requires an examination of its restrictions and its relationship with personal freedom while acknowledging the differences between public opinion and the general will.
 Rousseau's solution to the problem of individual liberty and social harmony was the creation of a social contract between the citizens and the state; in this contract, the citizens transfer some of their rights to the state and, in exchange, the state upholds the common good of society. He believed that individuals must adhere to the social contract, which was determined by the general will. The government must ensure that this general will is implemented and that the needs of the individual are addressed through the collective decisions made by the society.
The idea of a social contract would ensure that the government and the citizens of the state have a mutual understanding of their duties and responsibilities. The state would maintain law and order, and the citizens would provide labor, resources, and taxes, helping the collective good. The social contract provides a relationship between the state and its citizens, ensuring that both work for the betterment of society.
However, the practicality and worth of the social contract are also open to question. In many modern democracies, it would seem that government officials and those in power do not always carry out the social contract as intended. The state may fail to uphold its side of the contract, which includes providing basic services to citizens, such as education, healthcare, and security. This situation often leads to the unequal distribution of resources among the population, entrenching economic inequality and encouraging social stratification along class lines.
Furthermore, others suggest that the social contract represents a necessary reflection on human nature, which is often self-centered and individualistic. If not checked, these individualist impulses could lead to chaos and conflict and require a contract between the state and the individual to ensure social order and harmony. However, there remains a need for further examination of how the social contract successfully (or not) applies to contemporary situations beyond its original intent.
In conclusion, Rousseau's fundamental problem was concerning how to balance individual liberty and the common good of society. His solution to this problem was the concept of the general will, which aimed to unite individuals with society. He also proposed creating a social contract between the citizens and the state to ensure a reciprocal understanding of the individual-state relationship. Though these ideas have symbolic value, their practical application to modern democracies prompts serious questions. However, the debate that has emerged from these ideas has brought or encouraged an examination of the limitations of democratic practices and lead to a search for a fairer political practice.
