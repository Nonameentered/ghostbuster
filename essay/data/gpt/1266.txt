To evaluate Renold Plc's performance over the past financial years, it is crucial to examine its financial ratios, financial statements, and market position. These indicators provide investors and other stakeholders with an understanding of the company's financial stability, profitability, growth potential, market share, and overall performance.
One significant performance indicator that is commonly used to evaluate a company's performance is its financial ratios. Renold Plc's financial ratios for the past financial years revealed that the company has achieved steady growth and profitability. The company's gross profit margin was 30.8% in 2005 which is very high for a manufacturing company, indicating good cost management and sales efficiency. Renold's current ratio was 1.1, signifying that the company has adequate liquidity to meet its short-term financial obligations. The company's debt-to-equity ratio was moderate at 67%, which indicates that the company is managing its debt levels well. With a return on equity ratio of 10%, Renold Plc is also generating adequate profits for its shareholders.
Another essential financial statement to review is the income statement, which provides a summary of Renold Plc's revenue, expenses, and net profit over the past financial years. Renold Plc's revenue increased by 14.6% from £148.2 million in 2004 to £169.7 million in 2005. The company's net profit before tax was £9.8 million in 2005, up from £8.1 million in 2004, indicating a steady increase in profitability.
Market position is also a critical factor to consider when evaluating the performance of Renold Plc. The company's focus on innovative products, quality manufacturing, and strong customer service have contributed to its ability to establish a competitive position in its target markets.

Based on the 2004/2005 annual financial report, Renold Plc's future prospects are optimistic.

Renold Plc's performance compared to its peer group has been competitive in the past financial years. Competitors like Coats Group Plc, GKN Plc, and NSK Ltd. have also delivered consistent revenue growth and profitability, indicating a stable environment for industrial manufacturing.
Factors like steel prices and currency exchange rates have had a significant impact on Renold Plc's profitability during this time. Steel prices affect Renold's input costs, which in turn affect the company's profitability and gross margin. Renold Plc has been able to manage these costs efficiently to maintain a healthy gross profit margin, as evidenced by its consistent profitability. Currency exchange rates also have an impact on the company's revenue and profitability, primarily when its products are produced in one country and sold in another. Renold Plc has mitigated this risk by diversifying its operations in various countries worldwide.
Overall, Renold Plc's performance over the past financial years has been consistently stable, marked by steady revenue growth, profitability, and efficient cost management. With its focus on new product development, expansion in emerging markets, and diversification of operations, Renold Plc is well positioned for long-term growth and profitability.
