Edgar Allan Poe is considered one of the most celebrated American authors of the 19th century. His literary works are notable for their intricate plot structures, mysterious characters, and eerie settings. Poe’s storytelling is known for its portrayal of unique and unfamiliar environments that evoke a sense of anxiety and unease in the reader. He uses strange and eerie settings such as dark and gloomy forests, old castles, hidden tombs, and isolated islands to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and isolation in his works. These settings reflect the societal uneasiness and anxiety that existed in American culture during his time.
Poe’s use of eerie and distant settings can be closely linked to the psychological, social, and cultural factors that were prevalent in American society during his time. Poe was writing during the mid-19th century, a time when the United States was undergoing transformation and change. The nation was grappling with social, political, and economic changes that were causing anxiety and uncertainty among its citizens. The theme of social unrest, violence, and corruption is also frequently present in Poe’s stories. The settings Poe creates help establish this mood and are a reflection of the anxieties and fears of the society he was living in.
One of Poe's most famous works, "The Masque of the Red Death," is an allegory for the 19th-century cholera epidemic that swept through America. The story is set in an isolated castle, and the partygoers are experiencing the decline of their society. The castle is described in detail as being dark and eerie, with blackened stained-glass windows and an ever-present air of menace. This image is mirrored by the atmosphere of society during Poe’s time, with the rise of industrialization and the threat of disease leading to a sense of impending doom. The eerie and dark castle setting reflects societal fears of isolation, dread and death.
Poe’s short story, "The Fall of the House of Usher," is another example of the use of eerie settings to reflect societal cultural anxiety. The story features a decaying mansion with decaying surroundings and occupants. The mansion features a dark and gloomy atmosphere, with a pervasive sense of dread. The setting reflects the societal fears and cultural anxieties of the period, where the concept of entropy and decay had become prevalent. The industrial revolution had caused significant cultural change in the structure of the society, with people losing the sense of identity and belonging. Poe’s description of the house’s atmosphere is symbolic of the disease and decay that was spreading in American society at the time. The mansion in the story mirrors the fragmentation and decay of society, which was then in the midst of physical and psychological transformation.
The setting of “The Purloined Letter” is another example of Poe’s use of eerie and distant settings to reflect societal anxieties. The story is set mostly in the Belgian ambassador's hotel room, which is described as being austere and mysterious. The room is dark and dreary, with a permeating sense of unease. The description of the setting hints at the corruption and moral degradation that was prevalent in American society during the 19th century. The broad interpretation of the story’s meaning makes it possible to see the ambassador as representative of American society. The setting of the room in which the story is taking place reflects the moral turpitude and existential fears prevalent in the society.
Another one of Poe’s works that illustrate his use of eerie, distant settings is “The Cask of Amontillado.” The title of the story itself indicates a sense of mystery and intrigue, and the setting is similarly atmospheric. The story takes place in a damp, dark wine cellar, far removed from the outside world. The setting of the story reflects the feelings of isolation and dislocation prevalent in American society during the 19th century. The cellar, with its dampness and darkness, evokes a sense of eeriness and otherness that underscores the existential fears and anxieties of the characters. Poe uses the cellar setting to create a mood of isolation and dislocation, reflecting the psychological states of people in the society during his time.
In conclusion, Poe's use of eerie settings in his stories reflects the societal anxieties and fears that existed in American culture during his time. His works were written during a time of significant social, economic, and cultural change that gave rise to anxiety and uncertainty in the lives of people. Poe’s descriptions of eerie and distant settings, such as castles, dark forests, and hidden tombs, paint a picture of a society that was grappling with feelings of isolation, dislocation, and existential fear. Poe’s own life experiences undoubtedly influenced his writing, and the true extent of the relationship between his stories and the cultural unease of his time remains a topic for debate. Nonetheless, the atmospheric settings he creates are a testament to the universal theme of anxiety about the world that is fundamental to human nature.
