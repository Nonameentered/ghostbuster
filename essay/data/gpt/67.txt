Introduction:
Social psychology is a discipline of psychology that examines how people think, feel, and behave in social situations. In social psychology, obedience is the act of following the orders from a person who has higher authority. The experiments of Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram are two of the most notable and influential experiments that examined obedience to authority. Both the experiments conducted by Zimbardo and Milgram were different in terms of their hypothesis, methodology, and results. This essay will compare and contrast the experiments of Philip Zimbardo and Stanley Milgram in studying obedience to authority.
Hypothesis:
Philip Zimbardo designed his famous experiment to study how prisoners and guards interact with one another. He aimed to test whether the behavior that arises in the prison situations is due to the personality or the situation. Therefore, the main hypothesis of Zimbardo's experiment is that "the situation, not the personality, can cause anti-social behavior" (Zimbardo, 1969). On the other hand, Stanley Milgram aimed to test the extent to which individuals are willing to obey orders that are given by an authority figure, even when the orders conflict with their personal moral code. Milgram's hypothesis was that "the majority of people, no matter their social status or education, will go to the extreme and perform the required task when an authority figure orders them" (Milgram, 1974).
Methodology:
The methodology used by Zimbardo and Milgram in their experiments was different. Zimbardo's experiment took place in a simulated prison environment, whereas Milgram's experiment took place in a university laboratory setting. The prison simulation was designed to create a sense of realism, making the subjects feel that they were actually prisoners and guards in a real prison. The experiment consisted of two groups, one group of 'prisoners,' and another group of 'guards.' Zimbardo assigned the role of the prison guards to the study participants randomly. The experiment lasted six days, during which the guards and prisoners were allowed to interact with each other. The guards were instructed to keep discipline in the prison and to follow the given orders. Zimbardo played the role of the prison warden, and his assistants acted as prison officers.
Milgram's experiment was designed to examine how far individuals would go to obey orders given by an authority figure, regardless of the consequences. Milgram recruited participants via newspaper advertisements, by mail, and through direct contact. The subjects were led to believe that they were taking part in a study on learning and memory. The study participants were instructed to deliver electric shocks to a stranger who was believed to be another study participant. The shocks were delivered using a shock generator, and the voltage of the shocks increased with each wrong answer given by the stranger. The stranger was actually an actor who was pretending to be receiving electric shocks, and the shocks were not real. Milgram recorded the level of obedience by the participants to authority, the length of time that they administered shocks, and their reactions to the experiment.
Results:
The results of Zimbardo's experiment showed how quickly the study participants adopted their respective roles, with the guards becoming increasingly aggressive and sadistic. The participants, both guards and prisoners, began to internalize their roles and behaved in ways that were inconsistent with their typical behavior. The participants who played the role of the guards felt powerful, and they began to mistreat the prisoners by verbally abusing, humiliating, and dehumanizing them. In contrast, the prisoners began to experience depression, anxiety, and even severe emotional breakdowns.
The results of Milgram's experiment showed that 65 percent of the study participants administered the maximum voltage of electric shocks despite hearing the stranger's screams of pain. The study showed how far an individual would go to obey the authority figure even if it meant inflicting pain on another person. The study revealed that people were willing to ignore their personal values and beliefs on the orders of an authority figure.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, both Zimbardo and Milgram's experiments reveal the harmful effects of obedience to authority. However, the experiments were designed to test different hypotheses, and therefore, their conclusions were divergent. Zimbardo's experiment suggested that the situation, not the personality, could influence the behavior of a person. Milgram's experiment suggested that people are capable of obedience to authority, even if it conflicts with their personal beliefs and values. Both Zimbardo and Milgram's experiments were influenced by the social and cultural context in which they took place, as well as the participants' motivations and predispositions. Their experiments mark a significant breakthrough in understanding the complex relationship between human behavior and obedience to authority.
