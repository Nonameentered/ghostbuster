Carl Becker is one of the most significant historians of the twentieth century who offered a distinct reworking of traditional methods of historical writing. He challenged the traditional modes of historical inquiry to scrutinize the philosophical and epistemological basis of historical thought. Becker's work in historical writing was anchored on well thought and structured response to the prevailing historical modes of inquiry. He identified flaws in the traditional ways of writing history and offered an insightful shift in rethinking historical writing. In this essay, we discuss the methods of historical writing that Carl Becker challenged and the significance and impact of his work on American historical writing.
The traditional approach to historical writing is premised on creating a linear sequence of events in different periods, often drawn from documentation in the analysis and construction of historical narratives. However, Becker maintained that history writing could result from subjective interpretations of historical events and that judgments made by historians accorded different meanings to past events. Essentially, he challenged the traditional methods of historical inquiry, pointing out that historical writers and scholars have varied personal experiences that form a distinct lens through which they view and interpret historical events. He thus destabilized the traditional methods of creating nationalistic views of history. Becker believed that historical analysis should be apprehended through rigorous assessment by the historian of their value judgments and subjective interpretation of the data available.
Becker illuminated the importance of understanding our worldview and its impact on our perception of historical events. He recognized that historians act as both scientists and artists, emphasizing that adequate knowledge about perspective, context, and subjectivity is crucial in understanding the past. In his view, historical writing was an imaginative act in the sense that the historian produced knowledge that was informed by their values, ideas, emotions, and personalities. Becker highlighted that a thorough understanding of subjectivity and value judgment was a primary tool required for conscious and rigorous history writing. Becker, therefore, called for historical writing to be both an art and a science, as the historian used their skill to interpret data from various primary sources and shaped stories and narratives to be released to the world.
One of the most significant contributions of Becker was the construction of the idea of "Everyman his own historian." He emphasized that every person, regardless of their social status, shared a duty to actively read, understand, and interpret the past. By this phrase, Carl Becker meant that every citizen has a duty to independently examine the historical narratives they are fed, as well as construct their own historical account based on primary research. This idea of Everyman his own historian reflected Becker's belief in the importance of critical thinking and active engagement by ordinary people in interpreting the past rather than merely consuming vastly nationalistic and overly deterministic historical accounts. Becker called for continuous educative efforts to promote historical literacy, empowering individuals to engage in discourse and stimulate the challenge of existing historical frameworks.
Becker's work has been extremely influential and critical in shaping American historical writing discourse. His structuralist approach to historical inquiry has offered a flexible and more useful approach in moving beyond the unsatisfactory linear rendering of history by traditional approaches. Becker's insistence on the importance of the historian's subjective interpretation and characterization of historical events propelled the creation of a more nuanced view of historical events. His ideas have been adopted by several groups of historians, such as the New History movement, to impact and reshape the American historical writing tradition.
Becker's work encouraged historical writing to be pluralistic rather than a prescriptive rendering of history, providing a wider frame of analysis, and insight into historical analysis and interpretation. His work promoted the idea of literature and history as being intertwined in their rendering of events and as an essential element in constructing national identity. Through his emphasis on subjectivity and value, Becker aligned the pursuit of historical inquiry with the broader project of individualism and self-discovery.
In conclusion, Carl Becker's significant contribution to American historical writing cannot be overstated. He challenged the traditional approaches to historical inquiry, stressing the need for a more nuanced view of history that was grounded in the subjectivity and value judgments of the individuals writing it. Through his work, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complexities of historical rendering, encouraging the investigation of a more diverse range of perspectives and the development of more sophisticated forms of analysis. Becker encouraged the centrality of critical thinking and reflection in historical discourse and propagated the importance of the literate and active citizen in conducting historical inquiry. Becker's ideas have far-reaching consequences, and he remains relevant today in the field of American historical writing, which has been profoundly impacted by his contributions.
