Introduction
The relationship between women's human rights and religious freedom is a complex one that has been a source of contention for many years. The human rights of women have often been impeded by religious beliefs and practices that discriminate against them. While religious freedom is a fundamental human right, it can conflict with the human rights of women. In this essay, we will trace this relationship through the context of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. We will also use case studies from India to highlight the different positions taken by religious ideologues and feminists regarding women's rights. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of the CEDAW, including its weak enforcement mechanism and criticisms of embodying a male-based model of equality. 
Relationship between Women's Human Rights and Religious Freedom
Women's human rights and religious freedom are two fundamental human rights that can sometimes come into conflict. The issue often arises when women's rights are infringed upon due to religious beliefs and practices that discriminate against them. This can be seen in many areas, such as education, employment, and reproductive rights. For example, in many parts of the world, women are denied an education based on religious beliefs that women should not be educated. 
The United Nations has recognized the importance of addressing the relationship between women's human rights and religious freedom. The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979, is a treaty that aims to eliminate discrimination against women worldwide. It obligates member states to take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all areas, including education, employment, and health care. 
Similarly, the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief (DEADR) is a declaration that aims to eliminate all forms of religious intolerance and discrimination worldwide. It recognizes that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and that this right should be protected and respected without discrimination. 
Case Studies from India
India is a country with a diverse religious population, and it is an excellent example of the different positions taken by religious ideologues and feminists regarding women's rights. The country has a long history of discrimination against women based on both religious and cultural beliefs. 
One of the most contentious issues related to women's rights in India is the practice of "triple talaq," which is the practice of a Muslim man divorcing his wife by saying "talaq" three times. Many Muslim feminists have argued that this practice is discriminatory against women and goes against the principles of equality and justice. However, many religious leaders argue that this practice is a fundamental tenet of their religion and should not be interfered with by the government. 
Another case study is the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, India. Women between the ages of 10 and 50 are traditionally not allowed to enter the temple because of the belief that women of menstruating age are impure. The practice was challenged by a group of women who argued that it was discriminatory and violated their human rights. The issue was taken to the Supreme Court of India, which in a landmark judgment in 2018, allowed women of all ages to enter the temple. 
Limitations of the CEDAW
The CEDAW is a landmark treaty in the fight for women's human rights, but it has some limitations. One of the biggest limitations is its weak enforcement mechanism. The treaty lacks enforcement mechanisms, and the courts in many countries have not been receptive to cases filed under the CEDAW. 
Another limitation is that states can make reservations to the treaty, which means that they can exclude themselves from certain provisions of the treaty. Many countries have made reservations to the CEDAW, which weakens its impact and scope. 
Finally, some critics have argued that the CEDAW embodies a male-based model of equality and does not address the unique experiences of women. For example, the treaty focuses on formal equality rather than substantive equality, which means that it aims to provide women with the same opportunities as men rather than addressing the specific needs and experiences of women.
UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief
The UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief complements the CEDAW by guaranteeing the freedom to practice one's own religion without fear or discrimination. The declaration recognizes that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and that this right should be protected and respected without discrimination. 
The declaration also recognizes that discrimination based on religion or belief can lead to violations of other human rights, including women's human rights. By guaranteeing the right to religious freedom, the declaration helps to ensure that women's rights are protected from religious discrimination and intolerance.
Conclusion
The relationship between women's human rights and religious freedom is complex and often contentious. While religious freedom is a fundamental human right, it can conflict with the human rights of women. The UN has recognized this relationship through the CEDAW and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. Case studies from India have highlighted the different positions taken by religious ideologues and feminists regarding women's rights. While the CEDAW has been a significant step forward for women's human rights, it has its limitations and needs to be strengthened.
