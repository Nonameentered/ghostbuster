Strayer and Johnston’s research article, “Driven to Distraction,” explores the effects of cell phone usage on driver’s attention and its impact on driving performance. The study examines the relationship between visual-handling tasks and risk-taking behaviors in a simulated driving environment. While the study provides essential insights into the negative effects of cell phone usage on driver distraction and safety, there are potential issues with the external validity, construct validity, and internal validity of the research. In this essay, I will discuss these potential issues and offer suggestions on how the researchers can address them to improve the reliability and applicability of their findings.
External Validity
One potential issue with the external validity of Strayer and Johnston’s research is that the study was conducted in a simulated driving environment. While a simulated environment allows researchers to control the variables and manipulate the scenarios, it lacks ecological validity and may not accurately reflect real-world driving situations. External validity refers to the generalizability of the research findings to the target population, and in this case, it can be an issue because drivers may behave differently in a real driving environment, given the complexity and unpredictability of the road. Further, since the study was conducted on college students, the generalizability of the findings may be limited to adult drivers, and it may not apply to younger or older drivers or different populations.
To address these issues, the researchers can conduct a similar study in a real-world driving environment, such as on the road using a monitoring device that can track drivers’ cell phone usage and driving performance in different driving scenarios. This would improve the external validity of the study and allow for more accurate and generalizable findings. Additionally, the researchers can include a diverse population of drivers to examine if there are differences in cell phone usage and driving performance among different age groups or populations.
Construct Validity
Construct validity refers to the extent to which the study measures the targeted construct accurately. In Strayer and Johnston’s research, the construct of driver’s attention and cell phone usage was measured using several variables, such as frequency of cell phone usage, visual-handling tasks, and risk-taking behaviors. While these variables can provide important insights into the relationship between cell phone usage and driver distraction, they may not capture the full extent of the construct and may be subject to measurement errors or biases.
To improve construct validity, the researchers can consider using more objective measures of driver distraction, such as eye-tracking technology or driving performance metrics, to assess the effects of cell phone usage on driver’s attention. Additionally, they can use validated scales to measure the construct of driver distraction and cell phone usage. A validated scale can provide a more accurate and reliable measure of the construct and can help address some of the measurement errors or biases that may exist in the study.
Internal Validity
Internal validity refers to the extent to which the study can establish a causal relationship between the independent variable (cell phone usage) and dependent variable (driver distraction). In Strayer and Johnston’s research, the study design used a between-group design where participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group. The experimental group was exposed to a simulated driving environment with various visual-handling tasks while using a cell phone, while the control group was exposed to a driving environment without cell phone usage.
While this study design allows for a comparison between the experimental and control groups to examine the effects of cell phone usage on driver distraction, there may be other confounding variables that may influence driver’s attention and driving performance in the simulated environment. For example, participants in the experimental group may have different levels of driving experience or attentional abilities compared to the control group, which may influence the study outcomes.
To improve the internal validity of the study, the researchers can use a within-subject design where participants are exposed to both conditions (with and without cell phone usage) to compare their driving performance and attentional abilities under different conditions. A within-subject design can help control for individual differences in driving experience and attentional abilities and can provide a more accurate and less biased comparison between the two conditions. Additionally, the researchers can use a crossover design where participants are randomly assigned to different sequences of conditions, such as cell phone usage first, followed by no cell phone usage, or vice versa, to control for order effects that may influence the study outcomes.
Conclusion
Overall, Strayer and Johnston’s research provides valuable insights into the negative effects of cell phone usage on driver distraction and safety. However, there are potential issues with the external, construct, and internal validity of the study that may limit the generalizability, accuracy, and causal inferences of the research findings. To improve the reliability and applicability of their findings, the researchers can address these issues by conducting a similar study in a real-world driving environment, using more objective measures and validated scales to assess the construct of driver distraction and cell phone usage, and applying different experimental designs to control for confounding variables and biases. By addressing these issues, the researchers can help provide a more accurate and reliable picture of the effects of cell phone usage on driver distraction and safety, which can inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and drivers about the risks associated with distracted driving and the importance of responsible cell phone usage while driving.
