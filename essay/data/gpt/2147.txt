Intonation refers to the rise and fall of pitch in speech, which can convey a range of meanings, emotions, and attitudes. Teaching English intonation to adult learners is crucial for effective communication, as it enables them to express themselves appropriately in different social contexts. Peter Roach and David Brazil are two notable linguists who have developed different notation systems for teaching English intonation. While their frameworks offer valuable insights into the complexities of intonation, they also have distinct advantages and disadvantages that can affect their coherence and clarity in teaching.
Roach's notation system is based on the concept of tonemes, or basic pitch patterns, that recur across different languages and contexts. His framework consists of five tonemes, namely high level, high fall, low rise, low fall, and rise-fall. The advantage of Roach's system is its universality and simplicity, as it can be applied to a wide range of speakers and situations. However, the disadvantage is that it may oversimplify the nuances and variations of intonation, leading to a mechanical or robotic speech style.
Brazil's notation system, on the other hand, is based on the notion of prosody, or the overall melodic structure of speech that incorporates intonation, rhythm, and stress. His framework consists of three components, namely tone unit, tone group, and intonation contour. The advantage of Brazil's system is its comprehensive and context-sensitive approach to intonation, as it takes into account the semantic and pragmatic functions of speech. However, the disadvantage is that it may be too complex and abstract for some learners, especially those who are not familiar with linguistic terms and concepts.
The different objectives of Roach and Brazil also influence the coherence and clarity of their frameworks. Roach's objective is to provide a simple and practical tool for teaching and learning intonation, without requiring extensive linguistic knowledge or analysis. His framework is therefore more focused on identifying and reproducing tonemes, rather than explaining their functions or meanings. Brazil's objective, on the other hand, is to describe and analyze the prosodic features of speech, in order to enhance learners' awareness and control of their intonation. His framework is therefore more theoretical and analytical, requiring a deeper understanding of how intonation interacts with other aspects of language.
In conclusion, both Roach's and Brazil's notation systems have advantages and disadvantages for teaching English intonation to adult learners. Roach's system is simpler and more universal, while Brazil's system is more comprehensive and context-sensitive. The coherence and clarity of their frameworks depend on their different objectives, which prioritize either practical communication or theoretical analysis. Therefore, the choice of notation system should be based on learners' needs, goals, and abilities, as well as the learning context and objectives.
