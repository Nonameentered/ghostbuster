William Wordsworth’s ‘We are Seven’ is a poem that remains one of the quintessential pieces of Romantic literature that explores several themes including childhood, death, and the afterlife. The poem recounts the conversation between a narrator and a young girl named “Little Maid,” who claims that she and her siblings are “seven,” despite two of them having already died. Through the conversation, Wordsworth gives voice to the child’s perspective on death, and the afterlife, while weaving in his own views on these themes. This essay will explore Wordsworth’s views on childhood and death as portrayed in the poem, and how he uses language to effectively voicing the child’s perspective on these themes.
One of the most essential themes in the poem is childhood, which Wordsworth uses to explore not only the children’s innocence but also their understanding of life and death. From the conversation between the narrator and the little girl, it is easy to discern that the little girl still has a great attachment to her siblings, even those who have already passed on to the afterlife. Wordsworth captures the essence of childhood innocence in the little girl’s refrain, “we are seven,” underscoring the idea that children have the capacity to see beyond what adults perceive as reality. For the child, reality is what they experience and feel. Despite the loss of her siblings, the little girl holds onto the idea that her deceased siblings are still part of her family, a belief that she finds difficult to let go of.
The poem also frequently explores the concept of death, which Wordsworth uses to show the child’s understanding of the afterlife. When the narrator explains that two of her siblings have died, the little girl refuses to accept that they are no longer part of her family. The child believes that the deceased siblings are still part of the family because they are “in heaven,” revealing her deep-seated belief in an afterlife. In Wordsworth’s view, children are still pure and unfettered by societal beliefs about the afterlife, and therefore can imagine something that is beyond our understanding. This is seen clearly in the line, “Nay, we are seven! Two of us are in the church-yard laid, But when the grass is fresh with rain...then they show as good as day.” Through the child’s words, the poet conveys that death is not something to be feared, as the dead continue to exist in the memories of their loved ones.
While one might assume that the little girl is a mere tool to express the poet’s view, the poem manages to capture her innocence and purity while showing how effective her childlike perspective is in reflecting the poet's own beliefs. The child’s perspective offers a counter-narrative against the narrator and other adults in the poem's universe. The narrator, for example, remains skeptical of the little girl’s assertion that she is one of seven children. The focal point of their disagreement is the dead siblings, with the narrator insisting that since the two children are deceased, they should not count as part of her siblings. However, the child proves much more capable of acknowledging and accepting her siblings’ demise, as her childlike perspective allows her to understand the impermanence of physical life, while remaining focused on the immortality of their familial bond.
Wordsworth uses riddle-like language to further emphasize the child’s innocence, while simultaneously underscoring her conviction that her siblings who have passed away are still very much a part of her life. The poem’s repeated “We are seven” not only reflects the child’s innocence but also transforms the phrase into something of a riddle. The refrain acts almost like a rhyme, fuelling the poem's rhythm and consistency, and emphasizing the child’s unwavering belief in the unity of her family despite the physical absence of her siblings. The little girl’s refrain and conviction elicit sympathy and a sense of urgency in the reader to explore the broader implications of her belief in the persistence of her deceased siblings, thus adding to the poem’s depth and complexity.
Wordsworth’s view on childhood and death also explores the idea that humans are not wholly defined by their physical existence. Through the little girl’s words, the poet depicts death as a natural part of the human existence, as well as something that people should not fear. For the child, death is not a loss in the traditional sense, but rather a mere transition to a new phase of life. Wordsworth’s view on death acknowledges that physical bodies may come into existence, grow old, wither, and eventually be buried, but people’s souls and memories are, in many ways, immortal. In Wordsworth’s view, memories are the way humans remain connected to their loved ones, giving their lives meaning long after their physical existence has ended.
By voicing the child’s perspective, Wordsworth is able to explore and portray deep emotions with simplicity, innocence, and purity, conveying sentiments that are often lost in an adult-centered world. The poet captures the sensory experience of childhood and presents a vision of life that is not wholly bound by traditional concepts of logic and reason. Wordsworth’s use of language in the poem is also reflective of the child’s perspective. For instance, the poem’s structural simplicity allows the poem to be read by children, and its conversational tone replicates the child’s experiences, which make the reader feel closer to the child and better able to understand her perspective. The simple, repetitive nature of language highlights the child’s innocence and innocence, allowing the reader to see the world through the eyes of a child.
In conclusion, Wordsworth’s "We are Seven" is a poem that explores the themes of childhood, death, and the afterlife through the little girl’s voice. His use of language in the poem helps to bring the child’s perspective to life, as the child’s innocent and pure perspective creates an alternative narrative to mainstream society’s beliefs about death and the afterlife. In Wordsworth’s view, life is not wholly about the physical world, but is instead a compilation of memories and connections that continue even after physical death. The use of riddle-like language emphasizes the child’s conviction, underscores her innocence, and adds depth to the poem’s overall understanding. Ultimately, Wordsworth’s poem highlights the idea that even amidst the difficulties of life, children possess a simplistic ability to deal with the complexities of life that adults often fail to understand.
