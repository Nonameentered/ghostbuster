The Serial Endosymbiosis Theory (SET) proposes that mitochondria and plastids, including chloroplasts, originated from symbiotic associations between the ancestral eukaryotic host cell and free-living bacterial ancestors. According to SET, the evolutionary development of eukaryotic cells occurred through a series of endosymbiotic events, where one organism resides with another inside its cells, leading to metabolic integration and genetic exchange. These endosymbiotic events eventually gave rise to the complex, eukaryotic cells we see today.
SET suggests that mitochondria originated from a free-living bacterium, which was engulfed by an early host cell and subsequently evolved into a specialized organelle. Highly conserved features of mitochondria, such as their unique double-membrane structure, their own genome, and biochemical pathways that are distinct from those found in the rest of a eukaryotic cell, are all hallmarks of endosymbiotic evolution. Similarly, chloroplasts are thought to have originated from a free-living cyanobacterium, which was engulfed by a eukaryotic host cell and subsequently evolved into a specialized organelle to carry out photosynthesis. The evidence supporting SET comes from a variety of sources, including comparisons of the genetic material from mitochondria and bacteria, studies of the biochemical pathways and proteins of modern mitochondria and chloroplasts, and the observation of symbiotic associations between modern eukaryotic cells and bacteria.
In contrast to SET, autogenous theories of eukaryotic cell evolution propose that eukaryotic cells arose from proto-eukaryotic cells through a process of gradual internalization of endogenous components. The most prominent autogenous theory is the Membrane Infolding Model, which suggests that eukaryotic cells developed from an ancestral archaeon through a series of invaginations of the cell membrane. This internalization would have allowed the cell to develop the specialized compartments known as organelles that are characteristic of eukaryotic cells today. While autogenous theories like the membrane infolding model are plausible, the evidence supporting them is not as robust as that supporting SET.
The evidence for the endosymbiotic origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts is strong and has been bolstered by a wide range of approaches. For example, mitochondrial DNA is circular and has many similarities to bacterial DNA, including the presence of genes for enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. Similarly, chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and have their own circular DNA molecule that is similar in many ways to bacterial DNA. Key enzymes involved in photosynthesis in chloroplasts are also similar in structure and function to those present in cyanobacteria. Morphological and physiological similarities between mitochondria and bacteria have also been observed.
Lynn Margulis proposed an expanded version of the SET that included other organelles such as cilia and flagella, as well as the endosymbiotic origins of eukaryotic cells themselves. Her idea, known as the symbiogenesis theory, emphasizes the role of symbiotic associations in the evolution of life. The main difference between SET and Margulis's symbiogenesis theory is that the latter proposes that the internalization of bacteria occurred at multiple points in eukaryotic cell evolution, rather than just the two seminal events proposed by SET. Margulis's ideas have influenced modern concepts of eukaryotic cell evolution, although they are currently less well-supported by experimental evidence than the middle ground SET.
The characteristics of mitochondria are consistent with their endosymbiotic origins. Mitochondria are characterized by their unique double-membrane structure, which is thought to reflect the host cell's phagocytosis of the free-living bacterium that would give rise to the mitochondrion. Mitochondria also have their own genome, which has some similarities to bacterial genomes, including the presence of plasmids. Furthermore, mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation, which is the primary way that eukaryotic cells generate ATP. The genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria are highly conserved across all eukaryotic cells, and many of these genes have their earliest origins in bacteria.
In conclusion, the evidence surrounding SET strongly supports the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were originally free-living bacteria that were engulphed by ancestral eukaryotic cells. The unique characteristics of these organelles, such as their double membrane structure, own genomes, and ATP-producing pathways, all suggest their endosymbiotic origins. While autogenous theories of eukaryotic cell evolution also offer reasonable explanations for the evolution of eukaryotic cells, they are not as robustly supported by the evidence as SET. The symbiogenesis theory of Lynn Margulis has expanded on the original SET, emphasizing the role of symbiotic associations in the evolution of eukaryotic cells and proposing multiple internalization events, but it is currently less well-supported by experimental evidence than the middle ground SET.
