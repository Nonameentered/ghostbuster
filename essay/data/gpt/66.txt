Western understandings of Asia have been shaped by Orientalist assumptions to a great extent. The term “Orientalism” refers to the Western interpretation of the cultures, customs, religions, and languages of Asian societies. It is defined as a series of representations and stereotypes constructed by the West regarding the East. In this essay, I will examine the impact of Orientalism on current Western understandings of Asia, focusing on its historical roots, its influence on popular culture and media, and its implications for international relations.
To understand how Orientalism has influenced Western perceptions of Asia, it is necessary to examine its historical roots. The concept of Orientalism dates back to the Enlightenment period when European scholars became interested in the study of non-Western cultures. The study of the East was seen as an opportunity to explore the origins of Western civilization and to understand the “Other.” However, the study of Asia was not based on an objective, scientific approach, but rather on assumptions and stereotypes that were deeply rooted in Western culture.
Edward Said, a Palestinian-American scholar, has been widely acknowledged as the foremost critic of Orientalism. In his seminal work Orientalism, Said argues that the study of Asia was motivated by the desire to control and dominate it. According to Said, Orientalism was a way for the West to justify its imperialist policies and to construct a negative image of the East. He argues that Orientalism was a form of power that allowed the West to impose its own cultural values on Asian societies.
One of the most significant effects of Orientalism on current Western perceptions of Asia is its influence on popular culture and media. Popular culture and media have the power to construct and reinforce stereotypes and perceptions of Asia that are deeply rooted in Orientalist assumptions. Hollywood movies, for example, have portrayed Asian societies as exotic, mysterious, and dangerous. The portrayal of Asian women as submissive and exotic reflects the Orientalist stereotype of the passive and sensual “Oriental.” Similarly, the portrayal of Asian men as martial artists and villains reinforces the stereotype of the “Yellow Peril.”
The influence of Orientalism on media and popular culture is not limited to Hollywood movies. News media, for example, has been criticized for its biased reporting of Asia. The news coverage of the 1997 financial crisis in Asia, for example, portrayed Asians as lacking in rationality and economic expertise. The coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games perpetuated the stereotype of China as a repressive regime where human rights are disregarded. These examples illustrate how Orientalist assumptions have influenced Western media representations of Asia.
Another significant effect of Orientalism on Western perceptions of Asia is its impact on international relations. Orientalist assumptions have contributed to the Western belief in the superiority of Western civilization and its values over those of the East. This belief has justified colonialism and imperialism, as well as Western interventions in Asian affairs. For example, the Western intervention in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 was justified on the grounds that Western civilization had a duty to protect its own citizens and to impose its values on “barbaric” Asian societies. The belief in the superiority of Western civilization has also contributed to the imposition of economic policies, such as free-market capitalism and neoliberalism, that have had negative consequences for Asia.
Despite its drawbacks, Orientalism has also influenced the development of Asian societies. The adoption of Western ideas and practices in Asia has been a result of the influence of Orientalism. The Westernization of Asian societies, such as Japan, has allowed them to modernize and to achieve economic success. However, this has come at a cost, as the adoption of Western ideas has often resulted in the loss of cultural identity.
In conclusion, Orientalism has had a significant impact on current Western perceptions of Asia. Its historical roots lie in the Enlightenment period, when the study of non-Western cultures was motivated by a desire to understand the “Other.” However, this was accompanied by stereotypes and assumptions that were deeply rooted in Western culture. These assumptions have influenced popular culture and media, as well as international relations. The negative portrayal of Asia in Hollywood movies and biased reporting by Western media illustrate how Orientalist assumptions have shaped current Western perceptions of Asia. Nevertheless, the adoption of Western ideas and practices by Asian societies has also been a result of the influence of Orientalism.
