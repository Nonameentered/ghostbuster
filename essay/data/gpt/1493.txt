Qualified and motivated employees contribute significantly to enhancing an organization's performance, delivering excellent customer service, and meeting the changing preferences and expectations of customers. Appropriate recruitment and selection practices enable organizations to identify suitable candidates who fit well with their organizational culture, the job requirements, and the customer service requirements of the industry.

This industry is known for its high employee turnover rates, which affect an organization's operational efficiency, customer satisfaction and retention, and profitability. Hiring suitable employees through appropriate recruitment and selection practices aids in reducing employee turnover rates by creating a conducive work environment, job satisfaction, and career progression opportunities.
Current recruitment and selection practices in the hospitality and tourism industry
The hospitality and tourism industry has varied recruitment and selection practices, depending on organization size, customer preferences, and job roles. The recruitment and selection practices in this industry include job advertisements on websites and social media platforms, employee referrals, recruitment agencies, career fairs, and direct hiring.
In job advertisements, organizations provide details on job descriptions and job specifications to attract suitably qualified candidates. When organizations use social media platforms, they have the advantage of reaching a wider audience that may not be captured by conventional recruitment methods. Employee referrals are also popular among organizations as they rely on existing employees to refer suitable and qualified candidates to fill up the vacancy. Recruitment agencies provide temporary and permanent recruitment solutions to organizations that need an optimized recruitment process. Career fairs allow organizations to network with potential candidates and display their available job opportunities.
In direct hiring, organizations rely on walk-ins, current online applicants, or internally promoted employees to fill up the available vacancies. Direct hiring is an efficient way to recruit suited internal employees since they are familiar with the organization's culture, and their promotion motivates them to continue working for the organization.
Suitability of current recruitment and selection practices in achieving employee fit
Employee fit refers to how well the employees align with the organization's expectation or culture, the job, and with one another as a team. The suitable recruitment and selection practices are those that aid in identifying employees that fit into an organization's culture, and job requirements. The current recruitment and selection practices in the hospitality and tourism industry have some advantages and also some disadvantages.
Job advertisements and social media platforms draw candidates interested in the advertised job role. Their platform enables the organization to create interest for the vacant position, identify possible candidates, and filter them based on the job descriptions and specification. However, these methods may not be suitable in identifying an individual's soft skills such as customer service, teamwork, and communication skills.
Employee referrals may lead to homogeneity within the organization because existing employees may refer candidates with similar backgrounds, which might not be what the organization needs to achieve diversity. Furthermore, the use of recruitment agencies to optimize the recruitment process can be expensive, and they may not be suitable for identifying candidates with unique skills and creativity.
Direct hiring is efficient in identifying suitable internal employees that are familiar with the organization's culture and job requirement. It is a cost-effective method of recruitment and allows employees to progress in their careers. However, it can lead to favoritism and lack of diversity within the organization.
Overall, the current recruitment and selection practices in the hospitality and tourism industry are fit to achieve employee fit. However, there is a need for organizations to employ multiple recruitment methods to cater to the diverse workforce's needs and meet the changing customer expectations.
Different HRM approaches and their effectiveness in the hospitality and tourism industry
There are two HRM approaches, namely Best Practice and Best Fit. The best practice approach is the ideal management practice that enhances organizational competitiveness by improving employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention. The approach involves investing in employee training and development, providing a conducive working environment, and aligning compensation packages with job demands.
The best fit approach focuses on aligning the organization's human resources with its strategic goals. It involves adjusting recruitment and selection methods, compensation packages, and job roles to fit the organization's requirements. This approach emphasizes recruiting suitable employees with the required skills, a cultural fit to the organization, and a match to the job requirements.
Both approaches can enhance the hospitality and tourism industry's competitiveness by enhancing employee satisfaction, productivity, retention, and aligning employees' skill sets and organizational goals. The best-fit approach is well suited for the hospitality and tourism industry because of its high dynamicity and changing customer expectations and preferences. Organizations that use appropriate recruitment and selection methods, which aid in identifying employees' skills and personal attributes that align with their strategic goals, have a higher chance of success.
Benefits of "soft" models such as TQM and how they improve recruitment and selection processes
Total Quality Management (TQM) is a "soft" HRM model that emphasizes the involvement of all employees in the organization to achieve its quality goals, which eliminates inefficiencies in the system. TQM can lead to improvements in recruitment and selection practices by promoting internal recruitment and referral systems, providing employees with training and development opportunities, ensuring fair compensation packages, and creating an inclusive work culture.
Internal recruitment and employee referral systems found in TQM promote employee retention and aid in identifying suitable candidates for existing job roles. Employees are familiar with the organization's culture, strategic goals, and job requirements, which enhances employee fit. Adequate training and development opportunities can increase employees' skills and competencies, which positively affect organizational productivity and efficiency. Employees with suitable skills and competencies are motivated and committed to their jobs, leading to job satisfaction, which, in turn, leads to job retention.
Furthermore, TQM provides fair compensation packages to employees that match the job requirement, which promotes job satisfaction, and motivates employees to work better. A conducive work culture that provides equal opportunities to all employees can promote diversity and inclusivity and increase employee commitment to their work and the organization.
Overall, TQM promotes employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention that support long-term organizational growth. Organizations that adopt TQM practices have a higher chance of success because their employees are aligned with the organization's culture and job requirements.
New and innovative recruitment and selection methods, such as psychometric tests and assessment centers, to improve employee commitment and integrate them with the business strategy
New and innovative recruitment and selection methods such as psychometric tests and assessment centers can improve employee commitment and align them with the organization's strategic goals. Psychometric tests are tests that assess an individual's personal attributes such as personality, critical thinking, decision-making, and communication skills. It helps in identifying characteristics that are not necessarily visible on the surface, which might be of great significance to the job role. It helps in minimizing subjective human bias that might affect the recruitment process.
Assessment centers assess a candidate's practical skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, relevant to the job role. The assessment centers aim to simulate a real work environment to identify an individual's strengths and weaknesses critical to his/her job role.
The above innovative methods provide a detailed assessment of the candidates that aid in identifying individuals with the required skills that align with the organization's culture and job requirements. Minimizing subjective human bias during the recruitment process leads to attracting diverse and talented individuals for the job role. The methods aid in identifying individuals who align with the organization's culture and strategic goals. Attracting such individuals has a positive impact on the organization's employee commitment, productivity, and retention.
New and innovative recruitment and selection methods are essential for organizations that aim to stay ahead of their competitors. Adopting innovative methods can aid organizations in meeting their ever-changing recruitment and selection needs, aid in achieving employee fit, and aligning employees with the organization's strategic plan.
