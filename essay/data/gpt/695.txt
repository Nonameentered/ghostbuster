The world operates on the concept of money. Money is what makes the world go round. It is the medium of exchange for goods and services. However, the amount of money in circulation cannot be arbitrary. It must be regulated for the welfare of the economy. This is where the concept of the money multiplier comes into play.
The money multiplier refers to the process by which banks use deposits to create money. It is a fascinating idea that has its roots in the banking system's theoretical foundations. Banks are financial intermediaries that help transfer funds from savers to borrowers. Banks do this by accepting deposits from savers and using the money to lend to borrowers, who, in turn, repay the loan with interest.
Banks use a fraction of the deposit to keep in reserve, which is a reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is set by central banks. These reserves are held as a safety net to deal with withdrawals by depositors. Banks keep these reserves to ensure that they have enough liquid assets that can help cater for sudden withdrawals or any other short-term emergencies. This then leads to the money multiplier principle in action.
The money multiplier acts as a multiplier for deposits and reserves, enabling the creation of more money from the initial amount available. The process works as follows:
1. Person A deposits money in a bank.
2. The bank then holds a fraction of the deposit as reserve and lends the remainder to Person B.
3. Person B then uses the money to buy goods and services, and the seller deposits the money back into the bank.
4. The bank again sets aside a fraction of the deposit as reserves and lends the remainder to Person C.
5. The process repeats itself multiple times, resulting in multiple deposits that stem from the initial deposit.
The money multiplier phenomena can be calculated using the following formula: Money Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Ratio. For instance, if the reserve ratio is 10%, the money multiplier would be 1 / 0.1 = 10.
Banks play a crucial role in the creation of money; nevertheless, it is the central bank of the country that regulates the reserve ratios, hence indirectly regulating the money supply. In times of economic crisis, the central bank can use the reserve ratios as a tool of monetary policy to regulate the money supply.
Monetary policy refers to the process by which the central bank influences the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives like inflation, full employment, currency stability, among others. The central bank regulates the money supply through open market operations, reserve requirements, and interest rates.
One way central banks regulate the reserve ratios is through the legal reserve requirements. Legal reserve requirements are the minimum percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserve to fulfill the bank's liquidity needs in case of emergency. When the central bank increases the legal reserve requirement, it reduces the amount of reserves that banks can lend out, causing the money supply to decline. On the other hand, if the central bank lowers the legal reserve requirements for banks, it increases the amount of reserves available for lending. Banks can, in turn, generate more deposits, which results in the money supply increasing.
Another way central banks regulate reserve ratios is through the use of discount rates. The discount rate is determined by the central bank and is the interest rate that commercial banks have to pay on the money they borrow from the central bank. When the central bank increases the discount rate, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow and lend money. Thus, banks will reduce their lending, which decreases the supply of money. Conversely, if the central bank lowers the discount rate, it becomes cheaper to borrow and lend money, encouraging banks to lend more, which increases the money supply.
In conclusion, the money multiplier principle is a fundamental aspect of the banking system. It enables banks to use deposits to create more money through the lending process. Central banks regulate reserve ratios to ensure that banks have enough reserves to meet the needs of depositors while also regulating the money supply of the economy. An increase in the reserve ratio decreases the amount of money in circulation, while a decrease leads to an increase in the amount of money circulating in the economy, thus affecting the economic activities of the country. As such, it is essential to maintain an equilibrium between the reserve ratios and the money supply to ensure macroeconomic stability.
