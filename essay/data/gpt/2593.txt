In considering the application of principles of justice within the family unit, Susan Moller Okin and John Rawls propose differing and at times conflicting arguments. Okin contends that the traditional family structure is conducive to gender-based oppression and must be reformed in order to facilitate a truly just society, while Rawls largely avoids direct commentary on family structure and instead emphasizes principles of fairness and freedom. The dialogue between these two theorists highlights tensions regarding the private/public dichotomy and approaches to addressing power imbalances within the family unit.
Okin contends that traditional family structures in which women are economically dependent on men contribute greatly to gender inequality and must be reformed in order to promote true justice. In particular, she argues that women are disproportionately burdened with domestic labor and childrearing responsibilities due to cultural expectations surrounding femininity and domesticity, and that these roles often prevent women from pursuing paid employment and lead to their economic dependence on men. Okin suggests that this economic dependence places women in a disadvantaged position within the family, as they lack the leverage to negotiate for equitable distribution of labor and decision-making power. Additionally, Okin contends that expectations regarding gender roles serve to reinforce and perpetuate gender-based oppression, and that the dismantling of these expectations is necessary in order to promote genuine equality.
Rawls, in contrast, largely avoids addressing issues of family structure directly, instead focusing on principles of fairness and freedom that he believes should guide society as a whole. Rawls argues that each individual in a just society should have access to basic liberties, such as freedom of speech and of conscience, and that any inequalities that exist should be arranged in such a way as to benefit the least advantaged members of society. He suggests that the principles of justice that would apply to the family unit can be derived from these larger societal principles, and implies that the family is ultimately a private matter that individuals must negotiate on their own terms.
One of the primary areas of tension between Okin and Rawls’ arguments concerns the public/private dichotomy. Okin contends that issues of gender inequality within the family unit are not simply a private matter, but rather have significant impacts on the larger society. She argues that the traditional family structure contributes to the perpetuation of gender inequality by limiting women’s opportunities for economic independence and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes. Okin suggests that in order for society to be truly just, it must take an active role in addressing these issues and working towards reforming the family structure. Alternatively, Rawls largely avoids commenting on the public/private dichotomy, instead treating the family unit as a private matter that individuals must navigate on their own terms.
Another area of tension between Okin and Rawls’ arguments concerns their approaches to addressing power imbalances within the family unit. Okin argues that power imbalances, particularly those based on gender, must be explicitly addressed in order to promote true equality within the family. She suggests that a just society must work to dismantle harmful gender stereotypes and facilitate opportunities for women to achieve economic independence, which would in turn provide them with leverage to negotiate for more equitable distribution of labor and decision-making power within the family. Alternatively, Rawls suggests that principles of fairness and freedom can help to address power imbalances within the family unit. He suggests that a just society would be one in which each individual has access to basic liberties and in which any particular inequalities that exist are arranged in such a way as to benefit the least advantaged members of society. Rawls implies that if these principles are upheld, individuals within the family unit will be free to negotiate power dynamics in a fair and equitable manner.
Ultimately, the arguments put forth by Okin and Rawls highlight tensions surrounding the application of principles of justice within the family unit. Okin argues that traditional family structures perpetuate gender inequality and must be reformed in order to promote true equality, while Rawls largely avoids commentary on family structure and instead emphasizes principles of fairness and freedom. The debate between these theorists highlights tensions surrounding the public/private dichotomy and approaches to addressing power imbalances within the family unit. While Okin and Rawls’ arguments differ in their approach to these issues, both ultimately seek to promote a more just society through the upholding of principles of fairness and equality.
