Ever since C.B. MacPherson posited his thesis on the Levellers and their stance on franchise reform more than half a century ago, historians have been locked in a debate about the accuracy of his claims. Central to his argument is the contention that the Levellers were a homogenous group of radicals who sought to extend the franchise to include all adult males. This notion has been challenged by a body of evidence that demonstrates that the Levellers were a heterogeneous group whose positions on franchise reform evolved over time and were influenced by a variety of factors, including ideology, pragmatism, and the perceived political threat posed by other groups. This essay will provide an analysis of the debate surrounding MacPherson's thesis, with a focus on evidence from the authoritative documents on the franchise. It will then argue for a different hypothesis based on the notions of compromise and heterogeneity, including an analysis of Petty's position at Putney and the changing stances of the Levellers towards certain groups.
MacPherson's thesis was first presented in his 1962 book, "The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism." According to his argument, the Levellers were a radical egalitarian movement who championed the extension of the franchise to all adult males. In MacPherson's view, the Levellers represented a challenge to the prevailing ideology of possessive individualism, which held that individual property rights were the foundation of freedom and social organization. By advocating for universal franchise, the Levellers were attacking the very basis of this political philosophy, which resonated with the political elite and business classes who dominated English society at the time. MacPherson's thesis was widely influential and had a significant impact on the study of the Levellers. However, in the years since its publication, a number of historians have questioned the evidence used to support his claims.
The authoritative documents on the franchise include the Agreement of the People, the Putney Debates, and various pamphlets and other publications produced by the Levellers. These documents provide a rich source of evidence on the Levellers' position on franchise reform, and their interpretation has been central to the debate surrounding MacPherson's thesis. One of the key disagreements between MacPherson and his critics concerns the extent to which the Levellers were a homogenous group. MacPherson argued that the Levellers shared a common vision of democracy and equality, and that their support for universal franchise was based on this shared ideology. However, many historians have pointed out that there were significant differences within the Leveller movement, both in terms of ideology and strategy.
For example, some Levellers, such as John Lilburne, were committed to the principle of universal franchise from an early stage of the movement. Others, however, were more pragmatic in their approach. In particular, there were Levellers who were concerned about the potential consequences of extending the franchise too widely. In the Putney Debates, for example, the Levellers debated the issue of whether or not to include women and servants in the franchise. While some Levellers, such as Thomas Rainsborough, argued in favor of universal franchise, others, such as William Rainborough, expressed reservations about the potential consequences of including groups who they perceived to be less politically mature. Rainborough argued that "the least part of those who are together" would "be more violent in the pursuance of their ends than the greater number." This debate reveals that the Levellers were not a homogenous group, and that their positions on franchise reform were influenced by a range of ideological, strategic, and tactical considerations.
Moreover, the Levellers were not resistant to the idea of compromise. They were willing to make concessions and to work with other groups if it helped to further their broader aims. For example, in the Agreement of the People, the Levellers proposed a number of concessions to the demands of moderate parliamentarians in order to build a broad coalition of support for their proposals. This demonstrates that the Levellers were not ideologically rigid, and that they recognized the need to be pragmatic in their approach to political change.
The Levellers also showed a willingness to adapt their position on franchise reform in response to changing circumstances. For example, in his pamphlet "The New Leveller's Standard Advanced," Richard Overton argued that the franchise should be extended to include "every man that is taxed and bears arms." This represented a significant shift from the Levellers' earlier position, which had focused on the principle of representation. Overton's argument was based on the perceived threat posed by the Royalist army, which had been reconstituted in 1648 following the defeat of Charles I. The Levellers recognized that the only way to counter this threat was to mobilize a broad-based army of citizens who would be loyal to the cause of democracy and equality. This demonstrates that the Levellers' position on franchise reform was not fixed, but was influenced by changing political contexts.
In light of this evidence, it is clear that the Levellers were a heterogeneous group whose positions on franchise reform were influenced by a range of factors, including ideology, pragmatism, and the perceived political threat posed by other groups. Given this heterogeneity, it is unlikely that the Levellers shared a common vision of democracy and equality, as MacPherson suggested. Rather, their political philosophy was shaped by a complex array of factors, and their positions on franchise reform evolved over time.
It is therefore possible to propose a different hypothesis about the Levellers' stance on franchise reform. Rather than being guided by a preconceived ideology of democracy and equality, the Levellers were motivated by a desire to achieve political change that was consistent with their broader aims. This change was facilitated by a willingness to compromise and to work with other groups, as well as a recognition of the need to adapt their strategies in response to changing political contexts. Rather than being a homogeneous group of radicals, the Levellers were a diverse movement that was united by a commitment to political change and a recognition of the need to be pragmatic in their approach.
In conclusion, the debate surrounding MacPherson's thesis on the Levellers and their stance on franchise reform has been an ongoing one. While MacPherson argued that the Levellers were a homogenous group of radicals who sought to extend the franchise to all adult males, many historians have challenged this position. Evidence from the authoritative documents on the franchise suggests that the Levellers were a heterogeneous group whose positions on franchise reform were shaped by a range of factors, including ideology, pragmatism, and the perceived political threat posed by other groups. As a result, it is possible to propose a different hypothesis about the Levellers' position on franchise reform, one that is based on the notions of compromise and heterogeneity. By recognizing the complexities of the Levellers' political philosophy, it is possible to gain a richer understanding of this important movement and the impact that it had on the development of English democracy.
