The methodology used to assess the antioxidant potential of a range of samples involves three main procedures, namely, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). These procedures are used to measure the ability of samples to scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress.
To prepare the samples, they are first extracted and diluted to a specific concentration. The TAC procedure involves measuring the absorbance of the sample after oxidation using specific reagents. The ORAC procedure measures the inhibition of fluorescein oxidation resulting from a peroxyl radical initiator. The FRAP procedure measures the ability of the sample to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) under acidic conditions.
To test for repeatability, the samples are prepared and tested in triplicate. The results obtained from each procedure are averaged and compared to ensure precision and accuracy. Statistical analysis is also conducted to determine the variability between the samples and the significance of the results.
Overall, the methodology used to assess the antioxidant potential of samples is crucial in understanding their ability to protect against oxidative stress. By using three different procedures, researchers can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the antioxidant potential of the sample and ensure the results are repeatable and accurate.
