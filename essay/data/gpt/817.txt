The Great Leap Forward was a socio-economic campaign launched in the People's Republic of China in 1958, aimed at rapidly transforming China into a socialist industrialized nation. The campaign was initiated by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China, and was marked by an unprecedented drive towards industrialization and collectivization. The Great Leap Forward promised a utopia of communal living, communal farming, and communal production of goods and services. Unfortunately, the results were far from utopian, and the campaign has been widely criticized for causing widespread suffering and economic devastation. In this essay, I will assess the degree to which Mao Zedong was personally responsible for the Great Leap Forward's lack of success.
Mao Zedong was unquestionably the driving force behind the Great Leap Forward and the main architect of its policies. Mao's ideologically driven vision of a communist utopia, his belief in the power of the masses, and his determination to accelerate economic development at any cost were the main driving forces behind the Great Leap Forward. Mao saw the campaign as a way to surpass the economic development of the capitalist world and build a socialist society that would be the envy of the world. Mao recognized that to achieve this goal, China needed to achieve rapid industrialization, and he saw massive industrial projects as the key to success.
Mao's role in the Great Leap Forward was not limited to providing vision and policy guidance; he was also actively involved in the implementation of the campaign. Mao made frequent trips to the countryside to review the progress of the campaign, and he personally addressed village meetings and encouraged farmers to embrace the new agrarian policies. Mao was also involved in overseeing the production of industry and the collection of grain, which were the two most critical components of the campaign.
One of Mao's most significant contributions to the Great Leap Forward was the "Backyard Steel Furnaces" campaign. This campaign aimed to mobilize farmers and other rural residents to produce steel in small backyard furnaces. Mao believed that this would allow China to catch up with industrialized nations quickly. However, the results were disastrous. The small-scale production of steel was inefficient, and the steel produced was of poor quality. The resources spent on this campaign could have been better used to build large-scale steel production facilities, which would have been more efficient and of higher quality.
Mao was also responsible for the implementation of the "Commune" system during the Great Leap Forward. The Commune system aimed to collectivize agriculture by merging small farms into large communes. Mao argued that this would allow for the efficient use of resources and the integration of farming with industrialization. However, the forced collectivization of agriculture led to resistance from farmers and resulted in a decline in agricultural output. The lack of individual ownership of land meant that farmers had little incentive to work hard, resulting in low crop yields.
Mao's failure to listen to the advice of experts was another factor contributing to the Great Leap Forward's lack of success. Mao distrusted expert advice and believed that the masses could achieve anything if given the opportunity. Mao's disdain for experts was evident when he rejected the advice of the country's leading experts in agriculture, who warned him against the dangers of collectivization. Mao also rejected the advice of economists who warned him against the excesses of the campaign, such as the building of unnecessary infrastructure.
Another factor contributing to the Great Leap Forward's failure was the lack of a feedback mechanism to assess whether the campaign was working or not. Mao believed that the campaign would be a success as long as people were enthusiastic about it and were working hard. Mao was overly optimistic about the campaign's prospects, and he refused to acknowledge the evidence that it was not working. This left the campaign without any means to correct its mistakes, resulting in the continued waste of resources and labor.
In conclusion, Mao Zedong was responsible for the Great Leap Forward's lack of success to a significant degree. His ideologically driven vision, combined with his belief in the power of the masses, resulted in policies that were unrealistic and costly. His personal involvement in the implementation of the campaign further compounded the situation. Mao's refusal to listen to expert advice, his overly optimistic view of the campaign's prospects, and the lack of a feedback mechanism to assess its success were all factors that contributed to its failure. Ultimately, it was Mao's vision, policies, and leadership that were responsible for the Great Leap Forward's disastrous consequences.
