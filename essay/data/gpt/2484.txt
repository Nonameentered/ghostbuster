The CTCS scheme is a numerical algorithm used to solve partial differential equations, which model phenomena in fields such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and finance. However, this method is not without its drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss the errors associated with the CTCS scheme, how they affect the numerical solution, and offer suggestions on improving the scheme's stability.
The CTCS scheme is a second-order central difference scheme that requires three time steps to compute a new approximation. However, the scheme's instability arises from its truncation error, which creates a numerical oscillation. This oscillation is a result of the second-order difference scheme's dependence on the values of neighboring points to calculate the numerical approximation at each step. This means that the second-order difference scheme uses data from points that are farther away from the desired point. As a result, the scheme produces numerical oscillations that become amplified over time, leading to an erroneous solution.
The CTCS scheme's numerical oscillations affect the numerical solution by distorting the wave's amplitude and causing the wave's phase to lag behind the true wave's phase. This problem is especially prominent when the wave's amplitude is small. In addition, the CTCS scheme's oscillations are most significant in the high-frequency regime since the scheme's truncation error is proportional to the wave's frequency. These errors are particularly evident when the wavefronts' propagation speed is close to the limiting speeds, resulting in a distorted image of the wave.
Comparing the square wave to the smooth initial function, we can see the difference in the errors' effects. The square wave's sharp discontinuity creates a more significant truncation error, leading to more pronounced numerical oscillations. As the square wave propagates, it creates a stair-step pattern reminiscent of the wave violating Nyquist's criterion, which states that the sampling rate should be at least twice the maximum frequency. On the other hand, the smooth initial function generates much less numerical oscillation. The wave propagates smoothly and only slightly deviates from the true wave solution. This is due to the smooth initial function's slowly varying amplitude change, leading to a lesser truncation error in comparison to the stepped discontinuity of the square wave.
To improve the stability of the CTCS scheme, several approaches could be implemented. One potential method to stabilize this scheme is to dampen its numerical oscillation. It is possible to add artificial numerical damping terms to the governing equations to reduce the numerical oscillation. This damping effect can be achieved by adding a small fraction of the second derivative in the time derivative term of the governing equation. Another approach to increasing the scheme's stability is to adaptively adjust the time step to reduce the amplification of the numerical oscillations. The use of adaptive time steps will allow us to reduce the time step when the frequency is high, thus avoiding the amplification of numerical oscillations.
Another method to reduce the error would be to utilise higher-order difference schemes to increase the numerical stability. The use of higher-order difference schemes, such as the fourth-order Adams-Bashforth (AB4) or the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4), will remedy the CTCS scheme's instability by reducing the truncation error and subsequent numerical oscillation. Higher-order difference methods also better handle sharp gradients and discontinuities, reducing the staircase effect seen in the square wave CTCS solution.
In conclusion, the CTCS scheme is a numerical algorithm used to approximate solutions to partial differential equations but is associated with several errors that affect its stability and numerical accuracy. These errors often manifest in the form of numerical oscillations, which distort the wave's amplitude and phase, leading to an erroneous approximation. In addition, comparison of the CTCS numerical solutions for the square and smooth initial function indicates that sharper and more discontinuous functions lead to greater errors. To improve the scheme's stability, we must develop numerical damping mechanisms, adapt the time step around high-frequency regimes, or utilise higher-order difference schemes better suited to handling harsher wavefront gradients. In concert, these measures can provide a swift remedy to a notoriously difficult issue to solve in numerical finite-difference methods.
