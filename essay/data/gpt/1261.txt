Micromorphology is the study of microscopic thin sections of soil, sediment, or other matrix materials found in archaeological sites. This approach offers an effective tool for understanding the archaeological context of the samples, providing insights into the building activities and the use of buildings in past societies. These thin sections are analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or other micro-analytical methods, revealing the minute details of the geological, pedological, and anthropogenic layers and features present in sediment samples. By examining these micro-artefacts, archaeologists can gain an understanding of the various activities that took place in specific spaces and how buildings were utilized.
Micromorphology offers detailed information about the flooring, wall, and surface materials, as well as the activities associated with the use of various spaces. Under the microscope, it is possible to identify the presence of different sediment layers, the size of the sediment grains, and the composition of different materials. By examining the sediment layers, archaeologists can understand the accumulation of deposits over time and their relationship to the building activities that took place. 
For instance, when examining the micro-artefacts of a building floor, the presence of food processing residues may suggest that the room was used for food preparation or consumption. Alternatively, the presence of fibers, plant remains, and animal hair could indicate that the room was used for textile making, suggesting the type of activities that took place in the building.
Micromorphology also provides insights into the different construction techniques used in the building, as well as how specific materials were sourced. For example, the identification of imported or locally sourced materials can help archaeologists understand the trade networks and social networks of the people who constructed and used the building. Moreover, the analysis of sediment layers also reveals how the different construction techniques were employed, how different materials were incorporated into the building, and the impact of different activities on the integrity of the building.
One example of micromorphological applications is the study of Kawakami Sakura Mound, a prehistoric Japanese site dated around 3000 years ago, located in the Hokuriku region of Japan. The analysis of the soil samples collected from the mound found lots of interesting micromorphological features that revealed the social and environmental context of this specific site. The thin sections of sediments identified the presence of several layers of ash and burnt soil that matched with the discovery of charred structures associated with daily life activities of people. The burnt soil layers contained a high concentration of shell fragments, pottery, and bone fragments that provided evidence of food processing, cooking, and consumption activities. Additionally, the study of the sedimentary layers also demonstrated the existence of various soil horizons, some of them representing horizons of human disturbance, indicating the different stages of mound construction and the accumulation of deposits associated with human activity.
Another example of how micromorphology can provide insights comes from the study of Pueblo Grande, an Ancestral Puebloan site in Arizona, USA, which dates back to the Hohokam period (between AD 700 and 1500). Researchers excavated several room blocks and found that different rooms showed signs of different types of activities. The micro-analysis of the soil samples from these rooms identified micromorphological features such as ash layers and charcoal fragments, suggesting intensive food processing, cooking, and storage activities. The presence of fibers and plant remains indicated textile making activity. Furthermore, the examination of the wall plaster in one room revealed the use of several plaster layers, indicating changes in the use of the room over time, possibly related to renovation and redecoration of the space.
Finally, micromorphology can also provide insights into the environment in which the building was located at the time of its construction and use. The sediment layers reveal information such as the soil conditions contributing to the building's construction, the depositional environment, and the local natural resources that were utilized in the construction of buildings. This information can offer valuable insights into the environmental adaptations and resource management strategies of past societies.
In conclusion, micromorphology is a powerful tool for unlocking valuable insights into the activities conducted in buildings in past societies, providing information that cannot be obtained through other archaeological practices. The study of micromorphology provides valuable insights into the environmental, social, and economic contexts of buildings, revealing how buildings were utilized in the past and the different activities that took place within these structures. By analyzing the micro-artefacts identified in sediment samples, archaeologists can understand the various construction techniques and how they were employed, as well as the source of different materials. Therefore, micromorphology has become an essential tool for archaeologists to study the different aspects of past societies and should continue to be used to expand our knowledge of the historical world.
