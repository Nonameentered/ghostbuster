For many people, discovering oneâ€™s passion and working towards a career in that field can be a life-changing experience. This was certainly the case for me, as I pursued my dream of opening a bakery that incorporated the gastronomies of different cultures in one unique product. In this essay, I will describe the steps I took to identify my career aspirations and create an action plan to achieve them. I will also delve into the process of updating my CV and covering letter to secure a loan for my business set-up. Finally, I will explain my motivation for pursuing entrepreneurship over a strategic management career in an international hotel company.
My journey began with a glimpse of inspiration that I encountered in my travels. While exploring the streets of Tokyo, I came across a bakery that fused traditional Japanese flavors with French-style baking. In that moment, it dawned on me how incredible it would be to create culinary delights that combined flavors from different cultures.
Upon my return from my trip, I began researching various recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. It was then that I realized that I could pursue a career in opening a bakery that specialized in multicultural baking. Eager to turn my dream into a reality, I sought guidance from seasoned entrepreneurs and baking experts. Through their support and advice, I crafted a solid business plan that outlined everything from the products I would offer to the marketing strategies I would employ.
The next step on my path was to secure funding. To do this, I had to create an impressive CV and covering letter that highlighted my experience in the baking industry and communicated my passion for multicultural baking. I wanted to show potential lenders that I had done my homework, knew the market, and was committed to making my bakery a success. I also wanted to demonstrate that I had the skills needed to run a business, such as accounting, management, and customer service.
One of the challenges I faced in creating my CV and cover letter was the lack of formal education in business or entrepreneurship. To mitigate this issue, I took the initiative to enroll in online classes and workshops that expanded my knowledge in these areas. I also documented my self-study and included it in my CV to show that I was committed to learning and growing.
In terms of motivation, I was driven to pursue entrepreneurship over a strategic management career in an international hotel company due to the freedom and creativity it offered. I knew that if I worked for a hotel company, I would have limited agency in terms of how I ran my business. In contrast, starting my own bakery gave me the opportunity to be my own boss, make decisions based on my own values, and provide a unique experience for my customers.
Moreover, opening a multicultural bakery allowed me to challenge existing notions of what a bakery should be by creating a space that celebrates diversity and inclusion. I wanted my bakery to be a place where people from different backgrounds can come together and enjoy a delicious and unique product that reflects their individual tastes.
In conclusion, identifying my career aspirations and creating a plan to achieve them was a long and challenging journey. However, through my passion for multiculturalism and my willingness to learn and grow, I was able to turn my dream into a reality. Thanks to the support and guidance of seasoned entrepreneurs, I was able to craft a solid business plan and secure funding for my bakery. Although my CV and cover letter initially presented a challenge, I was able to leverage my self-taught skills and showcase my commitment to learning and growth. In the end, my motivation for pursuing entrepreneurship over a strategic management career in an international hotel company was driven by my passion for culinary creativity and diversity. I am proud to say that my bakery has become a unique destination that celebrates the multicultural flavors that make our world so rich and colorful.
