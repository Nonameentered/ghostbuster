Introduction
Information Communication Technology (ICT) has significantly impacted the tourism industry. Over the years, ICT has revolutionized the distribution channels and structure of the tourism industry. The sector has adopted various technologies such as Computerized Reservation System (CRS), Global Distribution System (GDS), and the internet to simplify operations and improve consumer satisfaction. With the advent of ICT in tourism, distribution channels and industry structure have changed, which has had implications for tourism organizations from both consumer and organizational perspectives. This essay will discuss how the application of ICT into tourism has changed the distribution channels and structure of the industry. The essay will discuss the role of Computerized Reservation System (CRS), Global Distribution System (GDS), and the internet and analyze the implications for tourism organizations from both consumer and organizational perspectives. Furthermore, the essay will evaluate and compare three different distribution channels on the internet from a consumer perspective and provide recommendations for tourism organizations.
ICT application in tourism and its impact on distribution channels and industry structure
The integration of ICT into the tourism industry has resulted in significant changes in the distribution channels and industry structure. The tourism industry now has a more efficient and effective system of delivering services to customers. Consumers now have access to information on destinations, transport, and accommodation through various channels such as online booking systems and travel agents. The role of intermediaries such as travel agents has changed significantly due to the integration of ICT. Carrying out bookings and reservations can now be done easily and efficiently through online booking systems instead of going through travel agents and making calls to hotels.
One of the primary tools used in the tourism industry is Computerized Reservation System (CRS), which has revolutionized reservations, ticketing, and seat inventory management. Through the use of CRS, airlines, and hotels can easily manage and control their inventory, which has resulted in increased efficiency and reduced costs. In addition, direct bookings have increased as a result of CRS, as tourists can easily make reservations online. The use of CRS has facilitated the emergence of new trends such as dynamic packaging in the tourism sector, which has resulted in the creation of new travel products and services. Furthermore, CRS has resulted in increased competition in the tourism industry due to lower transaction costs, which has resulted in reduced prices for consumers.
Another application of ICT in the tourism industry is the Global Distribution System (GDS), which is a computerized network system that provides travel industry professionals access to book airline seats, hotels, and car rentals worldwide. GDS has various benefits, such as global reach, the ability to compare various rates, and the availability of up-to-date information. Furthermore, GDS enables travel professionals to access real-time rates and availability, which has resulted in more efficient booking processes. The use of GDS has significantly increased the efficiency of travel agencies in the tourism industry, which has resulted in increased profits for travel agencies. The emergence of online travel agencies such as Expedia, Priceline, and TripAdvisor, which use GDS, has resulted in increased competition, and as a result, pricing for consumers has reduced.
Another significant application of ICT in the tourism industry is the internet, which has resulted in significant changes in the distribution channels and industry structure. The internet has brought about a new method of distribution, and businesses that have adopted the use of internet distribution channels are now more efficient and effective in reaching consumers. The use of the internet has significantly reduced transaction costs in the tourism industry, which has resulted in an increase in the number of direct bookings made by consumers. The internet has facilitated the emergence of new trends such as online booking of accommodation and air tickets, which have simplified transactions and enhanced consumer experience. With the internet, consumers can easily access information on destinations, customer reviews, and compare various prices and deals, which has resulted in increased competition and reduced prices for consumers.
Implications of ICT in tourism for organizational and consumer perspectives
The integration of ICT into the tourism industry has resulted in various implications for both tourism organizations and consumers. From the organizational perspective, tourism organizations can now easily manage their bookings, inventory, and control their prices, which has resulted in increased efficiency and reduced transaction costs. Furthermore, Tourism organizations can now reach customers through various channels such as online travel agencies and direct bookings through their websites. The use of ICT in the tourism industry has resulted in the emergence of new trends and products such as dynamic packaging, which has resulted in increased competitiveness, and reduced prices for consumers.
From the consumer perspective, the adoption of ICT in the tourism industry has resulted in several benefits such as increased efficiency when making bookings, increased accessibility to information, and increased competition, which has resulted in reduced prices. Furthermore, consumers can now easily compare various travel products and services and book directly from tourism organizations, which has resulted in reduced costs.
Evaluation and comparison of three different distribution channels on the internet from a consumer perspective
Online travel agencies (OTA)
Online travel agencies such as Expedia, Priceline, and TripAdvisor provide consumers with various benefits such as access to numerous travel products and services and the ability to compare various prices. Furthermore, online travel agencies provide consumers with relevant information on travel products and services, such as customer reviews, which can aid them in making informed decisions. The major disadvantage of online travel agencies is the booking fees and transaction costs that they charge, which can make travel more expensive for consumers.
Direct bookings via hotel/airline websites
Direct bookings through hotel/airline websites provide consumers with a more direct relationship with service providers, which results in lower prices and increased access to information. By booking directly with service providers, consumers can save on booking fees and other transaction costs charged by intermediaries. Furthermore, direct bookings offer consumers exclusive deals that are only available when booking directly with service providers. The disadvantage of direct bookings is that it requires considerable effort, especially when conducting research and comparing various products and services.
Mobile applications
Mobile applications such as Airbnb and Uber have revolutionized travel and tourism, providing consumers with more affordable and efficient modes of transport. These mobile applications offer consumers the ability to access various travel products and services such as car rentals and accommodation at a lower price. Furthermore, mobile applications offer consumers convenience and efficiency as they can easily carry out transactions and bookings on their mobile phones. The disadvantage of mobile applications is that they may not be available in all destinations, which can limit accessibility.
Recommendations for tourism organizations
Tourism organizations need to be aware of the changes brought about by the integration of ICT in the tourism industry and adopt strategic plans to take advantage of these changes. One of the recommendations for tourism organizations is to invest in direct bookings by creating user-friendly websites that offer exclusive deals and lower prices for direct bookings. Furthermore, tourism organizations need to adapt to emerging trends such as mobile applications, which can enhance customer experience and increase accessibility to travel products and services. In conclusion, the integration of ICT into the tourism industry has had significant implications for both tourism organizations and consumers, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and increased competition. The tourism industry needs to fully embrace the use of ICT and adapt to emerging trends to remain competitive in the market.
