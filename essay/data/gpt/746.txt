Pat Barker's Union Street is a novel that paints a bleak picture of the lives of working-class women living in the North-East of England. In this novel, Barker depicts the daily struggles of a group of women living on Union Street where their lives are filled with poverty, abuse, violence, and hopelessness. However, despite the initial impression of bleakness and hopelessness, there are aspects of the novel that can be seen as "exhilarating." The novel provides a realistic account of the challenges faced by these women and serves as a testament to their resilience, courage, and strength. This essay will explore the aspects of Union Street that can be seen as exhilarating.
Resilience in the face of adversity:
One of the most exhilarating aspects of Union Street is the resilience of the women in the face of adversity. The women in the novel face unimaginable challenges, yet they continue to survive and persevere. Barker portrays these women as strong and capable, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
For example, in the first story of the novel, Kelly is forced to drop out of school and take care of her younger siblings after her mother dies. Despite having to deal with poverty, abuse, and harassment, Kelly perseveres and manages to provide for her family. She does not give up on her dreams of a better life, and even when faced with hardships, she continues to hold on to hope.
In another story, Brenda is a victim of domestic violence. However, she does not let her abusive husband control her life. She eventually finds the strength to leave him and take control of her own life. Brenda's story demonstrates the resilience and strength of women who face domestic violence and abuse.
Courage in the face of danger:
Another aspect of Union Street that can be seen as exhilarating is the courage of the women in the face of danger. The women in the novel are forced to face danger on a daily basis, whether it be from abusive partners, violent men, or dangerous situations. Yet, they continue to persevere and exhibit extraordinary courage in the face of danger.
For instance, in the story of Sylvia, a young girl is repeatedly sexually assaulted by her father. When it becomes too much to bear, she takes matters into her own hands and confronts her father. Her act of courage leads to the end of the abuse, and she is able to move on with her life.
In another story, Doreen is a victim of a violent attack. However, she refuses to be a victim and instead turns to her friends for support. She uses her experience to empower other women and help them stand up against violence and abuse.
Unity in the face of adversity:
Union Street also highlights the power of unity in the face of adversity. The women in the novel may face different challenges, but they are all in the same boat. They come together to support each other and find strength in their shared experiences.
For instance, in the story of Alice, a young girl is forced into prostitution by her mother. However, she finds support and comfort in the women who work at the brothel. They form a bond and provide each other with the support they need to survive.
In another story, the women of Union Street come together to support Brenda in her fight against domestic violence. They rally around her and help her find the strength to leave her abusive husband. The power of their collective support is what gives Brenda the strength to start a new life.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, while Union Street may paint a bleak picture of the lives of working-class women in the North-East of England, there are aspects of the novel that can be seen as "exhilarating." The resilience, courage, and strength of the women in the face of adversity are inspiring. The power of unity and support among women is also a powerful message that resonates throughout the novel.
