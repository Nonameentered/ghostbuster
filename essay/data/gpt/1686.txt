Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects joints and causes them to become swollen, painful, and stiff. It is an autoimmune disease that usually affects people in middle age and is more common in women than in men. Rheumatoid arthritis affects joints of the hands and feet, causing significant discomfort and inhibiting their usage. Even though the disease has no cure, it is possible to manage symptoms by using drugs, surgery, and physical therapy, including exercise and splinting.
The research design and methodology used in a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints involves several steps. It starts with defining the research question, identifying the study design, recruiting study participants, collecting data, analyzing results, and disseminating findings. In this essay, I will discuss the stages involved in the research design and methodology of a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints.
Defining the Research Question
The first stage in designing a research study that evaluates the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis in hand joints is defining the research question. The research question should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely. In this case, the research question could be "Does exercise and splinting improve patient outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in hand joints?" The research question allows the development of hypotheses that can be tested during the study and guides the selection of study design and methodology.
Identifying Study Design
The study design is an important consideration in any research study as it affects the reliability and validity of the findings. In the case of a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints, two study designs could be used: a randomized clinical trial or a quasi-experimental study. A randomized clinical trial involves randomly assigning participants to either the treatment group or control group. On the other hand, a quasi-experimental study involves selecting participants that meet certain criteria and then measuring changes before and after the intervention(s).
In this case, a randomized clinical trial would be the most appropriate study design. The reason is that the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions: exercise and splinting. Randomly assigning participants to either the treatment or control group ensures that the study results are not influenced by individual differences between the participants.
Recruiting Study Participants
The third stage of research design and methodology in a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints involves recruiting study participants. A suitable recruitment strategy is necessary to ensure that the study results are generalizable to the target population. Participants for this study could be recruited from rheumatology clinics or hospitals using flyers and invitations.
Eligibility criteria that include age, gender, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis by a physician, level of pain, and willingness to participate in the study could be used to select participants. Inclusion criteria for the study could be individuals between 35 and 65 years of age, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis of the hand joints, and experiencing moderate pain. Exclusion criteria could include individuals with a history of heart failure, stroke, or any other medical condition that could impede their participation in the study.
Collecting Data
Data collection is the fourth stage in the research design and methodology stage of a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints. Data collection can be done using several methods, including interviews, questionnaires, physical exams, and laboratory tests. In this study, data could be collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention(s) using patient-reported outcome measures such as hand function, pain, and quality of life. The primary outcome measure could be hand function, measured using the Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN).
Other secondary outcome measures could include measures of pain, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), and quality of life, such as the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire. Data on the use of pain relievers could also be collected to determine whether the interventions reduce medication usage. Participants could be given wireless sensors to monitor physical activity levels and adherence to the interventions.
Analyzing Results
The fifth stage in the research design and methodology stage of a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints is analyzing the results. Data analysis could be done using statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and regression analysis. Data could be analyzed using statistical software such as SPSS or SAS.
The primary outcome measure, hand function, could be analyzed using a mixed-effects model that accounts for individual variability and repeated measurement over time. Secondary outcome measures, such as pain, could be analyzed using t-tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) could be used to determine the effects of covariates such as baseline pain levels, age, and sex. Other analysis techniques could include logistic regression and multilevel modeling to account for the clustering effect of data.
Disseminating Findings
The final stage in the research design and methodology stage of a study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints is disseminating the findings. Dissemination of research findings involves sharing them with relevant stakeholders such as researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and patients. Dissemination ensures that the findings are used to improve patient care and inform future research.
The research findings could be disseminated through various channels such as peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences, workshops, and seminars. Patient and community engagement could also be crucial to disseminate findings and translate them into practice. Patient-friendly summaries of the study findings could be provided to the patients and their families.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a research study evaluating the effectiveness of exercise and splinting in treating rheumatoid arthritis of hand joints follows a stepwise process of defining the research question, identifying the study design, recruiting study participants, collecting data, analyzing results, and disseminating findings. The study design and methodology could involve a randomized clinical trial to determine the effects of these interventions on patient outcomes using several outcome measures such as hand function, pain, and quality of life. The findings from such a study could inform patient care and improve health outcomes.
