Introduction
The travel and tourism industry has experienced significant growth over the past few years spurred by globalization and technological advancements. Today, consumers have multiple channels to access travel packages and options, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar travel agents to online booking portals and social media platforms. To ensure a seamless travel experience, businesses often rely on distribution channels that aid in the delivery of travel packages. This essay will explore theoretical issues related to distribution channels in travel and tourism, applying them to a selected travel package to Iceland. The essay will then evaluate three electronic distribution channels, including an aggregator, integrator, and six principals, from the customer perspective. Lastly, the essay will provide recommendations for improvement.
Theoretical Issues related to Distribution Channels in Travel and Tourism
Distribution channels in the travel and tourism industry refer to the channels through which travel products and services are made available to consumers. It is essential to understand the theoretical issues that affect distribution channels to fully comprehend the various challenges that businesses face when designing, implementing, and managing travel distribution channels.
One theoretical issue that affects distribution channels in travel and tourism is the nature of travel products and services. Unlike tangible goods, travel products and services are intangible and perishable. Customers cannot see or touch a hotel room or flight, and they have a fixed period to consume the services once purchased. As a result, travel businesses must design distribution channels that allow customers to easily access their products and services. These channels should be fast and efficient, allowing customers to make bookings or cancellations in real-time.
Another theoretical issue is the complexity of the travel and tourism industry value chain. Typically, travel products and services pass through multiple stakeholders before reaching the customer. These stakeholders range from airlines and hotels to tour operators and travel agents. The more complex the value chain, the more challenging it is to design and manage a seamless distribution channel. Additionally, businesses need to be aware of the various legal and regulatory frameworks that determine what type of intermediaries and marketing tactics can be used.
Lastly, the increasing prominence of technology has led to the proliferation of electronic distribution channels, which create additional theoretical issues. With advancement in technology, travel businesses have to deal with the challenges of managing electronic inventory distribution, revenue management, and fulfillment issues with third-party suppliers.
Applying Theoretical Issues to a Selected Travel Package to Iceland
Iceland is a popular destination for travelers looking to witness the country's unique natural landscapes and northern lights. When looking to purchase a travel package to Iceland, customers have numerous distribution channels to access the packages. These include travel agents, online booking websites, and social media platforms.
Given the theoretical issues affecting distribution channels in travel and tourism, it is crucial to evaluate how each distribution channel is designed to address them. For instance, customers who prefer a more personalized service may choose to work with a travel agent because they can customize their travel packages. By working directly with the agent, the customer gets assistance in creating the perfect travel package that meets their specific needs. The agency can leverage its industry knowledge to ensure that the customer's travel itinerary aligns with their budget and interests.
On the other hand, online booking websites are popular among customers who prefer a self-service model. These channels provide convenience, allowing customers to browse multiple travel packages and make bookings at their convenience. Customers can access detailed information about the travel packages, comparing prices, and inclusions before deciding on the best package. However, customers need to exercise caution when working with online booking agents. They must ensure that the agents are legitimate and that the travel package includes all the necessary inclusions.
Lastly, social media platforms are an increasingly popular distribution channel for travel packages, targeting younger generations. These platforms leverage their user data to provide personalized travel packages tailor-made for the user's interests. They also provide comprehensive information on the destination and cultural experiences unique to the country. However, these travel packages can be challenging to manage, especially when dealing with third-party suppliers.
Evaluation of Three Electronic Distribution Channels from a Customer Perspective
There are three electronic distribution channels in travel and tourism: Aggregator, Integrator, and Six Principals. This section evaluates the three distribution channels and provides recommendations for improvement.
Aggregators are online platforms that consolidate travel packages from multiple sources, allowing customers to have a broad range of travel options. A popular aggregator platform is Booking.com. The aggregator model has several benefits, including a broad range of travel options and lower prices as the aggregator negotiates better rates than when buying directly from the supplier. However, from a customer perspective, the aggregator model has several limitations such as limited customization, lack of transparency, and poor customer support. The platform may not provide adequate information on inclusions or caveats in the travel packages, leading to misunderstandings after purchase. Therefore, to enhance the customer experience, aggregators need to focus on providing more transparency and customization, ensuring that the customer gets value for their money.
Integrators, on the other hand, create a technology ecosystem that connects suppliers and sellers to create a seamless travel experience. An example of an integrator is Sabre. One of the benefits of the integrator model is that it provides a comprehensive inventory of travel products and services, allowing customers to access a broad range of offerings. However, the integrator model may not provide the necessary transparency in pricing, leading to confusion among customers. Furthermore, the integrator may not effectively handle pre-and post-travel support, leading to dissatisfaction among customers. Therefore, to improve the customer experience, integrators need to focus on more transparent pricing and enhancing their customer support systems.
The six principals model refers to the six fundamental components that make up the travel industry value chain, including airlines, hotels, tour operators, travel agents, car rental agencies, and online travel companies. The principal model has several benefits, including a comprehensive distribution system that covers all aspects of a customer's travel experience. However, customer complaints often arise due to poor integration and coordination among the six principals, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. Therefore, to improve the customer experience, businesses must prioritize coordination, collaboration, and integration among the six principals. This way, customers can access comprehensive travel packages that meet their needs.
Recommendations for Improvement
To provide an excellent customer experience, businesses in the travel and tourism industry must focus on several areas, including transparency, integration, coordination, and customization. Here are some recommendations for improving the customer experience:
1. Enhance Customization: Customers require tailored travel packages that meet their specific needs. Therefore, businesses need to focus on providing travel packages that customers can easily customize to meet their needs.
2. Improve Transparency: Customers need to have access to adequate information on the travel package inclusions, pricing, and other details. This way, they can make informed decisions about the travel packages they intend to purchase.
3. Provide Pre- and Post-Travel Support: Customer satisfaction is dependent on the level of support that businesses provide before and after travel. Businesses must prioritize customer support, providing support to customers from the moment they start the booking process to after they return from their travels.
4. Enhance Collaboration and Integration: The complexity of the travel value chain can be a challenge, with multiple stakeholders involved. Therefore, businesses must prioritize collaboration and integration to provide a seamless travel experience.
Conclusion
In summary, distribution channels play an essential role in the travel and tourism industry. Businesses must understand theoretical issues related to distribution channels to design and manage effective distribution channels that meet customers' needs. In Iceland, customers have numerous distribution channels to access travel packages, including travel agents, online booking websites, and social media platforms.
