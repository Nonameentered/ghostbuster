Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that affects the joints, resulting in pain, stiffness, and swelling. This debilitating disease not only impairs physical function but also affects mental health, quality of life, and economic stability. The prevalence of RA is estimated to be 1% worldwide, with women being three times more likely to develop the disease than men.
The clinical evidence on rheumatoid arthritis has shown that it is a complex disease that results from the combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. The primary pathological mechanisms of RA are inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, bone erosions, and cartilage damage. These mechanisms lead to irreversible joint damage and functional impairment over time. RA can also cause systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis.
The most common clinical manifestations of RA are joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which predominantly affect the hands, wrists, and feet. The pain is typically worse in the morning and after inactivity. Moreover, the inflammation and pain can also affect other joints such as shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. Joint deformities, such as swan-neck, Boutonniere deformity, and ulnar deviation, are characteristic of RA. Patients with RA may also experience fatigue, fever, weight loss, and depression.
RA is associated with several comorbidities that can exacerbate the disease's course or worsen the patient's overall health. The most common comorbidities associated with RA are cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, and depression. Cardiovascular disease is more prevalent in patients with RA than in the general population, and it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary disease is also prevalent in RA patients, and it can be due to the inflammatory process or the adverse effects of drugs used in RA treatment. Osteoporosis is another common comorbidity in RA patients, and it is associated with increased fracture risk. Depression is prevalent in patients with RA, and it is associated with a higher risk of disability and lower quality of life.
In conclusion, RA is a complex autoimmune disease that affects the joints and causes systemic manifestations and comorbidities. The clinical evidence on RA has shown that it is a disease that results from complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing joint damage and comorbidities. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis relies on a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches, such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologic agents, and glucocorticoids. More research is required to better understand the pathophysiology of RA and to develop more effective treatments for this debilitating disease.
