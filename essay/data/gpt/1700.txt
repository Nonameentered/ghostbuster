Tourism management is a critical aspect of economic development in every country. Two popular tourist destinations in the United Kingdom are Bath and Oxford. Bath is a historic city that is famous for its Roman baths, Georgian architecture, and vibrant cultural scene. Oxford, on the other hand, is known for being home to the prestigious Oxford University, world-class museums and galleries, and architectural marvels like the Sheldonian Theatre and Christ Church Cathedral. This essay will compare and contrast the management of tourism in Bath and Oxford by analyzing their respective markets, how they are managed as tourism destinations, the facilities they offer, and the impacts of tourism on the local economy, society, politics, and physical environment.
To begin with, the tourist market in Bath and Oxford have significant differences. Bath receives around 5 million visitors annually, with a market dominance of families and adults. Most visitors are attracted to the city because of the various cultural, educational, and recreational activities available in the city, such as the Roman Baths, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Thermae Bath Spa. On the other hand, Oxford's tourism market is mainly educational-oriented. The city attracts over 10 million visitors annually with a dominance of students and adults. A large percentage of visitors are attracted by the University museums and exhibitions and the city's academic reputation, coupled with its vast range of literary tours.
Furthermore, the management of tourism in Bath and Oxford is unique. Bath has developed strong partnerships between its tourism board and the hospitality industry, leading to a collaborative approach towards the city's development as a tourist destination. The city council has actively pursued sustainable tourism by encouraging responsible resource use, eco-initiatives, and minimizing visitor congestion. On the other hand, Oxford has a slightly different management structure, with multiple stakeholders who are passionate about preserving the city's architecture and cultural legacy. The city's council and tourism board work together with the university and local businesses to promote tourism and manage the visitor flow. Sustainable tourism is promoted in Oxford through educational initiatives and encouraging cycling and walking tours.
Moreover, Bath and Oxford have a broad range of facilities to offer visitors. Bath has an extensive array of hotels, spas, restaurants, and cultural sites that cater to a diverse range of tourist interests. There are both modern and traditional amenities, catering to all budgets, from high-end luxury hotels to small, cosy bed and breakfasts. Oxford is also well endowed with world-class museums, galleries, and restaurants and accommodations ranging from budget-friendly hostels to luxurious hotels. Transport facilities are well developed in both cities, with various options such as buses, trains and cars for hire. However, Oxford's streets are relatively narrow, and visitors must use bikes or walking tours to move around the town centre.
Finally, tourism has both positive and negative impacts on Bath and Oxford. The tourist industry is a primary source of revenue for both cities, with visitors spending extensively on tourism-related activities. Bath's economy is highly dependent on tourism, accounting for up to 20% of the region's revenue annually. Similarly, tourism in Oxford provides significant revenue to the region, employing about 6,800 people and contributing millions of pounds to the local economy. However, tourism can have negative impacts, such as environmental degradation, social disruption and congestion. As a result, both cities have implemented measures to promote responsible tourism along with developing facilities that are mindful of visitors and residents. Initiatives such as bike-sharing and pedestrianization of city centres are examples of these efforts.
In conclusion, this essay has compared and contrasted tourism management in Bath and Oxford by analyzing their respective markets, management strategies, facilities, and impacts. While both cities have significantly different tourism markets, their management structures aim at promoting shared interests while encouraging sustainability within the industry. The range of facilities in both cities caters for different visitor needs, with various accommodation and transport options. Finally, both cities are grappling with the challenges posed by tourism on their local economies, society, politics, and physical environment, but they are making efforts to promote sustainable tourism and address the negative impacts.
