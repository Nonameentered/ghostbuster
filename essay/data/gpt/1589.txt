Introduction:
The aviation industry has been in existence for over a century now, and over the years, airlines have come and gone. The industry is highly competitive, and only the most innovative and resilient airlines can survive. Virgin Blue is a perfect example of such an airline. The airline started operating in Australia in 2000 and has since grown to become one of the best and most competitive airlines in the country. What has set Virgin Blue apart from its competitors in the Australian aviation market is its unique strategy. This essay will explore Virgin Blue's unique strategy, how it has been successful in the Australian aviation market, and the challenges it has faced from competitors such as Jetstar and how it has maintained its market share and profitability.
Virgin Blue's unique strategy:
Virgin Blue's unique strategy is to offer a high-quality, low-cost product that targets both business and leisure travelers. The airline's aim is to provide an affordable and enjoyable flying experience to everyone while still making a reasonable profit. To achieve this, Virgin Blue has implemented several key initiatives, including:
1. Efficient Operations:
Virgin Blue has one of the most efficient business models in the aviation industry. The airline has streamlined its operations to reduce costs while still maintaining high levels of service. For example, instead of having full-service flights with meals and beverages on board, Virgin Blue offers a buy-on-board concept where passengers can purchase meals and snacks during the flight, saving the airline costs on catering.
2. Targeted Marketing:
Virgin Blue has targeted its marketing efforts towards both business and leisure travelers. The airline uses social media, email, and other forms of digital marketing to promote its services and specials to its targeted audience. The airline has also embraced partnerships with hotels and car rental companies to create travel packages that appeal to its target markets.
3. Customer Service:
Virgin Blue's customer service is second to none. The airline focuses on making the flying experience as enjoyable as possible for its passengers. Virgin Blue provides comfortable seating, and the cabin is designed to create a relaxed and fun ambiance. The airline has also implemented online check-in options, which allow passengers to check-in and select their seat from the comfort of their homes or offices. This has eliminated long queues at the airport, creating a faster and more convenient check-in process.
How Virgin Blue has been successful in the Australian aviation market:
Virgin Blue's unique strategy has been successful in the Australian aviation market for several reasons. Firstly, the airline has focused on creating a low-cost product that offers high-quality service. This approach has resonated with both business and leisure travelers, who are always looking for affordable but high-quality travel options. Secondly, Virgin Blue has been able to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering a unique and fun-filled flying experience. This has helped the airline to attract a more diverse customer base, including families traveling with children.
Thirdly, Virgin Blue has been able to use technology to enhance the flying experience for its passengers. The airline's online check-in options, complementary inflight Wi-Fi, and mobile app have helped to reduce queues at the airport, making the entire flying experience faster, more convenient, and more enjoyable for passengers. Finally, Virgin Blue has been able to maintain its market share by regularly reviewing its operations and making necessary changes to stay ahead of its competitors.
Challenges faced from competitors such as Jetstar:
Virgin Blue has faced several challenges from competitors such as Jetstar. Firstly, Jetstar has implemented a similar business model to Virgin Blue, offering low-cost fares and a buy-on-board concept. This has made it harder for Virgin Blue to differentiate itself from its competitors. Secondly, there has been stiff competition between Virgin Blue and Jetstar for domestic and international routes. This has led to price wars, where both airlines have reduced their fares to stay competitive, leading to reduced profitability.
How Virgin Blue maintained its market share and profitability:
Despite facing stiff competition from Jetstar, Virgin Blue has maintained its market share and profitability by implementing several initiatives. Firstly, the airline has continued to innovate and improve its operations. For example, the airline has introduced a frequent flyer program that offers exclusive benefits to its customers. Virgin Blue's frequent flyer program rewards loyal customers with priority seat selection, priority check-in, and more. This has helped the airline to retain its loyal customer base and attract new customers.
Secondly, Virgin Blue has focused on expanding its services to new destinations. For example, the airline has introduced new routes for international travel, such as Los Angeles and New Zealand. This has helped to create new revenue streams and reduce the airline's dependency on the domestic market.
Finally, Virgin Blue has embraced technology to improve its operations and reduce costs. The airline has introduced several new technologies, including a mobile app, an online booking system, and inflight Wi-Fi, which have helped to streamline operations and reduce costs.
Conclusion:
Virgin Blue's unique strategy of offering a high-quality, low-cost product that targets both business and leisure travelers has been successful in the Australian aviation market. The airline has been able to differentiate itself from its competitors by providing a unique and fun-filled flying experience.
