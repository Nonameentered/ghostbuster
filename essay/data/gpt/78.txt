Introduction
The human body is programmed to perceive the world around it through the senses. Sensation and perception are the primary ways by which we gather information about the environment. Sensation is the process of detecting the existence of a stimulus, while perception is the process of recognizing and understanding the stimuli based on the received sensory information. These two processes work collectively to provide human beings with the means to interact with the world around them by making sense of the stimuli that they are exposed to. There exists a stark contrast between sensation and perception, and different theories have been brought forward to explain the process of interpretation of sensory experiences. It is the aim of this essay to explore the differences between sensation and perception and how varied theories explain the interpretation of sensory experiences using specific case studies and essential examples.
Differences between Sensation and Perception
Sensation and perception are two distinct processes that function differently, although they work together to process the physical sensations received from the environment. Sensation refers to the process of simply detecting the presence of a stimulus. It is a process that starts at the peripheral nervous system that receives and transmits sensory stimuli to the sensory organs located in the brain. Sensation is a relatively simple process cognitive process and requires the brain to detect the existence of a stimulus and encode it in its raw, unprocessed form. Perception, on the other hand, is the process that comes after sensation. It occurs when the brain interprets and processes the sensory information that was detected in the sensation process to give meaning to the stimuli. Perception is, therefore, a more complex cognitive process that involves assigning meaning and recognizing patterns to the perceived stimuli (Goldstein, 2019).
One of the key differences between sensation and perception is their adaptiveness. Sensation is adaptive, while perception is not. Sensation allows individuals to adapt to changes in stimuli quickly. For instance, when one first enters a room, the smell in the room may be noticeable. However, with time, they become accustomed to the scent, and their brain may not register it as vividly. This is due to sensory adaptation, which is a decrease in sensitivity to a stimulus that occurs over time. This adaptation occurs in the sensory organs, with the aim of filtering out stimuli that are not worth attending to. Perception, however, is not as adaptive as sensation. Once a person perceives a stimulus in a specific way, it is hard to change that perception. Perception is influenced by a person's pre-existing beliefs, prior experiences, and knowledge, which are tendencies that make it less adaptive to new information (Goldstein, 2019).
Sensation and perception also function differently in terms of their neural processing. Sensation involves the movement of nerve impulses from the receptor organ to the central nervous system (CNS), which is responsible for receiving information from the sensory organs and initial processing of these impulses. The CNS is thus responsible for encoding the sensory input into meaningful signals that can be interpreted. Perception, on the other hand, occurs when the brain starts to consider the stimuliâ€™s qualities, including their shape, motion, and color, to interpret and recognize patterns in the environment. Perception involves high-level cognitive processing, which involves the coordination of various brain regions that are responsible for analyzing specific types of information (Goldstein, 2019).
 Theories of Perception
The interpretation of sensory experiences can be explained using different theories such as bottom-up processing, top-down processing, and Gestalt approach.
Bottom-up processing is a theory of perception that explains the formation of perception from materials available in the environment. The theory emphasizes that perception begins at the sensory level and that meaning is extracted from the sensory data that is processed. In this model, perception is built up from the smallest sensory details to form a complete understanding of the environment. For instance, when an individual sees a new object, their perception begins with noticing its individual features, such as color and shape. These individual features are then combined to create perception of the total object (Goldstein, 2019).
According to Merikle and Reingold (1990), bottom-up processing is especially useful when the stimuli are novel and unfamiliar. In their research, they conducted an experiment to demonstrate the role of bottom-up processing in identifying letters presented to unfamiliar scripts. They found that participants who were unfamiliar with a script were able to recognize letters at a much higher rate than those who had prior knowledge of the script. These findings suggest that bottom-up processing plays a vital role in identifying unfamiliar stimuli and using the smallest sensory details to construct an understanding of it.
Top-down processing, on the other hand, is a theory of perception that explains how prior knowledge and memory influence perception. According to this theory, perception is guided by higher-level cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and expectations. Top-down processing is especially useful when a person is presented with familiar and known stimuli. In these cases, prior knowledge guides how perception is formed, and the person makes use of schemas, mental models, and object-based perception to interpret the environment (Goldstein, 2019).
An example of how top-down processing works can be illustrated through the sentence, "the cat sat on the mat". The order of the words and our understanding of how sentences are structured allow us to understand the sentence easily. However, when the words are mixed up, such as "the sat mat cat on the", the meaning becomes more challenging to understand because it challenges the established schemas of how sentences should be formed.
The Gestalt approach is another theory of perception that emphasizes how perception is fundamentally different from the sum of its parts. According to this theory, the mind forms an overall perception of what is being seen rather than just the individual parts that are seen. This approach, therefore, contends that perception is not determined by the stimulus's element but rather by the whole, organized perception. The Gestalt theory further argues that perception of objects is influenced by specific organizing principles, such as similarity, proximity, good continuation, closure, and figure-ground relations (Goldstein, 2019).
An example of the Gestalt theory in practice is the Necker cube illusion, where a two-dimensional drawing of a cube can be seen from multiple visual perspectives, even if it is not explicitly shown. The Necker cube illusion shows how the human brain is programmed to complete images and fill in the gaps even when there is minimal visual information present (Haladjian, Clabeau, Boucart, & Moroni, 2019).
Conclusion
In conclusion, sensation and perception are key cognitive processes that work together to provide meaning and understanding of the environment through the senses. While sensation is the process of detecting the presence of a stimulus, perception is the process of recognizing and interpreting the stimuli. These two processes vary primarily in terms of their adaptiveness, neural processing, and cognitive complexity. Sensation is adaptive while perception is not, and the two processes differ considerably in the neural mechanisms that guide them. Different theories, such as bottom-up processing, top-down processing, and Gestalt approach, provide varied explanations of how sensory experiences are interpreted. These theories illustrate how cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and expectation, help in the interpretation of sensory experiences. The distinction between sensation and perception and the theories that explain perception's involvement in interpreting sensory experiences emphasize the complexities of human perception, which plays a critical role in our everyday life.
