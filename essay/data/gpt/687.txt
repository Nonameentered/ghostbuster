The concept of the sublime has lingered in the imagination of human beings for centuries, offering a poignant glimpse into the beauty and terror of the natural and man-made world, inspiring awe, fear, and admiration across diverse cultures and historical periods. The idea of the sublime emerged as a philosophical and artistic construct in the late 18th century, a time when intellectuals and artists sought to break free from the constraints of the classical tradition and explore new ways of representing human experience and emotion. This essay explores the development of the theory of the sublime in the late 18th century, comparing and contrasting the views of Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant on the differences between the beautiful and sublime, the source of pleasure in the sublime experience, and the role of imagination in understanding the sublime.
The theory of the sublime arose as a response to the limitations of the aesthetic categories of beauty and the picturesque, which focused mainly on the pleasing and harmonious aspects of nature and art. The sublime, on the other hand, referred to those experiences that evoked a sense of awe, terror, and transcendence, pointing to the vastness, complexity, and unpredictability of the natural and man-made worlds. The concept of the sublime was closely associated with the rise of Romanticism, a cultural and artistic movement that emphasized the subjective, emotional, and imaginative aspects of human experience, rejecting the rationalism and classicism of the previous centuries.
Edmund Burke, an English philosopher and politician, was one of the first to articulate a theory of the sublime in his 1756 essay “A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful”. Burke distinguished between the beautiful and the sublime by their effects on the human mind and body. The beautiful, he argued, was defined by qualities such as harmony, proportion, and smoothness, which produce pleasure and delight. The sublime, by contrast, was characterized by attributes such as magnitude, obscurity, and terror, which inspire fear and admiration but not pleasure in the strict sense.
Burke attributed the source of pleasure in the sublime experience to the tension between attraction and repulsion, between the desire to approach and the fear of being overwhelmed, between the imagination and the senses. For Burke, the sublime was most powerfully evoked by nature, particularly by its grand and terrifying aspects such as mountains, waterfalls, storms, and earthquakes. The sublime experience, he argued, was also enhanced by the use of rhetorical devices such as hyperbole, paradox, and metaphor, which enlarged and intensified the effects of language on the mind.
Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher and one of the most influential thinkers in modern philosophy, developed a distinct theory of the sublime in his 1790 work “Critique of Judgment”. Kant distinguished the sublime from the beautiful in terms of their respective aesthetic judgments. While the beautiful was judged according to the sensory and formal qualities of an object, the sublime was judged according to the ideas or concepts that it evoked in the mind. In other words, the sublime was not a property of the object itself but a product of the interaction between the object and the cognitive faculties of the subject.
Kant identified two kinds of sublime experiences: the mathematical and the dynamical sublime. The mathematical sublime referred to the sense of infinity or boundlessness that the mind could not fully comprehend, such as the immensity of the universe or the infinitude of time. The dynamical sublime, on the other hand, referred to the sense of power or might that the mind encountered in the face of natural phenomena, such as storms, hurricanes, and tidal waves. In both cases, Kant argued, the sublime experience was rooted in the tension between the limitations of reason and the infinitude of nature.
Kant also highlighted the role of the imagination in the sublime experience, which he saw as the mediator between the sensible and the intellectual realms. The imagination, Kant argued, was able to grasp the idea of the sublime by expanding and contracting the mental powers of reason and sensibility, by means of self-transcendence and self-limitation. The sublime, therefore, could not be reduced to a mere sensory or rational experience but required the imaginative synthesis of both.
The views of Burke and Kant on the sublime differed in several ways. While Burke saw the sublime as a mainly emotional and rhetorical phenomenon, Kant emphasized its cognitive and conceptual dimension. While Burke linked the sublime mainly to the awe-inspiring qualities of nature, Kant extended it to the domain of ethics and the moral law. While Burke saw the sublime as an instance of the tension between the imagination and the senses, Kant saw it as an articulation of the tension between the finite and the infinite.
However, both Burke and Kant recognized the importance of the imagination in the sublime experience, acknowledging its role as the bridge between the human mind and the world of nature and art. Both saw the sublime as a means of transcending the limitations of the self and experiencing a sense of the transcendent and the sublime. Moreover, both Burke and Kant emphasized the significance of language and poetry in articulating and enhancing the sublime experience, whether through rhetorical devices or through the use of metaphor and imagination.
In particular, Burke’s idea of man-made forms of the sublime adds to our understanding of this concept by recognizing the power of human creativity and ingenuity in evoking a sense of the sublime. Burke saw man-made objects such as Gothic cathedrals and ruins as capable of producing the same sublime effect as natural phenomena, by means of their capacity for awe, wonder, and association. Burke’s notion of the sublime as a product of human culture and history expanded the scope of the sublime beyond nature and paved the way for future developments in the philosophy of aesthetics and art.
In conclusion, the theory of the sublime emerged in the late 18th century as a response to the limitations of the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty and the picturesque, pointing to the vastness, complexity, and unpredictability of the natural and man-made worlds. Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant offered distinct and influential theories of the sublime, highlighting the differences between the beautiful and the sublime, the source of pleasure in the sublime experience, and the role of imagination in understanding the sublime. While both Burke and Kant saw the sublime as a means of transcending the limitations of the self and the world, they differed in their emphasis on the emotional and the intellectual aspects of the sublime, on the natural and the cultural dimensions of the sublime, and on the role of language and poetry in articulating the sublime experience. However, their ideas contributed to the development of the philosophy of aesthetics and the arts, inspiring future generations of artists, poets, and thinkers to explore the sublime in new and exciting ways.
