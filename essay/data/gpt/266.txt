DNA samples have proven to be a powerful tool in solving crimes and identifying suspects. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of DNA databases by law enforcement agencies. While the retention of DNA samples by police may facilitate the detection and prevention of criminal activities, there are concerns regarding its compliance with Article 8(1) and 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
Article 8(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, their home and their correspondence. The retention of DNA samples by police could be seen as a violation of this right, as it involves the collection and storage of personal information without the individual's consent.
Moreover, DNA samples can reveal sensitive information about an individual, including their medical history and family relationships. The retention of such information could be misused by law enforcement agencies, and thereby infringe upon an individual's right to privacy.
Furthermore, the retention of DNA samples by police raises concerns regarding the potential for discrimination on the basis of genetics. Article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights prohibits discrimination on any ground, including race, national origin, and other characteristics. Given that one's genetic makeup is often linked to their ethnicity, there is a concern that certain groups may be subject to discrimination as a result of their DNA being held on police databases.
On the other hand, the retention of DNA samples by police can be seen as an effective means of facilitating the detection and prevention of criminal activities. DNA samples have been used to identify suspects and solve crimes for decades. The use of DNA databases has led to the resolution of a number of high-profile cases, including the rape and murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler.
Furthermore, the retention of DNA samples can serve as a deterrent to would-be criminals. If individuals know that their DNA is on record, they may be less likely to commit crimes in the first place, as they know that there is a greater chance of being caught.
Moreover, DNA samples can provide valuable information in cases where an individual is falsely accused of a crime. If DNA evidence is available, it can be used to prove the innocence of the accused, thereby protecting their rights and ensuring justice is served.
In addition, there are safeguards in place to ensure that the retention of DNA samples by police is not in violation of human rights. In the UK, for example, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) limits the retention of DNA samples to individuals who have been arrested and charged with a criminal offence. Samples taken from individuals who have not been charged or convicted must be destroyed within a specific time period.
Furthermore, the UK's DNA database has been subject to scrutiny from the European Court of Human Rights. In 2008, the court ruled that the UK's retention of DNA samples from individuals who had not been convicted of a crime violated Article 8(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights. As a result, the UK changed its laws to limit the retention of such samples.
In conclusion, the retention of DNA samples by police can be seen as both a valuable tool in the detection and prevention of criminal activities, and a potential violation of human rights. While there are concerns regarding the protection of individual privacy and the potential for discrimination, there are also safeguards in place to ensure that these concerns are addressed.
Ultimately, the retention of DNA samples by police should be weighed against the potential benefits, and any infringement of human rights should be minimized and justified. With careful consideration and attention to individual rights, the retention of DNA samples can be a valuable tool for law enforcement, without compromising the fundamental rights of individuals.
