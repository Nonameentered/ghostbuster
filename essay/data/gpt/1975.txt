Eggs are considered as one of the most commonly consumed animal-based protein sources globally. As the world's population continues to grow, so does the demand for eggs. Hence, egg production is a significant segment of the agriculture industry worldwide. There are several systems and techniques used to produce eggs, each with advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this essay is to examine, compare and contrast different egg production systems, recommend the most appropriate system for use in the UK, and consider the demands of consumers, economic constraints, environmental and welfare issues.
The most established production system for eggs is the conventional battery cage system. This system involves confining hens to a small wired cage where they lay eggs. This production system is low cost and requires minimal space and labor. However, hens in battery cages have limited access to food and water and cannot engage in natural behaviors like dust bathing, perching, and foraging. Additionally, the proximity of hens in battery cages increases the risk of disease transmission. The high level of stress and disease susceptibility reduces the egg production rate, making it less efficient.
The second production system is the enriched colony cage system. This system allows for a significant increase in space allowance than the conventional system, providing the hen with more space to move around, perch, dust-bathe and lay eggs in a nesting area. This system also provides perches for chickens to rest on and privacy for egg laying. Enriched colony cage system provides a more favorable environment for hens, resulting in better individual welfare and egg quality. However, while this system is better than the conventional battery cage system, it still has some limitations. As with the conventional system, the proximity of hens in an enriched colony cage system increases the risk of disease transmission. Additionally, it is comparatively expensive to build, which may not make it financially viable for some producers.
Another production system is the free-range system. Free-range egg production houses hens who have access to outdoor areas to engage in natural behaviours like dust-bathing, perching and foraging. Hens in free-range systems have more space, can move in and out of the coop, and access food and water when required. A significantly larger space compared to the battery cage or enriched colony system is required. Despite the added benefits of a higher-performing bird and higher egg production rate, this system often has a lower Return on Investment (ROI), and producers also face risks associated with weather, predators and disease transmission.
The final production system is the organic egg production system. This system is very similar to the free-range system, but it involves much stricter regulations. The food given to hens in organic chickens is pesticide and herbicide-free, with no genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Additionally, organic standards specify that there will be no forced molting using starvation to egg-laying hens. Organic eggs must come from hens that have lived in an organically managed environment, have free or unrestricted access to the outdoors, and are not kept in crowded or confined cages. Due to these stricter requirements, organic eggs are more expensive than other types of eggs. 
Taking into account the demands of consumers, economic constraints, environmental and welfare issues, the system most suitable for the UK is the enriched colony cage system. This system provides enough space for the hens to move, perch, dust bathe and lay eggs in a nesting area while providing better welfare attributes when compared to the conventional cage system. Additionally, the system is not as expensive to construct as free-range or organic systems, resulting in better profitability for producers. Similarly, the system improves biosecurity by reducing exposure to disease and pathogens, enhancing the effectiveness of disease control measures.
In conclusion, egg production systems have different advantages and disadvantages. The battery cage system is inexpensive, but at the cost of limited welfare provision, which affects egg production rates. The enriched colony cage system is relatively less expensive than free-range or organic systems while having better welfare attributes, resulting in better egg quality when compared to the battery cage system. The free-range system and the organic egg production system both have numerous environmental and health benefits but have significant price tags. Taking into account the demands of consumers, economic constraints, environmental and welfare concerns, the enriched colony cage system is the most appropriate system for use in the UK. However, there must be continuous research and development to implement best practices for animal welfare, profitability, and environmental sustainability in egg production.
