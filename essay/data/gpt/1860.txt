Bram Stoker's novel Dracula was published in 1897, during the late Victorian era when women's roles and expectations were undergoing significant changes. The New Woman movement was gaining momentum, and women were beginning to assert their independence and challenge traditional gender roles. In Dracula, Stoker presents a complex and sometimes contradictory portrayal of female sexuality that reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of Victorian society regarding the New Woman. This essay will explore the ways in which Stoker's representation of female sexuality in Dracula reflects the attitudes towards the New Woman movement in Victorian society.
One of the most prominent female characters in Dracula is Mina Harker, who is engaged to the novel's protagonist, Jonathan Harker. Mina is portrayed as intelligent, resourceful, and independent, and her relationship with Jonathan is presented as one of equality and mutual respect. However, Mina's sexuality is also a source of anxiety and uncertainty for the male characters in the novel. Throughout the novel, there are several instances where Mina's sexual desires are hinted at, but these desires are always portrayed as dangerous and potentially threatening.
For example, in Chapter 21, Mina writes in her journal about her attraction to Dracula: "I know now, my dear Jonathan, that you have been my lover, but not my husband" (Stoker 238). This passage suggests that Mina has had sexual feelings for Dracula, which creates apprehension for the other characters, especially Jonathan. Later in the chapter, when Mina meets Dracula in person, her desire for him intensifies, and she calls him "my love" (Stoker 246). This scene is clearly meant to be sexually charged, but it is also portrayed as dangerous and scary. After Mina and Dracula's encounter, Mina becomes more submissive and weaker, which is a common trope in Victorian literature that suggests that female sexuality is dangerous and must be repressed.
Another female character in Dracula who represents the New Woman is Lucy Westenra. Lucy is initially portrayed as a conventional Victorian woman who embodies the ideal of femininity. She is beautiful, sweet, and innocent, and she is engaged to Arthur Holmwood, one of Jonathan Harker's friends. However, Lucy's sexuality becomes more pronounced after she is bitten by Dracula and becomes a vampire. As a vampire, Lucy is portrayed as hypersexualized and sexually aggressive. She seduces multiple men and seems to revel in her newfound sexual power.
Lucy's transformation from a virtuous Victorian lady to a sexually liberated vampire can be seen as a reflection of the anxiety that Victorian society felt about the New Woman. The New Woman movement challenged traditional gender roles and advocated for women's sexual liberation, which was seen as a threat to the patriarchal order. Lucy's sexual liberation is presented as something that is frightening and dangerous, and it ultimately leads to her demise. By contrast, Mina's sexual desires are portrayed as a source of anxiety and uncertainty, but they are ultimately repressed and sublimated into her love for Jonathan.
Stoker's representation of female sexuality in Dracula reflects the ambivalence and uncertainty that Victorian society felt about the New Woman. On the one hand, Mina and Lucy represent a new ideal of femininity that is intelligent, independent, and assertive. They challenge the traditional gender roles that confined Victorian women to the domestic sphere and denied them agency and autonomy. On the other hand, their sexuality is portrayed as something that is threatening and potentially destructive. Mina's desire for Dracula and Lucy's transformation into a sexualized vampire both suggest that female sexuality is something that must be controlled and repressed, rather than celebrated and embraced.
In conclusion, Bram Stoker's representation of female sexuality in Dracula reflects the attitudes towards the New Woman movement in Victorian society. Through characters like Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra, Stoker presents a complex and sometimes contradictory portrayal of female sexuality that reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of Victorian society about women's changing roles and expectations. While Mina and Lucy embody a new ideal of femininity that is intelligent and independent, their sexuality is portrayed as something that is scary and potentially destructive. Stoker's representation of female sexuality in Dracula reflects the ambivalence and uncertainty that Victorian society felt about the New Woman, and it reveals the complexities of gender roles and expectations during this time period.
