Vertebrate limb development is a complicated process involving a plethora of signaling pathways, genes, and morphogenetic events. There are various models used in studies of vertebrate limb development, with mice and chicken embryos being two of the most commonly utilized ones. While both models have their advantages and disadvantages, researchers often have to weigh the costs and benefits of each when deciding which model to use for their studies.
One of the advantages of using mice as a model for the study of vertebrate limb development is their genetic similarity to humans, which allows for the investigation of conserved genetic pathways involved in limb formation and patterning. Mice embryos are also readily available and are easy to manipulate, which enables researchers to conduct experiments involving gene editing and other techniques. Moreover, mice have relatively short gestation periods, and their embryos develop relatively quickly and are readily observable, making longitudinal studies feasible.
On the other hand, using mice as a model also has some disadvantages. For instance, the limb buds of mice are significantly smaller than those of humans, which may limit the extent to which researchers can investigate limb development processes. Furthermore, mice are not an ancient animal, which could impact the study of evolutionarily conserved pathways. Also, the effects of genetic manipulation on mouse embryos may sometimes be unpredictable, and it may not be possible to generalize the results obtained to humans.
Chicken embryos are another model used in studies of vertebrate limb development. Chicken embryos are ideal for the study of early limb bud formation and differentiation because their limb buds are large and easily accessible. They also develop embryos outside the mother's body, allowing for more straightforward experimental manipulation. Studies of chicken development can trace how different genes interact at various stages in the developmental process. The results of the chicken studies may provide new insights into vertebrate evolution and the comparative development of various organisms.
However, like mice, chicken embryos also have some limitations when used to study limb development. For example, the genetic similarity between chickens and humans is lower than that between mice and humans, making the investigation of conserved genetic pathways more challenging. The limb buds of chickens may also differ significantly from those of mammals, which may limit the ability to extrapolate findings to humans.
In both mice and chicken embryos, the formation and patterning of limb buds rely on the interaction of multiple signaling pathways. One of the most important signaling pathways during limb bud formation is the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathway. FGF signaling acts early in limb bud formation, initiating the expression of key genes that direct limb patterning. FGF signaling also regulates the proliferation and survival of cells in the limb bud.
Another key signaling pathway in limb bud formation is the Wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) pathway. WNT signaling has a high degree of spatiotemporal regulation and is necessary for limb bud outgrowth. The WNT pathway is also involved in the initiation of dorsal-ventral polarity in the developing limb.
Several genes are critical for the formation and patterning of limb buds. One such group of genes are the T-box (Tbx) genes. These genes play crucial roles in limb formation by regulating the expression of other genes involved in limb development. Tbx5 is important in developing the forelimb and regulates the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Tbx4 is involved in hindlimb formation and is necessary for signaling by the mesenchymal factor Fgf10.
Another gene involved in limb development is Lmx1b, which encodes a transcription factor that is required for maintaining dorsal identity in limb buds. Lmx1b is responsible for the induction of dorsal cells in limb buds and regulates the expression of key signaling molecules, including Bmp4 and Wnt7a.
In conclusion, the choice of model for studies of vertebrate limb development is dictated by the research question, available resources, and other factors. While mice and chicken embryos are common models used to study limb development, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Understanding how FGF and WNT signaling pathways contribute to limb bud formation and patterning, as well as the expression of genes such as Tbx and Lmx1b, could unlock new insights into how the vertebrate limb develops.
