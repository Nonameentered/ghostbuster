Rene Descartes and David Hume were two prominent philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively, who explored the concept of scepticism in their writing. While both philosophers were interested in the problem of knowledge, their approaches were significantly different. Thus, this essay aims to compare and contrast Descartes and Hume's approaches to scepticism. It will also examine the distinction between 'doubt,' 'suspension of judgement,' and 'false beliefs' and the importance of the requirement of indubitability in knowledge. Additionally, it will analyze Hume's argument for the existence of the external world and explore Descartes' method of casting doubt on both reason and perception. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach will be explained, and their reliance on assumptions about human nature will be examined.
Firstly, Descartes and Hume had different approaches to scepticism. Descartes, in his philosophy, adopted a method of radical doubt to achieve indubitable knowledge. Descartes attempted to strip everything he knew of their foundations and rebuild them empirically. Descartes believed that the senses, emotions, and previously held beliefs were untrustworthy (Davies, 2000). He argued that the only way to accumulate knowledge was by having clear and distinct ideas, which are beyond doubt. Descartes identified these clear and distinct ideas to be the cornerstone of knowledge, and he believed that they could be a starting point for genuinely understanding the world.
In contrast, Hume's approach to scepticism was more empirical, adapting to the critical philosophy of John Locke. Locke argued that people should base their beliefs only on the evidence that they have, not reasoning or imagination. Hume continued this idea and argued that the foundation of knowledge is based on the evidence of the senses, which is often only probabilistic (Pasnau, 2021). Hume believed that knowledge should not be deduced from a priori principles, as he viewed these principles to be lacking evidence. Furthermore, Hume believed that an individual could never be experientially certain of the truth of a proposition.
Moreover, understanding the distinctions between 'doubt,' 'suspension of judgment,' and 'false beliefs' is essential in comparing and contrasting Descartes and Hume's approaches to scepticism. For Descartes, doubt was an active process that involved destroying existing beliefs with radical skepticism. There was no distinction between true and false beliefs in Descartes' philosophy, he believed, everything was doubtful (Chen, 2020). In contrast, Hume distinguished between false beliefs, suspension of judgment, and doubt concerning the existence or reality of something. Hume suggested that individuals should withhold assent when the evidence for or against a proposition is insufficient. Hume sought to address the problem of uncertainty by arguing that we should suspend judgment until sufficient evidence is attained.
Moreover, the significance of the requirement of indubitability in knowledge must also be considered when comparing and contrasting Descartes and Hume's approaches to scepticism. Descartes believed that it was possible to achieve indubitable knowledge through the use of the method of radical doubt. Descartes aimed to arrive at knowledge that was devoid of all uncertainty by utilizing clear and distinct ideas which would enable him to build a foundation for genuine knowledge. In contrast, Hume did not think that there was such a thing as indubitable knowledge. Hume suggested that knowledge is only supported by particular experiences and categorical judgments based on probable reasoning. He claimed that our knowledge was contingent upon empirical evidence and could be revised at any time resulting in knowledge being probabilistic (Kasai, 2016).
Examining Hume's argument for the existence of the external world and Descartes' method of casting doubt on both reason and perception is also of importance when exploring their approaches to scepticism. Hume, in "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding," argued that there is no necessary connection between cause and effect. Hume claimed that certain knowledge about the world was impossible because we were incapable of ever observing causality operating. Hume questioned how we might demonstrate the existence of an external world. Indeed, he maintained that we exclusively have and recognize our perceptions and concluded that any external world was nothing more than a construction of our minds (Hume, 2004).
On the other hand, Descartes, in his "Meditations," aimed to doubt everything, including the existence of an external world, as well as his own existence. Descartes believed that all of reality was created from within his own mind and that anything doubtable was false. Only those things which were indubitable were to be acknowledged as factual. He began by doubting his senses and argued that they were unreliable because they were susceptible to deception. Descartes believed that the only way to access reality was through reason, which required that individuals develop their mental faculties by putting their original presuppositions aside. This would enable them to have indubitable knowledge of everything around them (Cottingham, 2019).
Lastly, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and their reliance on assumptions about human nature should be explored. Descartes' approach to skepticism, grounded in his method of radical doubt, was a strength in that it enabled him to disencumber himself of the dogmatic prejudices that he may have held. In doing so, he was able to set down a strong foundation based on clear and distinct ideas. Nevertheless, the disadvantages of his approach are that his recommendations are sometimes considered extreme and ridiculous. Moreover, the strength of Hume's approach was that it relied on empirical study and observation of the world. Hume appealed to human nature, claiming that people only have access to perceptions and impressions. Nevertheless, an apparent weakness of his approach is that it resulted in scepticism and relativism, leading to the conclusion that we can have no knowledge of the external world (Ashworth & Walker, 2012).
In conclusion, Descartes and Hume were two prominent philosophers who faced the problem of skepticism. Through their work, they came up with different approaches to resolve the problem of knowledge with Descartes pulling towards a method of radical doubt and Hume towards empiricism and evidence-based reasoning. This essay revealed the distinctions between 'doubt,' 'suspension of judgement,' and 'false beliefs,' as well as the importance of the requirement of indubitability in knowledge. Additionally, Hume's argument for the existence of the external world and Descartes' approach to casting doubt on both reason and perception has been expounded. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach were explained, as well as their dependence on assumptions about human nature. Though both methods have their challenges, the ability to question and examine the world is a necessary milestone towards discovering new ways to perceive and relate to our environment.
