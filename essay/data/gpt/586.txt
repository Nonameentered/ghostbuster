The issue of masculinity is one that has been at the center of numerous scholarly, cultural, and political debates. Among Afro-American men, there appears to be a particular crisis of masculinity, a phenomenon that has drawn the attention of scholars such as Orlando Patterson. In his work, especially his book 'Rituals of Blood', Patterson argues that the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men is rooted in their experience of slavery. He links this experience of slavery to the disruption of the Afro-American male's traditional role as family head, provider, and protector. This essay explores Patterson's argument, its effects, and its criticisms, as well as the ways in which his later essays have challenged or complicated his earlier analyses.
Patterson starts his argument by identifying the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men, which he claims is starkly different from that of other American men. He contends that while white American men experience a sense of emasculation resulting from various societal and cultural shifts, including feminism, Afro-American men's crisis stems from a particular historical experience. In his book, 'Rituals of Blood', Patterson argues that the slave trade and slavery disrupted the traditional roles of the Afro-American man as a family head, provider, and protector. He asserts that these traditional roles, which were fashioned during pre-colonial African societies where men wore protector and provider, were upset by the slave trade. During this period, men were captured and separated from their families and were subjected to long periods of confinement, humiliation, fear, and violence. 
For Patterson, this dislocation of an Afro-American man's traditional roles has contributed to their current crisis of masculinity, which is marked by a sense of powerlessness, inadequacy, and lack of agency. Due to the long history of slavery and the subsequent exclusion from the mainstream society, Afro-American men lack access to the conventional criteria of masculinity, such as power, wealth, and status. This lack of access has perpetuated a sense of powerlessness and resignation, which Patterson argues, hinders Afro-American men's ability to act confidently and to assert themselves.
Furthermore, Patterson outlines the effects of this crisis of masculinity on Afro-American men, indicating that it has contributed to their high levels of criminality, drug use, family breakdown, and low social mobility. According to Patterson, the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men is an epidemic that affects the black community and the wider US society. He notes that the high levels of criminality and drug use among black men are linked to their sense of hopelessness and powerlessness, leading them to seek solace in drugs and crime. Additionally, their low social mobility is as a result of their lack of access to traditional pathways of success, which require affiliation to mainstream culture and its value system.
Patterson's argument about the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men has been both influential and controversial. Some scholars have praised Patterson for shedding light on a crucial aspect of Afro-American men's experience that has not received adequate attention. Patterson's assertion that the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men stems from their experience of slavery was groundbreaking, as it provided a way to understand the trajectory of the lives of many Afro-American men. Other scholars, however, have criticized Patterson's work. They argue that his claim that the crisis of masculinity affects Afro-American men exclusively is an oversimplification of a more complex issue. Furthermore, they contend that his argument generalizes the experiences of a whole race of people, ignoring the socioeconomic and cultural variations within the black community.
In addition to the criticisms of his work, Patterson's later essays have sought to challenge or complicate his earlier analyses. For instance, in his 1991 essay, "The Paradoxes of Afro-American Culture," Patterson argues that Afro-American culture is not a monolithic entity, as he had previously suggested. Instead, he asserts that Afro-American culture is characterized by a paradoxical tension between two competing traditions; the Black identity movement, and the African heritage movement. Patterson suggests that both traditions contribute to the Afro-American community's ability to adapt to change, but also contribute to their internal conflicts. 
This essay has examined Orlando Patterson's argument about the crisis of masculinity among Afro-American men. His analysis links the Afro-American man's current crisis of masculinity to their experience of slavery, which disrupted their traditional roles as family head, provider, and protector. The effects of this crisis have contributed to high levels of criminality, drug use, family breakdown, and low social mobility. While Patterson's argument highlights a crucial aspect of the Afro-American men's experience, it has also been criticized for oversimplifying a complex issue and generalizing the experiences of a whole race of people. Ultimately, Patterson's later essays have sought to challenge or complicate his earlier analyses, indicating the need for a more nuanced approach to issues of race, gender, and identity.
