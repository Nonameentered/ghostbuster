The practice of medicine has been an essential part of human experience for thousands of years. As societies have evolved and the understanding of the human body has advanced, the role of medical professionals has become more vital. However, even as medicine has become a formal profession, the impact on women has been enormous. Women have faced significant challenges in accessing medical care, becoming physicians and receiving fair representation. The growth of medicine as a profession has altered the understanding and role of women in society. In this essay, I will explore the implications for women of the rise of medicine as a profession, particularly in terms of gender and class.
One of the significant implications for women of the rise of medicine as a profession is the impact on their access to medical care. Prior to the development of formal medical institutions, women had traditionally relied on midwives and healers to provide medical care. However, as medicine became an increasingly professionalized field, women were pushed to the margins. Since men dominated the medical profession, women were often denied access to critical medical care. As a result, women's health care remained subordinate to the health care of men.
Additionally, the gendered expectations of medical professionals impacted women's access to medical care. Society had thought that the primary role of women was reproduction, leaving women's health concerns mostly unaddressed. As a result, the medical profession was far less knowledgeable about many of the health issues that typically affected women. A lack of understanding of women's bodies and health led to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.
Furthermore, class also played a significant role in the quality of medical care received by women. The feminist movement addressed the social inequities of healthcare, and it was said that women's liberation was interlinked with the struggle for better health care. In developing countries, women's access to medical care is contingent on class status. Better-educated and wealthier women are more likely to have access to adequate medical care. Poorer women may not be able to afford proper medical care or may be reliant on inadequate health care facilities.
Moreover, the growth of medicine as a profession had a significant impact on women who wanted to enter the medical profession themselves. Women had to contend with institutionalized discrimination in medical education. Historically, women had been entirely excluded from medical schools, but as medical education expanded in the 19th century, women were permitted to attend. However, there were still significant obstacles that they faced in education and practice.
Firstly, women experienced discrimination in medical education, which presented a significant barrier to entry. It was challenging for women to gain admission to medical schools because many institutions refused to accept them. Even when they were accepted, they were held to higher standards than male students. Women had to work harder and better than their male counterparts to prove their worthiness.
Secondly, the gendered expectations of the medical establishment also impacted women's entry to the medical profession. Society viewed the role of women as homemakers and caretakers, while men were the primary providers. Therefore, women who pursued medical careers were often viewed with suspicion by their male colleagues and society. They were not considered "real" doctors but rather treated as inferior and irrelevant.
Finally, the growth of medicine as a profession had profound implications for gender roles in society. Women were now entering a traditionally male-dominated profession, and thus, the gender dynamic was drastically shifting. Women physicians challenged the constructed notion of masculinity in medicine, which led to significant resistance from male counterparts. Men were used as the sole image of the medical profession, and it was proposed that women would damage that image, that they did not have the physical or emotional fortitude to handle the rigors of the job. Women who became physicians faced discrimination from their male colleagues and their patients.
Moreover, Women physicians encountered considerable resistance in the form of derogatory stereotypes and other prejudicial behaviors. A survey of male physicians about their attitude towards female colleagues found that 18% believed that women were less competent than men, and 8% believed they were less dedicated (Ter Meulen, 1997). The same study found that male physicians were less likely to accept referrals from women and that women physicians earned less than male physicians (Ter Meulen, 1997).
In conclusion, the rise of medicine as a profession has had significant implications for women in terms of gender and class. Women have struggled with access to medical care, entering the medical profession and receiving fair representation. Gendered expectations of the medical profession led to a disregard for women's health concerns, which has been limited progress for the female health-care movement. Women wishing to become physicians have encountered institutionalized discrimination and stereotyping, while gender roles in society have faced significant changes. For a society to move forward, gender equality is a must in the medical profession and, henceforth the provision and importance of women's health care should be given a fair and equal consideration.
