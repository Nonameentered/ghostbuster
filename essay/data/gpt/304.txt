The modern state is a complex entity that has been theorized by numerous philosophers over time. Among them, Thomas Hobbes stands as one of the most influential political thinkers. His seminal work, “Leviathan,” has provided new insights into the nature of the state and its necessary functions. Modernity, as a condition of contemporary life, has an impact on Hobbes’ social contract and the legitimacy of the sovereign's power. In this essay, I will explore the modernity of Hobbes' “Leviathan” in terms of its concept of the social contract and the legitimacy of the sovereign's power, comparing it with the political writings of Max Weber and discussing differing views of the modern state.
Hobbes' Leviathan presents a unique perspective on the nature of the state and its role in the lives of individuals. Hobbes argues that the state is a necessary entity that should be formed through a social contract. According to Hobbes, life in a state of nature would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” To avoid this, individuals must give up some of their rights in exchange for protection and security.
Hobbes’ concept of the social contract is rooted in his view of human nature. In his opinion, humans are egoistic beings who seek to maximize their self-interest. As a result, they need a powerful sovereign to prevent them from acting on their instincts and harming one another. This sovereign is established through a social contract, where individuals give up their “right of nature” to the sovereign in exchange for protection and security.
This social contract is what legitimizes the sovereign’s power. The sovereign, in Hobbes’ view, is the absolute ruler of the state, with the power to punish and reward individuals as necessary. By giving up their rights to the sovereign, individuals have agreed to abide by his or her laws and decisions. This exchange forms the basis for the legitimacy of the sovereign's power.
Hobbes’ concept of the social contract and the legitimacy of the sovereign’s power have significant implications for the modern state. The modern state, unlike the early modern one, has a monopoly on the use of force and is responsible for providing public goods such as education and healthcare. It is also responsible for maintaining law and order and protecting the rights of its citizens.
Max Weber, another prominent political thinker, has contributed to the understanding of the modern state. In Weber’s view, the modern state is a bureaucratic entity that is characterized by a division of labor, hierarchy, and rules and regulations. Weber believed that the modern state is efficient and rational, and that its bureaucracy is essential for its functioning.
Weber's theory of the modern state differs significantly from Hobbes' Leviathan. Weber’s state is primarily bureaucratic, whereas Hobbes' state is primarily a sovereign power. While Hobbes believed that the sovereign had absolute power over the state, Weber believed that the modern state was characterized by a separation of powers. In Weber's view, the state should be divided into different branches, each with its own tasks and responsibilities.
The differing views of the modern state in Hobbes' “Leviathan” and Weber’s political thought highlight the challenges facing contemporary societies. While Hobbes' focus was on the sovereignty of the state, Weber's focus was on the bureaucracy of the state. These differing views have a significant impact on government policies, ethics and morality in the society.
One of the most significant impacts of Hobbes' social contract theory is the role of the citizen in the modern state. According to Hobbes, individuals give up their rights to the sovereign in exchange for protection and safety. This exchange means that the citizen has a responsibility to the state. They are required to follow the laws established by the sovereign and to support the state's efforts to establish law and order. This responsibility forms the basis for the modern citizen's duty to the state.
Weber, on the other hand, believed that the modern citizen has a responsibility to the state bureaucracy. Citizens are required to follow rules established by a bureaucracy that is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the state. This responsibility forms the basis for the modern citizen's duty to the state bureaucracy.
The different views, however, pose some challenges to the legitimacy of the modern state. Weber's bureaucratic state places a heavy emphasis on rules and regulations, leaving less room for individual autonomy and discretion. This approach has led to criticism from those who believe that bureaucracy is incompatible with democracy.
Hobbes' “Leviathan,” on the other hand, places a heavy emphasis on the sovereign's power to protect and provide security to individuals. This has led to criticism from those who believe that Hobbes' state is authoritarian and lacks checks and balances.
However, the two approaches also reveal some of the strengths of the modern state. Hobbes' emphasis on the sovereignty of the state provides a strong foundation for the protection of individual rights and the establishment of law and order. Weber's emphasis on bureaucracy provides a framework for the efficient delivery of public goods and services.
In conclusion, Hobbes' “Leviathan” and Weber’s political writings both provide comprehensive and relevant insights into the modern state. The two approaches, however, have different concepts of the modern state, which present challenges and opportunities for contemporary societies. Hobbes' focus on the sovereignty of the state emphasizes protection and security, while Weber's focus on bureaucracy emphasizes efficiency and rationality. The different views of the state present challenges to the legitimacy of the modern state, ethics and morality in the society. Nevertheless, the two approaches also demonstrate the strengths of the modern state.
