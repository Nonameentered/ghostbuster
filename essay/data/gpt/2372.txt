Stokes Drift and Its Difference from Wind-Driven Currents
The oceans are vast and complex bodies of water that are affected by various physical processes. One of these processes is the occurrence of currents in the oceans, which can result from different forces. Among these forces is the wind, which is a significant driver of the ocean's surface currents. However, the wind-induced currents are not the only currents that exist in the ocean, as there are also other types such as the Stokes drift. In this essay, we will discuss what Stokes drift is, how it differs from wind-driven currents, and how computer programming can be used to analyze and model the movement of water masses in the ocean.
Stokes drift is a type of wave-driven current that occurs in the ocean. This current is named after the Irish mathematician and physicist George Gabriel Stokes, who discovered it in the 19th century. It occurs due to the formation of surface waves, which result from the interaction between wind and water. When waves are formed on the ocean's surface, they generate a net water displacement in a particular direction, causing the water particles to move in a circular orbital motion. This motion, in turn, creates a horizontal current known as Stokes drift. Therefore, Stokes drift is a type of wave-driven, long-term current that transports sea surface waters in a particular direction.
On the other hand, wind-driven currents are currents that are caused by the movement of air over the ocean surface. The wind exerts a force on the ocean surface, causing the water particles to move in a direction. This movement is what produces ocean surface currents. The wind-driven currents can occur both at the surface and in the water depth, and they can be both long-term and short-term in duration. Wind-driven currents can have a significant impact on the ocean's circulation, especially the upper layers, and can also impact atmospheric patterns.
One of the significant differences between Stokes drift and the wind-driven currents is that the former is not confined to the ocean's surface. Stokes drift extends beneath the surface of the ocean to a depth equal to half of the wavelength of the waves that generate it. Conversely, wind-driven currents only affect the water column's upper layers and are usually limited to depths of up to 100 meters. Furthermore, the Stokes drift is continuous and can persist even after the wind has stopped blowing, while wind-driven currents are only significant when the wind is present.
Moreover, the Stokes drift is generally a weak current that moves at a much slower velocity compared to wind-driven currents. The velocity of the Stokes drift current is proportional to the wave amplitude and the wavelength. Typically, the average velocity of the Stokes drift is around 5-10 centimeters per second, while the wind-driven currents can have velocities of up to several meters per second.
Computer programming can be used to model and analyze the movement of water masses in the ocean, including the Stokes drift. One of the most common methods used in computer modeling of ocean currents is the use of numerical models. These models simulate the ocean's physical dynamics by taking into account parameters such as water temperature, salinity, currents, and wind conditions. Numerical models require a vast amount of data, and programming skills to develop and run the simulations are necessary.
The use of numerical models can help researchers gain insights into oceanic processes such as the Stokes drift. The models allow scientists to predict the movement of water masses, determine the impact of different oceanic forces, and identify the physical processes that contribute to the ocean's currents. By modeling the Stokes drift, researchers can study the effects of different parameters on the current, including the wave amplitude, depth, and direction of propagation.
The amplitude of the wave field affects the total drift of water. At a given depth, the Stokes drift is proportional to the wave height of the waves, meaning that the larger the amplitude, the stronger the current's direction. In contrast, wind-driven currents are proportional to the wind's speed, with the current's direction being dependent on the wind's direction and speed. Therefore, an increase in wind speed does not translate to a proportional increase in the current's velocity. Consequently, the larger the amplitude of the waves, the more substantial the Stokes drift component of the total current.
At the same time, oceanic waves can interact with the wind-driven currents to influence overall oceanic circulation. For example, strong waves can exert pressure on the upper layers of the ocean, resulting in the mixing of water masses. The mixing can result in the formation of new currents, which can merge with existing currents to form complex oceanic circulation patterns. Consequently, understanding and modeling the effects of different parameters on the Stokes drift can help researchers gain insight into these complex oceanic processes.
In conclusion, the Stokes drift and wind-driven currents are two distinct types of oceanic currents that result from different forces. While wind-driven currents are mainly confined to the surface layers of the ocean and are proportional to the wind speed, Stokes drift is generated by oceanic waves and can extend below the surface. Computer programming can be used to model and analyze oceanic currents, including the Stokes drift, providing insights into the physical processes driving oceanic circulation. On the other hand, the amplitude of the wave field affects the total drift of water, with larger wave amplitudes resulting in stronger Stokes drift components of the total current.
