Corporate killing refers to the death of individuals resulting from the criminal negligence of corporations. It is an all-too-common occurrence globally, and the UK is no exception. The call for reforms aimed at ensuring better accountability for management failures resulting in the death of employees and other members of the public has led to the proposal of a new offence of corporate killing. The proposed changes seek to change the law's present limitations and inadequacies stemming from weaknesses in existing legislation, such as the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007.
The proposed new offence of corporate killing is part of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 which holds corporations accountable for management failure leading to death. The law is meant to act as a deterrent for corporations that may have been overlooking health and safety issues for their employees and the public. The proposed changes to the law would make it easier to sentence individuals responsible for fatalities resulting from corporate negligence.
The death of Vince, an employee who fell from scaffolding on a building site operated by BloggsBuild Limited, provides an excellent case study for examining how the proposed changes would affect the culpability of individuals and organizations for similar incidents. Under existing legislation, it is challenging to hold individuals accountable for incidents such as Vince's death - the law focuses solely on corporate entities. However, the new proposed offence would hold both individuals and corporations responsible, and it would be easier to charge individuals with corporate killing. Therefore, if it's discovered that BloggsBuild did not act responsibly to protect its employees or the public and Vince's death resulted from it, it would be liable for the new offence of corporate killing. Simultaneously, individuals responsible for the victim's death, such as the supervisor or other employees, would be equally punished as they would have contributed to the crime. 
These proposed changes highlight the government's commitment to ensuring corporate accountability for management failures. By holding individuals just as accountable for corporate negligence as the corporations themselves, there will be a reduction in instances where companies make decisions that negatively impact employee and public safety, resulting in fatalities. The new offence aims to promote a culture of safety in corporations, ensuring that companies prioritise safety alongside profit-making.
However, the proposed changes may not be enough to ensure full corporate accountability as there are still gaps or limitations in the law that need to be addressed. For instance, the offence's broad definition may be challenging to apply in practice, and there may be instances where companies need to be held to account for causation and not just the effect of management failure. The lack of a clear threshold for punishment under the new offence may also be problematic. The current Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 has only resulted in years of ineffective enforcement. The new proposals therefore should talk directly of the enforcement that should follow if the legislation is enacted.
Another issue is that the currently proposed change only addresses incidents resulting in fatalities, yet there are cases where corporate negligence has led to severe injuries, causing permanent disability or disfigurement. While these cases may attract compensation claims, they fall outside the proposed new offence's ambit, and those responsible may go unpunished. It is crucial to consider other forms of corporate failures causing harm to employees and public health.
The proposed new offence of corporate killing is a significant step towards ensuring corporate accountability for management failure in cases that have often gone unpunished in the past. The inclusion of individuals in the new law ensures shared responsibility in taking preventative measures to promote a culture of safety in corporations. However, the gaps and inadequacies in the proposed law must be addressed and filling in these loopholes must be outlined in the proposals. By addressing these limitations, the law will be more effective in ensuring full corporate accountability. Such reforms will go a long way in promoting a culture of safety in the corporate world, reducing fatalities and injuries resulting from corporate negligence.. 
In conclusion, the proposed changes to the law on corporate manslaughter can only be effective if they are reliably enforced. Proper awareness needs to be created over the changes, which will act as a warning to companies to adhere to their obligations in workplace safety. The legislative measures proposed for new offenses of corporate killing should be taken as a basis for all regulations that will make companies more aware of the need to take proper measures in workplace safety. By effectively enforcing and making changes that will prompt companies to understand safety regulationâ€™s significance, death or injury from corporate negligence will significantly decrease. Therefore, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction.
