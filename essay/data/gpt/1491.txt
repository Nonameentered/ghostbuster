Introduction
Charles Dickens, in his novels, gives immense importance to the portrayal of London as a significant character. Writing during a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization, Dickens's works inevitably reflect the social, economic, and political changes that defined the city and its inhabitants. His perspectives on London rely heavily on his personal experiences and observations of its urban development and the challenges facing its population during the 19th century. Through vivid descriptions and realistic portrayals, Dickens presents London as a place of contradictions - filled with beauty and squalor, opulence and poverty, and rife with social inequality. In this essay, we will examine Charles Dickens’s use of London as a character in his novels and explore how modern literature and films inform a contemporary understanding of the city. We will analyze the evolution of Dickens's ideas and their role in the composition process, referencing specific sources and proposed rewrites.
Dickens’s Portrayal of London as a Character
London plays a central character in Dickens's works, and its portrayal changes with each novel. It is shown as a city of contrasting landscapes, one studded with bustling streets, businesses, and factories and another filled with the misery and hardship of its people. Dickens illustrates the divide between the rich and the poor in his novels, highlighting the slums and the filthy living conditions of the working-class, and the luxurious homes of the wealthy.
In Oliver Twist, Dickens bewails the tragedy of the poor and homeless in the crowded streets of London. He describes the darkness and squalor of the city and the misery of the people. The setting of the novel is an apt representation of the squalid conditions that the urban poor had to endure. In the novel, London is portrayed as a place where people struggle to eke out an existence, and the city becomes an essential aspect of the story’s character and development.
Similarly, in Bleak House, he portrays London as a city of contrasts, with the wealthy living in the affluent areas, while the poor are left to suffer in congested, disease-ridden areas. He uses the city to shed light on the inequity and injustice in society, the deplorable conditions of the poverty-stricken masses, and the greed and corruption of the wealthy.
In A Tale of Two Cities, the city takes on both a historical and a symbolic significance, representing the duality of human nature and the struggle between good and evil. More so, the novel captures the horrors of the French Revolution that occurred at the time, using the city as a representation of the chaos, brutality, and destruction. Dickens also uses the city to show how different individuals respond to the same events, highlighting the divides between the privileged and the underprivileged.
Evolution of Dickens’s Ideas and their Role in the Composition Process
Dickens's perception of London evolved throughout his literary career. His earlier books were more focused on depicting the physical and social aspects of the city, while his later novels, such as Great Expectations, portrayed the effects of the city on human development and personal morals.
In Great Expectations, Dickens uses London as a metaphor for life and its pitfalls. The city is a place of change, growth, and opportunity where people can forge their destinies. However, he also portrays London as a place of corruption, where wealth and power are obtained through nefarious means.
In his later works, such as Little Dorrit and Our Mutual Friend, Dickens focuses more on the internalization of the city's impact on characters, exploring the psychological and emotional toll it takes on individuals, both rich and poor. For example, in Little Dorrit, Dickens portrays the different psychological effects that the city has on its characters; the wealthy and the powerful are complacent and greedy, while the poor are forced to navigate its depressing and oppressive nature.
Conclusion
Charles Dickens's literary works laid a foundation for contemporary understanding of London. He paints the city as an active character by highlighting both its physical and emotional characteristics, showing it serves as a metaphor for the struggle between good and evil, and for the impact of urban living on individuals. While there have been several changes to the city's buildings, social environment, and the lifestyles of the inhabitants, modern authors and filmmakers have continued to use Dickens's model as a basis for their portrayals of London. Through their work, audiences can understand how the city has evolved over time and the impact its changing dynamics have on the people who inhabit it.
