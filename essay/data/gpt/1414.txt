Introduction:
Feminism has brought about a shift in how we perceive gender roles and relationships. Women's experiences, perspectives, and knowledge production have finally been given the attention they deserve. Feminist researchers aim to investigate how gender is constructed, how inequality is reproduced, and how it can be challenged. However, feminist research is not without its challenges and issues, which can pose barriers to collecting and interpreting data. Marjorie Shostak's Nisa: The Life and Words of !Kung Woman, published in 1981, is an influential feminist ethnography that presents a vivid and intimate portrait of the life of a woman from the !Kung society. This essay will examine the issues and challenges faced by feminist researchers in social research, using Shostak's work as a case study. The essay will also evaluate how Shostak's work negotiates these issues and challenges.
Issues and Challenges Faced by Feminist Researchers:
1. Researcher's Subjectivity:
Contextualising research as gendered is vital for feminist researchers. Feminist researchers acknowledge that their subjectivity lends itself to research, and personal experience influences their research focus and methodology. Since feminist research is conducted by feminists, their research reflects their own experiences, values and perspectives. As a result, researchers need to recognise and reflect on their own positionality to understand how their views may influence their data collection, interpretations, and analysis.
2. Power Dynamics:
Feminist researchers are often working in communities or spaces that are characterised by pervasive inequalities and power dynamics. Power relationships are at play in almost every social situation, which can impact how feminist research is conducted. Researchers must recognise that they have limited privileges and access to information, that can be amplified by prejudices and biases within the research field.
3. Ethical and Practical Concerns:
The nature of Feminist research often necessitates accessing sensitive, personal information that can be distressing or harmful to participants. Confidentiality and privacy, recording and sharing field data, community requests to participate, and misunderstandings between participants and researchers must be handled in a professional but sensitive manner. Furthermore, time and resource constraints, particularly for postgraduate and research that is unfunded, pose significant challenges to conducting interviews and collecting observation data.
4. Resistance from Participants:
Feminist research investigates and challenges existing power dynamics, and this is not always welcomed by communities or individuals who feel threatened or violated. Researchers may be rejected or avoided altogether, or might face hostility and critique from participants, who may be resistant to change.
Shostak's Nisa: The Life and Words of !Kung Woman:
Shostak's ethnography highlights several issues and challenges facing feminist researchers in relation to conducting research on marginalised communities. First, Shostak's subjectivity is clear from the outset. Shostak's relationship with Nisa, the central figure of the book, shaped her investigation focus and methodology. Shostak writes the first half of the book in the first-person, outlining her own relationship with Nisa and other women in the !Kung community. Through the use of pseudonyms and first-person narration, Shostak acknowledges her positionality as a White, English-speaking Western woman conducting research in a society. However, she is not open about her feminist views, as she thought it might lead to biased reception from the community she would study.
Second, Shostak's book demonstrates how power dynamics can impact the research process. Shostak acknowledged that community gatekeepers like Nisa's brother and husband controlled who got access to information about !Kung society and culture. To mitigate these issues, Shostak lived with the !Kung people for several years, learnt to speak their language reasonably well, and even took on certain responsibilities in the community to gain their trust and facilitate access to information by building rapport with women community members. This gave Shostak greater access to information and helped her to rebuild the trust of the women who were initially hesitant to trust a Western researcher. However, this positionality also allowed some of the !Kung people to dismiss and misinterpret Shostak's data as she did not share their cultural background.
Third, Shostak grapples with ethical and practical concerns, such as those related to gender roles, cultural traditions, and femininity. The book raises questions surrounding the ethics of taking a fieldworker's approach while integrating oneself into the culture to get more in-depth information. She went beyond the scope of ethical practice by playing the role of a parental figure to Nisa's children when Nisa developed a life-threatening illness. Additionally, she was part of the process of sheltering women who experienced domestic violence, and giving them progressive opportunities in medical treatments and educating them on hygiene.
Finally, Shostak's research highlights issues of resistance from participants. Initially, Nisa's husband and male community members were hesitant to speak with Shostak. However, Shostak's persistence and emphasis on building rapport helped her to overcome barriers and gain insights into the impact of patriarchal structures on gender relations and familial dynamics.
Conclusion:
Feminist research faces multiple challenges and issues that must be acknowledged and addressed when collecting data. Through Marjorie Shostak's Nisa: The Life and Words of !Kung Woman, we see how these complications manifest themselves, and demonstrates the efforts feminist researchers must go through to mitigate them. Shostak highlights the importance of reflexivity, positioning herself as a researcher dedicated to building relationships with the people she was studying. Shostak's book demonstrates that while feminist research is not without criticism, it offers an essential contribution to redefining knowledge and questioning dominant power dynamics. Hence, It is critical that researchers recognise the difficulties and work towards conducting research in an ethical and inclusive manner that respects the dignity and rights of research participants.
