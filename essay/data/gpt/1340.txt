The critical approach to literacy in primary schools is an educational approach that emphasizes developing critical thinking habits and consciousness in children. Rather than passively absorbing information, the critical approach to literacy encourages children to question, analyze, and evaluate what they read and hear.
The critical approach to literacy helps develop students' consciousness and critical thinking skills by teaching them to evaluate information sources, including books, websites, and other media. Students learn to ask questions about the author's biases, intentions, and reliability. They are encouraged to consider alternative perspectives and to evaluate evidence before coming to conclusions.
The critical approach also emphasizes the importance of considering the social, economic, and political contexts in which written and spoken communication happens. Students learn to analyze how different groups are represented in literature and media and to recognize how power and inequality impact the way information is communicated.
By developing critical thinking habits and consciousness, the critical approach to literacy in primary schools prepares children to be active and engaged citizens who can understand and evaluate complex issues thoughtfully. It also helps children become lifelong learners who are curious, creative, and able to use language fluently and with purpose.
