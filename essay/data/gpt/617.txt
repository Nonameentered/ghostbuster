Contaminated land is the result of either a closed or an active industry, which leaves behind chemicals and materials, that are potentially harmful to the environment and human health. The impact of such land can be severe on the companies operating in them, including Spectrum Petrochemicals, which is likely to face legal, environmental, and social repercussions if their sites are found to be contaminated. It is, therefore, necessary that the company implements accurate assessment methods to ensure their sites are not contaminated, while also exploring possible remedies for contaminated sites.
Spectrum Petrochemicals operates in an industry that is notorious for being associated with environmental damage. The company is involved in the manufacturing of petroleum products such as motor vehicle fuels, diesel, benzene, and other chemicals. The processes involved in extracting and transforming petroleum products from crude oil often require significant input of energy, chemicals and water; this can result in contamination of land, surface water, groundwater, and air. The company, therefore, has a responsibility to ensure the environmental impact of their activities is minimal to none. The impact of contaminated land is multifaceted and varies depending on the company conducting the activities and the nature of pollutants, but the financial and reputational impact are significant for Spectrum Petrochemicals.
Contaminated land may lead to legal and regulatory consequences. Federal, state, and local regulations demand the protection of public health and the environment, particularly in situations where contamination threatens the livability of the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental protection agencies regulate contaminated land sites, and such regulations require companies to investigate and remediate pollution through of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) legislation. The legislation sets clear guidelines on how to prevent, identify, and report releases of hazardous waste into the environment. Spectrum Petrochemicals may have to face severe financial penalties and a bad reputation if their hazardous waste disposal and management practices do not comply with these laws.
Contaminated land also affects a company's reputation and social license to operate. The company's stakeholders, particularly investors, customers, and the surrounding community, expect them to act responsibly and minimize their environmental impact. Spectrum Petrochemicals must ensure that it meets stakeholders' expectations and is transparent in its reporting on environmental performance. Negative public perceptions of contaminated land are likely to increase the cost of raising capital from investors, while also hindering their efforts to retain customers and attract new ones. The community may also resist Spectrum Petrochemicals' expansion efforts, as the organization’s past activities in a particular area of contaminated land may lead to concern about the impact of new operations.
To prevent contamination, Spectrum Petrochemicals must implement a comprehensive assessment program. The first stage of assessment is identifying the potential sources of contamination and the mechanisms through which contaminants can spread. Spectrum Petrochemicals should review and assess historical records to identify potential areas of contamination. After identifying the potential pressure points, the company should undertake soil, water and air testing. Soil testing involves collecting samples of contaminated soil, and laboratory analysis of samples to determine the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene, lead, and other contaminants. The company should also conduct groundwater tests to determine whether there is downward migration of contaminants from the soil to the groundwater. Air testing is also important in assessing the risk of contaminants in the environment, particularly near urban areas where their facilities are located.
Once the company's sites are contaminated, Spectrum Petrochemicals can employ various remedies. One option is containment, where the company places a physical barrier around the contaminated site to prevent further spread of the contamination. Remediation or solution-based remediation may involve physically removing the contaminated soil or groundwater from the site and containing or partially treating it before it is either released for use or permanently disposed of. Phytoremediation is another option, where the company grows plants with the ability to absorb or degrade the contaminants, such as hyper-accumulator plants. The act of remediation can be costly and could result in legal and regulatory consequences; hence, Spectrum Petrochemicals must be cautious.
The Love Canal incident in 1978 provided crucial lessons about environmental contamination, and it acted as a catalyst in creating regulatory frameworks for contaminated land. The incident involved a community in Niagara Falls, New York, that was exposed to hazardous waste disposed of in a closed and abandoned canal by the Hooker Chemical Company. The waste included tetra-chlorobenzene, dioxin, benzene, and chlorinated benzene. The chemicals led to widespread health issues such as birth defects, miscarriages, cancer, and nervous system disorders. This led to the creation of the Superfund program, established by the CERCLA legislation, which regulated the country’s worst contaminated land sites. The Legislation required that individuals or organizations responsible for contamination must take immediate action to address the contamination. The legislation has led to the use of the Significant Pollutant Linkages (SPL) model to maintain oversight on potential contamination pathways, contaminants and receptors. 
The SPL model is a critical component of the Superfund program. The model prioritizes contaminants that pose the most significant risk; hence allowing the EPA to make the right decisions on addressing contamination. The model combines analytical and geospatial techniques used to map potential human and ecological risk pathways. The model inputs data on risk criteria, human and ecological sensitivities, exposure factors, and site-specific information. The model outputs crucial information about contaminant location and the most vulnerable receptors. Spectrum Petrochemicals may use the SPL model to investigate and assess contaminated land sites.
The risk assessment for Spectrum Petrochemicals sites must consider the effects of lead and benzene contamination. Both are hazardous and pose severe risks to human health and the environment. Lead can cause a range of effects depending on the level and duration of exposure. Acute exposure could lead to gastrointestinal distress, muscle damage, and anemia. Chronic exposure, primarily in children, affects the brain, resulting in behavior, learning, and developmental issues. Benzene, a volatile organic compound, is frequently found in petrochemical industries and is a known carcinogen, causing leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other cancers. 
Spectrum Petrochemicals's risk assessment will use the SPL model to identify the most vulnerable receptors, and then take appropriate preventive and remedial measures. The company can reduce benzene levels by minimizing the fugitive emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) through containment, using additional control measures or capturing recovery systems. The company can prevent lead contamination by properly managing lead-based paints, batteries, lead cables, and pipes. Additionally, Spectrum Petrochemicals must conduct regular environmental monitoring, disposing of contaminated substances correctly at recognized sites, and implementing best practices in industrial hygiene and safety.
In conclusion, Spectrum Petrochemicals must implement measures to ensure that their facilities are free from contamination and have systems in place to avoid contamination where possible. Contaminated sites pose significant risks to companies operating within them and the surrounding communities. Spectrum Petrochemicals should employ appropriate methods of assessment such as soil, groundwater, and air testing to minimize risks. The company should also implement the appropriate remediation methods should they encounter contaminated sites. The Love Canal incident played an essential role in raising awareness about the dangers of contaminated land, resulting in legislative frameworks. Such frameworks, as seen in the Significant Pollutant Linkages model, are necessary to ensure the safety of people and the environment. Additionally, the company's risk assessment should always criticize the critical issue of benzene and lead contamination. It should use tools like the SPL model to identify the most vulnerable receptors and take remedial measures to minimize such risks. Ultimately, Spectrum Petrochemicals should prioritize environmental safety in its operations to minimize reputational and legal risks while fulfilling its social and environmental responsibilities.
