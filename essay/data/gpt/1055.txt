Fumarase catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to L-malate, a crucial step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The kinetic parameters of this reaction were experimentally determined through various techniques. The initial velocity (vi), Vmax, and Km were the key parameters measured during the investigation.
The initial velocity was determined by measuring the rate of L-malate production at varying concentrations of fumarate. The Vmax was determined using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which plotted the initial velocity against the substrate concentration, indicating the maximum rate of the reaction. The Vmax was calculated by extrapolating the curve to a value that is statistically significant. The binding affinity of the enzyme to the substrate was estimated through the measurement of the Km. The Km value was calculated as a concentration of the substrate at one-half of the Vmax. 
The rate of the reaction is limited by various factors. One such factor is the enzyme to the substrate ratio, which can be altered by adding more enzyme to the reaction mixture. The rate of the reaction can also be limited by the concentration of the substrate. Secondly, the temperature of the reaction plays a vital role, as enzymes are temperature-dependent. An increase in temperature can increase the rate of the reaction by increasing the amount of energy transferred to the molecules. 
Several errors occurred during the experiment. Firstly, temperature variation could have significantly affected the result. The reaction must be carried out at a constant temperature, which was not maintained throughout the experiment. Secondly, errors in the measurements of the substrate concentration or enzyme activity could have distorted the Vmax and Km values. Thirdly, enzymatic activity can be influenced by factors such as pH, salt concentration, and inhibitors, which were not adequately controlled in the experiment. Finally, measuring accurate initial velocities can be challenging because enzymes can react quickly, and the reaction can become saturated. 
In conclusion, the experiment aimed to determine the kinetic parameters of the fumarase-catalyzed reaction with various techniques. The initial velocity, Vmax, and Km were the critical parameters that were measured during the investigation. The rate of the reaction can be limited by various factors such as the enzyme to substrate ratio and temperature. Errors were present in the experiment, including temperature variation, measurement errors, and the impact of environmental factors such as pH and salt concentration. Overall, the experiment provides significant insight into the kinetics of the fumarase-catalyzed reaction, highlighting the importance of proper control of experimental conditions and accurate measurements in the calculation of kinetic parameters.
