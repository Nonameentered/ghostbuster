Tetrachromacy is a condition where an individual possesses four types of cone cells in their eyes, which enables them to perceive a wider range of colors than the average person. Unlike the majority of the population, who are said to have trichromatic vision involving three types of cone cells, tetrachromats have an additional cone cell, which allows them to discern finer differences in color shades. While many people have heard of the existence of tetrachromats, it is a relatively rare condition, and it is only in recent years that scientists have begun uncovering the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. This essay will examine what tetrachromacy is and how it relates to anomalous trichromacy and X inactivation in females, as well as how the expression of the shifted red photopsin affects color perception in heterozygous carriers.
Tetrachromacy is a relatively new concept in the field of vision research and genetics, and understanding it requires a bit of background on color vision. The human eye is made up of two types of light-sensitive cells, rods and cones. Rod cells are responsible for vision in low-light conditions, while the cone cells are responsible for color vision in bright light. The cone cells are further divided into three types, each sensitive to different parts of the visible light spectrum. These are called the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones, medium-wavelength-sensitive (M) cones, and long-wavelength-sensitive (L) cones. S cones are most sensitive to violet light, M cones to green light, and L cones to red light.
Most people have three types of cone cells, which receive information from the three different photopigments that are sensitive to the different spectrums of light mentioned above. These people are known as trichromats, which is the most common type of color vision. However, some individuals have anomalous trichromacy where one of the three types of cones either partially overlaps or has a shifted sensitivity spectrum, meaning that they do not differentiate colors in the same way that the majority of the population experiences. There are various forms of anomalous trichromacy, including protanomaly and deuteranomaly, which limit the ability to accurately distinguish red and green hues.
Tetrachromacy occurs in individuals who have an additional type of cone cell in their eyes, which makes it possible to see a wider range of colors than the average person. However, despite the potential for expanded color vision, many tetrachromats may not realize their unique condition, as it relies on the expression of the various cone types. For a person to be considered a tetrachromat, they must possess four types of cone cells, with the fourth cone cell being sensitive to a part of the spectrum that is not covered by the standard three types. 
The genetics of tetrachromacy is still not entirely understood, but there are a few known factors. The potential for tetrachromacy is related to the X chromosome, which carries the genetic information for photopigments. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Some females have two different alleles, or versions of a gene, for the photopigment red-sensitive cone (L) cells. The combination of the two alleles on each chromosome can lead to possible variations in color perception. If one allele does not function correctly, it can lead to anomalous trichromacy, and if both alleles are functional, it can lead to tetrachromacy.
A female who is a tetrachromat will have one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with four cone types, making her a carrier of tetrachromacy. However, because of X inactivation, meaning that during embryonic development, one of the two X chromosomes in females is randomly inactivated in each cell, only one of those chromosomes is functional. If this inactivation occurs in the X chromosome containing the extra cone type, it will not be expressed, and the resulting female will not be a true tetrachromat. It is still possible that these carriers can have a wider range of color vision due to the more complex pairing of photopigments from the functioning L cone cell and the shifted L cone cell.
The expression of the shifted red photopsin in heterozygous carriers affects color perception in a complicated manner. While a woman with just one functioning X chromosome may be categorized as a protanomalous trichromat, she can still have the potential for enhanced vision because the photopigment from the functioning L cone cell could mix with the photopigment from the shifted L cone cell. If these two photopigments differ enough, then the resulting variation can allow for the perception of a more diverse range of colors. However, if the photopigments are too similar or do not produce different enough signals to the brain, then the individual may not experience any noticeable difference in perception.
In conclusion, tetrachromacy is a rare condition that allows an individual to see and distinguish a wider range of colors than most people. Anomalous trichromacy, and in particular, the shifted red photopsin, is closely related to tetrachromacy, and females who have two functional X chromosomes with the shifted red photopsin can result in the potential for tetrachromatic vision. However, due to X-inactivation, only one chromosome is expressed, and the carrier can have enhanced color vision without full tetrachromatic abilities. The combination of photopigments from the L cone cell and the shifted L cone cell can produce more diverse signals to the brain, allowing for the ability to distinguish a wider range of colors.
