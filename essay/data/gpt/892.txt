Introduction
Nurses are essential to the healthcare industry, as they are responsible for providing high-quality care to patients. They are tasked with the responsibility of making important decisions that affect patients' health outcomes. Nursing decisions are made based on evidence, patient desires, and their needs. Nurses use various reasoning theories to make informed decisions. This essay explores the factors and evidence that inform nursing decisions, the theories of reasoning applied, and how nurses weigh potential risks against patient desires and needs in the decision-making process. Additionally, the essay reflects on the decision-making process using the Gibbs reflective cycle and discusses the implications of this experience on future nursing practice.
Factors and Evidence Used to Inform a Nursing Decision
Nurses make decisions based on various factors and evidence. Some of the factors that influence nursing decisions include patients' medical histories, current medical conditions, and cultural or religious beliefs. Nurses often consult with other healthcare professionals, such as doctors, when making decisions about patients' health. Additionally, nurses use evidence-based practice, which involves using scientific evidence to inform their decisions.
One example of a nursing decision that is informed by factors and evidence is the administration of medication. Before administering medication to a patient, nurses review the patient's medical history, current medications, and allergies. They also verify the dosage and administration route with their peers and consult the physician if necessary. Nurses use the medication administration record (MAR) to ensure the correct medication is administered to the correct patient at the correct time.
Theories of Reasoning Applied in Nursing
Nursing decisions are also informed by theories of reasoning. Some of the theories of reasoning applied in nursing include critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and diagnostic reasoning. Critical thinking involves evaluating and analyzing information to make informed decisions. Clinical reasoning focuses on understanding the patient's medical condition and making decisions based on their needs. Diagnostic reasoning involves evaluating patient symptoms to determine the underlying cause of their illness.
One example of a nursing decision informed by theories of reasoning is the diagnosis of a patient's condition. Nurses use diagnostic reasoning to evaluate a patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of their illness. This involves conducting a comprehensive assessment of the patient, gathering information about their symptoms and medical history, and conducting physical examinations. Nurses also consult with other healthcare professionals, such as physicians or specialists, to confirm their diagnosis.
Weighing Potential Risks Against Patient Desires and Needs
Nurses must weigh the potential risks and benefits of their decisions against patients' desires and needs. They must consider the potential side effects of medications and treatments, as well as the potential harm that may be caused by not treating a patient's medical condition. Nurses must also take into account the patient's cultural and religious beliefs when making decisions about their care.
One example of weighing potential risks against patient desires and needs is administering pain medication. Pain medication can provide relief for patients, but it also has potential side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and addiction. Nurses must weigh the potential risks and benefits of pain medication against the patient's desires and needs. They must also consider the patient's medical history, allergies, and current medications.
Reflecting on the Decision-Making Process
The decision-making process in nursing can be complex, and it is important for nurses to reflect on their decisions to improve their practice. The Gibbs reflective cycle provides a framework for reflecting on the decision-making process. The cycle involves six stages: description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, and action plan.
Description
The nursing decision I am reflecting on is administering insulin to a patient with diabetes. The patient was experiencing high blood glucose levels, and the physician ordered insulin to be administered.
Feelings
As a nurse, I felt confident in administering insulin as I have done it several times before. However, I was also nervous about the potential side effects and the patient's reaction to the medication.
Evaluation
I evaluated the patient's medical history, current medications, and allergies before administering insulin. I also reviewed the medication administration record (MAR) to confirm the correct dosage and administration route.
Analysis
After administering the insulin, I monitored the patient closely for potential side effects. I also provided education to the patient about managing their diabetes, including diet and exercise.
Conclusion
The insulin administration was successful, and the patient's blood glucose levels decreased to a normal range. The patient reported feeling better and expressed gratitude for the care provided.
Action Plan
In the future, I will continue to review patient medications and allergies before administering any medication. I will also provide education to patients about managing their health conditions to promote better health outcomes.
Implications for Future Nursing Practice
Reflecting on the decision-making process can help nurses identify areas for improvement in their practice. In the future, I will continue to use the Gibbs reflective cycle to reflect on my decisions and improve my practice. Additionally, I will continue to use evidence-based practice to inform my decisions and collaborate with other healthcare professionals to provide the best possible care to my patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, nursing decisions are informed by various factors and evidence, including patients' medical histories, current medical conditions, cultural or religious beliefs, and scientific evidence. Nurses use various theories of reasoning, such as critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and diagnostic reasoning, to make informed decisions. Nurses must also weigh potential risks against patients' desires and needs to provide optimal care. Reflecting on the decision-making process using the Gibbs reflective cycle can improve nursing practice and ensure better patient outcomes.
