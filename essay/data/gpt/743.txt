In André Gide’s novel “The Immoralist”, Marceline is a pivotal character who represents the flaws in individualistic values. Marceline serves as a symbol of the traditional societal expectations of women and the consequences of breaking free from those norms. Through her character, Gide critiques individualism and what it means for society as a whole. Marceline plays a crucial role in shaping the novel’s critique of individualism, as she represents the limitations that individualism imposes on personal growth and relationships.
At the outset of the novel, Marceline is portrayed as the perfect wife. She is a beautiful and cultured woman who is devoted to her husband, Michel. Michel describes her as “simple, good-natured, always busy and solicitous, humble and obedient” (Gide 16). However, this idealized image of Marceline is challenged as the story progresses. With Michel’s newfound pursuit of pleasure and self-discovery, Marceline is forced into the role of a passive and subservient wife. She is completely unaware of Michel’s true desires and struggles, and this lack of communication ultimately leads to the degradation of their marriage.
Marceline’s character serves to illustrate the inherent flaws of individualism. Michel’s pursuit of pleasure comes at the expense of his relationship with Marceline. He neglects her emotional needs by denying his own, and this ultimately results in an unhappy and unfulfilling marriage. Gide suggests that individualism is a selfish philosophy that ultimately leads to loneliness and isolation.
Marceline’s role in the novel is also significant as she represents the traditional expectations of women in society. Despite her intelligence and education, Marceline is reduced to the role of a domestic caretaker. She is expected to be obedient and subservient to her husband, and any deviation from this prescribed path is met with disapproval. Marceline’s character serves to expose the underlying sexism in traditional gender roles and the harm of reducing women to caretakers.
As Michel becomes increasingly distant and disinterested in their marriage, Marceline begins to break free from her traditional role. She discovers that Michel has been visiting male prostitutes and becomes resentful of her subservient position. She begins to express her own thoughts and desires, which leads to conflict between her and Michel. Marceline represents the struggle faced by those who challenge societal norms, particularly women who are often relegated to a secondary position.
Marceline’s journey is a commentary on the dichotomy between individualism and social responsibility. She struggles to reconcile her own desires with those of the society she lives in. Marceline is torn between her desire for personal growth and the limitations imposed by traditional gender roles. Gide suggests that the pursuit of individualism is a lonely and self-centered path that ultimately leads to personal collapse rather than redemption.
In conclusion, Marceline serves as a pivotal character in Gide’s critique of individualism in “The Immoralist”. Her character embodies the flaws in individualistic values as she struggles to reconcile her own desires with the constraints of tradition. Marceline’s journey is a commentary on the limitations of individualism, particularly when it comes to relationships and social responsibility. Through Marceline, Gide suggests that the pursuit of individualism can lead to intense loneliness and isolation when it conflicts with traditional societal values. Marceline is not only a symbol of the traditional woman’s plight but also a demonstration of the cost of living in a society that places individualistic desires over collective needs.
