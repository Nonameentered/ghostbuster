In literature, intertextuality refers to the way a text is influenced by or references to other texts. It is a fundamental and pervasive technique used by writers to explore the complexities of human experience, culture, and history. Intertextuality allows writers to engage with other texts, both past and present, and to challenge, rework, and reinterpret existing narratives. In this essay, I will explore how intertextuality can be used to "revisit" the myth of Robinson Crusoe, focus on the authors who have used this technique and the process of creating new texts through intertextual hybridization. I will also provide a brief explanation of the intertextual hybridization involved in my revisiting of Crusoe's Island.
Robinson Crusoe is a work of fiction by Daniel Defoe, published in 1719. It tells the story of a British sailor, Robinson Crusoe, who is stranded on a deserted island for 28 years. The novel has come to be seen as a canonical work of literature and is known for its themes of survival, isolation, and self-reliance. Over the years, it has inspired numerous adaptations and reworkings, including films, television shows, and other literary works.
Intertextuality is a technique of creative writing that has been used by many authors to revise and reinterpret existing works of literature. They have been inspired by Defoe’s work, thus providing the world with a glimpse of Robinson Crusoe’s world through a different lens. One of such authors is J. M. Coetzee, who revisited the myth of Robinson Crusoe in his book, "Foe." Here, Coetzee tells the story of Susan Barton, a shipwrecked woman who ends up on an island with Crusoe. Unlike Defoe's original character Crusoe, Coetzee's version is a man of unsavory character who physically threatens both Barton and Friday on his Island.
"Foe" is newly framed in the modern post-colonial era, making it more appropriate for the current society. The text becomes a commentary on the implications of the colonial/ imperial era and its effects. Coetzee does not only change Defoe's story, but he also adds a new dimension to it to add perspective to the current world view, as far as colonialism, racism, discrimination and imperialism are concerned.
Another author who has revisited Crusoe's myth through intertextuality is Michel Tournier in his book "Friday." Tournier chooses to rewrite the original story of Robinson Crusoe from the perspective of the indigenous man whom Crusoe rescued from the cannibals and named Friday. While Defoe's version depicts Friday as a loyal and subservient servant, Tournier's Friday is a complex individual who almost exclusively focuses on his own desires and needs. Friday is portrayed as being intelligent and spiritual and act as Crusoe’s mentor.
Tournier's "Friday" is radical. It's a brilliant work of critical excitement. The author uses Crusoe's Island as a mere vehicle to expose the themes of race, identity, nostalgia, colonialism, and language. The novel is shaped by the historical waves of the 1960s. The reader is left to question the prejudices, assumptions, and stereotypes that they might have had about the island and its people.
In The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Defoe tells the story in a chronological series of events. He does not provide any detailed observations of the place which Robinson makes his home for twenty-eight years. The island and landscape remain peripheral. There is a defined plot, and the focus is on Robinson's isolation and mental development over his years of isolation. Tournier, however, creates a world that is far more inclusive through other characters - Saturday, Crusoe’s dog, Rili, the intelligent and spiritual animal, Mr. Koffi, the ambitious merchant and Tournier leaves a lot of the writing to his own preservation. He talks of Robinson's Island as “vaguely Socratic or stoic,” which means that the Island becomes and continues to be a philosophical landscape in its’ own right.
In my own revisiting of Crusoe's Island, I have attempted to use intertextual hybridization as a tool to create a new text. The intertextuality hybridization comes from the connection between two texts. Here, I have focused on revisiting Robinson Crusoe as a transcultural text. In my story, Robinson’s Island is not just seen by foreign eyes, which is unique given that the Island is often presented as outside of the realm of the then-colonial Western time. The protagonist’s perspective is filtered through that of his Nigerian friend, Sisi, and her experience of the Island as an African woman. In doing this, I am able to add cultural and personal dimensions to Crusoe's story.
By creating a new text through intertextual hybridization, I have been able to comment on the complexities of human experiences not fully realized through the original story. I have written my revision in such a way that I close the issues left hanging by the previous authors. I have done this while providing my own perspective on Crusoe's Island. From my point of view, I am able to paint a picture that completes the idea of globalization in Defoe's version of the story, hence providing new depths to the Island and the story at large.
To sum it up, Intertextuality has become an essential technique for reworking Robinson Crusoe's myth. By revisiting this iconic story, authors have been able to add new perspectives to it, making it more inclusive and representative of the wider audience. Through intertextual hybridization, writers have reworked the myth and given it a modern twist, meshing it with current post-colonial experiences and allowing the audience to reflect on them. As the authors’ works reveal, intertextuality allows for infinite possibilities for narrative revisions, and I endeavored to follow in their footsteps by using intertextuality to present my own perspective on Crusoe's Island. Hence, Robinson Crusoe's story can be told and retold, with new meanings and implications being discovered with each iteration.
