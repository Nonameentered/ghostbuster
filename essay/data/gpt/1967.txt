The widespread use of DDT as a pesticide in the 20th century led to severe ecological damage and affected the population of several bird species, including Peregrine Falcons and Sparrow Hawks in the United Kingdom. DDT is a synthetic insecticide that was first synthesized in 1874, but it gained worldwide popularity in the 1940s and 1950s for its effectiveness against malaria-carrying mosquitoes and agricultural pests. However, it had severe consequences for birds and other wildlife and was eventually banned in most countries around the world, including the UK. This essay will discuss how the use of DDT as a pesticide affected the population of Peregrine Falcons and Sparrow Hawks in the UK and describe the experiment that was conducted to measure the effects of DDT on the eggshells of these birds and what the results of the experiment revealed.
Peregrine Falcons and Sparrow Hawks are birds of prey that are widespread in the UK and secure their nests in cliffs, buildings, and trees in both urban and rural areas. They are at the top of their food chain and play an essential role in controlling the populations of smaller birds and mammals. In the 1950s, both of these species began declining rapidly, with some populations falling by as much as 90%. One of the major factors contributing to this decline was the use of DDT as a pesticide, which weakened their eggshells, making them more likely to break during incubation. The thinning of their eggshell was caused by DDT breaking down into DDE, which interfered with the female bird’s ability to incorporate calcium into the eggshell. Consequently, when the female bird laid an egg with a thin shell, the chances of the egg surviving to hatch decreased significantly. This reduced reproductive success led to a rapid decline in the population of these birds and raised concerns about the long-term survival of the species.
To confirm the link between DDT and the decline in bird populations, several experiments were conducted in the UK between the 1950s and 1970s. The most widely cited study was conducted by Derek Ratcliffe in the 1960s, which measured the effects of DDT on the eggshells of Peregrine Falcons in the Peak District National Park. Ratcliffe collected eggs from Peregrine Falcons nests in both contaminated and uncontaminated areas and analyzed the eggshells for their thickness. He found that eggs collected from contaminated areas had significantly thinner shells than those from uncontaminated areas. The shells from contaminated areas were so thin that they often cracked during incubation or were so weak that they broke under the weight of the adult bird. The reduction in shell thickness was more severe in inland areas where Peregrine Falcons primarily consumed prey that had a high concentration of DDT in their tissues, such as pigeons and other urban birds.
The experiment conducted by Ratcliffe showed a clear relationship between the use of DDT and the decline in the population of Peregrine Falcons. Other experiments conducted during this same period revealed similar effects on Sparrow Hawks and other bird species. For example, the Ecological Research Station at Munsö in Sweden observed a decline in the populations of several species of birds, including Ospreys, Goshawks, and White-tailed Eagles, which were all vulnerable to the effects of DDT. The experiments conducted in the UK and Sweden led to the discovery of the harmful effects of DDT on bird populations and raised awareness about the need for better regulation of pesticides to protect wildlife.
In response to the decline in bird populations and the evidence of the harmful effects of DDT, the UK government introduced several regulations. In 1958, the first year of Game Licenses and the Handling of Wild Birds Order came into effect. These regulations prohibited the use of DDT and other harmful pesticides in areas where birds of prey were nesting, breeding, or roosting. The UK was one of the first countries in Europe to introduce such regulations, and other countries followed suit. In the USA, Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, published in 1962, highlighted the danger of pesticides and led to the ban of DDT in 1972.
In conclusion, the use of DDT as a pesticide in the UK had a significant impact on the population of Peregrine Falcons and Sparrow Hawks and other bird species. It led to a decline in the reproductive success of these birds by weakening their eggshells. This decline in the population of birds of prey highlighted the need for better regulation of pesticides and contributed to the eventual ban of DDT in most countries. The experiment conducted by Derek Ratcliffe in the 1960s showed a clear relationship between the use of DDT and the decline in bird populations. The thinning of eggshells resulting from the use of DDT was a stark reminder of the consequences of human activity on the natural world. Consequently, this research played a crucial role in understanding the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants and safeguarding the welfare of wildlife.
