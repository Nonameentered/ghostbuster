The European Union (EU) emerged out of the ruins of World War II with a vision of a peaceful and prosperous Europe. The idea of European integration, however, has evolved over time, and it is now more encompassing than just economic cooperation. The EU is today a multi-level governance system dealing with various challenges, including democratic legitimacy. The EU takes into account the ethical and moral values of democracy, but to what extent can it be considered an incipient form of cosmopolitan democracy? 
Cosmopolitan democracy is an idea that reflects the belief in global democracy, based on human rights, a representative and accountable system of governance, and the participation of individuals and non-state actors. In this essay, I will explore the EU’s construction, its strengths and weaknesses, and the application of the concept of cosmopolitan democracy to the EU. 
The EU project started as an economic cooperation between six European nations to prevent another war between European countries. Today, the EU is a political and economic union consisting of 27 member states covering the majority of the European continent. It has evolved to include issues like education, research, culture, environmental and energy policy, among others. The EU’s construction is complex and involves different institutional actors, from the European Commission to the European Parliament, to the European Court of Justice. The EU has been designed to promote democracy and values like human dignity, freedom, equality, and human rights. The EU itself represents the idea of a peaceful Europe built on shared values. 
The EU has a democratic deficit, which means that the EU lacks democratic legitimacy. The roots of the democratic deficit are tied to the structure of the EU itself. The EU is a supranational entity, which means that it can make laws and regulations that affect its citizens without any democratic accountability. This is because the European Commission, a supranational institution, has a monopoly on legislative proposals. The citizens of the EU cannot directly elect the Commission. Instead, member states nominate the commissioners, which cannot be rejected by the European Parliament. The European Parliament, the only EU institution directly elected by EU citizens, can only accept or reject legislative proposals. It also has oversight and budgetary powers, but its legislative powers are limited. Therefore, the EU’s governance is limited in democratic terms. 
Cosmopolitan democracy is a new type of democracy that emphasizes the importance of democracy in decision-making, protection of human rights, and participation of non-state actors. Cosmopolitan democracy offers a potential solution to the EU’s democratic deficit, as it could be applied to the EU. Cosmopolitan democracy is characterized by its emphasis on human rights and democratic accountability. It is based on the recognition that all individuals deserve equal representation and that all individuals should be able to participate in decision-making processes. 
The EU’s construction has some features that could be considered incipient forms of cosmopolitan democracy. The EU has adopted the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions should be taken at the most appropriate level of governance, where the policy concern is most significant. The principle also requires that decisions at the EU level must add value to decisions at lower levels of governance. This approach acknowledges and respects the diversity of regions, cultures, and languages within the EU, and it promotes the involvement of non-state actors. 
The EU has also introduced participatory democracy through its citizen initiatives. The European Union’s citizens have the right to bring forward initiatives to the European Commission if they want to propose a new European law. To do so, they must collect one million signatures of people from seven EU countries. This innovative way of promoting deliberation and dialogue between EU citizens and decision-makers regards the citizen as a central actor in the democratic process. 
Moreover, the EU has formalized the protection of human rights through the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU). The ECHR and CFREU emphasize the importance of human dignity, individual freedoms, and fair treatment under the law. These documents give citizens the right to challenge both member states and the EU about their legislative and administrative actions. As such, the EU is relatively more accountable to individuals in terms of human rights protection. 
The EU still has some weaknesses regarding democracy and legitimacy. Although the EU has some incipient forms of cosmopolitan democracy, its construction does not yet capture the spirit of democratic accountability and participation. The main weakness of the EU is the democratic deficit already mentioned. The EU operates in a complex and opaque way, with decision-making often distant from citizens' involvement and choices. Given that citizens and civil society organizations have only limited access to the EU’s decision-making processes, their participation is often unstructured and limited. 
Cosmopolitan democracy has several strengths and weaknesses. One of the strengths is the promotion of global democratic governance through the recognition of human rights and political equality, regardless of nationality. Another strength is the emphasis on democratic accountability and the involvement of non-state actors such as civil society organizations. A weakness of cosmopolitan democracy is that it can be difficult to implement, considering the diversity of the world and the difference in legal, ethical, and moral values. 
The EU could become a more cosmopolitan democratic entity through certain reforms. Member states could give more power to the European Parliament by allowing it to submit legislative proposals to complement those of the Commission. The EU could also adopt more open decision-making processes and increase citizens' involvement in policy creation. The EU could adopt the principle of “participatory budgeting,” which would enable citizens to participate in the allocation of resources and budget creation. The EU could adopt more transparent processes of nomination of the commissioners and subject them to parliamentary approval. 
In conclusion, the EU is an ambitious multi-level governance system designed to promote democracy and human rights. Its construction includes various incipient forms of cosmopolitan democracy. However, the EU still lacks significant democratic legitimacy, as citizens have little influence over its decision-making processes. The application of the concept of cosmopolitan democracy to the EU, if implemented correctly, could help address the democratic deficit and provide a path towards democratization at the supranational level. The EU needs to undergo further reforms to achieve this goal.
