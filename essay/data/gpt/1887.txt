Introduction
The issue of childhood obesity is a growing concern across the globe, and it is imperative that we involve children, parents, teachers and social workers in our efforts to tackle the problem. In Wales, local councils can play a pivotal role in encouraging children to switch to healthier diets and make informed food choices. This essay provides an overview of how local councils can achieve this goal, including the design of a survey method to collect primary data from parents, teachers, and social workers in a disadvantaged urban area of Wales. 
Encouraging Children to Switch to Healthier Diets and Make Informed Food Choices
Local councils can play a vital role in increasing awareness about the importance of healthy food choices and physical activity in children's lives. Some of the steps that local councils can undertake include:
1. Encouraging healthy eating habits - Local councils can provide local schools with healthier menus, showcasing fruits and vegetables, lean protein, dairy products, and whole-grain foods. The local councils can also conduct awareness drives to sensitise children and their families about the importance of a healthy diet. 
2. Providing opportunities for active play - Local councils can create open, safe and accessible play areas for children to engage in physical activity. Examples can include enhancing local parks with child-friendly equipment such as slides, swings, monkey bars, and rock climbing walls, or providing safe playgrounds in local schools.
3. Organising community events - Local councils can organise community events aimed at promoting healthy eating and physical activity in children. These events can include community sports days and healthy eating competitions, where children showcase their healthy meal recipes. 
4. Engaging with schools and local health professionals- Local councils can engage with local health professionals and schools to design and implement evidence-based nutrition programs that target children and their families.
Designing a Survey Method to Collect Primary Data
To design effective programs and initiatives that meet the children's needs in disadvantaged urban areas of Wales, it is necessary to understand the perceptions of different stakeholders. Parents, teachers, and social workers play a vital role in ensuring that children in their care are healthy, well-nourished, and physically active. A survey method is a valuable tool to collect primary data from these stakeholders.
1. Survey Design 
The design of the survey should be clear and concise, with straightforward questions that are easy to understand and answer. The survey can be divided into three sections to gather data from parents, teachers, and social workers. The survey should have a length of 20-30 questions and should only take 15-20 minutes maximum.
2. Sampling Strategy
Accurate sampling is necessary to ensure that the study captures the views of the intended population. In this case, the sample population includes parents, teachers and social workers in disadvantaged urban areas of Wales. The sample size should be large enough to provide reliable data. A survey sampling strategy can be used, selecting respondents from different regions for an accurate representation of the target population. 
3. Questionnaire Distribution
The questionnaire can be distributed online or via paper copies through local schools. The schools can arrange for the surveys to be handed out and collected. Email invitations to complete the survey can also be sent, and social media can be used to increase the survey's visibility.
4. Data Analysis
Once the data has been collected, it must be analysed to identify trends and patterns that can be used to develop policies and programs. Statistical software packages, such as SPSS and Microsoft Excel, can be used to analyse data accurately. The results should be summarised in tables, graphs and supported with relevant data descriptions.
5. Ethical Considerations
The survey must be conducted in an ethical manner to protect the participant's anonymity and privacy. Participants must voluntarily provide their informed consent to participate in the survey. Additionally, it is essential not to ask sensitive questions about confidential data. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, tackling childhood obesity requires a collaborative approach from different stakeholders, including local councils, parents, teachers, and social workers. Local councils can play an important role in encouraging children to switch to healthier diets and make informed food choices by providing healthy food options, creating safe playgrounds, organising community events and engaging with schools and health professionals. Primary data collection can be conducted via survey methods, ensuring that data is reliably collected to inform evidence-based policies and programs. With collective efforts from all relevant stakeholders, we can create a healthier and more active future for children.
