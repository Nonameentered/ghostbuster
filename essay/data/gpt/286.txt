Introduction:
In understanding the post-Industrial revolution capitalist society, Marx's labor theory of value remains a crucial concept that helps to analyze labor force and its quality, a key factor to the economic commodity production and its overall value system. In his theory, Marx explored the essential elements to gain profit, the labor force, and its subjective and objective qualities, its productive nature, and the overall exploitation of the system. Its relevance and critical analysis prove to be a valuable asset in the contemporary society that highlights the capitalist market economy and its fundamental basis of production. Marx's labor theory of value delves deeper into the process of production and consumption, analyzing the intricacies of the labor force and its contribution to production. This essay discusses the theory of Marx's labor theory of value in criticizing contemporary capitalism, highlighting the concept of productive and unproductive labor, and the transformation problem to assess the relevance of the theory in analyzing employment under contemporary capitalism.
Marx's Theory of Labor Value:
Marx argues that the value of a commodity is not subjective but rather it is determined by the labor time involved in producing it. This implies that value is created by human labor and not by exchange values or supply and demand. The value of labor is correspondingly derived from its use-value, showing that the use-value of the labor was fundamental and the exchange value that accompanied it played an insignificant role. The labor theory of value's focus on the productive force of labor creates the basis of exploitation in capitalism. This exploitation results from the inadequate compensation of labor in proportion to the value added to goods. Marx highlights that labor power differs from labor in that “power” denotes the labor-power the worker has and puts at the disposal of the capitalist.
The Process of Exploitation in Contemporary Capitalism:
The labor theory of value uncovers the process of exploitation in capitalist society. Marx argues that the capitalist's surplus value generates from the exploitation of labor power in production. In contemporary capitalism, the process is perpetuated through various systems such as subcontracting and informal employment arrangements. In many developing countries, workers are compensated inadequately in proportion to the value they add to the goods they produce. For instance, the low-cost labor in developing countries in producing commodities for developed countries creates an imbalance in the value of the product and the labor cost. This process creates a class character of production, where the working class is continually exploited by the capitalist class.
The Theory of Productive and Unproductive Labor:
Marx differentiates two types of labor as productive and unproductive. Productive labor is that which increases the use-value of the product. In contrast, unproductive labor is that which does not add any new value to the product, such as labor involved in unproductive work like administration or accounting. The theory of productive and unproductive labor is vital in understanding the distribution and accumulation of profits in capitalist society.
Unproductive labor is a real cost to firms and can add to the value of the commodity. However, this type of labor is not productive in increasing the use-value of the commodity, and therefore, it adds no value to it. This is relevant in analyzing contemporary capitalism where there is an increase in the service sector, where much of the labor force is involved in providing services rather than producing material goods. The theory of productive and unproductive labor is essential in analyzing the share of value added to commodities by the service sector compared to the manufacturing sector.
The Transformation Problem:
The transformation problem is essential in Marx's labor theory of value. The transformation problem is the calculation of the value of the commodity to its price and the time of production. The problem arises from the labor theory's assumption that labor is the only source of value and that the value of a commodity is determined by the labor time involved in producing it. However, in the real world, there are other factors, such as technology, social systems, and climate, that influence the price of the commodity. Therefore, the transformation problem highlights the limitation in the labor theory of value in explaining the complexities of contemporary capitalism. 
The relevance of the theory of labor value in analyzing employment under contemporary capitalism:
The labor theory of value is relevant in analyzing employment under contemporary capitalism. With the increase in wealth inequality, the labor theory of value helps to identify the exploitation process that perpetuates this inequality. The theory highlights the process of exploitation in capitalist society, where the capitalist exploits the working class through inadequate compensation of their value-added labor.
The theory of productive and unproductive labor is essential in analyzing contemporary capitalism since it helps to determine the share of value added to commodities by different sectors. With the shift in labor force from manufacturing to service sectors, it is important to examine the value added by the service sector. Additionally, the theory of productive and unproductive labor is critical in analyzing the distribution of profits among the different sectors.
The transformation problem is essential in understanding the limitations of Marx's labor theory of value, particularly in explaining the complexities of contemporary capitalism. The problem highlights that labor is not the only factor that determines the price of the commodity and that other socio-economic and cultural factors influence it. This is relevant in analyzing the contemporary trend where other factors such as climate change and technology play a crucial role in the production process.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, Marx's labor theory of value remains a crucial tool in analyzing employment and contemporary capitalism, particularly in understanding the exploitation process and the distribution of profits. The theory distinguishes between productive and unproductive labor, which helps in understanding the contribution of labor to the value of the commodity and the distribution of profits. Although there are limitations to the labor theory, its relevance in analyzing contemporary capitalism is still significant, especially in understanding the exploitation and wealth inequality perpetuated by the capitalist system. It is important to note that the impacts of contemporary capitalism are complex and require a critical examination of different components, including the role of labor.
