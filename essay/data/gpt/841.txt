Rheumatoid arthritis, commonly referred to as RA, is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the joints, resulting in pain, stiffness, and loss of function. RA of the hand is a particular subtype that can severely affect the affected hand's mobility, dexterity, and strength, making daily activities challenging and potentially causing disability. Therapeutic exercise is a common intervention for RA of the hand, intended to maintain or increase range of movement and muscle strength. However, some experts suggest that combining exercise treatment with a resting hand splint could increase its effectiveness. This essay aims to explore the effectiveness of exercise treatment alone versus exercise treatment with the use of a resting hand splint in individuals with RA of the hand in maintaining or increasing range of motion and muscle strength.
Firstly, let us briefly discuss the pathophysiology of RA of the hand. RA is a systemic autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the synovial membranes surrounding the joints. The inflammatory process leads to cartilage damage, bone erosion, and ultimately joint deformities, affecting the hand's functionality. Specifically, RA frequently affects the hand's metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and wrist joints, resulting in pain, swelling, and stiffness. Moreover, muscle atrophy and weakness commonly occur as a consequence of reduced hand function due to RA, leading to further loss of mobility and functional impairment.
Therapeutic exercise is considered a cornerstone in the management of RA, aiming to maintain or increase range of motion and muscle strength. Exercise therapy for RA of the hand consists of a series of stretching, strengthening, and dexterity exercises, tailored to an individual's needs and limitations. Stretching exercises aim to maintain or increase flexibility, reducing joint stiffness and improving joint motion. Strengthening exercises aim to improve muscle strength, potentially increasing joint stability and enhancing hand function. Dexterity exercises aim to improve fine motor skills, improving the ability to perform daily activities involving precise hand movements.
Several studies support the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise for RA of the hand. For instance, a systematic review by Vliet Vlieland et al. (2012) found that hand exercise programs for RA patients were effective in reducing pain, stiffness, and functional impairment, as well as increasing range of motion and grip strength. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Oken et al. (2004) compared the effectiveness of an eight-week hand exercise program and a control group in RA patients, finding significant improvements in grip strength, hand function, and pain reduction in the exercise group.
However, some experts suggest that exercise treatment alone may not be sufficient in maintaining or increasing range of motion and muscle strength in RA of the hand, especially in severe cases. A resting hand splint, also known as a wrist cock-up splint, is a device that immobilizes the wrist joint, keeping it in a neutral or slightly extended position. The rationale behind using a hand splint in RA of the hand is to reduce joint inflammation and pain, preventing further damage and deformity. Moreover, a hand splint can potentially improve muscle strength and function by reducing muscle fatigue and facilitating rest.
Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of combining exercise treatment with the use of a resting hand splint in RA of the hand. For instance, a study by Hammond et al. (2011) compared the outcomes of a hand exercise program and a hand exercise program plus a resting hand splint in RA patients. The authors found that both groups improved significantly in hand function, grip strength, and joint range of motion, but the group receiving the hand splint showed greater improvements in grip strength and dexterity. Similarly, a RCT by Rannou et al. (2006) examined the impact of a hand exercise program and a hand exercise program with a night resting splint in RA patients. The authors found that both groups improved significantly in hand function and pain, but the group receiving the hand splint had additional improvements in grip strength and hand mobility.
In conclusion, therapeutic exercise is an effective intervention for maintaining or increasing range of motion and muscle strength in RA of the hand, reducing pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. However, combining exercise therapy with a resting hand splint may yield better outcomes, especially in severe cases. A hand splint can potentially reduce joint inflammation and pain, prevent further damage and deformity, and improve muscle strength and function by facilitating rest. Nonetheless, it is essential to tailor any therapeutic intervention to the individual's specific needs, limitations, and preferences, accounting for disease severity, comorbidities, and overall health status. Further research is needed to determine the optimal combination of exercise therapy and hand splinting in RA of the hand, as well as their long-term effectiveness and potential side effects.
