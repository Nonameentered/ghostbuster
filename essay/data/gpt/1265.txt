Strain gauges are essential components used for measuring the force applied to a cantilever beam. A cantilever beam is a type of beam that is supported at one end and left free at the other. This type of beam is commonly used in various engineering applications such as in bridges, buildings, and other structures. The force applied to such a beam can be measured by using a strain gauge. The primary purpose of this essay is to describe how strain gauges can be used to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam.
The measurement system required to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam using a strain gauge is relatively simple. It involves the use of a Wheatstone deflection bridge, an operational amplifier, and a low-pass filter. These components are used to amplify the strain gaugeâ€™s output voltage to obtain a more accurate reading.
The Wheatstone deflection bridge is a type of instrument used to measure electrical resistance changes in a circuit. It is made up of four resistive elements, which are two strain gauges (R1 and R4) connected in series with two fixed resistors (R2 and R3). The bridge is powered by a voltage source (V), and a voltmeter (VM) is used to measure the voltage across the bridge's output terminals (VO). Once the bridge is properly balanced, no voltage output is produced.
When a force is applied to the cantilever beam, it leads to the deformation of the beam and hence to a change in resistance in the strain gauge. The change in resistance results in an unbalance in the Wheatstone bridge, which produces an output voltage. The magnitude of the voltage output is proportional to the force applied to the beam.
The operational amplifier is used to amplify the output voltage of the Wheatstone deflection bridge. The amplifier reduces any noise and amplifies the signal to obtain a more accurate reading. The low-pass filter is used to filter out any unwanted high-frequency noise and maintain a stable output voltage.
To increase the sensitivity of the system, two strain gauges are used instead of one. The two strain gauges are placed on the opposite side of the beam from each other. When a force is applied to the beam, one gauge experiences tensile stress, while the other experiences compressive stress. The two strains add up, resulting in a more significant strain reading and hence a more sensitive system.
The output voltage of the two strain gauges can be determined by taking the voltage difference between the two gauges. The voltage difference is directly proportional to the force applied to the beam. The relationship between the output voltage and the applied force is given by the equation:
F = K (VO/Vexc)
Where F is the applied force, K is the gauge factor, which is a constant value that depends on the strain gauge characteristics, VO is the output voltage, and Vexc is the excitation voltage.
To determine the range of the force sensor, assumptions are made about the material properties of the cantilever beam. The material properties considered include the Young's modulus and fatigue strength of the beam. The Young's modulus refers to the measure of the stiffness of the material and its resistance to deformation under stress. On the other hand, the fatigue strength is the maximum amount of stress a material can withstand before failure.
The range of the force sensor can be calculated using the following equation:
Fmax = Smax * A
Where Fmax is the maximum force the beam can handle, Smax is the maximum stress the beam can experience before failure, and A is the cross-sectional area of the beam. The maximum stress is calculated using the formula:
Smax = My / I
Where My is the maximum bending moment the beam can handle, and I is the moment of inertia of the beam. The maximum bending moment that the beam can handle is calculated as:
My = (W * L)/2
Where W is the weight or load applied to the end of the beam, and L is the length of the beam.

The circuit diagram shows a typical Wheatstone deflection bridge. It consists of four resistive elements, which are two strain gauges (R1 and R4) connected in series with two fixed resistors (R2 and R3). The bridge is powered by a voltage source (V) and a voltmeter (VM) is used to measure the voltage across the bridge's output terminals (VO).
The amplifier used to provide an appropriate output voltage is an operational amplifier. The operational amplifier is connected to the Wheatstone bridge and is used to amplify the output voltage of the bridge. The amplifier is selected based on the desired gain of the system.
In conclusion, strain gauges are essential components used to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam. A Wheatstone deflection bridge, an operational amplifier, and a low-pass filter are used to amplify the output voltage of the strain gauge to obtain a more accurate reading. The sensitivity of the system is increased by using two strain gauges. The range of the force sensor is calculated by considering the material properties of the cantilever beam such as the Young's modulus and fatigue strength. The Wheatstone bridge's circuit diagram shows a typical configuration used to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam. Overall, strain gauges provide an effective, practical, and reliable means of measuring the force applied to a cantilever beam.
