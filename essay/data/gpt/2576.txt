The Aeneid, written by the Roman poet Virgil, is an epic poem that tells of the founding of Rome through the journey of its hero Aeneas. Aeneas’s portrayal as a model for Roman citizenship and heroism is a central theme in the poem. This essay will explore the ways in which Virgil uses Aeneas to embody Roman values of duty, piety, and courage, and how this differs from the portrayal of heroism in Greek epics such as Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.
One of the key ways in which Aeneas embodies Roman values is through his sense of duty. Aeneas is a Trojan prince, survivor of the Trojan War, who is destined to found a new city. Throughout the poem, Aeneas remains steadfast in his duty to fulfill this destiny, despite the many setbacks and obstacles he encounters on his journey. For example, when he is shipwrecked on the shores of Carthage, he resists the temptation to settle down and abandon his quest. Instead, he says, “We Trojans have a destiny, a duty to perform…To build the city of Troy again, and bring our gods to Latium, there to establish them, that is our mission.” Aeneas’s unwavering commitment to his duty to found a new city is a reflection of Roman values of duty and responsibility.
In addition to his sense of duty, Aeneas also embodies Roman piety. Roman piety was a moral virtue that emphasized reverence for the gods and devotion to one’s family and country. Aeneas is depicted as a pious hero who is committed to doing the will of the gods. For example, in Book III, he is commanded by the god Mercury to leave Carthage and continue his journey to Italy. Aeneas does not question this command; instead, he immediately sets out to fulfill the god’s will. Similarly, when he reaches Italy, he consults the oracle of Apollo to learn how he can win the favor of the gods and fulfill his destiny. Aeneas’s piety and devotion to the gods reflect Roman values of duty, loyalty, and respect for higher powers.
Finally, Aeneas embodies Roman courage on the battlefield. Throughout the poem, Aeneas participates in several battles against enemy forces, during which he displays his bravery and skill as a warrior. His heroic actions on the battlefield serve as a model for Roman soldiers and citizens, demonstrating the importance of courage and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of victory. For example, in Book X, Aeneas leads his troops in a fierce battle against the Latins. Despite being outnumbered, he fights valiantly and inspires his men to fight on, declaring, “The victory is Atlas’ to give, but effort alone is ours” (X.708-09). Aeneas’s courage in battle embodies Roman ideals of military valor and strength.
In contrast to the portrayal of heroism in Greek epics such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, Aeneas’s heroism is characterized by a sense of duty, piety, and courage that is distinctly Roman. In the Iliad, for instance, the warrior-hero Achilles is driven by a desire for personal honor and glory, rather than a sense of duty to his country or devotion to the gods. Achilles’s actions are motivated by his individualistic desires, and his conflict with Agamemnon is based on his desire for greater recognition rather than a sense of obligation to the greater good. Similarly, in the Odyssey, Odysseus’s heroism is defined by his cunning and ability to outsmart his enemies, rather than by a sense of duty or devotion to the gods. Odysseus’s focus on his own survival and desire to return home stand in contrast to Aeneas’s commitment to fulfilling his destiny and founding a new city.
Another key difference between Aeneas and the heroes of Greek epic poetry is that Aeneas embodies civic virtues that are central to Roman identity. Roman values of duty, piety, and courage are grounded in a sense of community and collective identity. Aeneas’s role as a leader and founder of a new city reflects his obligation to his people and his commitment to the greater good. By contrast, the heroes of Greek epic poetry tend to be individualistic, focusing on personal glory and honor rather than on the common good. In this sense, Aeneas’s heroism reflects the values of the Roman Republic, which were based on the importance of civic virtue and the common good.
In conclusion, the character of Aeneas serves as a model for Roman citizenship and heroism in Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid. Through his unwavering sense of duty, his piety and devotion to the gods, and his courage on the battlefield, Aeneas embodies the classic Roman virtues of responsibility, loyalty, and strength. This portrayal of heroism stands in contrast to the individualistic heroes of Greek epic poetry, emphasizing the importance of civic virtues and collective identity in Roman culture. As such, Aeneas’s journey to found a new city serves as an enduring symbol of the Roman Republic’s commitment to the common good and to the values that have come to define the foundations of western civilization.
