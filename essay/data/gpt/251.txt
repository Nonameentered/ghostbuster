The case of Donoghue v Stevenson was a landmark case in the history of English law that had a significant impact on the development of the tort of negligence. The case involved a woman, Mrs. Donoghue, who became ill after drinking ginger beer that contained a decomposed snail. She sued the manufacturer of the ginger beer, Mr. Stevenson, for damages. The case ultimately resulted in the establishment of the "neighbour principle" and the recognition of the duty of care owed by manufacturers to consumers. Lord Atkin, Lord Macmillan, and Lord Buckmaster played pivotal roles in shaping the outcome and subsequent application of the case.
Before the Donoghue v Stevenson case, the law of negligence was not well-defined in English law. The court had previously considered an individual's "right to safety" when damages resulted from incidents of negligence. However, the case of Donoghue v Stevenson marked the expansion of the law's scope; liability extended from the narrow confines of vertical relationships between parties, such as employer and employee, to the horizontal relationships between parties to which the neighbour principle was applied.
The neighbour principle was a concept developed by Lord Atkin, where he identified that every individual was a neighbour to another individual with whom they had necessary or intended contact, and therefore there arose a duty of care towards that person to protect them from risks of harm. Lord Atkin's neighbour principle moved the law of negligence away from precedent-based rulings towards a legal principle that could be applied on a case-by-case basis. He noted, "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour."
The neighbour principle was fundamental for the expansion of the tort of negligence, as it provided a clear framework that the court could use to assess the relationship between parties. The principle of proximate cause, which is crucial in the tort of negligence, also became a part of the neighbour principle. One of the significant criticisms of the prior law was that it did not address the causation element of the negligence claim. However, with the neighbour principle, the causation element was considered, because the duty of care owed by the defendant could not exceed the scope of the liability imposed by the duty or the resulting harm considered.
The neighbour principle was not the only concept that came out of the Donoghue v Stevenson decision. Lord Atkin's opinion also included others that would impact the development of English law and the tort of negligence. For instance, his principle of foreseeability established that defendants could only be held liable for damages resulting from harm that they could reasonably foresee.
Lord Macmillan, in his opinion, addressed the liability of manufacturers to consumers in the age where mass production of goods was becoming common. Lord Macmillan recognized the contemporary purpose of the law of negligence as the protection of the victim and the restriction of liability. He extended reasoning from the decision in Mullen v A.G. Barr, where it was held that a soft drink manufacturer had a duty of care towards customers, to the case of Donoghue. He concluded that there was no such distinction to be made where the consumer was the immediate customer, and extended the breach of duty to include the manufacturer also.
Lord Buckmaster expressed a sceptical view that seemed somewhat divergent from the other two Lords. He stated that the decision in the case was "not an easy case to decide," though concluded that the matter of concern amply subject to an action in negligence. In his opinion, the plaintiff pushed the boundaries too far because there was no contractual relationship between her and the manufacturer to give rise to other sources of potential liability also.
The opinions of these lords shaped the outcome of the case and would go on to influence future legal developments. The majority opinion formed the basis for consumer protection in England and other countries, including the United States, where the "neighbour principle" is commonly known under the name "reasonable care."
The decision in the Donoghue v Stevenson case established that manufacturers owed a duty of care to their immediate consumers, which transformed the way that businesses operated and the way that consumers used products. Manufacturers were required to ensure that their products were safe and would not harm the consumers who used them. The duty of care extended to the entire supply chain of the product and did not only affect the manufacturer. Suppliers, distributors, and retailers also had a duty to ensure that the product was safe for use by consumers and that all possible risks had been addressed.
The impact of the Donoghue v Stevenson case was far-reaching and has had a significant influence on jurisprudence. The case, which had begun with the simple question of whether a manufacturer owed a duty of care to a consumer, is now celebrated as an example of the common law tradition, a decision that was a "comfortably logical" and wholly reasonable one. Not only did the case become an iconic precedent-setting for law, but it also impacted society as a whole and led to the creation of legislature to protect people from unsafe products. 
In conclusion, the Donoghue v Stevenson case has had a vast impact on English law and the development of the tort of negligence. The case established the "neighbour principle" and the duty of care that manufacturers owe to consumers. It moved the scope of the law away from precedent-based rulings towards a principle that could be applied on a case-by-case basis. The impact of the decision on the law of negligence, as well as broader society, cannot be overstated. Lord Atkin's contribution was significant in establishing the neighbour principle, Lord Macmillan's recognition of the duty of care extended to manufacturers, and Lord Buckmaster's opinions helped shape the outcome of the case. The decision was a turning point in the legal system, bringing in the age of mass production, and creating new grounds for negligence claims in the future, and still, serves as a foundational precedent in common law today.
