Introduction:
The field of international relations has witnessed a range of theoretical approaches over time to understand the dynamics of international politics. While there have been many theories of international relations, neo-realism has emerged as one of the most influential perspectives. Neo-realism is an offshoot of classical realism, which dates back to the time of Thucydides. Neo-realism chose to reject some of the assumptions of classical realism on the grounds of taking a more structural view of the international system. In essence, neo-realism argues that international politics is dictated primarily by the structure of the international system, rather than the actions of individual states. While it has its merits, neo-realism has conceptual flaws, which this essay seeks to discuss.
Theoretical Overview of Neo-Realism:
Neo-realism theory is also known as Structural Realism coined by Kenneth Waltz, who was one of the founding fathers of the theory. Neo-realism follows the paradigm of scientific realism and asserts that the international system is anarchic, with no governing authority that exists above different nations. Furthermore, states are considered to be the primary actors in this system. In neo-realism, realism’s classic assumptions are refined to facilitate a deeper understanding of international politics in its own right. According to neo-realism, states are self-interested, unitary actors, who operate solely in the pursuit of their national interest. This interest is pursued within an environment where international politics is driven by state-centric factors such as power, security, and survival. The emphasis is largely on state actions, their interactions within the international system, and how conditions impact the balance of power. In this way, neo-realism attempts to identify general patterns in international relations. As a structural theory, neo-realism emphasizes that systemic factors often influence individual actors rather than similarly large groups of actors.
Conceptual Flaws of Neo-Realism:
While neo-realism has contributed significantly to the understanding of international politics in many ways, it has some conceptual flaws as well, which affect the theory’s ability to account for or understand certain aspects of the international system. These conceptual flaws of neo-realism can be classified into three main categories.
1. Overlooking Human Factors:
One of the key criticisms of neo-realism is that it overlooks human factors in international politics. According to neo-realism individuals are not important, and decisions of a state are not dictated by human factors. Instead, neo-realism sees states as the primary actors in international politics and assumes that they act independently of the individuals that comprise them. The state is considered a monolithic unit that is self-interested, unitary, and concerned about its survival in international relations. Therefore, neo-realism tends to assume that governments operate according to a fixed set of rules and principles. The assumption is that states act rationally, prudently, and regardless of the personal beliefs of individual leaders or decisions taken by other states. Thus, it overlooks the significance of leadership qualities, personal beliefs, and ideologies, which shape state decisions. It also ignores the role of domestic politics, which could affect foreign policies. The theory puts a disproportionate emphasis on the balance of power and military capabilities and disregards diplomatic relations, alliances, and other factors that do not relate to the balancing of power. In essence, human factors are far too important to be disregarded as they shape the dynamics of international relations.
2. Ignoring Changes in State Interests:
The second conceptual flaw of neo-realism is its short-sightedness regarding changes in the interests of a state. According to neo-realism, the state is primarily concerned about its own survival in the anarchical international system. Thus, state interests do not change, but instead, the state adjusts its behavior according to the situation to preserve its security. States are required to maintain their power capabilities to ensure their survival even if it means engaging in violent propositions. Since neo-realism focuses on the distribution of power and balance of power, the theory is unable to account for the fluctuation in state interests and how they might impact state behavior. It fails to take into account, the possibility of political changes in states, shifts in public opinion, changes in the economy, etc., which affect state interests. Also, it assumes that states have only one security interest and exclude other political, economic, or environmental issues that may impact state interests. Furthermore, Neo-realism doesn't account for how regional institutions, international regimes, and domestic pressures influence state interests; for example, the recent shift of countries moving towards green policies and abandoning crude oil exploitation as their mainstay material for exportation.
3. Limitation in Explaining Co-operation:
The final conceptual flaw of neo-realism is its inability to account for cooperation and the relative reduction of conflict in international relations. According to neo-realism, anarchy and the competition for power are essential features of the international system, making conflict and competition inevitable in international politics. However, many instances contradict this assumption, and on the contrary, it appears that states are more likely to cooperate. It is not uncommon for states to cooperate on matters such as environmental protection, disarmament, trade, and human rights despite having competing interests in other areas of their relationship. Cooperation defies what neo-realism assumes about state behavior. While neo-realism emphasizes the balance of power as a means of regulating power relations and the anarchical structure of the international system, it does not explain why states opt for cooperative, rather than confrontational measures to address shared problems.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the neo-realism theory has made a significant contribution to international politics. Neo-realism has been responsible for providing a structural framework for understanding the international system that has led to significant contributions in related fields such as peace and conflict studies. However, the flaws in the theory limit its ability to explain certain behaviors and aspects of international politics. The oversimplification of the decision-making process concerning policy and international events is worrisome, leading to an incomplete grasp of the dynamics of international politics. The flaws of neo-realism in international politics undermine the importance of a holistic and robust theoretical structure on which to base the management of global relations. A more nuanced and realistic analytical framework of International Relations is needed by integrating the more intricate and dynamic elements of international political dynamics to advance a more credible alternative to neo-realism.
