Language is the primary means of communication for humans, and the ability to communicate effectively is necessary not only for personal development but also for social and professional growth. The acquisition of language starts from early childhood, where children learn to speak, read, and write. As they grow older, they are taught the formal rules of language through formal education. However, the way they learn spoken language differs from how they are taught to read and write. This essay will explore how children learn spoken language and how they are taught to read and write and highlight the differences between the two processes.
Children learn to speak a language through their immersion in a community where adults and other children communicate in the same language. They develop their language skills mainly through their interactions with people in their environment, such as parents, siblings, and caregivers. They start by listening to sounds, then progress to words and phrases they hear in their everyday lives. Often, children learn the form and meaning of words without explicit instruction, through imitation, repetition, and observation. Spoken language also has its rules regarding pronunciation, intonation, and syntax, which children learn naturally from the context of social interaction.
In contrast, children are taught to read and write through formal lessons and explicit instruction. In this process, they learn the rules of language through structured learning in classrooms and reading materials. Reading and writing involve a complex set of skills, including decoding symbols, comprehension, vocabulary knowledge, and grammar understanding. Children acquire these skills through direct teaching and practice. For instance, they learn phonics, sight words, and grammar rules through reading instruction and practice writing through essay prompts, journaling, and other writing activities.
The difference between how children learn spoken language and how they are taught to read and write can be attributed to their nature and scope. Speaking a language is an innate skill, which helps children to communicate and interact with others. It is a non-artificial process, meaning that no formal instruction is necessary for the acquisition of language. On the other hand, reading and writing are skills that are not naturally acquired but learned and taught through a structured and deliberate process.
Spoken language is also dynamic and adaptable. Children have an immense learning capacity, which enables them to learn multiple languages and dialects naturally. They can change their language use according to their audience, context, and purpose, making it a highly adaptive skill. In contrast, reading and writing are formal and rigid processes with strict rules and regulations. Learning to read and write proficiently requires a dedicated effort from both the child and the teacher.
Moreover, spoken language is based on the child's oral development, meaning that there are no universally accepted standards for linguistic development or age-appropriate milestones. In contrast, reading and writing follow a standardized curriculum and developmental model for teaching and assessing a child's mastery of the skills. Children's progress in literacy is measured by comparing their skills to specific milestones outlined in the curriculum.
In conclusion, children learn spoken language and are taught to read and write in different ways. Learning spoken language is a natural process that does not require formal instruction, while learning to read and write is a highly structured and deliberate process. Spoken language is a dynamic and adaptable skill that children learn through their immersion in the language community, while reading and writing are formal skills taught through deliberate instruction. Understanding the differences between these two processes can help parents and teachers develop effective strategies for language development in children.
