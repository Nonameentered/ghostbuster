Introduction
Negligence is a liability that arises from a failure to meet the required standard of care, causing harm or damages to another person. The tort of negligence has three crucial elements that must be proven before a plaintiff can successfully bring a claim. These elements are duty of care, breach of duty, and causation. The duty of care refers to an obligation to take reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. Breach of duty occurs when the defendant fails to meet the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. Causation is the link between the defendant's breach of duty and the plaintiff's loss or harm. This essay will discuss these elements in detail and explore when duty of care exists. Additionally, the essay will provide examples of scenarios where these elements apply, as well as discuss the difficulties in proving breach of duty.
Duty of Care
The duty of care refers to the legal obligation to take reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. When a person owes a duty of care to another, they are required to act in a way that does not create an unreasonable risk of harm. The duty of care is established when a person engages in conduct that could reasonably foresee causing harm to others. The courts use the reasonable person test to determine whether a duty of care exists. This test establishes the degree of care owed by the defendant, taking into consideration the reasonable person's standard. 
There are various examples of where duty of care exists. For instance, in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, a manufacturer of ginger beer was held liable for the harm caused to a consumer who found a dead snail in her bottle of beer. The manufacturer was held negligent as they owed a duty of care to the consumer to ensure that their product was safe for consumption. This case established the principle of the neighbour principle, which states that a person owes a duty of care to their neighbour, who is any person who is reasonably foreseeable to be affected by their actions or omissions. 
Another example is the duty of care owed by professionals, such as doctors or lawyers. Professionals are held to a higher standard of care due to their area of expertise and the trust and reliance placed on them by their clients or patients. In Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee, a hospital was held not liable for the harm caused to a patient who suffered from a broken leg during electroconvulsive therapy. The court held that the hospital was not negligent as they had acted in accordance with the medical profession's standard and provided the patient with the information necessary for them to make an informed decision. This case established the Bolam test, which states that a professional will not be held negligent if they acted in accordance with a responsible body of opinion within their profession.
Breach of Duty
Breach of duty occurs when a defendant fails to meet the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. The standard of care is based on what a reasonable person would have done in similar circumstances. A breach of duty may be established if the defendant's conduct falls short of the standard of care required. The plaintiff must prove that the defendant's conduct was below the standard of care owed to them.
Proving a breach of duty can be challenging as it requires demonstrating that the defendant failed to meet the expected standard of care. In some cases, the standard of care may be unclear, making it difficult to determine whether there has been a breach. In other cases, the defendant may argue that they have taken reasonable care, making it challenging for the plaintiff to prove that a breach has occurred.
An example of a scenario where breach of duty occurred is in the case of Nettleship v. Weston. In this case, a learner driver's instructor was held liable for the damage caused to the car when the learner crashed into a lamppost. The court held that the instructor had breached their duty of care by allowing a learner to drive on a busy road. The instructor was held to the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent driver. 
Causation
Causation refers to the link between the defendant's breach of duty and the plaintiff's loss or harm. The plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions or omissions caused their loss or harm. The causation principle requires proving both factual causation and legal causation. Factual causation means that the plaintiff's loss or harm would not have occurred if the defendant had not breached their duty of care. Legal causation means that the breach of duty was the proximate, or near, cause of the plaintiff's loss or harm.
Proving causation can be challenging, particularly in cases where there are multiple causes of the plaintiff's loss or harm. In some cases, the plaintiff may have contributed to their loss or harm, making it difficult to establish causation.
An example of a scenario where causation occurred is in the case of Barnett v. Chelsea and Kensington Hospital Management Committee. In this case, a man died from arsenic poisoning as a result of the hospital's negligent diagnosis of his illness. The court held that the hospital was not liable for his death as the man's condition was so severe that he would have died even if he had received proper medical treatment.
Difficulties in Proving Breach of Duty
Proving breach of duty can be challenging, as it requires establishing that the defendant acted below the standard of care required in the circumstances. The standard of care is not always clear, making it difficult to determine when a breach has occurred. Additionally, the defendant may argue that they have taken reasonable care, making it difficult for the plaintiff to prove that there has been a breach. 
An example of a scenario where proving breach of duty is challenging is in the case of Bolitho v. City and Hackney Health Authority. In this case, a baby suffered from brain damage and was left severely disabled as a result of the negligence of the hospital staff. The court held that the hospital was negligent as the medical opinion relied on by the hospital did not withstand logical analysis. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, the tort of negligence requires proving three crucial elements: duty of care, breach of duty, and causation. Duty of care refers to the legal obligation to take reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. Breach of duty occurs when the defendant fails to meet the standard of care owed to the plaintiff. Causation is the link between the defendant's breach of duty and the plaintiff's loss or harm. Proving breach of duty can be difficult as it requires demonstrating that the defendant acted below the expected standard of care. The standard of care is not always clear, and the defendant may argue that they have taken reasonable care, making it challenging for the plaintiff to prove a breach. It is important to establish these elements to hold parties accountable for their actions, maintain the safety of society, and ensure that justice is achieved.
