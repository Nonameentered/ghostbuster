Judicial review is a foundational principle of modern democracies that serves to check the power of government and ensure the protection of individual rights. This process, which involves review by an independent judiciary of the lawfulness of actions taken by public authorities, is a key aspect of administrative law. A key principle of judicial review is that administrative decision-making must adhere to procedural fairness, which requires the decision-maker to follow established procedures, hear all relevant evidence, and make decisions based on the facts and evidence before them. This essay will examine the principles of judicial review and their application in the context of two scenarios involving decisions made by ABC College and will also discuss the grounds on which these decisions could be challenged.
Scenario 1: ABC College Student Disciplinary Actions
ABC College is a university with a student population of approximately 10,000 students. One of the key services that the College provides to students is the issuance of discipline for violation of College policies, and those policies require that the College conduct a fair and impartial disciplinary hearing before making any disciplinary decision.
In a recent incident, several students were accused of cheating on an exam. The college launched an investigation, and eventually, the three students involved were identified and called for a disciplinary hearing. The students were given notice of the charges against them and provided with an opportunity to respond to these charges. However, the hearing was conducted in an informal manner, with little procedural safeguards and no legal representation allowed for the accused students.
The decision of the disciplinary committee was to suspend all three students from school for one year. The students now claim that the decision was arbitrary and capricious, with little regard for their rights to a fair hearing.
Analysis
The students affected by the actions of the disciplinary committee at ABC College may have grounds for challenging the decision through the process of judicial review. The first issue that can be raised relates to procedural fairness, which requires the decision-maker to follow established procedures, hear all relevant evidence, and make decisions based on the facts and evidence before them. In this case, the disciplinary hearing was conducted in an informal manner, with little procedural safeguard and no legal representation allowed for the accused students.
For disciplinary hearings, the parties must be given advance notice of the charges against them, be given an opportunity to be heard, and be given a chance to provide evidence on their behalf. The accused students had a right to be heard in an impartial hearing, where they had the opportunity to present their case before an unbiased decision-maker. Without legal representation, the accused students were clearly at a disadvantage in presenting their case. Therefore, the disciplinary committee may have acted unlawfully by failing to follow the principles of procedural fairness.
In addition to procedural unfairness, there may also be an issue with respect to the grounds on which the decision was made. The decision may be arbitrary and capricious if it is based on factors that are irrelevant to the matter at hand or if the decision is not based on a rational consideration of the relevant factors. In this case, the decision of the disciplinary committee may be considered capricious as it was not based on any rational consideration of the evidence.
Moreover, the accused students may have had a legitimate expectation that the disciplinary hearing would be conducted in a fair and impartial manner. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is based on the proposition that a decision-maker must take into account the reasonable expectation of the individual who is affected by the decision. The accused students may have reasonably expected that the disciplinary hearing would be conducted in a fair and impartial manner, and with legal representation when allowed to do so. Thus, the disciplinary committee may be considered to have acted unlawfully by failing to meet these reasonable expectations.
Scenario 2: ABC College Admission Policy
ABC College is a prestigious institution that attracts students from around the world. The college has an admission policy that gives preference to students who come from certain geographic regions or who have a family history of attending the college. The college believes that this policy ensures that it maintains a diverse student body.
One student who applied to the college was denied admission, despite excellent grades and test scores. The student believes that the college’s admission policy is unfair and discriminatory. The student feels that the college has denied them admission on the basis of factors that are unrelated to their academic qualifications.
Analysis
The student affected by the admission policy of ABC College may have grounds for challenging the decision through the process of judicial review. The first issue that can be raised relates to the substantive fairness, which requires that the decision of the College must be based on rational and relevant criteria.
In this case, one may argue with the admission policy violates the principles of substantive fairness as the student was not admitted based on rational and relevant criteria. The student had excellent grades and test scores, which are relevant to the admission decision. However, the college admitted other students who have lower academic qualifications simply because of their geographic region or family history of attending the college. This admission policy may be considered arbitrary since it is not based on any rational consideration of the student’s qualifications.
Moreover, the actions of the college may also be considered to be discriminatory. The college may have breached the right to equality by giving preference to those from certain geographic regions or who have a family history of attending the college, while discriminating against the students who do not fall within these categories.
The doctrine of proportionality requires that public authorities must only interfere with the fundamental rights of individuals when it is proportionate and necessary to do so. In this case, the college’s policy may impede the fundamental right to equality as it discriminates against certain students based on grounds prohibited by law. Therefore, the decision of the college may be considered unlawful according to the doctrine of proportionality.
Lastly, natural justice has a significant role in issues affecting administrative law. There are two principles under natural justice, the right to be heard, and the right to a biased-free decision-maker. The College’s admission policy must be transparent and fair. The Applicant may challenge the admission decision made by the ABC College, which has not adhered to the principles of natural justice.
Conclusion
Judicial review is a significant process in administrative law that serves to protect the rights of individuals affected by public authorities' decisions. Courts review public authority decisions based on procedural fairness, substantive fairness, proportionality, legitimate expectation, and natural justice. The summaries of both scenarios discussed in this essay have shown that the decisions made by ABC College may have been arbitrary, capricious, and unfair, and therefore challenging those decisions through judicial review may be justified. Adherence to the principles of judicial review by public authorities such as ABC College provides protection of the individual fundamental rights. So, understanding and applying these principles is critical in maintaining the balance of administrative law.
