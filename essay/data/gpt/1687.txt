Indian poetry written in English is significant because it represents a confluence of two cultures. English, a language that was once used to colonize India, has been adapted and molded by Indian poets to give voice to their experiences, emotions, and thoughts. Through their poetry, Indian poets have provided a window into the multifaceted Indian identity and have made it accessible to people all over the world.
One of the distinguishing features of Indian poetry written in English is its use of the poetic line. The idea that a poem is formed by the spaces in its lines as much as by the words is particularly relevant to Indian poets, who use the line break to convey meaning and emotion. The line break can be used to create tension, irony, or ambiguity, and can be used to explore the ideas of tradition, identity, and change.
The use of the line break in Indian poetry written in English can be seen in the works of various poets. In 'The Indian Serenade' by Percy Bysshe Shelley, which was translated into English from the original Sanskrit, the poet uses the line break to create a sense of longing and desire in the poem. The first two lines of the poem read: 
"I arise from dreams of thee
In the morning's solitude;"
The line break between "thee" and "In" creates a pause, which draws attention to the fact that the speaker's thoughts are interrupted by the realization that they are alone. The line break is also significant in the third and fourth lines of the poem:
"When the breath of day returns,
With its countless wakes and woes."
The line break between "returns" and "With" creates a sense of contrast between the speaker's desire for their loved one and the realities of the day. This contrast highlights the speaker's feelings of isolation and the longing for companionship.
Another example of the use of line breaks in Indian poetry written in English can be seen in the works of Rabindranath Tagore. In his poem 'The Gardener', Tagore uses the line break to express the speaker's innermost thoughts and emotions. For example, in the ninth stanza of the poem, the line break between "And" and "When" emphasizes the speaker's hesitation and uncertainty:
"And when I shall come to you
At last, my own,
Despairing of the world,
In seeking you alone,"
The line break creates a pause that reflects the speaker's hesitation, as they weigh the pros and cons of reaching out to their loved one. The line break between "ours" and "Lonely" in the tenth stanza also emphasizes the speaker's status as an outsider:
"In love I pay my endless debt to thee
For what thou art.
The debt is not yet paid,
But love is lonely. O Love, my own!"
The line break between "debt" and "But" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, as the speaker struggles to come to terms with their feelings of loneliness.
Overall, the use of line breaks in Indian poetry written in English is significant because it allows the poet to express themselves in a unique and impactful way. The line break can be used to create ambiguity, tension, and contrast, and can convey the nuances of the Indian experience. By using the line break to create meaning, Indian poets have demonstrated their understanding of the importance of the form in shaping the content of a poem.
In conclusion, Indian poetry written in English is significant because it represents a merging of two cultures and provides a unique perspective on the Indian experience. Through their poetry, Indian poets have used the line break to convey meaning and emotion in a way that is noticeable and impactful. The line break can be used to create tension, irony, or ambiguity, and can be used to explore the ideas of tradition, identity, and change. Thus, the significance of Indian poetry written in English lies in its ability to express the nuances of the Indian experience and to demonstrate the universality of artistic expression.
