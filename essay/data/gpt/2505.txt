The usability of any space is crucial for its effective utilization, and the same goes for Armstrong Siddeley Building. Wayfinding is an integral component of a buildingâ€™s usability, which, when done poorly, can lead to frustration and confusion among its occupants. The current wayfinding system in the Armstrong Siddeley Building has several usability issues that need to be addressed, and hence, a prototype redesign was created to overcome these problems.
Firstly, the current wayfinding system in the Armstrong Siddeley Building lacks consistency. The signage is not uniform, and there's no clear hierarchy of information. The signs vary in size, color, and positioning, which makes it difficult for visitors to discern important information. As a result, visitors may get lost or have a hard time finding their way, especially if they have never been to the building before. They may also miss critical information about safety protocols, meeting rooms, or washrooms.
Secondly, the current wayfinding system is not very user-friendly. The current signage uses technical jargon and abbreviations that can be confusing to the average person. The signs indicate information about the floor level, room numbers, and names, but there is no indication of the location of important amenities such as elevators, restrooms, or exits. A visitor may have to search around for these facilities, losing valuable time and patience.
Thirdly, the current wayfinding system does not consider people with visual impairment, which is a usability issue. The current signage has small fonts, which can be challenging to read for people with visual impairments. There are no tactile or visual cues for people with visual disabilities, making it difficult for them to navigate the building. This non-inclusive approach can discriminate against people with disabilities, who may require spatial information to navigate the building effectively.
Finally, the distance between the signs in the current wayfinding system is too far apart, making it hard to follow directions. As a result, visitors may waste time walking back and forth, searching for the desired room or facility. This issue can be frustrating, especially when time is a critical factor, and delays are costly.
To address these usability issues, a prototype redesign was created, which aimed to create a more consistent, user-friendly, and inclusive wayfinding system. The redesign incorporates several features, including:
1. Color-coded signage: The new prototype redesigned signage is color-coded to improve wayfinding. Different colors indicate different areas of the building, such as amenities, offices, or entrances. This approach creates a uniform visual hierarchy that assists visitors to navigate the building more efficiently.
2. Easy to read and understand signage: The new signage is designed with easily recognizable symbols and clear fonts. The information is indicated in a way that is easy to read and less technical language. The signage clearly indicates the direction to the desired room or facility, as well as the location of important amenities, like elevators and restrooms.
3. Inclusion of tactile signage: The new signage system has incorporated Braille or raised symbols on the signage. This feature assists occupants with visual disabilities to navigate the building and access amenities.
4. Reduced signage distance: The signage spacing in the prototype redesign is based on research for optimal positioning of signs. The new signage is adequately spaced, making it easier for visitors to see and follow the directions.
In conclusion, the current wayfinding system in the Armstrong Siddeley Building has several usability issues. These issues can lead to navigational errors, frustration, and decreased building satisfaction among its occupants. To address these usability problems, a prototype redesign was developed with a focus on consistency, user-friendly, and inclusive design. The new prototype redesign incorporates features, such as color-coded signage, easy-to-read symbols, tactile signage, and optimized spacing between the signs. These features are aimed at enhancing the usability and effectiveness of the wayfinding system. A well-designed wayfinding system contributes significantly to the user experience, making the building more efficient and effective.
