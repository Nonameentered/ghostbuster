Oral agreements between parties are a common practice in business and personal transactions. These agreements are legally binding and enforceable by law, but issues often arise when one party fails to uphold their end of the bargain or when disputes arise concerning the agreement. In the absence of a written contract, determining the terms and terms of an oral agreement can be challenging, and disputes can escalate into legal battles. This essay aims to explore the legal issues that arise when oral agreements are made between parties and how courts determine whether a constructive trust has been created in such cases.
One of the primary legal issues that arise when parties make oral agreements is the difficulty in establishing the terms of the agreement. Unlike written contracts, oral agreements are not documented, and the terms are not explicit. Disputes often arise when one party alleges that the terms of the agreement were different from what the other party claims. In such cases, the burden of proof falls on the party making the claim to provide sufficient evidence to establish the terms of the agreement. This can be challenging, and the lack of a written contract makes it challenging to determine the exact nature of the agreement and all parties' obligations.
Another legal issue that arises when oral agreements are made is the difficulty in enforcing them. When one party fails to uphold their end of the bargain, the other party is left with little recourse in the absence of a written contract. In such cases, the party seeking enforcement will have to prove the existence and terms of the agreement, which can be challenging and can result in delays, extensive legal costs, and potential losses.
In cases where oral agreements have been made, and disputes arise, courts may determine whether a constructive trust has been created. A constructive trust is a legal remedy that arises when one party holds property in trust for another party. In the context of oral agreements, a constructive trust may arise where one party is claiming that certain property is theirs based on an oral agreement established with the other party. For a constructive trust to be established, the party claiming an interest in the property must show that there was a mutual understanding or agreement between the parties that the property was to belong to the party making the claim.
Courts will consider several factors when determining whether a constructive trust has been created in cases involving oral agreements. One of the key factors that courts will consider is the parties' intentions when they entered into the agreement. The court will assess whether there was a mutual understanding or an agreement on the property's ownership between the parties. Other factors that courts may consider include whether the party claiming an interest in the property has made any contributions to the property's acquisition or maintenance.
In conclusion, oral agreements between parties can result in a myriad of legal issues, primarily when disputes arise concerning the agreement's terms. When such disputes arise, courts may determine whether a constructive trust has been created based on several factors, including the parties' intention when entering into the agreement. While oral agreements are legitimate and enforceable by law, it is always advisable to have a written contract that clearly outlines the terms of the agreement. Having a written contract helps to minimize the risks of disputes and litigations that often arise with oral agreements.
