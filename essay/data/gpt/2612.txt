Throughout the epic tradition, heroism has remained a constant theme. However, the nature of heroism and heroic figures has undergone significant changes, from the era of Homer to Lucan's portrayal of Caesar in the 'Civil War.' The Greek heritage with Homer celebrated heroic figures, displaying their valor and strength on the battlefield, but through time, the nature of heroism became more complicated. The changing nature of heroism can be attributed to the social and political changes that took place across the centuries. This essay explores how the concept of heroism and heroic figures changed through time, discussing how various writers have portrayed heroes, their motivations, and how heroism evolved over time.
Homer's 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey' set the standards of heroic figures that would continue to be celebrated in the epic tradition for subsequent centuries. The characters of Achilles and Odysseus set the stage for epic poetry's heroic template. Achilles was the epitome of the warrior king, strong physically and politically dominant. The narrator celebrates him as "godlike" and "the best of all the Greeks" – characteristics that elevated him above humanity. Odysseus, on the other hand, was celebrated for his intelligence, quick-wittedness, and wit. Although both Achilles and Odysseus were heroes, they were very different – with distinct but complementary masculine qualities. 
As the years progressed, the concept of heroism became more complicated. In the transition from heroic literature to tragedy, the hero's perceived greatness was at times marred by flaws that led to their downfall. The tragic heroes of Sophocles and Euripides confront ethical dilemmas, making mistakes that ultimately contribute to their downfall. For example, Oedipus Rex, who kills his father and marries his mother, despite great intellectual knowledge fell from grace through tragic fate. Similarly, in Euripedes' play "Medea," the titular character, although strongly committed, also displays the ugliness of revenge.
On the other hand, Virgil's epic poem "The Aeneid" took a different direction, where the focus was on the hero's duty to their country and gods, rather than individual glory. The protagonist of Aeneas exemplified not the individualized glory that was celebrated in Homer, but rather the glory of the Roman empire as a whole. Aeneas was thus celebrated as a model of steadfastness, loyalty, and piety to the gods. The book highlights the journey that Aeneas undertakes on his quest to establish a new city, and through his determination and loyalty, he becomes the father of the Roman empire. Aeneas symbolized the ideal Roman hero who was more than just a powerful warrior but displayed the selflessness that was necessary for his community’s survival.
The nature of heroism underwent a significant transformation during the Middle Ages, where the Christian religion was infused into the epic tradition. The legend of King Arthur became a popular theme in literature, and the concept of chivalry, which encapsulated the virtues of Christian knights, became central to the heroic template. The idea of chivalry was centered on the virtues of courage, loyalty, and a commitment to a higher cause. Arthurian legends embodied an ideal of heroic figure inspired by Christianity, who fought for a just cause and a lady's love, backed by his moral and ethical principles. As a result, the idea of the hero evolved from the Homeric ideal of individual glory to the Medieval Christian idea of the hero who embodied servitude to a higher cause.
The medieval chivalric code began to evolve in the Renaissance, where the concept of the tragic hero returned, exemplified by William Shakespeare. The tragic hero in Shakespeare's plays exemplified arrogance, and their downfall was caused by their tragic flaw, usually hubris or blind ambition. The characters of Macbeth and King Lear exemplified these traits. Macbeth's tragic flaw was his blind ambition, while Lear's was his stubbornness. These tragic heroes were not perfect and often exhibited character flaws that contributed to their downfall. They were complex figures, humanized and relatable, making them empathetic to audiences. Shakespeare's tragic heroes reflected the emerging belief of the individual as central to human experience, suggesting that flawed heroes, though often fallen from grace, still deserved great respect.
In the 17th century, John Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost" explored religious and political dichotomy, and heroism took on a more humanistic dimension. The poem exemplified the concept that the heroic figure could be both flawed and persuasive. In "Paradise Lost," Milton explored the struggle between God and Satan and the complex motivations that drove them. He portrays Satan as a fallen angel who was once beloved by God. The audience is somewhat sympathetic to his cause despite his villainous drive, as his motivations are complex and multi-dimensional. In contrasting God and Satan, Milton creates a nuanced portrayal of heroism, suggesting that motive and context matter in determining the hero's role.
Finally, the concept of heroism was further evolving in the enlightenment. Enlightenment writers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Goethe reflected the shift in the focus of the heroic figure from politics to individual freedom, with heroism becoming associated with individualism and the triumph of human potential. The era's literary works celebrated the heroic individual who had a commitment to individual liberty, civil rights, and social justice. 
The shift to modernity saw the emergence of political heroism, where political philosophers replaced the religious philosopher as the basis for heroism. During the enlightenment, the political hero was enshrined as existing solely to achieve the greater good. With the French Revolution of the late 18th century, the heroic figure became a force for political upheaval as well as a vehicle for the people to express their political beliefs. The idea of the hero was now characterized by activism and revolution.
In the context of Julius Caesar, Lucan explores the hero as a political figure that represented the empire and was a fundamental extension of it. He frames Caesar's story as an account of what it means to be a hero in the context of state politics. Unlike in Homer, where the hero is a figure of individual greatness, Lucan's Caesar is a political figure who embodies both courage and cruelty. Unlike Virgil’s Aeneas and the romantic chivalric heroes, Caesar is complex, ambitious, and calculating.
In conclusion, the nature of heroism has evolved over time, shifting from the heroic figures that celebrated individual greatness, such as Achilles, to more nuanced interpretations like Sophocles and Shakespeare's tragic figures. Chivalry in the Medieval Ages gave rise to Christian knights and a complex moral code of servitude, while Milton saw heroes as flawed and nuanced. The enlightenment brought about political heroism, with Rousseau and Voltaire reflecting how individualism became central to human progress. Lucan's Julius Caesar exemplified the nature of 'heroism' as a political figure, whereby he embodied both courage and cruelty. Hence, the nature of heroism reflects the society and cultures that gave rise to the heroic figures. Heroism will ultimately continue to evolve as society changes, reflecting the values that societies hold dear.
