In Elizabethan and Stuart England, attitudes towards the deserving and undeserving poor shaped policies towards the poor. These attitudes were motivated by both moral concerns and economic interests. In this essay, I will explore how these attitudes influenced policies towards the poor and the extent to which moral concerns and economic interests were driving factors.
In Elizabethan and Stuart England, poverty was widespread, and the poor were seen as a burden on society. However, there was a distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor. The deserving poor were those who were unable to work due to age, disability, or illness, while the undeserving poor were seen as lazy and unwilling to work. This distinction was rooted in the belief that poverty was a result of individual moral failings rather than societal conditions.
The idea of deserving and undeserving poor was reflected in the Poor Laws, which were introduced in the Elizabethan era. These laws aimed to provide relief for the poor and were motivated by both moral concerns and economic interests. The moral concern was to provide relief for the deserving poor, while the economic interest was to prevent social unrest.
The Poor Laws were not solely motivated by moral concerns. They were also shaped by economic interests, particularly the need for a stable workforce. The Poor Laws required employers to provide for their employees, which ensured a stable workforce and prevented social unrest. However, it also meant that the cost of providing relief fell on individual employers.
The Poor Laws also reflect the belief that poverty was a result of individual moral failings. The Poor Laws required the deserving poor to work in return for relief, while the undeserving poor were punished. Punishments included being placed in a House of Correction or forced to work in a workhouse. This punishment was seen as a deterrent and a way of forcing the undeserving poor to work.
The attitudes towards the deserving and undeserving poor also influenced the development of the workhouse system in the 17th century. The workhouse was designed to provide relief for the poor while also punishing the undeserving poor. The workhouse provided food and shelter, but conditions were deliberately harsh to deter the undeserving poor. This punishment was seen as a way of forcing the undeserving poor to work and to discourage people from relying on relief.
However, the workhouse system was not solely motivated by moral concerns. It was also driven by economic interests. The workhouse system provided a way of controlling the cost of relief and ensuring a stable workforce. By forcing the poor to work, the workhouse system ensured that the cost of providing relief fell on the poor rather than on individual employers.
The workhouse also reflected the belief that poverty was a result of individual moral failings. The workhouse was designed to be a place of punishment and deterrence, rather than a place of relief. The conditions were deliberately harsh to discourage the poor from relying on relief and to encourage them to find work.
However, the workhouse system was not without its problems. The conditions were harsh, and there were concerns about the mistreatment of the poor. Some people saw the workhouse system as cruel and inhumane, and there were calls for reform.
Overall, policies towards the poor in Elizabethan and Stuart England were shaped by attitudes towards the deserving and undeserving poor. These attitudes were motivated by both moral concerns and economic interests. The Poor Laws and the workhouse system were designed to provide relief for the deserving poor while punishing the undeserving poor. They were also driven by economic interests, particularly the need for a stable workforce and the cost of providing relief.
However, these policies were not without their problems. The conditions in the workhouse were harsh, and there were concerns about the mistreatment of the poor. There was also a lack of support for the deserving poor, with relief falling primarily on individual employers. Despite these issues, policies towards the poor were shaped by attitudes towards the deserving and undeserving poor, and the balance between moral concerns and economic interests.
