Erving Goffman's "Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients" and Sam Porter's "Critical Realist Ethnography: The Case of Racism and Professionalism in a Medical Setting" are two studies that present different approaches to research, but share the objective of examining social situations and interactions within specific institutional contexts. While Goffman uses a sociological perspective to focus on the dilemma of mental patients, Porter uses a critical realist ethnography approach to explore the concept of racism and professionalism in a medical setting. This essay will compare and contrast Goffman's and Porter's studies, examining their theoretical and methodological assumptions, and the implications of their research focus and outcomes.
Erving Goffman's study "Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients" was first published in 1961. Goffman is considered one of the most significant figures in sociology, and his work has been instrumental in shaping modern sociological theories. In "Asylums," Goffman uses the concept of total institutions to explain the social situation of mental patients. According to Goffman, total institutions are organizations where a group of people reside in a controlled environment. In these institutions, the staff has complete control over their residents and regulates their behavior. Total institutions are designed to control and transform people, and in these institutions, individuals lose their identity and become part of a system.
Goffman argues that mental patients in asylums experience a loss of identity and individuality. Mental patients enter the institution with a sense of self but are stripped of their identity once they become part of the institution. In "Asylums," Goffman describes the dehumanization of mental patients, who are treated like objects and not individuals by staff and other patients. Goffman uses a sociological perspective to suggest that the social stigma attached to mental illness is the main reason for the dehumanization of mental patients. Being mentally ill is considered a social deviation, and therefore mental patients are socially rejected, stigmatized, and given a lower status in society. Goffman argues that mental patients are severely affected by stigma, and their autonomy and dignity are taken away from them once they enter the asylum.
Sam Porter's study, "Critical Realist Ethnography: The Case of Racism and Professionalism in a Medical Setting" was published in 2001. Porter's study also examines institutional behavior, but it does not focus on the institutionalization of individuals. Instead, Porter examines the social interactions between staff members in a medical setting. Porter argues that racism and professionalism are intertwined in medical practice, and systematic biases exist in the way doctors and nurses interact with people of different races.
Unlike Goffman, who uses a sociological perspective, Porter uses a critical realist ethnography approach. Critical Realist Ethnography (CRE) is a qualitative research method that combines elements of critical theory, realism, and ethnography. CRE focuses on the social structures and institutions that shape the world, aiming to uncover the social processes and mechanisms that drive human behavior. Critical realists assume that social reality is not straightforward but is influenced by social structures and other variables, such as culture, history, and power dynamics.
Porter's critical realist approach allows him to examine the complexities of racism in medical practice. Porter suggests that racism is not just an individual characteristic, but rather a structural aspect of the healthcare system. Porter uses CRE to identify certain social structures that influence the behavior of medical professionals when dealing with patients of different races. Racism, according to Porter, is a systematic bias that is inherent in medical practice, and it can have negative effects on patients' health outcomes.
The theoretical and methodological differences between Goffman and Porter's studies have significant implications for their research focus and outcomes. Goffman's study focuses on the asylums and the dehumanization of mental patients. Goffman's study is sociological, but he uses a theoretical framework that emphasizes the dehumanization of mental patients. Goffman's study is focused on the individual level, examining how mental patients lose their identity once they become part of the asylum system. Goffman's study is descriptive, aiming to explain the social situation of mental patients and the effects of social stigma on their autonomy and identity.
On the other hand, Porter's study examines the social interactions between medical professionals and patients of different races. Porter's study recognizes that racism is a systematic issue, and it is influenced by social structures and other factors that impact medical professionals' behavior. Porter's study is not focused on a particular institutional context but aims to examine the social process that drives medical professionals' behavior in the healthcare system. Porter's critical realist approach allows him to explore the complex nature of racism and professionalism in a medical setting.
The implications of these studies on research and practice are significant. Goffman's study shows that mental patients are socially stigmatized and subjected to dehumanizing experiences in asylums. Goffman's study is focused on mental illness, and it highlights the negative effects of social stigma on individuals' mental health and social status. Goffman's study has implications for public policy, especially for mental health policy, which needs to address the issue of social stigma attached to mental illness.
Porter's study is focused on racism and professionalism in a medical setting. Porter's study has important implications for healthcare policy, as it highlights the need to address the structural biases that exist in medical practice. Porter's study shows that racism is a systematic issue that impacts medical professionals' behavior, and this can have negative consequences on patients' health outcomes. Porter's study suggests that healthcare providers need to be trained to recognize their biases and address them to ensure that they provide equitable care to all patients.
In conclusion, the studies of Erving Goffman's "Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients" and Sam Porter's "Critical Realist Ethnography: The Case of Racism and Professionalism in a Medical Setting" are two important research studies that examine social interactions within institutional settings. These studies have different theoretical and methodological approaches, but they share the common goal of uncovering social processes and mechanisms that drive human behavior. The implications of these studies have significant implications for public policy and the healthcare system. Goffman's study highlights the negative effects of social stigma on the autonomy and identity of mental patients, while Porter's study shows the structural biases that exist in the healthcare system and their implications for patients' health outcomes. These studies suggest that addressing social structures and biases are important in promoting equity and social justice in society.
