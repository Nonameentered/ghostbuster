The first generation speculative attack model, developed in the 1970s, sought to explain the collapse of fixed exchange rate regimes by identifying the conditions under which it was profitable for speculators to attack a currency. The model has been widely used to explain currency crises, but it has several theoretical limitations that make it an incomplete explanation of why fixed exchange rate regimes fail. In this essay, we discuss these limitations and explore possible extensions to the model that could overcome them.
One limitation of the first generation speculative attack model is that it assumes that all agents have perfect information about the economic fundamentals that affect exchange rates. This assumption is unrealistic because information is often incomplete, asymmetric, and subject to manipulation. As a result, the model cannot explain why some currency crises occur even when economic fundamentals appear to be stable. For example, the Mexican peso crisis of 1994 caught many market players by surprise because the country had implemented sound economic policies, reduced inflation, and attracted foreign investment. However, the crisis occurred because investors suddenly became concerned about Mexico's ability to service its external debt, which was not reflected in the economic fundamentals at the time.
Another limitation of the model is that it assumes that all agents have common expectations about future exchange rate movements. This assumption is unrealistic because market participants have different expectations based on their individual assessments of economic conditions, political events, and other factors. Therefore, the model cannot explain why speculative attacks happen even when market participants do not agree on the direction of exchange rate movements. For example, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, some investors bet on the appreciation of Southeast Asian currencies believing that their economies would quickly recover from the crisis, while others bet on their depreciation because they believed that their financial systems were too weak to withstand the crisis.
A third limitation of the model is that it ignores the role of institutional factors in shaping exchange rate regimes and their vulnerability to speculative attacks. This limitation is significant because exchange rate regimes are not solely determined by economic factors but also by political and social factors, such as the distribution of power among interest groups, the level of democratization, and the strength of civil society. Therefore, the model cannot explain why some countries with similar economic conditions and exchange rate policies experience currency crises at different times. For example, Argentina and Brazil had similar inflation rates, fiscal policies, and exchange rate regimes before the 1990s, but Argentina experienced multiple currency crises while Brazil avoided them.
To overcome these limitations, scholars have proposed extensions to the first generation speculative attack model that incorporate new theoretical and empirical elements. One extension is the incorporation of heterogeneous expectations among market participants. This approach acknowledges that investors can have different perceptions of future exchange rate movements and their consequences for their investments. As a result, the model can explain how speculative attacks can occur even when market participants have different assessments of economic fundamentals. For example, Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2011) developed a model that highlights the role of "threshold effects" in explaining currency crises, whereby a small deviation from a certain threshold level can trigger a sudden reversal of capital flows and a collapse of the exchange rate regime.
Another extension is the incorporation of institutional factors that shape the incentives and interests of market participants. This approach recognizes that exchange rate policies and their outcomes are shaped not only by economic factors but also by political and social factors that affect the bargaining power and preferences of different groups. As a result, the model can explain why some countries can sustain fixed exchange rate regimes despite facing similar economic challenges. For example, Rodrik (2006) developed a model that explains how institutional factors such as the level of decentralization, the diversity of economic interests, and the strength of civil society can affect the likelihood of currency crises in emerging economies.
Empirical evidence supports these extensions to the first generation speculative attack model, showing that they can improve its explanatory power and predictive accuracy. For example, studies by Calvo and Mishkin (2003) and Baldwin and Krugman (1989) find that currency crises are more likely to occur when market participants have heterogeneous expectations about future exchange rate movements and when there are institutional factors that constrain policy responses. Moreover, studies by Bordo et al. (2001) and Aizenman (1997) find that the success or failure of exchange rate regimes depends not only on economic fundamentals but also on the institutional environment and the level of political stability in the country.
In conclusion, the first generation speculative attack model has been an influential and useful tool for explaining currency crises, but it has several theoretical limitations that make it an incomplete explanation. By incorporating new theoretical and empirical elements, such as heterogeneous expectations and institutional factors, scholars have proposed extensions to the model that can overcome these limitations and provide more robust explanations for the collapse of fixed exchange rate regimes. Although these extensions are not without their own limitations and challenges, they represent a promising avenue for future research on currency crises and exchange rate policies.
