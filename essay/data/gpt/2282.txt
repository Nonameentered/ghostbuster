The next task was to integrate a payment gateway to the website to process transactions securely. Various payment options such as credit/debit card, PayPal, and other modes of payment were included. After the payment gateway integration, order processing and fulfillment were set up. This involved inventory management and shipping arrangements for the products ordered.
Lastly, a robust and efficient customer service system was implemented, ensuring that customers had access to support when needed. Frequently asked questions were included, and a customer service representative was available to answer queries via email or phone.
