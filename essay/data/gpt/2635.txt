The language development of medically premature children has been a topic of interest in the field of child language acquisition. The investigation into the language used by these children is aimed at understanding the unique challenges and experiences they face as they try to develop their linguistic abilities. This is an important area of research as it highlights the need for tailored language intervention strategies that are designed to meet the needs of these young children. This essay will discuss the aims of investigating the language of medically premature children, the methodology used to collect and analyze data, and the differences between this approach and previous studies. Additionally, the essay will explore factors that contribute to accurate assessments of a child's language abilities.
The aim of investigating the language of medically premature children is to gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of the linguistic difficulties that they may face. Children born prematurely are at risk of experiencing developmental setbacks that can affect many aspects of their lives, including their language abilities. When combined with other risk factors such as low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, and prolonged hospitalization, these infants are at a higher risk of language delay or disorder. Researchers have shown that the earlier the infant was born, the greater the risk of difficulties in language development (Johnson, 2011).
To gain a better understanding of the linguistic challenges experienced by medically premature children, researchers use various methods to collect and analyze data. One such method is the use of standardized tests. These tests are typically used to assess a child's language abilities and to identify areas of concern. Standardized tests may include measures of expressive vocabulary, receptive vocabulary, syntactic abilities, and pragmatic abilities. These measures are compared to age-matched norms to identify any developmental delays or language disorders (Rescorla, 1989).
However, the use of standardized tests poses several limitations when assessing the language of medically premature children. Firstly, these tests were developed based on the language abilities of typically developing children and may not accurately reflect the language development of premature infants. Secondly, these tests may not take into account the unique environmental and medical factors that can impact the language development of these young children. Therefore, researchers supplement these standardized tests with additional methods such as observational studies, which provide further insight into the child's environment, behavior, and language use patterns.
Observational studies capture the natural language use of the child in real-time environments. This type of data collection allows researchers to observe the child's interactions with caregivers, peers, and family members. The use of naturalistic data allows researchers to better understand the communication context and interactions that take place. This method of data collection also uncovers information about the child's communicative development such as how they initiate and respond to conversation, comment on their environment, and use multisyllabic utterances (Berk, 2012).
In addition to observational studies, researchers may also analyze the language used by caretakers in the child's environment. This type of data collection can provide insight into the quality and quantity of language input or interaction the medically premature child is exposed to. The amount of language input is crucial to the child's linguistic development and may impact their vocabulary growth, grammatical structure, and conversational abilities (Hoff, 2018).
The approach used to assess the language of medically premature children differs from previous studies in several ways. Past studies have mainly used standardized language measures to evaluate the language development of these children. However, researchers now recognize that premature infants exhibit a unique pattern of language acquisition that may be different from typically developing children. For example, infants born prematurely have been found to show a lower level of joint attention, a crucial component of language learning that involves coordinating attention between an object and the linguistic input (Spittle et al., 2015).
Due to the unique challenges faced by medically premature children, traditional language assessments may not capture the full extent of their communicative abilities. Therefore, current research aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the child's language development by utilizing a range of methods such as observational techniques and naturalistic data collection. This approach enables researchers to gain a more in-depth understanding of the child's communication skills and to identify areas of strength and weakness that may be overlooked by traditional language assessments.
Several factors contribute to the accurate assessment of a child's language abilities. Firstly, the age at which the assessment is conducted is crucial. The earlier the assessment is carried out, the more accurate the language development profile will be. This is because early assessments can identify emergent language patterns before they become entrenched. Secondly, the individual conducting the assessment should be trained in language assessment and should be aware of the unique challenges and medical conditions associated with medically premature children. Furthermore, the assessment should take into consideration the child's socio-economic background, linguistic and cultural context to provide a well-rounded picture of the child's communicative competencies.
In conclusion, investigating the language of medically premature children aims to provide a better understanding of the unique linguistic challenges faced by these individuals. Researchers use a variety of methods to collect and analyze data such as standardized measures and observational studies. The approach used differs from previous studies as it involves a more comprehensive assessment of the child's communicative abilities to identify areas of strength and weakness that may be overlooked by traditional language assessments. Accurate assessment of a child's language abilities requires an early assessment, a trained assessor, and the consideration of socio-economic background and linguistic and cultural context. The insights gained from investigating the language of medically premature children can be used to develop targeted language intervention strategies that meet the unique needs of these young children and promote their overall development.
