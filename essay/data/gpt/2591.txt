The image of a gladiator is often associated with violence, bloodshed, and death. In ancient Rome, gladiators were slaves who fought to death for the entertainment of the masses. They were considered as lowly beings and were often overlooked in the societal hierarchy. However, the modern cinematic portrayal of gladiators is quite different. In the present times, gladiators are portrayed as heroes who overcome insurmountable odds to emerge victorious. Contemporary values and beliefs shape this perception, as the modern audience seeks heroic figures who incite emotions of admiration and respect. In this essay, we will discuss how the modern cinematic portrayal of gladiators as heroes reflects contemporary values and beliefs, using the films Spartacus and Gladiator as examples to analyze how these films present gladiators as heroic figures.
The modern portrayal of gladiators as heroes can be attributed to the changing societal values. In the ancient times, the Roman Empire was built on the subjugation of its people. The power was concentrated in the hands of a few, and the masses were oppressed. The gladiators were one of the many groups of people who were subjected to this oppression. However, today's society is founded on values such as democracy, equality, and justice. Consequently, contemporary audiences want to identify with characters who embody these values. The modern portrayal of gladiators as heroes reflects a contemporary desire for equality, respect, and justice.
One of the films that portray gladiators as heroic figures is the 1960 film Spartacus. The film is an adaptation of the life of Spartacus, a former gladiator who led a slave revolt against the Roman Empire. The film is a powerful portrayal of Spartacus as a heroic figure, who defies the system and fights for his freedom. The film highlights the atrocities committed against the gladiators and their fellow slaves by the Roman elite, creating sympathy for the gladiators among the audience. The film does not shy away from showing the brutal and violent nature of gladiatorial combat. However, it pairs the violence with a humanistic element, as the gladiators depicted in the film fight for more than just survival, but for a greater cause beyond themselves.
Moreover, the film depicts Spartacus as a leader who inspires and unites his fellow slaves to stand up against their oppressors. This depiction reflects contemporary beliefs around leadership and justice. The contemporary audiences admire Spartacus for his principles and his ability to rally people around a common cause. His dedication inspires his fellow slaves to fight against the system, and this inspires the audience who resonate with a desire for a similar goal of fighting against entrenched power structures.
Similarly, the 2000 film Gladiator also portrays its protagonist, Maximus, as a hero. The film depicts Maximus as a former Roman general, who becomes a gladiator after his family and emperor have been killed. The film shows a moralistic contrast between the good and the evil by presenting Maximus, who is honourable and virtuous, and Commodus, who is cruel and selfish. The audience is encouraged to align their values with the hero, Maximus and are inspired by his leadership, integrity and his sense of honour, contemporary values. In the film, Maximus is portrayed as a symbol of righteousness and retributive justice. This reflects contemporary values of justice and equality, underscoring that people seek to find justice for the oppressed, whether it be for themselves or others.
The film Gladiator also focuses on the theme of hope and redemption, which is relevant in contemporary society. Maximus is not just a hero because of his noble values, but also because he endures unbearable loss and is continuously pushed beyond his limits. The film shows Maximus physical and emotional journey of hardship and suffering, and his perseverance is hailed as the ultimate sacrifice that one must make for their cause. In his struggle, the audience is inspired by his steadfastness and his humility. His willpower encourages the audience to confront their problems and work towards overcoming them with grace.
In conclusion, the modern cinematic portrayal of gladiators as heroes reflects contemporary values and beliefs. The current societal order emphasizes the importance of treating every person with respect, equality and justice. The modern audience wants memorable stories where the hero is worthy of admiration, and the people they represent share their values. The films Spartacus and Gladiator demonstrate that as society changes, our perception of heroism evolves. The films present the gladiators as heroes who fight for honour, freedom, and retributive justice, and their portrayal is a reflection of our collective contemporary values. The films inspire and awe the audience by displaying the hero's courage and determination. The enduring appeal of these films is not solely based on their well-constructed narratives but their ability to evoke an uplifting vision of what society can become if people uphold their transcendent values: justice, freedom, and equality for all.
