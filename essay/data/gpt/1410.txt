Alfonsina Storni's poetry is one of the most striking examples of Argentine literature of the twentieth century. As a female writer in a predominantly patriarchal society, Storni's poetry is marked by feminist themes that challenge the patriarchal norms imposed on women. Her unique use of language, imagery, and literary devices shed light on women's issues in the early twentieth century. In this essay, I will examine the feminist themes present in Storni's poetry, with a particular focus on her use of language and imagery to critique societal expectations of women.
Storni was born in Switzerland but spent most of her life in Argentina. She was a prolific writer, producing four volumes of poetry, three plays, and several essays. Her poetry is characterized by its simplicity, clarity, and poetry of the everyday, often touching on the themes of love, death, and women's issues. Storni was an outspoken feminist, and her poetry reflects her concern with women's issues in early twentieth-century Argentina.
In her poetry, Storni uses language to challenge the patriarchal norms that restrict women. She often employs a conversational style that mimics everyday speech, making her poetry more accessible to a wider audience. In her poem, "Tú me quieres blanca," Storni addresses the societal expectation that women should be pure and innocent. The poem consists of two stanzas, with each stanza containing a rhetorical question that challenges this expectation. The speaker asks, "You want me pure, you want me alabaster," then counters, "Why do you want me to be pure, alabaster?" Through these rhetorical questions, Storni challenges the notion that women should be pure and virginal, suggesting that this expectation is imposed on women by men.
Storni's use of language also challenges the traditional gender roles imposed on women. In her poem, "Hombre pequeñito," Storni describes a man who is physically small but powerful and manipulative. She uses the diminutive form of the word "hombre." which in Spanish translates to a little man or a man "of smallness." The poem is a critique of traditional masculinity, equating it with the physical size. The speaker calls the man "minute, petty," and "sublime," suggesting that he is small in stature but powerful in his manipulations. Through her use of language, Storni suggests that traditional gender roles that define masculinity as dominant and powerful are constructions rather than innate qualities.
Storni also uses imagery in her poetry to challenge societal expectations of women. In her poem "Peso ancestral," Storni describes the burdens that women carry, both literally and metaphorically. The speaker describes herself as carrying the weight of "ancestral [weight]," which she suggests is both a psychological and physical burden. Through this image, Storni critiques the societal expectations that women should be self-sacrificing and obedient. The poem suggests that these expectations are imposed on women through generations, with each generation carrying the burden of the one that preceded it.
In another poem, "Las manos," Storni uses the image of hands to explore the theme of women's labor. The poem is a tribute to the work that women do, both visible and invisible. The speaker describes the hands of women who sew, cook, and clean. She also describes the hands of women who "write, paint, and create," highlighting that women's labor is not limited to domestic work but extends to creative work as well. Through this imagery, Storni challenges the notion that women's labor should only be domestic and that creative work is a domain reserved for men.
Storni's poetry also highlights the intersectionality of women's issues and critiques the oppression of women of color and those from lower socio-economic groups. In her poem "Dolor," Storni describes the pain and oppression of an indigenous woman. She describes the woman's "dark skin" and her "hands wrinkled by work," highlighting the intersection of racism and classism faced by indigenous women. Through this poem, Storni critiques the white feminist movement that focused solely on the issues of middle-class white women and neglected the oppression faced by women of color and those from lower socio-economic groups.
Storni's poetry is a testament to the power of language and imagery to challenge societal expectations of women. Through her poetry, she critiques traditional gender roles and highlights the intersectionality of women's issues. Her poetry sheds light on the struggles faced by women in early twentieth-century Argentina and remains relevant to this day.
