Leopold von Ranke, a German historian, philosopher, and author, is well-known for his ground-breaking contributions to the field of historiography, the study of the writing of history, and the scientific approach to history. Von Ranke believed that history was an objective, empirical, and scientific discipline distinguished by values other than those of art, poetry, or philosophy. His philosophy of history and his contributions to the development of scientific history remain influential to this day.
Born in 1795 in Wiehe, Germany, Leopold von Ranke spent much of his life studying history, philosophy, and other humanities subjects. After teaching at the University of Berlin, he became the chair of history at the University of Leipzing, where he established the first department of history in Germany. Von Ranke's inspiration came from his experience with the Enlightenment philosophy of Immanuel Kant and Johann August Eberhard's concern for knowledge as a direct attitude toward reality.
Von Ranke's philosophy of history was characterized by his belief that history should be studied as it really had occurred. He was concerned primarily with the "what" of history, which he believed could be established through empirical research. He rejected the notion of an individual "philosophy of history," preferring to focus instead on the factual and empirical reality of historical events. In other words, he saw the role of the historian as that of a scientist who collects and analyzes data to reconstruct the past accurately.
At the heart of von Ranke's philosophy of history was his approach to source material. He believed that historians needed to start with the primary sources, which he defined as original documents, including letters, diaries, and official records, to reconstruct the past. He emphasized the importance of verifying the facts presented in these primary sources and comparing them to other sources to come up with a comprehensive account of the past. Even when he used secondary sources, he was cautious to cross-validate and compare the information presented with the primary sources he had used.
Von Ranke's scientific approach to history revolutionized the discipline and was crucial in the development of the broader concept of the social sciences. His empirical approach to history emphasized the importance of objectivity and accuracy, and it made room for the development of the historical discipline due to its scientific basis. Furthermore, he advocated for the historical discipline to be understood scientifically, questioning how societies would progress if it did not provide objective scientific evidence of what happened. Thus, Leopold von Ranke's philosophy of history led the way for the development of a disciplinary methodology that would seek to establish previously misunderstood facts and add some level of coherence in the understanding of past events.
One of the key contributions made by Leopold von Ranke to the development of scientific history was his emphasis on the role of the historian. Von Ranke believed that the historian should be objective in the reconstruction of the past without reading any contemporary ideas and prejudices into it. This notion is evident in his famous dictum, "wie es wirklich gewesen" (what really happened), which signaled a move away from Romantic historicism that placed emphasis on idealization, as opposed to realism in the presentation of History.
Von Ranke's ideas about the role of the historian rejected the idea of writing history for the purpose of glorification of the past or the authorities ruling over various social contexts. Instead, the study of history and historical writing were to be undertaken in an objective and impartial manner, with the aim of gradually reconstructing events that took place empirically. Such reconstruction of events would then lay the foundation for the understanding of particular ideological orientations of societies, such as economic, social, cultural, and political facets of various societies in order to understand their evolution and outcomes.
The methodology established by von Ranke was empirical and objective. Historians collect and analyze evidence to uncover what happened in the past. He suggested that historical research should follow a strict and controlled approach to develop accurate accounts of past societal evolutions, objectively. A historian should read and review primary sources independently and uncolored by modern-day issues or philosophical perspectives that may not align with what happened in the past. He implored scholars to remain disinterested in the events' moral, cultural, or social implications and rather depict them as they occurred.
Von Ranke was instrumental in bringing about a shift in the methodology of history writing, which is evident in his view that historical knowledge is empirical. His philosophy of history led to a significant departure from a prior method of history reportage, which was based on inherited assumptions emphasizing the present rather than constructing past societies' objective realities. This approach was marked by subjective, often idealized portrayals of events, thus distorting the historical record. Von Ranke's method paved the way for a systematic approach to history writing that, to a large extent, eradicated such distortions by ensuring a sequential rendering of events together with a process of verification of sourced information.
In conclusion, Leopold von Ranke's contributions to the development of scientific history have significantly impacted contemporary historiography. His philosophy of history emphasized the empirical nature of historical events and the necessity of factual accuracy in constructing stories of the past. He laid the foundation for historical research to be viewed as a scientific method, differentiating history as an objective profession built on empirical evidence. Leopold von Ranke's approach to writing history and his philosophy built on the foundations of the enlightenment as characterized by Immanuel Kant, and it has become an essential part of the social sciences. Historians seek to present stories of the past that are free from the influence of political, social, or philosophical prejudices, emphasizing that written history is just an accumulation of the facts research produces from a variety of sources allowing a peak of insight into societies of the past and an apprehension of how they evolved into our present world.
