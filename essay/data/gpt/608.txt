A total colectomy with ileostomy is a surgical procedure in which the entire large intestine is removed, and the small intestine is redirected to an artificial opening on the abdominal wall, called a stoma. This procedure is often performed to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colon cancer, or other conditions that affect the large intestine. Although this procedure can improve a patient's quality of life by alleviating symptoms and preventing health complications, living with an ileostomy can pose significant challenges for women, both physically and emotionally.
One of the primary health presentations of a woman who underwent a total colectomy and ileostomy is digestive changes. The small intestine is responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from food, and without a large intestine, the stool becomes more frequent, watery, and acidic. Women may experience diarrhea or constipation, dehydration, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. They may also develop complications such as intestinal blockage, infection, or hernia.
In addition to these physical health issues, the stoma can also have a profound impact on a woman's psychological and psychosexual well-being. The stoma is a visible reminder of the surgery, and some women may feel self-conscious, ashamed, or embarrassed about it. They may feel anxious or depressed about the impact of the stoma on their appearance, intimacy, and social life. Sexual issues can arise due to the stoma, as well, causing anxiety and depression.
To manage depression, women who have undergone a total colectomy with ileostomy can benefit from a range of psychological interventions. Counseling or psychotherapy can help them discuss their feelings about the surgery, find ways to cope with stoma-related issues, and develop strategies to improve their emotional resilience. If necessary, medication can also be prescribed for more severe cases of depression or anxiety.
Women may seek support from their families, friends, or support groups. These networks can provide emotional support, practical assistance, and guidance throughout the recovery process. Talking to other women with a similar experience can be particularly helpful in boosting confidence and self-esteem.
As for needs and entitlements, women who have undergone a total colectomy and ileostomy may require a range of services, including wound care, stoma care, dietary and nutritional support, specialized equipment, and psychological support. These services can be provided by healthcare professionals such as nurses, dietitians, psychologists, and social workers. A multidisciplinary team approach to care can be beneficial for these women, as it combines the expertise and resources of different healthcare professionals to address the complex physical and emotional needs of the patient.
Healthcare professionals should work collaboratively with the patient and her support network to develop a care plan that is tailored to her specific needs and preferences. The care plan should address issues such as stoma care, wound healing, medication management, dietary counseling, and rehabilitation. The patient should be educated about her condition and treatments to enhance her understanding and participation in her care. Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled to monitor her progress and address any concerns or complications.
In summary, living with a stoma can pose significant challenges for women who have undergone a total colectomy and ileostomy. These women can experience physical, psychological, and psychosexual issues that need to be addressed by healthcare professionals and their support network. The psychological support needs for these women are vital in helping develop resilience towards negative feelings that may develop. Multidisciplinary care, tailored to the patient's specific needs, can be beneficial in improving her quality of life, independence, and well-being. With the right support, women who have undergone a total colectomy and ileostomy can lead fulfilling and satisfying lives.
