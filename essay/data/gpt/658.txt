Meetings are a fundamental tool for effective communication in any organization. Whether virtual or in-person, meetings serve as a platform where individuals gather to discuss their ideas, challenges, progress, and strategies. Communication through meetings helps to build and retain relationships, foster teamwork, enhance learning, problem-solving, and ultimately drive success.
Meetings have various roles in promoting effective communication. Firstly, it allows for face to face interaction where individuals can gauge each other’s mood, tone, and body language. This enables them to empathize, understand and respond accordingly, which is critical in building relationships. Secondly, meetings afford participants an opportunity to share and exchange ideas and thoughts, leading to the development of fresher, innovative and diverse perspectives. Thirdly, meetings provide a platform for decision making and evaluation. By discussing, deliberating, and analyzing data as a group, individuals can determine what's working and what's not, which then leads to better decision-making.
Technology has had a significant impact on how people conduct meetings. With the ever-growing technology industry, new meeting platforms have been developed to cater to the diverse communication needs of organizations. Video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams have become popular over time, as they allow for people to participate in meetings from different locations. Participants don't have to be in the same room, town, or country to attend a meeting. This has further increased the participation of individuals who would have otherwise missed a face-to-face meeting.
In addition to virtual meetings, technology has enabled participants to share and collaborate using digital tools such as whiteboards, screen sharing, and online document collaboration and editing tools. Tools like Miro and Figma have drastically improved the way participants can interact and share their ideas on screen. More people can join discussions and properly evaluate and provide feedback on projects by using these platforms. Organizations have also adopted event management applications to schedule and manage meetings, and to align stakeholders to a common goal effortlessly.
Apart from improving the convenience and participation of individuals in meetings, technology has also enabled organizations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of meetings. For instance, meeting platforms can automatically send invitations, reminders, agendas, take attendance, record minutes, and share them with stakeholders for further engagement. Workflow applications like Trello, Asana, and Monday.com can also track individual tasks, set reminders and deadlines, and assess progress against goals automatically. This results in more productive meetings as participants don’t need to waste time on non-value tasks.
In conclusion, meetings remain an essential component of effective communication in any organization, and technology has undoubtedly impacted how they are conducted. While technology has improved the efficiency, effectiveness, and convenience of meetings, it’s important to note that face-to-face interactions have not completely been replaced. Technology is a tool that can help facilitate meetings and communication, but it is not a complete substitute for human-to-human interaction. Personal experience from working with different organizations, teams, and cultures has taught me the importance of keeping a balance between using technology and face-to-face interactions in meetings for a more productive outcome.
