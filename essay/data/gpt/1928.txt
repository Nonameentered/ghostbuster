In today's business world, organizations operate in an environment that is dynamic, complex and constantly changing. The external environment includes economic, legal, social, technological, and political factors, which can have a significant impact on the performance and success of any business organization. In order to survive and succeed in such an environment, a business must be able to analyze and understand the external environment in which it operates. In this essay, we will explore the key factors a company needs to consider when analyzing its external environment, how understanding the external environment can help a company identify key issues and improve its position relative to competitors, and use Tesco as an example to discuss their competitive strategy options and methods of development used.
Analyzing the External Environment:
To analyze the external environment, a company must consider several key factors. Among these are economic factors such as inflation, exchange rates, and taxation. These factors can have a significant impact on the performance of the company within the marketplace.
Legal factors such as regulations, intellectual property rights, and labor laws can also have a significant impact on the company’s operations. Companies must comply with various regulations, restrictions, and policies, which can impact their bottom line. It’s essential that a company ensures that it is compliant to avoid any potential legal issues.
Social factors must also be considered, such as changing demographics, attitudes, and lifestyles, which can affect consumer demand for products and services. For example, trends in healthy eating may lead retailers to offer more organic products, or wellness products, whereas an increase in vegetarianism may cause decline in sales of meat and poultry.
Technological factors must also be considered, such as advancements in technology, which can provide significant opportunities or challenges within the marketplace. Companies that are aware of and make use of these technological changes are likely to have better success within the market than those that do not.
Lastly, political factors such as changes in government policies and regulations can also impact the performance and success of a company. For instance, any change in import and export policies by the UK government would impact Tesco's supply chain.
Understanding the environment and Improving a Company's Position:
By understanding the external environment companies can identify key issues and improve their position relative to competitors, thereby increasing their profitability. For instance, by analyzing the external environment, companies can be aware of upcoming industry trends, consumer needs and preferences, and competitors activities. 
In 2014 Tesco, a large grocery retailer in the UK, was going through a difficult period and recorded a loss of £6.4bn ($8.4bn) - the worst in its history. Following this Tesco management arranged a company-wide restructuring in 2015 to refocus its business, remain competitive in the retail market and improve its financial performance. Tesco were faced with an environment that was dominated by price wars from Lidl and Aldi, low consumer confidence, and increased pressure on margins. Additionally, Tesco had to face the challenges of technological advancements in e-commerce and big data in the retail industry which impacted consumer behaviours and preferences.
Through its analysis of the external environment, Tesco identified competitive pricing, improving its customer experience, and a greater focus on its digital capabilities as the strategic areas for the company. Tesco was able to revise its price structure, creating simpler and more transparent pricing structures, and focussing on offering a better in-store experience to customers. The company also launched its own budget brand, Fresh & Easy to make more headway into the price-sensitive market, alongside making large investments in its digital capabilities such as the Tesco Online Platform and Tesco Clubcard.
With this understanding and subsequent strategic moves, Tesco improved its position relative to competitors. Over recent years, Tesco’s sales and share price have recovered, and the company has developed new channels to market such as the acquisition of Booker, a wholesaler to convenience stores.
Competitive Strategy Options and Development used by Tesco:
In analysing Tesco's development strategies, it is important to consider its external environment and how they identified key strategic areas for development.
Tesco adopted cost leadership as a competitive strategy, using a low-cost operating model to offer value to its customers. As a cost leader, Tesco was able to build a strong supply chain through efficient operations, which allowed it to offer products competitively.
Tesco’s development strategies also included being the market leader in the UK, which allowed the company to take advantage of economies of scale and offer low prices to customers. The company invested in building its brand and product range, allowing for growth in profitability. Tesco expanded beyond traditional grocery retail and into categories such as clothing, banking, electronics and others.
Another way Tesco achieved its development strategy was through diversification, investing in a wide range of industries. Tesco entered into joint ventures with professional services providers, including large corporations and small start-ups to learn and offer wider-reaching services. Tesco acquired the convenience store chain One Stop for £750 million ($984m) in 2003 to expand its offering of convenience products.
Stakeholder engagement is another element that helped Tesco achieve its development strategy. Tesco recognized the importance of building relationships not only with suppliers but also with other stakeholders such as the community, employees and shareholders. This approach allowed Tesco to gain a notable market share while maintaining its brand image and reputation. 
Conclusion:
In conclusion, analyses of a company's external environment cannot be understated. Organizations need to consider a range of factors such as economic, legal, social, technological, and political to be well-positioned to compete within their market. A thorough understanding of these external factors allows businesses to take advantage of resultant opportunities or to manage risks. 
Tesco's restructuring is an illustrative example that identifies how a company can use analyzing the external environment to revamp its strategy using cost leadership, economies of scale, diversification, and stakeholder engagement - which led to a renewed and growing business. A robust analysis of the external environment offered Tesco a new competitive direction to reposition itself within the retail market by addressing the challenges in their supply chains and identifying growing needs from customers in the marketplace.
By using Tesco’s example and discussing their competitive strategy options and methods of development used to achieve their development directions, it becomes apparent that a company's external environment is critical in determining the company's success or failure. Foresight and flexibility are critical in these analyses, and businesses that fail to implement it are at risk of declining or even failing – thus, the need for a continuous analysis of the external environment to identify areas for development.
