Balance of payments is a vital macroeconomic concept that refers to the inflow and outflow of money to and from a nation's economy. It is a reflection of the economic relationship between a country and its trading partners. In this regard, balance of payments can have both short-term and long-term impacts on the macroeconomic stability of a country. A crisis within the balance of payments occurs when there is a sudden and significant adverse shift in the inflow and outflow of money. This imbalance has the potential to destabilize the economy, leading to negative consequences such as inflation, recession, currency depreciation, and higher unemployment rates. Consequently, the first-generation model of balance of payments crisis was developed to address the macroeconomic framework surrounding such crises. This essay aims to explain the first-generation model of balance of payment crisis, explore the underlying macroeconomic model, examine its limitations and extensions, and analyze the empirical evidence supporting the model.
The first-generation model of balance of payments crisis conceptualizes a sudden and unsustainable outflow of capital as the primary cause of a crisis within the balance of payments. The model is based on the assumption that domestic economic policy coupled with market conditions creates an environment that incentivizes investment inflows, which ultimately result in an unsustainable buildup of debt. In the short-term, the inflow of capital creates an illusion of economic growth and prosperity. However, this growth is built on a weak foundation that is prone to sudden withdrawals of capital, creating an imbalance in the balance of payments. In the short-run, the sudden withdrawal of capital creates a sudden depreciation of the country's currency value, leading to a financial crisis. In the long run, the imbalance between inflows and outflows creates macroeconomic imbalances leading to structural changes and economic adjustments.
This macroeconomic model operates under the assumption that the capital account is driven primarily by short-run market conditions rather than economic fundamentals. Additionally, the model assumes that foreign investors are profit-driven and can withdraw their investments at any point based on market conditions. The model is also based on the belief that fixed exchange rates deter short-run speculative capital inflows that result in a sudden withdrawal of capital.
While the first-generation model is a useful tool for understanding crises within the balance of payments, it has several limitations. Firstly, the model neglects structural factors that create an environment for foreign investors to invest excessively or unnaturally in an economy. Secondly, the model does not account for domestic policies that can result in unsustainable levels of investment. Thirdly, the model fails to incorporate the role of long-term economic fundamentals in determining the capital flows into an economy. In effect, the model can be interpreted as being too narrow, focusing just on short-term market conditions and the mobility of capital without much concern for underlying economic conditions.
Despite its limitations, the model has been extended to incorporate different theoretical and empirical frameworks. One of these extensions is the second-generation model developed in the 1980s. This model addresses several of the limitations of the first generation model of balance of payments crisis. The second-generation model stresses the importance of domestic economic conditions in driving capital inflows to an economy. It also incorporates a more realistic depiction of investor behavior, recognizing that investors may be subject to different preferences and biases.
Empirical evidence supports the first-generation model's assertion that crises within the balance of payments result from sudden and unsustainable outflow of capital. Academic studies on Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, among others, indicate that crises within the balance of payments can result from investors' sudden withdrawal of investment funds from an economy. For example, empirical studies suggest that a rapid increase in foreign debt and a decrease in net exports can predict a financial crisis within the balance of payments. Similarly, theoretical models suggest that the initial balance of payments deficit coupled with external debt is a crucial determinant in predicting a crisis within the balance of payments.
While the empirical evidence supports the first-generation model, it must be noted that the model is hindered by several limitations. For instance, the model does not account for the sources of capital outflow, whether it is due to economic fundamentals or speculative market conditions. Consequently, the model may not adequately account for crises in the balance of payments resulting from long-term economic transformation or structural changes.
Finally, the model's limitations underscore the need for a nuanced and multi-dimensional approach to analyzing the crises within the balance of payments. Recently, the third-generation model, which incorporates the effects of globalization, technological innovation, and institutional arrangements, has been proposed to complement the existing crisis models. Third-generation models recognize that the global economy's increasing complexity, the financial system's internationalization and deregulation, and the growing interconnectedness of economies can affect the transmission of economic shocks across borders and cause a balance of payments crisis. Additionally, the third-generation model recognizes that the institutional arrangements for managing the balance of payment may be inadequate or ineffective in addressing the risk posed by such crises.
In conclusion, the first-generation model of balance of payments reflects a macroeconomic framework that evaluates financial instability resulting from an unsustainable outflow of capital. This model is based on the assumption that sudden outflows of capital resulting from short-term market conditions can lead to a financial crisis. However, the model has several limitations, including its narrow focus on short-term market conditions, neglect of domestic factors, and the over-reliance on short-term investment opportunities. Empirical evidence supports the model's labelling of crises resulting from sudden capital outflows. Nonetheless, the limitations of the model underscore the need to complement it with other empirical and theoretical frameworks to develop a more comprehensive approach to managing balance of payment crises. The integration of these models may provide a better understanding of the complexity of the global economy and the institutional arrangements that should be put in place to address the underlying risks.
