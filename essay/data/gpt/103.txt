Introduction
The arts sector is a significant contributor to the cultural and social diversity of a society. Artistic venues have always played a pivotal role in promoting cultural diversity and social inclusion through their programs. The dynamic nature of arts means that galleries, museums, theatres, and cinemas have the power to bring people together and showcase the beauty of unique cultures from around the world. This essay explores how arts venues demonstrate a commitment to social inclusion and cultural diversity in their programming. It compares and contrasts the approaches of Birmingham Hippodrome and Derby Playhouse, major performing arts venues that strive to accommodate diverse cultures in their programming.
Social Inclusion and Cultural Diversity
Social inclusion involves creating an environment that ensures that everyone feels valued and accepted in society. It refers to the deliberate action aimed at creating society that meets the needs and aspirations of all members. Cultural diversity entails recognizing, accepting, respecting, and embracing differences among people from different cultures. Arts venues are significant contributors in promoting social inclusion and cultural diversity in a society. Through their artistic programming, venues provide an avenue for people from diverse cultures to express themselves. In this way, performing arts venues help break down social barriers and promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures. By showcasing the work of artists from all backgrounds, arts venues enable the public to engage, learn, and immerse themselves in cultures other than their own.
Birmingham Hippodrome
Birmingham Hippodrome is one of the major performing arts venues in the UK. The venue often hosts culturally diverse programs which reflect the diversity of the Birmingham city. Birmingham is known for its diverse population, which has contributed significantly to the city's history, culture, food, and music. The theatre seeks to reflect this in its programming by offering diverse productions that appeal to a broad range of audiences.
One of the key ways that Birmingham Hippodrome demonstrates a commitment to social inclusion and cultural diversity is through its access and outreach programs. The theatre is committed to breaking down social barriers that prevent people from visiting and participating in the arts. The theatre offers a range of programs for people with disabilities, including wheelchair spaces, sign language interpretation, and audio description. The theatre also offers free tickets for people who experience economic inequality and may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend performances.
In addition to access and outreach programs, Birmingham Hippodrome also showcases shows that are representative of different cultures. For example, in 2019, the theatre hosted The Color Purple, a musical that explores race and sexuality issues. The performance was praised for putting black women at the center of the narrative, a rarity in the musical theatre genre. The Theatre has also hosted Bollywood productions, such as Bollywood Masala Orchestra and Dancers of India.
Derby Playhouse
Derby Playhouse is another major performing arts venue that promotes social inclusion and cultural diversity through its programming. The venue has a strong reputation for the quality of its productions, and its diverse program reflects the varied community it serves. The theatre has a particular emphasis on showcasing local talent and providing opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to engage with the arts.
Derby Playhouse programming promotes cultural diversity by showcasing local talent from all cultures. The theatre is home to a diverse range of local community groups. The groups perform on the main stage, making it possible for the public to experience diverse cultures in a high-quality theatre setting. The theatre also offers English language courses to refugees and asylum seekers and holds workshops for local schools.
Like Birmingham Hippodrome, Derby Playhouse provides access and outreach initiatives to enable people from all backgrounds to participate in the arts. The theatre offers discounted tickets to people on low incomes and provides spaces for wheelchair users. The theatre also provides education programs to encourage young people from all backgrounds to participate in drama activities.
Challenges Facing Arts Venues in Promoting Social Inclusion and Cultural Diversity
Notwithstanding the importance of promoting social inclusion and cultural diversity, arts venues face challenges in delivering this mandate. One of the most significant challenges is funding. Most arts venues in the UK rely on public funding and depend on grants to maintain their programming. In recent years, these funding sources have dwindled. In addition, the downturn in the economy has reduced the discretionary spending of the public, making it harder for arts venues to generate revenue through ticket sales.
Another challenge for arts venues is attracting audiences from diverse cultural backgrounds. For instance, in Birmingham, some members of the diverse community may have never been to the theatre. Such individuals may not see the value of attending performances, or they might feel that theatre is not an activity that reflects their cultural identity. As a result, venues need to work hard to communicate their artistic offerings and attract diverse audiences.
Another challenge is balancing commercial success with artistic excellence. Many arts venues are dependent on ticket sales to generate revenue, and as such, they must balance commercial appeal with artistic excellence. Balancing these dual objectives is a delicate and complex task that requires significant investment of time, effort and money.
Conclusion
The arts sector plays a significant role in promoting social inclusion and cultural diversity. Arts venues such as Birmingham Hippodrome and Derby Playhouse serve as examples of what cultural venues can achieve by embracing and celebrating the diversity of their local communities. However, they face significant challenges when trying to achieve this aim. Ultimately, overcoming these challenges and creating an inclusive society will require a concerted effort from the public, private, and third sectors. Achieving a diverse and inclusive society is not only the responsibility of arts venues but of society-at-large. Nonetheless, it is vital that each institution, large or small, plays its part in promoting social inclusion and cultural diversity.
