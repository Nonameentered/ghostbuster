Introduction:
The healthcare industry operates with a primary goal of meeting the needs and expectations of patients. Every patient comes with unique expectations, needs and priorities that should be the point of focus for nurses and other healthcare providers. In this essay, the care provided to Mary, a patient with unique priorities, will be analyzed using Holm & Stephenson's (1994) model of reflection.
Assumptions of Patient and Nurses:
The provision of care is influenced by the assumptions of both the patient and nurses. Health care providers must recognize and understand the patient's priorities to tailor their care plan accordingly. Mary may have individual priorities such as pain control or symptom management. Nurses may make assumptions about Mary's priorities based on their experience with similar patients or general expectations. The nurse's assumptions might include treating Mary's physical symptoms as a priority, while Mary may be more concerned about emotional support and comfort.
Patient Rights and Access to Treatment and Services:
Mary has the right to access medical treatment and services. Nurses should provide care to encourage and facilitate her access. Patient rights should be respected to enable them to exercise autonomy about their treatment options. Mary has the right to make decisions about her treatment and care. Nurses must respect Mary's preferences, choices, and ensure that she is empowered to participate in her care decisions.
Quality of Care in Relation to Patient Priorities:
The provision of quality care should reflect the patient's priorities and values. In Mary's case, the provision of quality care should align with her individual priorities. The nurse must provide care that meets Mary's physical, emotional, and social needs. It is important to have an insightful understanding of Mary's priorities, to ensure patient-centered care is provided. The quality of care should not only meet Mary's expectations, it must be in line with current best practices and standards.
Personhood and Possible Barriers to Its Provision:
Personhood is a concept that focuses on the individual and their unique experiences, values, and goals. In Mary's case, the nurse must prioritize her personhood to provide quality care. The nurse must recognize that Mary is an individual with her own unique needs, preferences, and priorities. Personhood is essential in the provision of quality care, as it enables the nurse to address the patient's physical, emotional, and social needs.
There may be possible barriers to the provision of person-centered care. Some of the barriers may include language barriers or cultural differences, where the nurse is not sensitive to the patient's cultural background. Communication deficits may hinder the provision of care that reflects Mary's individual priorities. Time constraints may also hinder the provision of person-centered care, where the nurse has a high workload and is unable to attend to Mary's unique needs.
Holm & Stephenson's (1994) Model of Reflection:
Holm & Stephenson's (1994) Model of reflection encourages the nurse to reflect on their experiences and challenges. The model focuses on four stages of reflection that includes a description of the event, reflection, evaluation, and action. This is a useful framework in nursing practice, as it enables the nurse to examine their thoughts, feelings and identify areas of improvement.
Description of the Event:
Mary, a 70-year-old woman, arrives at the hospital with complaints of difficulty breathing, weakness, and fatigue. Mary has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. The nurse introduces herself and welcomes Mary to the hospital. Mary appeared anxious and fearful.
Reflection:
Initially, I focused on Mary's physical needs and was quick to suggest interventions that would address her physical symptoms without taking the time to recognize her emotional needs. As I continued to interact with Mary, I recognized her anxiety and feelings of fear. I realized that my assumptions about Mary's priorities might not be accurate, and I needed to take the time to understand her priorities better and provide care that was aligned with her values.
Evaluation:
In retrospect, I need to improve my communication skills, especially in situations where patients are anxious or fearful. I need to create an environment that fosters open communication and encourages patients to share their emotional needs. In addition, I need to develop a better understanding of cultural differences as this may influence the patient's priorities and expectations.
Action:
The next time I encounter a patient with similar symptoms and emotional needs, I will take the time to assess their emotional state and create an environment that promotes open communication. I will also seek to understand more about different cultures and how they influence patient expectations and priorities.
Conclusion:
Quality care is essential in the provision of healthcare services. Mary, as a patient with unique individual priorities, has the right to access services that address her needs. The provision of quality care should consider Mary's priorities and focus on her personhood to ensure patient-centered care is delivered. Students in nursing practice should take the time to reflect on their experiences to identify areas of improvement and provide quality care. Reflection promotes learning and development and is essential in providing patient-centered care.
