Symbolism is an essential tool for writers to express ideas and emotions in their novels. It allows readers to interpret the deeper meaning behind the words and understand the author's perspective. E.M. Forster, a renowned English novelist, uses symbolism to explore the themes of connection and fulfilment in his novels. Through the use of symbols, he brings profound meaning to his stories and highlights the complexities of love, relationships, and societal norms. This essay will examine how Forster uses symbolism to illuminate the ideas of connection and fulfilment in his novels.
One of Forster's most famous novels, 'A Passage to India,' explores the themes of race, colonialism and cultural misconceptions. In the novel, Forster uses the symbolism of caves to depict the complexity of the relationship between the British colonizers and the native Indians. The caves are symbolic of the British colonizers' fear of the unknown and their inability to connect with the Indians on a deeper level. The dark and mysterious cave passages also represent the cultural divide between the two communities, as they fearfully explore the cave system, unable to understand or appreciate the other's culture.
The Marabar Caves are the most significant symbol in the novel. The caves represent a place of spiritual awakening, where individuals can connect with the oneness of their existence, free from labels of race or nationality. However, the caves also hold an eerie, haunting quality, which brings out the dark side of human nature. This is shown through the character of Dr Aziz, who becomes agitated and hostile when he is lost in the caves with Adela Quested. Forster's use of symbolism represents the deep-rooted fear and aggression between the two communities that have caused a divide that appears too large to bridge.
Forster also employs the symbolism of the mosque in the novel to depict the connection and spiritual journey of the Indian community. The mosque represents a safe space for the Indians to connect with each other on a deeper level. The mosque is described as a place where people can come together, regardless of their social background, and connect in the presence of a higher power. By contrast, the British colonizers are shown attending Christian church services, symbolizing a disconnect between the British and Indian communities and their differing spiritual practices.
Forster's use of symbolism in 'A Passage to India' conveys the complexity of the relationship between colonizer and colonized, and their divergent cultural practices. Foreshadowing with the symbolism of caves, he hints at the darkest aspects of human nature and the fear it holds. The symbolism of the mosque represents the connection and spirituality of the Indian community and the ideals of oneness and inclusion.
In 'Howards End,' Forster explores the themes of class and societal norms in early 20th century English society. In this novel, the main symbol is the house 'Howards End,' which represents the connection between the people who have lived there over the years. The house becomes a metaphor for a deeper sense of belonging, community and emotional fulfilment. The novel shows how this sense of connectedness is lost when the house is sold to a wealthy businessman and designated to be razed. Forster's use of the house as a symbol highlights the transient nature of life and the importance of significant connections and emotional fulfilment to find true fulfilment in life.
Another significant symbol in 'Howards End' is the symbol of music. Forster represents music as a source of emotional upliftment, connection and transcendence throughout the novel. This can be seen through the character of Helen Schlegel, who uses music to escape her mundane existence as a rich socialite. The music becomes a symbol of emotional freedom and is used to represent the universal language that bridges the class divide. Additionally, the character of Mr Bast, who is poor and disconnected, also finds solace in music, highlighting its power to connect people.
Forster's use of symbols in 'Howards End' illustrates the importance of emotional fulfilment and meaningful connections in life. The symbol of the house 'Howards End' represents a deeper sense of connection and belonging that is often lost in society's pursuit of wealth and prestige. The symbolism of music illustrates the power of art to transcend societal norms and connect people on a deeper level.
Finally, we examine Forster's use of symbolism in 'A Room with A View,' which explores the themes of love and self-discovery. In the novel, the central symbol is the view, which represents the characters' changing perspectives on life and love. The view is a symbol of the characters' emotional journeys and the different choices they make as they navigate their romantic relationships.
In the opening of the novel, the protagonist Lucy Honeychurch arrives in Florence and is given a room without a view. However, when she is granted a new room with a view of the beautiful city, she is overcome by the beauty of the surroundings. This moment marks a turning point in her emotional and romantic journey, as she becomes more willing to explore the beauty of life and engage with her emotions. The use of the view as a symbol highlights the transformative power of changing perspectives and the importance of exploring the beauty of life.
Another significant symbol in the novel is the use of water. Water is used to represent a connection between the characters and the natural world. The characters are shown to be most at peace when they are near water, such as when Lucy and George bath in a pond. The water is a symbol of emotional cleansing and a space where the characters can connect on a deeper emotional level. Forster's use of the symbol of water illustrates the importance of reconnecting with nature and exploring our emotions to find true fulfilment in life.
Forster's use of symbolism in 'A Room with A View' conveys the emotional journey of the characters as they explore new perspectives and connect with the natural world. The symbol of the view represents the transformative power of changing perspectives in life, while the symbol of water highlights the importance of reconnecting with nature and exploring our emotions.
In conclusion, Forster's use of symbolism in his novels explores the themes of connection and fulfilment in a profound way. The symbolism of the caves, mosque, house, music, water, and views in his novels highlights the challenges and complexities of human connections, while also emphasizing the power of art, nature, and change to create meaningful connections and emotional fulfilment. The use of symbols in Forster's novels goes deeper than just the surface narrative, highlighting the importance of examining deeper emotional and societal issues in life. Forster's careful and thoughtful use of symbolism makes his novels a work of art and illuminates the path to true fulfilment and happiness in life.
