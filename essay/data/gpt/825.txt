Skin lesions can be classified as benign or malignant based on their clinical criteria. Benign skin lesions are those that are not cancerous and do not spread to other parts of the body. They are typically small, do not grow rapidly and have a regular shape. Malignant skin lesions, on the other hand, are cancerous and can spread to neighboring tissues and other parts of the body. They generally grow rapidly, change in shape, color or texture and may bleed or ulcerate. Here, we will explore the clinical criteria of differentiating between the two and the factors that increase the risk of developing malignant skin lesions.
The most common type of malignant skin lesion is Malignant Melanoma. The risk factors include a family history of melanoma, exposure to UV light either from natural sunlight or artificial sources like sunbeds, fair skin types, large numbers of moles or melanocytic congenital nevi, and immune suppression. Other noticeable signs of melanoma include a change in size, color or shape of an existing mole, new pigmented lesion, a lesion that is multicolored, asymmetrical, has an irregular border, and exceeds 6mm in diameter.
To differentiate malignant melanoma from a benign skin lesion, a clinician can use the Glasgow 7-point checklist. The checklist assigns points to various features based on their likelihood of malignancy. The features include change in size, shape, color, and texture, inflammation, bleeding, and abnormal sensation. A final score of 3 or more indicates the risk of malignancy, and the patient needs further evaluation from dermatologists.
Histological analysis of the biopsy or surgical specimens also contributes to predicting the survival rate and prognosis. A pathologist examines the tissue under the microscope to study the cellular and structural features to assess the degree of malignancy. In patients with thinner melanomas (Breslow thickness <2mm), where the cancer does not extend beyond the top layer of the skin, surgical removal is the only treatment needed, and the prognosis is typically excellent. In more advanced cases of melanoma, additional treatments like immunotherapy, targeted therapies, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are required.
Medical personnel and government can play a significant role in managing and preventing melanomas. Medical personnel can educate patients on the importance of regular skin checks, use of sunscreen, protective clothing, and reducing exposure to UV radiation. They can provide recommendations on lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of melanoma, such as exercise, a healthy diet, and smoking cessation. The government can assist by implementing public health campaigns to increase awareness of melanoma and supporting research for new treatment modalities.
Bladder cancer, another form of cancer, involves cells in the urinary bladder that become cancerous. Symptoms of bladder cancer include blood in urine, frequent urination, painful urination, and lower back pain. There are different types of bladder cancer, and the treatment plan depends on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health. Diagnosis of bladder cancer involves a combination of physical examinations, medical history, imaging studies, cystoscopy and biopsy.
Early detection of bladder cancer has a considerable impact on prognosis and treatment. Family support can also be critical in managing bladder cancer. Family members can provide emotional support and assistance with logistics during treatment and recovery. Additionally, they can assist with the monitoring of symptoms and encourage regular follow-up visits with medical professionals.
In conclusion, distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions involves an assessment of various features like size, shape, color, and texture. Malignant melanoma, the most common malignant skin lesion, has risk factors like sun exposure, fair skin types, and family history. The Glasgow 7-point checklist can assist clinicians in predicting malignancy, and histological analysis contributes to assessing the degree of malignancy and prognosis. Medical personnel and government can play a crucial role in managing and preventing melanomas. Finally, early detection and family support play a key role in managing bladder cancer.
