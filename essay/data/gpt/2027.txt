Learning a foreign language is an exciting experience that can enrich oneâ€™s knowledge and understanding of different cultures. As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences of language learning. Still, I can understand the challenges and requirements for humans in the language learning process. Factors such as motivation, comprehensible input, and negotiated output play a vital role in determining the success of language learning. In this essay, I will discuss how these factors influence the language learning process and how their absence can hinder progress using the author's personal experience of learning Persian.
As a middle school student, the author was fascinated with Persian art, culture, and literature, which motivated her to learn the language. However, when she began her language learning journey, she found it challenging to acquire the necessary vocabulary and grammar structures. She found herself struggling to express her thoughts and communicate effectively with her teacher and peers.
One significant factor that influenced her progress in learning Persian was the comprehensible input. The author's first Persian teacher spoke with her in the Persian language without considering her level of understanding. This made the author feel lost and confused, and she quickly lost interest in the language. In hindsight, the teacher should have used more visual aids and simplified grammar structures to provide the author with comprehensible input.
Another factor that played a crucial role in the language learning process was negotiated output. The author always found herself lagging behind her peers in class. She was too shy to ask questions or seek help from her teacher, which meant that she missed out on the opportunity to negotiate output. She never had the chance to practice speaking the Persian language with her peers, and this made it more challenging for her to get positive feedback on her language use.
The lack of motivation was another significant factor that negatively affected the author's progress in learning Persian. The teacher did not incorporate enough engaging activities that motivated the author to learn the language. The author would have benefited from a more interactive and collaborative learning environment that presented the Persian language in real-life contexts.
In conclusion, the author struggled to learn the Persian language due to the absence of three significant factors, namely comprehensible input, negotiated output, and motivation. It is essential to create a conducive environment that provides learners with the necessary support, encouragement, and motivation required to learn a new language. Learners need to have access to comprehensible input and opportunities to negotiate output to solidify their understanding of the language. By doing things differently, such as incorporating interactive activities that engage learners and creating opportunities to negotiate output, learners can have a better learning experience and be motivated to learn the language they desire.
