UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) milk is also known as long-life milk. It is processed through a method known as UHT treatment, which involves heating milk to an extremely high temperature of 135-150°C for one to two seconds to destroy all the microorganisms present in it. The milk is then rapidly cooled and airtight packaged, providing a long shelf life of up to six months.
The experiment in analyzing the properties of UHT milk aims to determine the effect of UHT treatment on the milk's nutritional properties, microbiological quality, and sensory traits compared to traditionally pasteurized milk. The experiment tests the various UHT treatments, such as direct and indirect heating systems, on milk to find out which option offers the best product.
To begin, the direct heating system is a process where milk is heated in a plate heat exchanger to sterilize the milk. The milk is rapidly heated to a high temperature of 135℃ for one to two seconds before cooling down and aseptic packaging. This method is suitable for products with low viscosity, less fouling, and fewer heat-sensitive substances.
On the other hand, the indirect heating system used in UHT treatment involves heating milk indirectly through a sterilization tube. The milk is heated at a high temperature of 135℃ for two to four seconds before cooling and packaging in an aseptic environment. This method is suitable for products with high viscosity, heavy fouling, and heat-sensitive substances.
The advantages of UHT processing include its ability to destroy all the bacteria and pathogens in milk, increasing its shelf life and reducing spoilage and wastage. UHT milk does not require refrigeration, making it convenient to store and transport, especially in tropical regions where refrigeration is a challenge. Consumers can also enjoy milk at any time without worrying about it going bad before they consume it. Additionally, UHT milk has a consistent taste and fewer microorganisms, making it safer to drink.
Despite the benefits, UHT processing has limitations and difficulties faced in the indirect heating system. The high temperatures used during UHT treatment affect the milk's nutritional properties, including the destruction of vitamins and essential amino acids, ultimately reducing the milk's nutritional value. Also, the heat treatment causes changes to the milk's sensory characteristics, such as its flavor, creaminess, and color, making it less appealing to some consumers.
Furthermore, the high temperature used during the heating process causes fouling in the sterilization tubes, which can lead to a reduction in production efficiency, deteriorating the quality of UHT milk. Therefore, manufacturers should regularly check and clean the sterilization tubes to avoid milk contamination and ensure the long-life milk's quality.
In conclusion, UHT milk is processed by heating milk to an extremely high temperature to destroy all microorganisms present, giving it a long shelf life. Direct or indirect methods can be used in UHT treatment, depending on the viscosity and heat sensitivity of the milk being treated. Despite the advantages of UHT milk, it has its limitations, such as a reduction in nutritional value and sensory quality due to high-temperature treatment. Manufacturers should regularly check the sterilization tubes to improve production efficiency and maintain the quality of long-life milk. Therefore, further research and innovations in UHT processing are necessary to enhance milk's sensory and nutritional characteristics while prolonging its shelf life.
