Thomas Hobbes's State of Nature is the theory that man is essentially self-destructive. It suggests that every person has the natural right to everything; hence life in a state of nature is a constant condition of conflict, chaos, and violence. He argued that the state of nature is a war of all against all due to the natural competition between individuals. It is a state without any social institutions and no government, where people would only act for their survival and could use any means to achieve it. Hobbes argues that people in a state of nature are solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short-lived. To create a stable society, Hobbes proposes that people should give up their natural rights to a central authority, which is called the Leviathan. In this essay, we will discuss the role of Hobbes's state of nature, the criticism of his theory by Locke and Rousseau, and its relation to civil society and the design of Leviathan.
Hobbes's theory of the state of nature is based on natural law, which he describes as the law of nature. According to him, natural law is a basic principle of reason that dictates that people should seek peace and be willing to give up their natural rights for the sake of security. In the state of nature, there is no government or law to enforce peace, and everyone is free to do whatever they want. Due to this, life in a state of nature is erratic and violent, where the fittest survive, and the weak die. To escape this condition, people should agree to give up their natural rights and surrender their power to a central authority, the Leviathan.
John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau criticized Hobbes's state of nature theory. Locke argued that people have natural rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property. However, he believed that people entering into a social contract, agreeing to protect each other's rights and give up their natural rights only to a limited extent, was required to live together in a stable society. Locke argued that the natural state of human beings is not conflictual but communal. Similarly, Rousseau criticized Hobbes's theory of the state of nature, arguing that humans are not naturally violent; their violent nature is due to societal pressures.
Rousseau's criticisms of Hobbes's theory of the state of nature have significant implications for the design of the Leviathan. While Hobbes's Leviathan is a system of centralized authority that seeks to prevent violence, Rousseau argued that the state should be designed in such a way that it promotes the general will. The general will is the idea that everyone should act in the best interest of society as a whole, rather than in their self-interest. According to Rousseau, the government should establish a social contract in which individuals agree to follow the general will, thus promoting the stability and well-being of the community as a whole.
Furthermore, the relationship between civil society and the design of the Leviathan is critical. Civil society refers to a community of individuals living together, working towards common goals or interests. As Hobbes argues, the state of nature is chaotic and violent. The creation of the civil society is the only way to escape this state. Civil society requires the presence of a government, which has the authority to protect the citizens against each other through the establishment of laws and justice. According to Hobbes, this requires the surrender of natural rights of the citizens to the government, which he called the Leviathan. The government is an institution that seeks to maintain order, promote justice, and protect civil society from external and internal threats.
The central concept in Hobbes's social contract theory is the sovereign power. The sovereign is a single person or a group of people who have complete authority over the society. It has the power to make laws, enforce them, punish those who violate these laws and ensure the safety and security of the people. The Leviathan is set up to rule over the society as an absolute monarch. Hobbes suggests that only an absolute government can provide the necessary order and bear the responsibility of the safety and preservation of the society against the power and the individual interests of its citizens.
In conclusion, Hobbes's State of Nature is the theory that man is essentially self-destructive. It suggests that every person has the natural right to everything, and life in a state of nature is a constant condition of conflict, chaos, and violence. Locke and Rousseau criticized Hobbes's theory of the state of nature, arguing that the natural state of human beings is not conflictual but communal. They both believed in the natural rights of the individuals. Rousseau proposed the idea of the general will, in which individuals agree to follow the best interest of the society as a whole, while Locke proposed the need for limited government to protect individual natural rights. The design of the Leviathan is significant to ensure the stability and well-being of the civil society. Hobbes proposed that only the absolute government could provide the necessary order and bear the responsibility of the safety and preservation of the society against the power and the individual interests of its citizens.
