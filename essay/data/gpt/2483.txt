The 'Experiencing the Weather' field course held at the Leeson House Field Studies Centre in Dorset over the weekend of 28th October 2021 boasted an incredible array of activities designed to help students understand the complexities and diversity of the local climate. However, the weather played a significant role in shaping the experience of the course participants and was the subject of much discussion and observation throughout the weekend.
During the first day of the course, the weather was sunny and mild, with temperatures reaching around 15 degrees Celsius. The clear skies allowed for exceptional views of the surrounding landscape, and many students took advantage of this by taking long walks around the grounds. In the afternoon, the course instructor led a series of interactive workshops outdoors where participants could learn how to read weather maps, understand wind directions and speed, and measure temperature and humidity levels. The clear and mild weather allowed the participants to gain an in-depth understanding of the weather patterns and the environmental factors that contribute to them.
However, as the weekend progressed, the weather began to change. Overnight on the first day, the winds picked up, and dark clouds started to gather on the horizon. The course participants woke up to a cold, overcast morning, with temperatures dropping down to 6 degrees Celsius. The course organizer took this opportunity to teach the students about the relationship between temperature and humidity and how these variables impact the formation of mist and fog in the area.
The morning was spent in the classroom, studying the atmospheric pressure systems and observing the changes in cloud cover as the day progressed. By noon, the winds picked up considerably, and a storm front arrived, bringing with it heavy rain and gusty winds. The participants were forced to take shelter indoors and spent the afternoon studying the impact of high winds on trees, buildings, and the surrounding environment.
However, the storm front soon passed, and the weather became more stable by evening. The temperatures dropped even further, and the participants spent the night learning about the formation and properties of snow. They examined snow crystals under microscopes and calculated snow densities and the impact of snowfall on the environment.
In conclusion, the 'Experiencing the Weather' field course at Leeson House field studies center in Dorset, held over the weekend of 28th October, provided a unique opportunity for participants to study the diverse and constantly changing weather patterns in the area. The weather ranged from mild and sunny to stormy and cold, allowing the students to gain a thorough understanding of the role of various atmospheric factors in shaping the region's climate and ecology. Despite the variability of weather, all the participants gained invaluable insights into the complex workings of the natural world and the importance of weather prediction and observation.
