Stokes Drift is a phenomenon in fluid dynamics that describes the net transport of fluid particles due to the propagation of waves. It was first proposed by Sir George Stokes in 1847 and later, the mathematical formulation was developed by John W. Miles. It is a crucial component of oceanography, as it can help us understand the motion of fluids and particles in the ocean.
Stokes Drift can be numerically solved using an explicit method. Explicit methods calculate a solution at a future time by using information from the present time. In numerical models of Stokes Drift, the motion of fluid particles is simulated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of the fluid. The finite volume method is commonly used to solve these equations numerically.
The equation for Stokes Drift can be written as follows:
uS = -λ∇p
where uS is the Stokes Drift velocity, λ is the coefficient of viscosity, and p is the pressure field. The negative sign indicates that the direction of Stokes Drift is opposite to that of the wave propagation.
The addition of waves affects the displacement of a parcel in the ocean by causing it to move in a circular pattern, known as a wave orbit. The wave orbit is caused by the interaction of the wave motion and the fluid particles. As the wave propagates, the fluid particles move in a circular motion and eventually return to their original position. This circular motion leads to a net transport of fluid particles in the direction of wave propagation, known as the Stokes Drift.
Computer models of Stokes Drift can agree with the theory that at small values of wave amplitude, the approximate solution for Stokes Drift is correct. At small wave amplitudes, the wave motion is linear and the fluid motion can be approximated as Stokes flow. Stokes flow is a type of fluid flow that occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where the inertial forces are negligible compared to the viscous forces. In this regime, the motion of the fluid is governed by the Stokes equations, which are a simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations.
Waves assist in the displacement of a parcel by creating a net transport of fluid particles in the direction of wave propagation. The net transport is caused by the circular motion of the fluid particles in the wave orbit. In addition to this, waves also induce turbulence in the fluid, which can further enhance the transport of particles. The main effect of waves in numerical models is to introduce nonlinearities in the Navier-Stokes equations, which cannot be solved analytically. This makes numerical simulation a vital tool for studying the effects of waves on Stokes Drift.
In conclusion, Stokes Drift is a phenomenon in fluid dynamics that describes the net transport of fluid particles due to the propagation of waves.
