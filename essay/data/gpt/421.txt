Edward Bond's Outraged is a powerful and disturbing play that challenges traditional interpretations of the Oedipus complex and uses humor and violence to convey deeper societal issues and flaws. The play tells the story of Len, a practical and flawed character who struggles to come to terms with his role in a society that is teetering on the brink of collapse. Through Len's journey, the play explores issues related to power, violence, sexuality, and the nature of human relationships. In this essay, I will explore how Bond uses humor and violence to convey deeper societal issues and flaws in Outraged, and how Len's practical and flawed character embodies these themes. I will also analyze the audience's complicity in the play's disturbing events.
One of the ways Bond challenges traditional interpretations of the Oedipus complex is by presenting Len as a character who is not defined by his relationship with his mother. In traditional interpretations of the Oedipus complex, the son is driven by a desire to replace his father and claim his mother as a sexual partner. However, in Outraged, Len has a complicated relationship with both his mother and his father, and his quest for power is not solely driven by his incestuous desires. Len's relationship with his mother is complicated by the fact that she is an alcoholic who is frequently absent from his life. Len's father is also absent, but in a different way: he is a corrupt politician who is more concerned with maintaining his power than with his son's well-being. As a result, Len is left to navigate a world that is devoid of love and support.
Bond uses humor and violence to explore the effects of this dysfunctional family dynamic on Len's psyche. The play is punctuated by moments of grotesque humor, such as when Len's mother vomits on him during a drunken binge. This humor serves to highlight the absurdity of Len's situation and to underscore the fact that he is a victim of his circumstances. At the same time, the play is replete with scenes of violence, ranging from the brutal murder of Len's father to the torture and mutilation of his victims. This violence serves as a metaphor for the ways in which power is wielded in society and for the manner in which individuals are often trapped by exploitative systems.
Len's practical and flawed character embodies these themes in a profound way. At the beginning of the play, Len is presented as a practical man who is simply trying to survive in a world that is hostile to him. He is not a hero, nor is he an antihero. He is simply a man who is struggling to make sense of his life. This practicality is rooted in Len's relationship with his mother. He is not driven by a desire to replace his father, but rather by a desire to care for his mother and to protect her from the dangers of the world. This practicality is also reflected in Len's career as a hitman. He is not a sadist or a psychopath; he is simply someone who has found a way to make a living in a society that values violence over empathy.
As the play progresses, however, Len's flaws become more apparent. He becomes increasingly disillusioned with the corrupt system that he is a part of, and he begins to realize that his actions have real consequences for the people around him. This realization is brought home to him when he accidentally kills a young girl who is caught up in the web of his violence. Len's response to this tragedy is telling. Rather than trying to make amends or to change his ways, he becomes more violent and more erratic. His practicality gives way to a kind of nihilism that is fueled by his sense of powerlessness.
It is through Len's flaws that Bond is able to convey deeper societal issues and flaws. Len is not a hero or a villain. He is a flawed human being who is trapped by a corrupt and violent society. His flaws are a reflection of the flaws of the larger system, and his journey is an allegory for the journey of society as a whole. Bond uses Len to explore issues related to power, violence, sexuality, and the nature of human relationships. He shows us how power can corrupt even the best of us, and he demonstrates the ways in which violence is used as a means of maintaining power. He also shows us how sexuality is used as a weapon, and how human relationships are distorted by the pressure of society's expectations.
Through the use of humor and violence, Bond is able to convey the profundity of these themes in a way that is at once disturbing and enlightening. The humor of the play serves to underscore its absurdity and to highlight the ways in which people are forced to adapt to a dysfunctional world. The violence of the play serves as a metaphor for the ways in which people are trapped by exploitative systems, and the manner in which their actions have real consequences for the people around them. In this way, Bond is able to challenge traditional interpretations of the Oedipus complex and to offer a searing critique of society.
The audience's complicity in the play's disturbing events is also worth considering. Throughout the play, the audience is called upon to confront their own relationship to violence and power. The violence that is depicted on stage is often graphic and brutal, and the audience is forced to witness the consequences of this violence. At the same time, however, the play is punctuated by moments of humor that serve to distance the audience from the violence and to create a sense of detachment. This detachment is necessary, as it allows the audience to confront the issues raised by the play without being overwhelmed by its brutality.
Ultimately, Bond's Outraged is a powerful and challenging play that forces us to confront our relationship to power, violence, sexuality, and the nature of human relationships. Len's practical and flawed character embodies these themes in a profound way, and Bond's use of humor and violence serves to underscore the absurdity and the consequences of a dysfunctional society. The audience's complicity in the play's disturbing events serves as a powerful reminder of our own relationship to these issues, and the manner in which we are all complicit in the perpetuation of societal flaws. Outraged is a play that demands to be seen and understood, and its message is one that is both disturbing and enlightening.
