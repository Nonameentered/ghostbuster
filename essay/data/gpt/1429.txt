India, a developing country with over 1.3 billion people, faces significant challenges concerning infant and child mortality rates. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that in 2020, the infant mortality rate in India was 28 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the child mortality rate (under five years of age) was 36 deaths per 1,000 live births. Although these rates have declined in recent years, they remain among the highest in the world, and therefore require urgent attention from policy makers. By exploring factors influencing infant and child mortality rates in India and analyzing data from 520 districts, policy makers can reduce these rates.
Several factors contribute to infant and child mortality rates in India. One of the significant drivers of child mortality is poor nutrition. According to the Global Nutrition Report 2020, over 20% of Indian children under five years of age suffer from wasting, a severe form of malnutrition that can lead to death in extreme cases. Additionally, anemia, a condition of low iron levels in the blood, affects 59% of children in India, which can affect brain development and increase risks of infections. Malnutrition weakens the immune system of children and makes them more susceptible to diseases and infections, leading to mortality.
Another factor that contributes significantly to infant and child mortality in India is inadequate access to healthcare. Although there has been an improvement in healthcare infrastructure in recent years, rural areas in India have limited access to hospitals and clinics, leading to inadequate vaccination coverage and poor management of illnesses. India has one doctor for every 1,457 people, which is below the WHOâ€™s recommendation of one doctor for every 1,000 people. Moreover, many healthcare facilities are under-staffed, under-equipped, and lack essential medicines, further worsening the healthcare situation.
A third factor is poverty. India is one of the most impoverished nations globally, with over 270 million people living below the poverty line. Most of these individuals lack access to clean water, proper housing, healthcare, and nutritious food, which can lead to a host of health problems, including infant and child mortality. Children from these backgrounds are at higher risk of malnutrition and infections due to inadequate nutrition and poor living conditions, increasing their vulnerability to diseases and infections, which can further lead to mortality.
To reduce infant and child mortality in India, policy makers must tackle these factors by implementing suitable intervention measures. One of the most effective strategies is improving nutrition. This strategy includes ensuring that babies are breastfed within the first hour of birth, promoting exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, and complementary feeding alongside breastfeeding from six months up to two years. Policy makers can also provide education and counseling to mothers concerning appropriate infant and young child feeding, as well as fortification of staple foods with essential vitamins and minerals.
Improving the health system is another crucial strategy for reducing infant and child mortality in India. Policy makers need to invest more in healthcare infrastructure, increasing the number of healthcare professionals, and extending the reach of healthcare facilities to underserved areas. This includes mobile health clinics, telemedicine, and village health workers. Policy makers must also prioritize vaccination programs for children under five years of age, as vaccines prevent many diseases that cause mortality.
Poverty reduction is also a critical strategy of reducing infant and child mortality in India. Policy makers need to adopt poverty alleviation measures such as providing access to clean water, sanitation, and housing to the poor. This approach also requires providing financial assistance to families living below the poverty line, offering food subsidies, and creating employment opportunities that pay a living wage. Poverty alleviation strategies would enable families to access adequate resources to improve their health and nutrition, thus reducing infant and child mortality rates.
To analyze how effective these strategies are, we can use cross-sectional analysis of data from 520 districts in India. This method helps to determine the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in the data set. An example of a cross-sectional study that explored the influence of poverty on infant and child mortality rates in India is the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). In the NFHS-4 report of 2015-16, the study found that infant and child mortality rates were higher in households with low wealth index than in high wealth index households. Likewise, the report found that infant and child mortality rates were higher in rural areas than urban areas, indicating an urban-rural divide in health outcomes.
Another example of cross-sectional analysis to determine the effectiveness of intervention is the midterm evaluation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme. ICDS is one of the largest programs globally that aims to reduce infant and child mortality rates through various interventions such as nutrition, healthcare, and education. The midterm evaluation found that the intervention program was effective in reducing child mortality rates in some districts with effective implementation, but the reduction was lower in districts where the implementation was weak.
In conclusion, infant and child mortality rates in India are among the highest in the world, driven by factors such as poor nutrition, inadequate access to healthcare, and poverty. To reduce these rates, policy makers must intervene by improving nutrition, healthcare, and poverty levels. Cross-sectional analysis of data from 520 districts in India serves as a tool to determine the effectiveness of interventions. Therefore, policy makers must adopt the most effective strategies suited to each district and measure the results through cross-sectional analysis. By implementing effective interventions and collecting accurate data, policy makers can significantly reduce infant and child mortality rates in India.
