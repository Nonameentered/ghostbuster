Literature is one of the oldest and most diverse forms of human expression. It is a form of art that allows writers to capture the essence of human history, experiences, and emotions. Literature has numerous interpretations, meanings, and themes, making it a vital tool for self-reflection, critique, and questioning authority. From combining tales of the past and features of the present, literature provides a gateway to understanding the world, current issues, and ourselves.
Thus, the study of literature is vital, for it allows students to engage with a diversity of ideas, cultures, and perspectives. It enables them to question and understand societal arrangements, behaviors, and values that shape the world. Literature offers readers multiple perspectives that challenge the status quo and creates new ways of looking at the world.
Sir Walter Raleigh's poem "The Lie" is an excellent example of how literature questions authority. Written in the 16th century, during the age of exploration, Raleigh was a member of Queen Elizabeth I's court. This period of history is known for its mercantilism, colonialism, and the rise of the monarchy. Raleigh's poem was a response to these events, as it challenged the authority of the crown.
In "The Lie," Raleigh exposes the hypocrisy of the ruling class and their dishonesty. He speaks to the notion that individuals in power can say one thing, mean another, and still be seen as virtuous, loyal, and trustworthy. The poem demonstrates how Raleigh uses literature to challenge the expectations of the ruling class and expose the lies that they use to maintain their power.
Another example in literature of questioning authority is found in Virginia Woolf's writing. Woolf was a leading feminist author in the 20th century, and her writing illustrates the struggles of women in society. Woolf's work explored the gender inequalities, patriarchy, and women's rights in society, challenging the established patriarchal values of Western civilization. 
In her book, A Room of One's Own, Woolf used literature to challenge the accepted norms of society. She argues that literature is a powerful tool for women to communicate their grievances and questions the traditional patriarchal roles and attitudes towards women. Woolf's exploration of the concept of patriarchy and gender roles encourages a re-examination of the accepted societal norms by highlighting the role that literature can play in questioning authority.
Literature can shed light on recurring themes and topics that, over time, illustrate the path of societal change. Furthermore, critical approaches such as New Historicism and Reader-response Criticism aid in understanding the historical context and meaning of texts.
New Historicism is a vital approach to understanding literature because it emphasizes the historical context in which a text is produced. This approach acknowledges that literature is not produced in a vacuum but is a product of a specific historical period. To fully appreciate a text, it is necessary to understand the social, cultural, and political circumstances in which the text was written. New Historicism examines the issues surrounding the text and highlights how these issues impact the meaning of the work.
Similarly, reader-response criticism is an essential approach to analyzing the meaning of literature. This approach emphasizes the role of the reader in the construction of meaning and the significance of the text. Reader-response critics believe that readers create meaning in their minds as they interact with the text. Therefore, the meaning of the text is determined by the reader's interpretation. Analyzing the reader's reaction to literature can expose societal and personal ideologies, emotions, and social arrangements that influenced meaning production.
In conclusion, the study of literature is vital to understanding our world and questioning authority. From the works of Sir Walter Raleigh, Virginia Woolf and many others, literature has the power to encourage a new perspective of the world, present alternative worldviews, and reveal the lies that permeate society. Literature can function as a tool for exploring historical and cultural contexts. The potential of literature to promote social change is evident in the ways that it can re-examine societal arrangements and mentalities. By utilizing different critical approaches, such as New Historicism and reader-response criticism, literature can be analyzed to yield insights into historical contexts and point out the gaps or flaws in current social arrangements. Hence, literature is a potent weapon against established power structures, ideologies, and orders by questioning their legitimacy and providing a platform to challenge them.
