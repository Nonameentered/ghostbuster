The British National Party (BNP) has been a part of British politics since the early 1980s, but it has only come to prominence in recent years. The party's rise has been attributed to various factors, including changes in the political landscape and the broader cultural and societal trends. This essay discusses the extent to which BNP is on the rise and the threat it poses to the mainstream British political system and culture. Additionally, this paper delves into the history of far-right politics in Britain, the recent electoral successes of the BNP, and the reasons behind Britain's past resistance to far-right politics.
The far-right has always existed in the UK, but it has never gained significant traction for a variety of reasons. Although there have been different far-right groups in the past, the most successful one was the National Front (NF). The NF was formed in 1967 as an offshoot of the British National Party and remained active throughout the 1970s. However, by the early 1980s, the group's credibility had been undermined by infighting and allegations of racism. At that point, the BNP emerged as the main far-right party in the UK.
The BNP remained a marginal political force for many years, with its membership fluctuating between a few hundred and a few thousand. The party only started to gain prominence in the early 2000s when the UK experienced a wave of anti-immigration and anti-Muslim sentiment following the 9/11 attacks. This period saw the rise of far-right groups such as the English Defence League (EDL) and the BNP began to piggyback on this xenophobic sentiment to gain support.
The BNP's electoral success has been limited, but there have been instances where the party has made significant gains. The party's first electoral breakthrough came in 2002 when it won three council seats in Burnley, Lancashire. The party subsequently made gains in several other local elections but struggled to win further elections. In the 2009 European Parliament elections, the BNP won two seats, an event that shocked the political establishment.
Since then, the BNP's electoral fortunes have declined steadily. The party lost both of its European Parliament seats and struggled to make an impact in several local elections. Following poor results in the 2013 local elections, the party experienced a split, with several key members leaving to form a new far-right party, Britain First.
Despite the decline, the BNP's rise has not been without consequences. One of the main concerns about the BNP has been its apparent attempts to infiltrate mainstream politics. A number of former BNP members have joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and there have been accusations that UKIP has been absorbing BNP voters. While UKIP has denied these allegations, there is some evidence to indicate that former BNP members have found a home in UKIP.
The BNP's influence extends beyond electoral politics. The party has been accused of stirring up racial tensions in the UK by campaigning against immigrants and Muslims. The party has also been linked to a number of racially motivated attacks and other violent incidents. The party's leader, Nick Griffin, has been particularly controversial. In 2009, he appeared on the BBC's Question Time program, prompting protests and a debate about whether he should be given a platform.
Overall, it seems that the BNP's ascendancy in the political arena is on the decline. The party has suffered electoral losses and has been plagued by infighting and accusations of racism. The party's influence on mainstream politics, while significant in the past, has diminished in recent years. More significantly, the public discourse in the UK has shifted away from far-right ideologies, and there is growing concern about the rise of extremism and hate crimes.
In conclusion, the history of far-right politics in the UK has been marked by limited electoral success and marginal influence on mainstream politics. The recent rise of the BNP is not representative of the broader British political system and culture, but rather a reflection of the public's concerns about immigration and national security in the wake of 9/11. The BNP's presence in the political arena poses a threat to tolerance and social cohesion, but it has not achieved the levels of success seen in other countries. The UK remains resilient to far-right politics due to its strong democratic institutions, vibrant civil society, and commitment to multiculturalism. The BNP's recent prominence is a reflection of the challenges that the UK, like many other countries, faces in confronting the rise of extremist ideologies.
