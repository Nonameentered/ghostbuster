The concept of consideration is a fundamental element of contract formation. It involves a mutual exchange of something of value between the parties. Generally, consideration can be anything that has value, including goods, services, and money. The traditional stance of the courts is that parties to a contract must provide some form of consideration for the agreement to be legally binding. However, the case of Williams v. Roffey Brothers challenged this traditional stance by introducing the concept of practical benefit as consideration.
According to the traditional perspective, a contract must involve an exchange of consideration between the parties. The consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate. In other words, the consideration must have value, but it does not need to be equal in value or proportion to what is being offered in return. As long as there is some form of benefit to each party, the consideration requirement is met.
This concept is evident in many cases, such as Currie v Misa (1875), where the court stated that consideration was "some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other." Furthermore, Stilk v Myrick (1809) established the principle that there must be fresh consideration to modify an existing contractual agreement.
Under this traditional approach, the courts have also held that performing a pre-existing contractual obligation is not valid consideration, as in the case of Collins v Godefroy (1831). In this case, the claimant had already agreed to attend court as a witness, but the defendant promised to pay him if he attended. The court held that the claimant was not entitled to any payment as he was under a pre-existing legal obligation to attend.
However, the traditional stance on the concept of consideration was challenged in the case of Williams v. Roffey Brothers. The case involved a contract between a building contractor, Roffey Brothers, and a carpenter, Williams. The carpenter agreed to perform carpentry work and needed to complete the work by a specific deadline. Roffey Brothers were concerned that the carpenter would be unable to complete the work on time and offered him an extra payment. The carpenter agreed to accept the additional payment, and Roffey Brothers made the payment as agreed. However, the carpenter later claimed that he was entitled to further payment, which Roffey Brothers refused to make. The carpenter sued for the additional payment.
In court, the carpenter argued that the additional payment was consideration for his promise to complete the work on time. Roffey Brothers claimed that they did not receive any benefit from the carpenter's performance that they were not already entitled to under the original contract. Therefore, they argued that the additional payment was not consideration for the carpenter's promise to complete the work.
The court ruled in favor of the carpenter, stating that the practical benefit of completing the work on time was sufficient consideration. The court stated that the additional payment was not a bribe but was a legitimate incentive for the carpenter to complete the work on time. Therefore, it was valid consideration. The court held that the practical benefit received by Roffey Brothers was the avoidance of a potential penalty or liquidated damages for the delay. The court found that the practical benefit to Roffey Brothers was sufficient to constitute valid consideration, even though the carpenter had not provided any additional value for the benefit.
The decision in Williams v. Roffey Brothers was controversial. It challenged the traditional approach to the concept of consideration and raised concerns about the potential for practical benefit to be used as a form of consideration in a broader range of cases. Many experts felt that the decision gave rise to uncertainty and flexibility, which could create problems in future cases. Some critics of the decision argued that it undermined the traditional approach, which emphasized the importance of an exchange of value between the parties.
However, others argued that Williams v. Roffey Brothers provided a practical solution to a common problem in construction contracts, where the completion of work on time is often critical. The decision created an opportunity for parties to negotiate additional payments and incentives for timely completion.
Subsequent cases have since attempted to distinguish Williams v. Roffey Brothers and limit its application in particular contexts. In Re Selectmove Ltd (1995), a case concerning the payment of rent, the court acknowledged the decision but felt that it was a narrow exception to the general rule that consideration must involve an exchange of value.
Similarly, in The Eurymedon (1975), the court held that the promise to perform a pre-existing contractual obligation would only be valid consideration where practical benefit could be shown. Therefore, it is apparent that while the decision in Williams v. Roffey Brothers was significant, it has not overturned the traditional stance on the concept of consideration altogether.
In conclusion, the traditional stance of the courts is that parties to a contract must provide some form of consideration for the agreement to be legally binding. However, Williams v. Roffey Brothers challenged this traditional stance by introducing the concept of practical benefit as consideration. It was held that the practical benefit of completing the work on time was sufficient consideration. The decision was significant, but subsequent cases have attempted to limit its application and reassure that the traditional approach to consideration still underpins most contracts.
