Introduction 
The period from 1932 to 1937, as the global economy struggled to recover from the Great Depression, was characterized by different social policies adopted by various governments. The Nazi government in Germany and the Democratic government under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States, responded to the crisis with different approaches, but shared the goal of addressing mass unemployment and stimulating industrial recovery. While the Nazi government pursued social policies that were authoritarian and discriminatory, the Roosevelt government implemented policies that were more inclusive and aimed at protecting individual rights and enhancing social welfare. This essay will explore the social policies of both governments during this period, analyzing their similarities and differences, and the ways in which the Nazi policies went further than those of the Roosevelt government in dealing with mass unemployment, industrial recovery, social welfare and insurance reforms. It will also examine the differences between the relationships between the state and trade union movement and the state and business community in both countries and consider why Germany was able to achieve full employment and economic recovery much earlier than the United States.
Policies on Mass Unemployment
One of the most pressing problems faced by both governments was the issue of mass unemployment. In Germany, the Nazi government viewed unemployment as a national problem that required immediate and drastic measures to alleviate. In 1933, the Nazi government introduced the Reich Labour Service which provided jobs for the unemployed, and by 1935 mandatory service had been introduced, ensuring that every able-bodied German was employed. The government also invested heavily in the development of new industries, such as the construction of public buildings, and had a vast plan to rebuild and rearm the country, which created jobs. 
Similarly, the Roosevelt government aimed to tackle mass unemployment. The New Deal policies, launched in 1933, created several programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration, and the Works Progress Administration, which created jobs for millions of unemployed Americans. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was another measure introduced in 1933 to set wages and prices for various industries, including a maximum workweek of 40 hours. Although the NRA did create some jobs, it was eventually ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
Contrasting the two governments’ approach to tackling mass unemployment, the Nazi government went further than the Roosevelt government, which relied primarily on short-term employment with the public sector and the provision of relief and welfare to support the unemployed. In contrast, the Nazi government developed sweeping public work programs that were mandatory for all young men, which provided a sense of purpose and identity for those unemployed. Thus, while the Nazi government managed to provide full employment much earlier than the Roosevelt government, the latter achieved broader success in the long-term with its broad-based policies of job creation and investment in the country's infrastructure, as evidenced by the major progress in public sector employment even until the present time.
Stimulating Industrial Recovery
After the Great Depression, both Germany and the United States faced the challenge of stimulating industrial recovery and increasing production to boost the economy. Germany focused on rearmament in the early-mid 1930s, which was a massive investment that generated jobs and provided the foundation for future growth. This rearmament process allowed Germany to produce essential conventional weapons such as rifles, artillery pieces, and tanks, and the investment made reforms in transportation and communication infrastructure (Evans, 2005).
In the United States, the Roosevelt government aimed to increase industrial production by implementing the New Deal policies that included the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Wagner Act. The Agricultural Adjustment Act aimed to raise the prices of crops and to support agricultural producers by reducing surpluses. The National Industrial Recovery Act created a government body to deal with production codes and wages and created the Public Works Administration to fund large-scale construction projects. The Wagner Act allowed workers to form labor unions and engage in collective bargaining.
The Nazi government went further than the Roosevelt government in stimulating industrial recovery by investing much more heavily in their infrastructure in the medium to long-term. By investing in new technology, new industries, and rearmament, the German government increased its production of weapons and engaged in massive capital expenditure onto infrastructure development projects, which enabled massive internal growth and expansion, thus spurring economic growth in the long run. In contrast, Roosevelt's policies were primarily geared towards short-term job creation through investment in public works, trade regulation, and labor rights but had a less significant effect on the overall long-term duration.
Social Welfare and Social Insurance Reforms
The Nazi government and the Roosevelt government approached social welfare and social insurance reforms differently. In Germany, the Nazi government instituted a policy of racial purity that was underpinned by discriminatory social welfare and social insurance policies. The government excluded Jews and other “undesirable” groups from social and welfare services and offered financial incentives for people to get married and have children. This policy established extensive social welfare mechanisms, which provided for benefits for mothers and children, old-age pensions, and disability insurance, all of which were provided primarily for those considered to be "racially desirable for the nation."
The Roosevelt government's New Deal policies were much more inclusive and aimed at strengthening the social welfare and social insurance systems to provide more comprehensive support during the recession. The Social Security Act of 1935 introduced a new federal system of pensions, unemployment insurance, and disability payments for workers and their families. The Fair Labor Standards Act provided for minimum wages, maximum working hours for workers, and ensured welfare and safety standards at workplaces.
Therefore, Roosevelt's policies were more social democratic as they stressed inclusivity, strength, and the broader principles of risk pooling and redistribution, compared to the ruthless exclusion of people considered “internal enemies, ” as advocated by the Nazi government, which led to many being left out of its social insurance programs, in the process infringing on human rights of some groups.
Restrictions placed on Democratic Governments through Economic Interest Groups
Both Germany and the United States demonstrated the limitations of democratic governments resulting from their susceptibility to economic interest groups. In Germany, the Nazi government established the German Labour Front, which was responsible for representing German workers. Although the front offered benefits to workers, its main role was to ensure that the Germany workforce had a nationalist ideology. The government limited collective bargaining rights of workers, and labor unions, and opposition parties were prohibited.
In the United States, President Roosevelt was faced with the problem of dealing with the interests of the business community and trade unions, which had been clashing since the 1930s. Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration attempted to bring labor unions and business interests together, but it ultimately failed to achieve a consensus. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) was formed in 1935, by the leaders who had broken away from the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and it focused on industrial rather than trade union organization. This organization became more powerful than the AFL by operating as a union that ensured work stoppages and solidarity among its members
Despite both governments facing opposition from interest groups, the Nazi government went further in its use of authoritarian tactics to suppress trade unions and the business interests that opposed it. The Nazi government’s anti-Semitic and nationalist policies undermined democratic rights and freedoms, and legitimized the authoritarian tendencies of the regime. The United States, on the other hand, maintained a more democratic approach to addressing interests of business groups and labor organizations, while continuing to enact policies that aimed to address the needs of the vast majority who were left vulnerable by the crisis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the social policies of the Nazi government and the Roosevelt government in response to the Great Depression had many similarities and several differences. Both aimed to tackle mass unemployment, stimulate industrial recovery, and improve social welfare and social insurance systems. Although the Nazi government succeeded in achieving full employment and industrial growth much earlier than the New Deal policies of the Roosevelt government, this was largely the result of radical authoritarian measures that discriminated against certain groups and undermined democratic principles. In contrast, Roosevelt's New Deal policies were more geared towards the broad-based social democratic policies that aimed at addressing the needs of all Americans and providing long-term solutions to the crisis. Both governments faced the problem of restrictions placed on democratic governance by the strong interests of economic groups, but while the Nazi government adopted authoritarian measures to overcome this, the Roosevelt government remained more democratic in its approach.
