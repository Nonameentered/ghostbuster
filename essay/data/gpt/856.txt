Disc brakes are one of the most essential components of modern-day vehicle braking systems. They provide a reliable and efficient method of converting the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle into thermal energy, by converting the rotational motion of the wheels into heat via a frictional interface between the brake pads and the disc. The design of a disc brake, therefore, involves a multitude of theoretical and practical considerations to ensure its optimal performance in stopping a moving car. 
The primary theoretical considerations for the design of disc brakes are force distribution, heat dissipation, and wear and tear. In terms of force distribution, the disc brake system should be able to distribute the force evenly to all the wheels of the car. This ensures that the braking force is applied uniformly, and the car brakes symmetrically, without any lurching. In practice, advanced brake systems employ a hydraulic piston mechanism as it provides an even distribution of force to all the wheels of the vehicle. 
Heat dissipation is another crucial theoretical consideration for disc brake design. The kinetic energy of the moving car is converted into thermal energy during the braking process. The thermal energy must be dissipated effectively to ensure that the braking system does not overheat and fail. The material properties of the brake rotor play a crucial role in the heat dissipation. The design must ensure that the brake rotor has enough surface area to dissipate the heat, while also being thin enough to allow for efficient heat transfer. The use of drilled holes or slots in the brake rotor is a popular method to increase the surface area of the rotor, thereby improving heat dissipation. 
Wear and tear is another major consideration when designing disc brakes. The frictional interface between the brake pads and the rotor increases as the brake is applied, leading to wear of both components over time. In practical terms, a properly designed disc brake should minimize the wear of both the brake pad and rotor. The brake pad material plays an important role in ensuring minimal wear and tear. Low-metallic or ceramic brake pads are commonly used in high-performance brake systems as they offer high resistance to wear while also providing excellent stopping power. 
The practical design considerations of disc brakes include the disc size, brake caliper design, and brake pad material. The disc size is directly related to the surface area available for the heat to dissipate and the braking force produced. As a result, the larger the disc, the better the braking performance. However, the size of the disc must be balanced with other design considerations such as weight and cost. As cars have grown more massive over the years, larger brake rotors are necessary to counteract the higher weight of the vehicle. 
The brake caliper design is another crucial practical consideration in disc brake design. The brake calipers contain the brake pads and apply the force required to generate the braking torque. The design of brake calipers has evolved over the years, from the conventional floating calipers to the more advanced fixed calipers with multiple pistons. Fixed calipers with multiple pistons provide an even distribution of force over the brake pads and rotor's surface, minimizing brake pad wear and ensuring better braking performance. 
Lastly, brake pad material is the most critical practical consideration for disc brake design. Different pad materials provide different frictional properties under various operating conditions. Organic, semi-metallic, low-metallic, and ceramic are the four most common pad materials used in disc brake systems. Each material has its own set of pros and cons, which must be weighed carefully in choosing the most appropriate pad material for a given application. Organic brake pads are affordable and produce less dust than metallic pads, but they wear out quickly and generate less torque. Metallic brake pads are durable and produce high torque but generate more dust and are prone to loud noise. Low-metallic and ceramic brake pads offer excellent braking performance and generate less noise and dust, but they can be more expensive. 
The braking performance of a typical saloon car weighing 1000 kg is also dependent on numerous factors that affect the design and operation of the disc brakes. The most critical variables associated with the design of a disc brake are the braking torque, brake pedal force, and acceleration. The braking torque essentially determines how much force is required to bring the car to a complete stop. The braking torque is directly proportional to the force applied to the brake rotor. Increasing the force applied to the rotor increases the braking torque, which ultimately affects the braking performance. 
The brake pedal force is another vital variable in disc brake design. The force required to apply the brakes varies depending on the type of brake system used. Hydraulic brake systems have a specific force distribution for the front and rear wheels. This ensures that the braking force is applied uniformly, and the car brakes symmetrically, without any lurching. In most modern cars, the brake pedal force is adjusted based on the driver's acceleration requirements. As the car accelerates, more force is required to bring it to a complete stop. 
Acceleration is also a crucial variable that affects disc brake performance. The braking system must generate enough braking torque to stop the car in a safe distance when traveling at different speeds. During sudden braking, the frictional force between the pads and the disc increases considerably, leading to heat generation, reduced braking efficiency, and increased wear. As a result, the braking system must be designed to withstand the extreme braking torque generated during emergency stops. 
Once the disc brake system's design variables are quantified, the amount of torque required can be determined to achieve maximum braking performance. Several parameters affect the braking torque, such as the brake pad material, the surface area of the rotor, and the number of pads employed, among others. The braking torque can be determined using mathematical models that consider these parameters. However, the brake manufacturer must ensure that the brake system's design follows the brake manufacturer's recommended specifications to ensure maximum braking performance. 
Different brake pad materials can also affect the torque provided by disc brakes. Metallic brake pads, for instance, generally have a higher coefficient of friction than non-metallic brake pads, leading to higher torque and improved braking performance. Low-metallic brake pads, however, generate less noise and dust compared to metallic brake pads while still providing excellent braking performance. Ceramic brake pads are known for their excellent stopping power and provide considerable noise reduction, but they can be more expensive than other pad materials. Brake pad materials must be chosen carefully based on the application, brake system design, and overall braking performance requirements. 
In conclusion, the design of disc brakes for motor vehicles involves both theoretical and practical considerations to ensure optimal braking performance. Theoretical considerations such as force distribution, heat dissipation, and wear and tear must be considered by the brake designer. Practical considerations such as the disc size, brake caliper design, and brake pad material are also important. Various variables, such as braking torque, brake pedal force, and acceleration, are associated with disc brake design and are crucial in determining the torque requirements to achieve optimal braking performance. Finally, brake pad material plays a critical role in providing the braking torque required for a particular application and can significantly affect braking performance.
