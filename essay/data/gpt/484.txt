The field of international relations has been dominated by three theoretical frameworks for explaining and analyzing the behavior of states and international actors - Realism, Liberalism, and Marxism. Each of these theories has its own set of assumptions and explanations about the workings of the international system, its historical record, and its efficacy when applied to real-world scenarios. This essay aims to evaluate the efficacy of Realist, Liberalist, and Marxist world views in explaining international relations, with an assessment of the assumptions that underpin each theory and how their historical records influence their utility as theories.
Realism is the oldest and most influential theoretical framework in international relations. It is based on the principles of power politics and the assumption that states are the primary actors in the international system. Realists believe that the anarchic nature of the international system provides states with the freedom to pursue their own interests without any overarching authority. According to realism, states are rational actors, and they act in their self-interest to maximize their power and security. To Realists, conflict, competition, and security dilemmas are inevitable outcomes of the international system.
The historical record of Realism is mixed. While there are some undeniable instances where Realism has provided a useful explanatory framework for understanding international relations - such as the Cold War arms race - its limitations are also apparent. Realism struggles to explain the broad sweep of history since it doesn’t take into account the role of non-state actors, such as non-governmental organizations, multinational corporations, and international organizations. Moreover, Realism’s assumption that states are always necessarily in competition is problematic because it doesn’t account for situations where states can cooperate for mutual benefit, such as the institutional arrangements that developed to manage the global economy in the post-World War II period.
On the contrary, Liberalism takes a significantly different approach to the study of international relations. Arguably, it is the most optimistic of the three theoretical frameworks, and it is characterized by the conviction that international anarchy is solvable. Liberalism asserts that cooperation is possible among states, and that governance institutions, such as international law, norms, and rules, can regulate behavior and constrain the exercise of power. Liberalism’s proponents stress that democracies are more likely to cooperate with one another, and they are less likely to engage in conflict.
The historical record of Liberalism demonstrates that this theoretical framework can be effective at explaining certain aspects of international relations. For example, the proliferation of international environmental treaties and agreements demonstrates that Liberalism’s emphasis on cooperation and international governance provides utility in some domains. However, there are also strong counterpoints to this perspective. The rise of China as a geopolitical competitor with the established Western liberal powers has led to scenarios in which cooperation is not an option. Moreover, Liberalism overlooks the fact that states must compete with each other for finite resources and advantageous bargaining positions, which is a fundamental limitation of all international relations.
Marxism, the third of the three theoretical frameworks, argues that the global economy is the sole driver of international relations. Marxists are skeptical about the efficacy of states as actors in the international system and emphasize the role of socio-economic classes. Marxism posits that the international system is characterized by an unequal distribution of wealth and resources, and that the bourgeoisie seeks to maintain its predominance over the proletariat by exploiting weaker states and people. As a result, Marxism criticizes Liberalism and Realism for ignoring the role economic systems play in the functioning of states and the international system.
The historical record of Marxism is complex. Marxism has been most applicable in the analysis of the Cold War period, which was defined by the interaction of world powers, and the ideological divide between Communist and capitalist countries. In recent decades, Marxism has had limited utility in the study of international relations since its predictions of the inherent instability and inevitable collapse of capitalism have not materialized, at least not in the sense Marx prophesied. In addition, the challenges which emerged between Communist and capitalist countries had as much to do with ideology as they did with capitalist-determined socio-economic factors.
In conclusion, each of the three theoretical frameworks - Realism, Liberalism, and Marxism - has its own set of assumptions, explanations, and critiques when it comes to analyzing and understanding international relations. While each of these frameworks has its own merits in providing potential explanations in certain contexts, the reality is that no one theoretical framework can alone provide a complete and satisfactory explanation of the workings of the international system. To the extent that theory must come in for more than just one aspect, an eclectic approach to theoretical frameworks presents itself as the most viable path forward. For instance, realism can explain when conflicts may occur, while Liberalism can provide insight into the institutional and legal frameworks that could enable cooperation and collaboration. On the other hand, Marxism can prove beneficial in cases where socio-economic factors are at the forefront of issues, providing an insightful perspective on the power relations between states, and the roles of capitalists and proletariats play. Therefore, it could be argued that the most effective way to understand international relations is to draw from all three of these theoretical frameworks, depending on the situation or scenario that is being studied.
