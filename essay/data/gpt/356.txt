Famines in India are not a new phenomenon. Indian history is full of evidence of famines that have ravaged the land in the past, oftentimes leaving its people to face starvation. Yet, the period from 1765 to 1900 was the era of some of the most crippling famines India had seen. The British rule had only exacerbated an already vulnerable region, and as a result, the famines became more frequent, more profound, and more deadly. This essay seeks to identify the factors that contributed to the increased frequency of famines in India between 1765 and 1900, examine their significance, and determine the primary cause.
Before analyzing the factors, it's essential to understand why famines were so prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. Famines were primarily caused due to a variety of reasons, including natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and cyclones. In addition, India's lack of proper infrastructure, inadequate irrigation facilities, and the traditional agrarian economy proved to be the catalysts for the famines in India. Moreover, the British's exploitative policies played a significant role in India's vulnerability to famines. One such example of British policies is the colonial government's decision of converting India from self-sufficient agriculture to cash crops. In this system, farmers only grew crops that would fetch higher profits in foreign markets. This shift prioritized economic gains over the well-being of India's citizens, leading to crop scarcity and hunger. As a result, famines were becoming more frequent, and their deleterious impact was twofold. The first impact was related to the increased mortality rate caused by famine-related diseases. The second was related to the loss of human capital that weakened India's economy, never letting it recover.
With this understanding, we shall now examine the various factors that increased the frequency of famines in India during the British regime.
The British Agricultural Policies
The colonial government implemented various policies that aimed at transforming India's agrarian economy. They aimed to convert India from traditional self-sufficient agriculture to cash crops. As mentioned earlier, this policy shift encouraged farmers to cultivate cash crops like opium, indigo, cotton, and wheat for the global market. This policy shift was detrimental to India as it led to the over-dependence on cash crops, resulting in crop failure and food scarcity. For instance, in the late 1800s, the provinces of Bombay, Central Provinces, and Berar started growing cash crops like cotton and wheat, now worthless since there was a surplus of these crops in other parts of the world. Consequently, these regions could no longer grow their food and, as a result, died of starvation.
Another significant agricultural policy was the irrigation policy, which aimed to improve agricultural production. However, the British irrigation policy was implemented selectively, primarily benefiting those who grew cash crops but still left many farmers dehydrated and helpless. This led to insurmountable disparities in water supply, thus exacerbating the vulnerabilities of India's agrarian economy. Lastly, the British government also imposed high taxes, particularly on lands, which reduced the incomes of farmers and limited their ability to invest in their farm's infrastructure, leading to crop failure and famine.
The British Trade Policies
Having the East India Company in India facilitated the flow of raw materials to Britain, which would later be returned as manufactured goods. This exploitative regime drained India of its wealth, leading to significant export profits of India's resources from its shores. As explained earlier, the Indian agricultural sector only produced cash crops, leading to a lack of food reserves. When famine struck, it became challenging to procure enough food, and the prices of what was available were very high, resulting in unaffordability for many. This was tied to the exploitative and rapacious trade alliances that had the British government taking Indian resources, including food reserves, hence leaving the Indian population vulnerable when famine hit.
The Railway Policies
Apart from agriculture and trade, infrastructure projects played a significant role in increasing famines. In the 1850s, the British government started building railroads in India to transport goods efficiently, including raw materials to be processed into finished products in Britain. Although it benefited the British economy, it was detrimental to India. One effect was that vast areas of land were cleared of vegetation to build the railway tracks, resulting in soil erosion, soil pollution and subsequent crop failure, leading to famine. The railway also created an imbalance in the food market, where areas with foodstuffs could not transport them to areas with scarce food, leading to food shortages and famine. The policies of the British government led to the weakening of India's economy, leaving it with no room to recover. The construction of railways, while aimed at expanding exports, failed to incorporate the grassroots population's needs and led to increased starvation in numerous parts of India.
Natural Disasters
India is prone to natural disasters, including droughts, floods, and cyclones, but how much these contributed to famines is a subject of debate. In some cases, natural disasters could be compensated by growing food in other affected regions, but Indian regions remained dependent on agriculture, which made them vulnerable whenever natural disasters hit. The British government's exploitation policies increased India's dependency on cash crops, and agriculture left the Indian economy vulnerable to natural disasters.
Population Growth
During British imperialism, the population of India rose, leading to food shortages. This increase in population could not be catered for by expanding India's food production, resulting in increased hunger. At the peak of British imperialism, India's population growth stood at four times the total population of the Great Britain, which made it difficult for India to feed its citizens, worsening the condition of the already weakened economy.
After a comprehensive analysis of the factors that contributed to the increased frequency of famines in India during the British colonial era, it's essential to identify the primary cause. Metaphorically speaking, it is like identifying the straw that broke the camel's back. Firstly, the British agricultural policies and trade policies favored short-term economic gains over the well-being of India's citizens. This policy led to severe crop failures, unaffordability, and subsequently, widespread hunger. The British railway and infrastructure policies were detrimental to the Indian ecology, resulting in soil erosion, soil pollution, and a lack of food reserves exacerbating the severity of the famines. Lastly, the increase in population growth in India was a significant contributor to the famine crises, as the country struggled to meet the demand for food. However, the primary cause was the British monetary policy. The imposition of high taxes, the preference for export-oriented agriculture, and the exploitation of Indian resources like cotton, spices, and tea contributed significantly to food scarcity. These policies drained India of its wealth, resulting in famine as the population could not afford rising food prices. The economic policies put in place by the British government were the primary cause of the increased frequency of famines in India from 1765 to 1900.
In conclusion, the increased frequency of famines in India from 1765 to 1900 was caused by various factors, including British agricultural policies, trade policies, railway policies, population growth, and natural occurrences like droughts and floods. The agricultural policies of the British initiated India's overdependence on cash crops, compromising India's food security and creating an insurmountable imbalance in the food market. The infrastructure policy led to soil erosion, soil pollution, and lack of food reserves, exacerbating the situation of famine whenever it occurred. Population growth made the situation worse by overstretching the available food, and natural catastrophes added salt to the already raw wound. However, monetarist policies put in place by the British had the most significant impact on the increasing frequency of famines in India. These monetary policies caused the Indian population to become vulnerable financially, further intensifying their level of starvation. While it's easy to simplify the factors that contributed most to the spike of famines in India, it is worth noting that these factors fed into each other to create a complex system where the compound effects ultimately led to exacerbated hunger.
