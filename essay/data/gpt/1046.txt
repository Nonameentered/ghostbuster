The sublime is a concept that has been explored by thinkers and artists for centuries. From Aristotle to Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, many philosophers have attempted to define and articulate the sublime experience. Burke and Kant both developed theories of the sublime, but their conceptions differ considerably. In this essay, I will compare and contrast Kant and Burke’s theories of the sublime, and explore whether Kant’s conception of the sublime can be applied to artwork.
Burke’s theory of the sublime is rooted in the idea of terror. He believed that the sublime is an experience in which the observer is overwhelmed by fear, awe, and wonder. For Burke, the sublime is closely linked to the natural world and is experienced in response to grand and imposing natural phenomena such as mountains, storms, or waterfalls. According to Burke, the sublime is defined by the contrast between a feeling of danger and the observer’s ability to feel safe. Thus, the sublime is not only a response to the grandeur of nature, but also to the danger that such grandeur poses. Burke believed that the sublime experience leads to a kind of emotional purification. The observer is temporarily freed from ordinary concerns and constrained by the sense of awe that the sublime creates.
Kant also believed that the sublime experience is one that is marked by awe and wonder, but his conception of the sublime is considerably different from Burke’s. Kant’s theory of the sublime is rooted in the idea of transcendent reason. For Kant, the sublime experience is one of apprehension and admiration. While the sublime is still an experience that leaves the observer feeling awe-struck and overwhelmed, it is not a response to danger or terror. Instead, it is a response to the idea of the infinite and the infinite's capacity to transcend the limits of the observer’s understanding. According to Kant, the sublime is felt when “nature threatens to overpower our imagination, yet the feeling of the freedom which is the presupposition of reason remains unshaken.” For Kant, the sublime is a reaction to the idea of something that is entirely beyond the observer’s grasp.
The contrast between Burke and Kant’s theories of the sublime can be seen in their respective interpretations of the same natural phenomena. For example, consider a mountain. For Burke, the sublime is created by the mountain’s grandeur and the fear of being overwhelmed by its size and power. From this perspective, the sublime is about recognizing the dangers that the natural world possesses. For Kant, the sublime is created by the mountain’s possible infinity, that it holds a kind of infinity that our minds cannot fully conceive. From this perspective, the sublime is about discovering the limitlessness of our minds and imagination.
Taking these theories onto artwork means that Kant’s concept of the sublime can be applied to artwork much more easily than Burke’s. Kant believed that the sublime experience is one that occurs when an object or idea exceeds the limits of the observer’s comprehension. Artwork that is considered sublime, according to Kant, is that which becomes an object of wonder and admiration, but also one that presupposes the observer's failure to grasp its ultimate meaning. Therefore, Kant’s concept of the sublime can be applied to artwork that achieves a kind of transcendence or profundity that remains unfathomable to the observer. Pieces of art that are seemingly infinite, and neverending, or that seem to suggest a kind of boundless creativity, will be regarded as sublime.
In conclusion, Kant and Burke’s theories of the sublime differ considerably in their interpretation of the experience. Burke’s theory is rooted in the idea of terror, while Kant’s theory is rooted in the idea of transcendent reason. While both theories begin from the same impulse, awe and wonder, they differ greatly in their response to the mental state. Kant’s theory can be applied to artwork that serves as a trigger for the sublime experience, as long as it is an art that goes beyond understanding, incomprehensible, infinite, or that surpasses our grasp of the world's imagination will be seen as sublime. Thus, Kant’s conception of the sublime has broader possibilities of realization in artwork than Burke’s.
