Logic is a fundamental element of human reasoning and inquiry, providing a framework for constructing and evaluating arguments. But is logic a man-made construct, developed through language and culture, or a feature of the physical world that we discover through observation and analysis? This question has been debated by philosophers and logicians for centuries, and there is no consensus on the matter. In this essay, we will explore the ideas of Lewis Carroll, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Susan Haack, to consider the different perspectives on the nature of logic and its relation to the physical world. Furthermore, we will evaluate the concept of revisability in logic, questioning whether the logical truths we hold today might be subject to change in the future.
Lewis Carroll, a noteworthy Victorian-era mathematician, invented a pioneering literature piece that contains a lot of logical reasoning concepts entwined with veiled meanings in it, named "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." In Carroll's view, logic was a man-made construct, conceived through rational reflection and linguistic conventions. In his book "Symbolic Logic," Carroll regarded logic as a language of symbols, a notational system developed to represent propositions, arguments, and inferential relations between them. For him, logical principles, such as the law of excluded middle or the principle of identity, were not universal truths but convenient rules of the system. He claimed that they did not reflect the fundamental nature of the physical world but were instead the product of logical analysis and manipulation of sentences' meanings. Carroll even went on to argue that the rules of logic were not absolute and could be altered based on our preferences. By contrasting his invented poem "Jabberwocky" with a real one, he revealed that symbolic logic could still be applied in the absence of meaningful words.
In contrast to Carroll's perspective, Willard Van Orman Quine maintained that logic was not a man-made creation but a feature of the physical world that we discover through empirical observation and analysis. He endorsed a view known as naturalism, which contends that reality is ultimately one and that our scientific theories should aim to capture its structure, laws, and relations accurately. According to Quine, logical truths are not arbitrary conventions but necessary consequences of the basic physical principles governing the universe. He suggested that the analytic truth occurs when a piece of knowledge follows from a mere set of definitions and logical laws. The analytic truth would need no empirical evidence to support it, and it must be necessarily true regardless of the observations. Quine talked about the interrelation between metaphysical commitment and how it seemingly holds tons of empirical evidence and implicitly impacts the analytic truth. For instance, the analytic truth that water is H2O could not have been known without the underlying assumptions about molecules around it, and that is an empirical issue. As a result, Quine saw logic as an integral part of the physical world that could not be revised arbitrarily but only as part of broader scientific advances.
Susan Haack's view bridged the gap between Carroll's and Quine's positions, proposing that logic was a compromise between the two perspectives. She argued that logic was simultaneously a man-made construct and a reflection of the physical world, with its rules and principles drawing from both language and experience. Haack emphasized the importance of the pragmatics of language, pointing out that logical principles could change depending on the communicative context. However, she noted that logical principles could not be entirely arbitrary either and that they had to comply with the basic laws of the physical world. In her view, logic was ultimately provisional and subject to revision, but only as part of a continuous scientific dialogue and not based on mere linguistic preferences. Haack talked about "foundherentism," the process of analytic truth searching for the harmony between our preexistent and empirical science.
Therefore, revisability of logic was a significant area of debate among the three philosophers who had different views of the nature of logic. Logic is a highly growth-intensive subject, and the scope of its principles continues to expand due to rigorous research and empirical developments. The extent to which certain areas of logic, such as modal logic or intuitionistic logic, may be revised in the future is unknown. Nonetheless, some central aspects of logic, such as the law of non-contradiction or the principle of bivalence, are considered beyond dispute by many logicians, owing to their undeniable usefulness and applicability in various fields.
The potential for revisability in logic raises significant philosophical and practical challenges. On the one hand, logical revision could lead to significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the physical world, and the adoption of new logical principles could advance scientific inquiry. On the other hand, it may also create uncertainty and confusion, undermining the stability and coherence of our current scientific understanding. Furthermore, if we adopt a position of radical skepticism towards logical principles themselves, we may find ourselves unable to conduct any scientific investigation or even basic communication.
In conclusion, logic is a fundamental aspect of human reasoning and inquiry, providing a framework for constructing and evaluating arguments. The question of whether logic is a man-made construct or a feature of the physical world continues to be debated by philosophers and logicians. Lewis Carroll, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Susan Haack offered three distinct perspectives on the subject, emphasizing the role of language, empirical observation, and the compromise between the two. The possibility of revisability of logical principles underscores the importance of scientific inquiry and the need for continuous dialogue and evaluation of our assumptions and knowledge. Ultimately, logic represents an intersection of linguistic, cultural, and empirical factors that allow us to navigate the complexities of the world around us.
