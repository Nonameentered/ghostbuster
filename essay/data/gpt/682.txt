Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA) or ‘mini-strokes’ are brief episodes of neurological dysfunction caused by a temporary interruption in blood supply to the brain. These attacks occur due to an embolus, small clot or a spasm in a blood vessel. TIAs last for less than 24 hours, with most of them lasting for only a few minutes. These attacks can serve as a warning of an impending stroke, giving a window of opportunity for preventive therapy. In this essay, we will discuss the causes, signs to look for in examination, the main sources of emboli, the epidemiology and risk factors associated with carotid artery disease, and the benefits and considerations of carotid endarterectomy.
The causes of TIA are largely attributed to atherosclerosis, emboli, and thrombi. Atherosclerosis refers to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, leading to the narrowing of the arteries' lumen, and the reduction of blood supply to the brain. Embolism usually results from cardiac sources, predominantly atrial fibrillation. Thrombi also occur from within the patient's bloodstream and tend to be a source of episodic and transient events. Other causes include vasculitis, congenital abnormalities, drug-induced, and migraines.
The signs and symptoms of TIA may vary, but they typically involve sudden, profound, and transient neurological disturbance that is usually reversible. Common neurological symptoms include impaired vision in one or both eyes, weakness or paralysis in an arm or leg, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, balance problems, and headache. The patient may also have excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, nausea, and vomiting.
The main sources of emboli to the brain are the carotid arteries, cardiac sources, and the aorta. The carotid artery comprises the common carotid, internal carotid, and external carotid arteries. The common carotid bifurcates into the internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid supplies the brain while the external carotid supplies the face scalp and neck. Cardiac sources of emboli include atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and patent foramen ovale. The aorta may also be a source of emboli.
Differential causes for transient episodes include migraine attacks, seizure, hypoglycemia, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. TIAs have been observed in up to 20% of migraines.
The exacerbation of carotid artery stenosis by comorbid conditions such as chronic lung and cardiac disease is a complex issue. Chronic heart and lung disease contribute to arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, which could lead to hypertension and atherosclerosis. Hypertension increases the likelihood of rapid carotid stenosis progression, and atherosclerosis increases the risk of embolus formation. This creates a disease state of varying severity that requires management of both the carotid stenosis and the comorbid conditions.
Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical technique that involves removing the blocked portion of the carotid artery. This procedure reduces the risk of future stroke and TIA by restoring normal blood flow to the brain. Carotid endarterectomy is a common and effective intervention for patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. However, it is not without risks, and comorbidities such as heart and lung disease place patients at higher operative risk. In addition, medical management may be preferable in patients who are at low risk of stroke.
Epidemiological data suggest that carotid artery disease affects 1-5% of the population, and is more common in people with hypertension, diabetes, smoking history, and dyslipidemia. Reduction of risk factors such as smoking cessation, blood pressure control, glycemic control in diabetes, and lipid-lowering therapy reduces the risk of stroke and TIA.
Ethical issues surrounding non-resuscitation and indications for surgery in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients may arise due to the individual nature of each case. Non-resuscitation orders serve as a directive made by the patient or surrogate, and should be respected unless a healthcare provider believes the order to be inconsistent with good medical practice. Indications for surgery in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients should also be made after careful assessment by the surgical team taking into account several factors.
Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is used to detect emboli in real-time monitoring during surgery. It can also assess the progress of atherosclerosis and effectiveness of medical and surgical interventions.
In conclusion, TIAs serve as a warning of an impending stroke and provide a window of opportunity for preventive therapy. The causes, signs to look for in the exam, the main sources of emboli, benefits and considerations of carotid endarterectomy, the epidemiology and risk factors associated with carotid artery disease, ethical issues that may arise, and the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound to monitor emboli production among others are significant factors that need to be considered when diagnosing, managing and treating TIAs.
