Neanderthals were a species of hominid that roamed the earth over 300,000 years ago. They were the closest relatives of modern-day humans, and many researchers have speculated whether they were capable of speech. In this essay, the question of whether Neanderthals were capable of speech will be addressed. The topics that will be analyzed include the fossil evidence, neurological interpretation, and the function of verbal communication to identify whether Neanderthals were capable of producing a modern range of sounds.
Fossil Evidence
In terms of fossil evidence, researchers have been able to locate the hyoid bone of Neanderthals, which is the only bone responsible for fixing the tongue and larynx in the throat and helps in vocalization. The hyoid bone is located in the neck area and is connected to the tongue and larynx in modern humans, who utilize it primarily for speech production. The configuration of the hyoid bone in Neanderthals gives us an idea of their ability to produce speech.
The hyoid bone of Neanderthals was located in the same position as that of modern humans, suggesting that they had similar vocal abilities. The length of the bone and the muscle attachment points were less pronounced than those seen in modern humans. However, this does not necessarily mean that Neanderthals could not speak at all. It could only mean that their vocalization would have had different qualities compared to what we consider typical human speech.
An article in The Journal of Human Evolution by F. R. de Lumley and G. C. Weniger in 2004 (cited in Schmitz et al. 2015) presented the discovery of a small bone situated in the right middle ear of a Neanderthal specimen. The discovery of this bone, the stapes, is not unusual as it is a stable component of the ear structure. However, in this particular case, the stapes bone revealed that the Neanderthal was deaf in the right ear. The discovery of a hearing impairment in a Neanderthal specimen suggests that they may have relied on verbal communication more than other forms of communication—such as non-verbal cues and gestures—to exchange information.
Another piece of fossil evidence presented in a study by Quam et al. (2015) relates to the Neanderthal population in Spain. The study analyzed the morphology of the middle ear and found that the ear bones of Neanderthals in this area were similar to those of modern humans. The similarity indicates that their auditory system worked similarly to modern humans and thus, they were able to distinguish between different sounds.
Overall, the fossil evidence suggests that Neanderthals were capable of speech to some extent. The similarities in the structure of the hyoid bone and ear system suggest that they had the ability to vocalize, hear, and understand speech.
Neurological Interpretation
Neurological interpretation also plays a significant role in determining whether Neanderthals were capable of speech. Recent research suggests that some areas of the Neanderthal brain associated with language were developed to a comparable level to that of modern humans (Balzeau 2018).
Many studies and research papers indicate that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the human brain are responsible for the production and comprehension of language (Broca and Wernicke 1861). These areas are present in both modern humans and Neanderthals. Research conducted by Pearce et al. (2013) found evidence of a structurally modern human brain plan in Neanderthal specimens. In their study, they used computed tomography to create virtual casts of the cranial cavity to examine the Neanderthal endocasts. The results showed the presence of Broca's and Wernicke's areas in the Neanderthal brain, indicating that Neanderthal brains contained the necessary neural structure to understand and produce speech.
Based on the studies and research on brain morphology, it appears that Neanderthals were capable of similar neural processes that lead to speech production in modern humans. This evidence suggests that they may have had sophisticated language capabilities, similar to those of humans.
Function of Verbal Communication
The function of verbal communication also provides insights into Neanderthal speech. Humans use speech for a multitude of functions, including signaling social status, establishing relationships, and conveying information. Early humans also used speech to plan, hunt, and work together as a group. Neanderthals seem to have had similar social structures to humans; thus, speech could have played a crucial role in their lives.
Neanderthal artifacts and cave paintings provide evidence of their culture, society, and ability to communicate. The existence of symbolic art and material culture represents human-like cognitive abilities and the capacity for creating shared meaning. The idea of communication through art suggests the possibility of a more complex communication system, including the possibility of language.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the fossil evidence, the neurological interpretation, and the function of verbal communication all suggest that Neanderthals were capable of producing a range of sounds that would have allowed them to communicate verbally with their own kind. The differences between the vocal apparatus of Neanderthals and humans suggest that their vocalizations may have had distinct qualities and were different from human speech. However, the similarities in brain morphology, the position of the hyoid bone, and evidence of hearing impairments indicate speech capabilities in Neanderthals that would have allowed for sophisticated communication.
Speech may have played a fundamental role in the social and cultural structures of Neanderthal society, allowing them to communicate, exchange information, and better navigate their ancient world. Nonetheless, more evidence is required to identify precisely what Neanderthal language sounded like, how it was learned, how it varied across differing groups, and how it was used.
As a result, the issue of the capability of Neanderthals to speak remains unresolved, and more research is required. Nonetheless, based on the available evidence, it seems fair to suggest that Neanderthals were capable of speech and likely had unique communication systems that allowed them to communicate with each other verbally. The question of whether it was a language in the same way that humans have languages is a matter of debate and will require further evidence.
