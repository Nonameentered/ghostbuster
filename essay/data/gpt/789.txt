The process of globalization has led to the emergence of multinational companies that operate across several countries. These companies are characterized by a high degree of mobility and the ability to penetrate different markets. Multinational companies are significant players in the global economy and contribute significantly to economic growth and development. However, the national origin of multinationals remains an important issue in the era of globalization. This essay examines the extent to which the national origin of multinational companies remains relevant in the era of globalization and discusses practical examples from various industries.
The national origin of multinational companies is relevant in the era of globalization to a significant extent. One of the ways that national origin is still relevant is through the national policies that regulate the operations of these companies. Governments have a significant role to play in regulating the activities of multinational companies, especially regarding taxation, intellectual property rights, and labor standards. As such, the host country's policies have a significant impact on the operations of multinationals.
For instance, Apple is a multinational company with its headquarters in the US and operations in several countries globally. In 2016, the European Commission (EC) ordered Apple to pay $15.3 billion in back taxes to the Irish government following an investigation that concluded that the company had received illegal state aid. Apple had allegedly agreed with the Irish government to pay an extremely low tax rate, thereby avoiding higher taxes in the United States, where the company's products were mainly sold. This example demonstrates how national governments can affect the operations of multinational companies.
Another way that the national origin of multinationals is relevant is through their management structure. The management of multinational corporations is often led by executives from the home country. These executives are likely to carry their cultural values, attitudes, and practices into the host country, affecting the company's operations positively or negatively.
For instance, Ikea is a multinational company with its origins in Sweden that operates in several countries globally. The company has a reputation for promoting a culture of openness, sustainability, and social responsibility. The management style at Ikea has been attributed to the company's Swedish origin, which places a high emphasis on collaboration, egalitarianism, and consensus decision-making. The Swedish management style has been shown to positively affect the company's operations, especially in relation to employee motivation and customer satisfaction. This example illustrates the role of national origin in the management practices of multinational corporations.
Furthermore, the national origin of multinational companies remains relevant in the era of globalization through consumer behavior. Different consumers may have varying preferences and biases towards products and services based on the company's national origin. As such, multinational corporations may benefit from leveraging their home country's reputation for quality, innovation, or other attributes to attract customers.
For example, Gucci is an Italian luxury fashion brand that operates in several countries globally. The brand's reputation for sophistication, style, and quality has been attributed to its Italian origin. Therefore, Gucci has capitalized on its Italian roots to appeal to customers globally. This example demonstrates the significance of national origin in consumer behavior.
Moreover, the national origin of multinational companies remains relevant in the era of globalization due to its impact on the company's brand image. A company's national origin may influence how the company is perceived by customers, investors, and other stakeholders. As a result, companies may need to leverage or distance themselves from their national origin to manage their brand image effectively.
For instance, Toyota is a multinational company with its origins in Japan that operates in several countries globally. The company has had to manage its brand image following a series of recalls related to safety issues. Toyota has leveraged its Japanese origin to reassure customers that the company is taking proactive steps to address quality and safety concerns. The example of Toyota demonstrates how national origin can affect the brand image of multinational companies.
In conclusion, the national origin of multinational companies remains relevant in the era of globalization. The impact of national origin is evident through national policies, management practices, consumer behavior, and brand image. While multinational companies operate across several countries, their national origin plays a vital role in shaping their operations and their relationships with the host countries. Multinational companies need to be mindful of their national origins and the impact this may have on their operations and engagement with stakeholders. Therefore, multinational companies need to be aware of the impact of their national origin, maximize its potential benefits, and mitigate potential risks.
