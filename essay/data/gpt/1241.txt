Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive medical technology used to measure the oxygen saturation (SpO2) level in arterial blood. This technology has revolutionized patient monitoring by providing an easy, quick, and reliable way to measure oxygen saturation levels, which is a critical tool in different clinical settings.
The functioning principle of pulse oximetry relies on the fact that oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in arterial blood absorbs different wavelengths of light. Specifically, oxygenated hemoglobin has a higher absorption rate in the 660 nm wavelength, while deoxygenated hemoglobin has a higher absorption rate in the 940 nm wavelength. Pulse oximeters use this principle to measure arterial oxygen saturation by calculating the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin.
Pulse oximetry has a wide range of applications, specifically in situations where continuous oxygen monitoring is essential, such as in cardiac and respiratory care, surgical and anesthesia management, and neonatal and pediatric care. Its portability, ease of use, and non-invasive nature make it an essential tool in remote settings such as emergency medical services, ambulances, and home care.
However, pulse oximetry’s effectiveness is limited in certain situations, particularly in cases where peripheral perfusion is compromised due to vasoconstriction, hypothermia, or edema. In these situations, pulse oximetry may provide a lower reading, leading to a false diagnosis of hypoxia, therefore, limiting its clinical effectiveness and utility.
The technology of pulse oximetry is continually evolving, with increasing focus on improving accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. Future developments in this technology include the ability to measure additional parameters such as respiratory rate, pulse rate variability, and continuous blood pressure, among others. This increased information could provide a more comprehensive view of a patient’s physiological state, especially in high-risk clinical environments.
An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance and accuracy of different pulse oximeters in measuring oxygen saturation levels. The study involved several pulse oximeters from multiple manufacturers, which were tested on a group of patients in a clinical environment. The patients had varying conditions, including hypoxia, peripheral vasoconstriction, low perfusion, and low temperature.
The pulse oximeters' readings were recorded sequentially, and their validity was compared against a reference saturation level obtained via arterial blood gas analysis. The results showed varying levels of accuracy among the pulse oximeters, with some providing consistently high readings, while others frequently overstated the saturation levels.
Moreover, the study found that pulse oximeter accuracy could be significantly compromised in situations where peripheral perfusion was impaired, leading to an underestimation of the true oxygen saturation level. This finding highlights the limitations of pulse oximetry technology in certain clinical settings and underscores the need for continued improvement in pulse oximeter accuracy and reliability.
In conclusion, pulse oximetry is an essential tool in modern healthcare, providing accurate and non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation levels. Its applications are vast and include critical care situations, surgical and anesthesia care, and neonatal and pediatric care. However, its accuracy and reliability are limited in certain clinical settings, and future developments seek to address these limitations. The lab experiment demonstrated that pulse oximeter accuracy varies widely among different instruments, and accurate readings could be obtained only in situations where peripheral perfusion was optimal. This observation underscores the importance of evaluating pulse oximeter performance and enhancing their accuracy and reliability.
