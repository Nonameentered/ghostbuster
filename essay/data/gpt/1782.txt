Fish protein is an essential nutrient for human consumption. The nutritional value of fish protein can degrade during storage, and this can affect the quality of the fish product. As a result, it is vital to examine the changes that occur in fish protein during storage. In this essay, I will explore the methods employed to examine these changes and the outcomes of the study.
The study focused on the changes that occur in the protein quality of Atlantic salmon during storage. The researchers employed chemical and physical methods to examine these changes. The chemical methods used included protein solubility, electrophoretic techniques, and amino acid analysis. The physical methods used included thermal techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering.
Electrophoretic techniques are used to identify the molecular weight, structure, and solubility of proteins. The researchers employed two types of electrophoresis methods: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF). SDS-PAGE separates proteins based on their molecular weight, while IEF separates proteins based on their isoelectric point. The researchers used these techniques to examine the degradation of salmon protein during storage.
Amino acid analysis is used to determine the composition of the essential amino acids in proteins. The researchers used this technique to quantify the amount of lysine, methionine, and tryptophan in Atlantic salmon during storage.
Protein solubility is a measure of the amount of protein that can dissolve in a particular solution. The researchers used this technique to measure the soluble protein content of Atlantic salmon during storage. They employed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) as the solubilizing agents.
Thermal techniques, such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), measure the thermal stability of proteins. The researchers used this technique to examine the effect of temperature on the protein stability of Atlantic salmon. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measures the average size and distribution of particles in a suspension. The researchers used this technique to measure the particle size distribution of salmon protein during storage.
The outcomes of the study showed that Atlantic salmon protein degrades during storage. The researchers found that the protein solubility of salmon decreased during storage. The soluble protein content of salmon samples stored for 14 days decreased by 22% when solubilized by PBS and 37% when solubilized by TCA. The electrophoretic analysis showed that the salmon degradation increased with storage time.
The researchers observed that the protein band intensity decreased after 14 days of storage, indicating the degradation of salmon proteins. The amino acid analysis showed that the concentration of essential amino acids, specifically methionine, decreased during storage. The DSC results showed that the thermal stability of salmon proteins decreased during storage.
The outcomes of the study have significant implications for the fish industry. Proper storage of fish can help to maintain the quality and nutritional value of the product. The findings of this study suggest that adequate storage conditions such as proper temperature and packaging are essential to preserve the nutritional value of fish protein.
In conclusion, the study employed several methods to examine the changes that occur in the protein quality of Atlantic salmon during storage. The chemical and physical methods used, such as electrophoretic techniques, amino acid analysis, protein solubility, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic light scattering, helped to provide insights into the changes that occur in fish protein during storage. The outcomes of the study showed that Atlantic salmon protein degrades during storage, and the protein solubility, amino acid profile, and thermal stability of salmon decreased with storage time. The results of this study highlight the importance of proper storage conditions that can help to preserve the nutritional value of fish protein.
