Introduction
Science is a systematic method of generating and testing theories that seek to explain natural phenomena through empirical evidence. The criteria that define science are influenced by the nature of scientific inquiry and the need to differentiate it from pseudoscientific practices. Demarcation criteria are used to differentiate scientific theories from non-scientific ones. Various philosophers of science have proposed different criteria, and this essay will examine the contrasting views of Karl Popper's falsification criterion and Thomas Kuhn's puzzle-solving criterion, as well as Imre Lakatos's hard core/protective belt ideas, and Thargard's views on astrology. Finally, I will provide my views on what criteria science should have to be considered genuine.
Criteria that Define Science
Science seeks to explain natural phenomena using empirical observations and data. Scientific theories must be testable and subject to falsification and verification through observation and experiments. Scientific theories must be consistent with previous knowledge and supported by evidence that can be independently verified. A scientific theory must be generalizable and applicable to new situations, and it must be predictive in explaining natural phenomena. A scientific theory must be subject to scrutiny and open debate that allows for revisions based on new evidence and observations.
Distinguishing Science from Pseudoscience
Pseudoscience refers to practices that claim to be scientific but do not adhere to scientific criteria. Pseudoscientific practices are characterized by a lack of empirical evidence, adherence to dogma or tradition, and the use of flawed or biased experimental methods. Pseudoscience thrives on preconceived notions and faith rather than rational inquiry and testing. Astrology, for example, is a pseudoscientific practice that claims to predict human behavior and future events using celestial positions. There is no scientific evidence to support the assumptions underlying astrology’s claims, and it violates the criteria of consistency, predictability, and falsifiability.
Karl Popper’s Falsification Criterion
Karl Popper’s falsification criterion posits that scientific theories must be capable of being falsified or refuted. He argued that scientific theories cannot be proven, but they can be disproven. A theory that cannot be falsified is not a scientific theory. According to Popper, a scientific theory must be testable, and its predictions must be capable of being tested and shown to be false. Popper’s criterion emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence in scientific testing. However, this criterion has been criticized for its inability to differentiate between scientific and non-scientific theories. For example, some theories may not be refutable due to limited empirical evidence available to disprove them.
Thomas Kuhn’s Puzzle-Solving Criterion
Thomas Kuhn’s Puzzle-Solving Criterion argues that scientific theories should be evaluated based on their ability to solve puzzles or problems within a particular scientific paradigm. He posits that science is not a steady accumulation of knowledge but a process of solving problems within a given scientific framework. A scientific paradigm provides a framework for inquiry, problem-solving, and sharing of information within a community of scientists. According to Kuhn’s criterion, a theory that solves a puzzle within a paradigm is considered valid or genuine. Kuhn, however, recognizes that there are scientific anomalies or data that cannot be solved within the existing paradigm, leading to paradigm shifts. The puzzle-solving criterion is criticized for relying too much on established scientific frameworks and being too subjective in its evaluations.
Imre Lakatos’s Hard Core/Protective Belt Ideas
Imre Lakatos’s Hard core/Protective Belt ideas emphasize the cyclical nature of scientific theories. Lakatos posits that scientific theories have a “hard core” that is the essential components of the theory that cannot be altered. The hard core is protected by a “protective belt” of auxiliary or limiting hypotheses that are subject to revision or rejection. Lakatos argues that when a scientific theory’s auxiliary hypotheses fail, it may lead to the reconstruction of the theory or the replacement of the paradigm altogether. Lakatos’s criterion has been criticized for its inability to provide objective criteria for evaluating theories and being too abstract.
Thargard’s Views on Astrology
Thargard argues that astrology is a pseudoscientific practice that lacks scientific credibility. Astrology is based on astrological signs, which do not demonstrate any causal relationship with human behavior. There is no empirical evidence to support astrology’s claims, and its ad hoc explanations for failed predictions make it difficult to falsify. The theory also fails to meet other criteria for scientific credibility, such as being generalizable, predictive, and falsifiable.
Demarcation Criteria for Identifying Genuine Science
Demarcation criteria are used to differentiate scientific theories from non-scientific ones. Demarcation criteria must be capable of identifying features that are specific to scientific theories, retain generality, be objective, and be capable of being falsified. However, demarcation criteria have proven difficult to establish, and many proposed criteria have been criticized and challenged.
My Views on Criteria for Genuine Science
A genuine scientific theory must meet the following criteria: It must be testable, falsifiable, and replicable. A scientific theory must make predictions that can be tested and generate results that can be replicated. All scientific theories must be based on empirical evidence and subject to independent verification and scrutiny. A scientific theory must be able to provide causal explanations for natural phenomena and must be consistent with previous knowledge. Finally, scientific theories must be subject to revision based on new evidence and should not be dogmatic or based on preconceived notions. 
Conclusion
Science is a systematic method of generating and testing theories that seek to explain natural phenomena through empirical evidence. Criteria that define science focus on testability, falsifiability, consistency, predictability, and subject to scrutiny and open debate. Demarcation criteria have been proposed to differentiate scientific theories from non-scientific ones. The contrasting views of Karl Popper’s falsification criterion and Thomas Kuhn’s puzzle-solving criterion, as well as Imre Lakatos’s hard core/protective belt ideas, and Thargard’s views on astrology, have revealed the difficulty in establishing satisfactory demarcation criteria. My views on what criteria science should have in order to be considered genuine include testability, falsifiability, replicable, based on empirical evidence, causal explanations, consistent with previous knowledge, and subject to revision based on new evidence.
