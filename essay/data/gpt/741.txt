The 1969 movie "Easy Rider" directed by Dennis Hopper and co-written by Peter Fonda and Terry Southern is a countercultural classic that depicts the journey of two motorcycles riders, Wyatt and Billy, as they travel cross-country with the proceeds from a drug deal. The journey is portrayed as one of aimlessness and boredom, and the film uses various techniques to convey this sense of aimlessness and boredom to prepare the audience for the unexpected climax.
The film starts with a sequence of stills that show Wyatt and Billy preparing for their journey. Through these stills, the audience sees that the characters are riding choppers, which are customized motorcycles and often associated with the counterculture movement that emerged in the 1960s. The stills also show the characters carrying a significant amount of cash, which they earned from a drug deal. The stills have a grainy, washed-out look, giving the impression that the characters are going on an adventure with no clear goals. This sense of aimlessness and lack of direction is reinforced by the use of a flickering light that creates a dream-like, ethereal quality.
As the motorcycles riders start their journey, the film uses long shots of the American landscape to highlight the vastness and emptiness of the country. The shots of the open road stretching before the characters reflect the sense of freedom, but also the sense that the characters' journey will be long and aimless. The sound is also important in this sequence, with the audience hearing the roar of the motorcycles and the wind. However, the use of silence is equally important since it creates a sense of detachment and isolation.
The two characters' interaction is also used to convey a sense of aimlessness and boredom. Wyatt and Billy are both quiet and introspective, and they communicate mainly through gestural language, rather than words. The dialogue between the characters is minimal, and when they do speak, they don't seem to have any real purpose. For example, in one scene, Billy asks Wyatt if he thinks their cash will last the whole trip, and Wyatt replies, "Yeah, I do." There is no elaboration or discussion about how they plan to spend their money or what they want to achieve.
The use of time-lapse photography is another technique used by the film to convey a sense of aimlessness and boredom. Time-lapse sequences depict the passing of time in a compressed way, and in "Easy Rider," they show the characters travelling across different American states. However, these sequences also depict the monotony of life on the road, with the characters often seen riding their motorcycles in silence or lying down in campsites, staring at the sky. These scenes are underscored by the music of The Byrds, Bob Dylan, and other musicians associated with the countercultural movement. The music reinforces the sense of yearning for freedom and escape but also the sense of melancholy and disquiet.
The use of editing and montage is another technique employed by the film to convey a sense of aimlessness and boredom. For example, the editing in the sequence where the characters are in New Orleans, Louisiana, shows them attending a parade, dancing in a nightclub, and getting high on marijuana. However, these moments are punctuated by images of poverty, violence, and racism, which disrupt the sense of freedom and escape. The montage conveys a sense of disorientation and ambiguity, as if the characters are unsure of where they are going or why they are there.
The climax of the film is unexpected but also consistent with the sense of aimlessness and boredom that characterizes the characters' journey. In the final sequence, Wyatt and Billy go to a commune in Arizona, where they are welcomed by a group of hippies. The sequence is optimistic and joyful, with the characters finally finding a place where they feel at home. However, the scene is disrupted by the arrival of locals on motorcycles, who are hostile to the hippies. The sequence ends with Wyatt and Billy being brutally murdered, in an act of senseless violence that highlights the intolerance and hatred that the counterculture movement faced in the 1960s.
The use of film techniques in "Easy Rider" is effective in conveying the sense of aimlessness and boredom that characterizes the characters' journey. The film uses stills, long shots, sound, editing, and montage to create a dream-like, detached atmosphere that prepares the audience for the unexpected climax. The use of music, time-lapse photography, and dialogue is also important in conveying the characters' sense of alienation and disorientation. The climax of the film is a shocking reminder that the counterculture movement was not universally accepted, and that senseless violence was a real risk for those who challenged the social norms of the time.
In conclusion, "Easy Rider" is a film that uses various techniques to convey the sense of aimlessness and boredom in the journey of the bikers. The film prepares the audience for the unexpected climax by creating a detached, dream-like atmosphere that underscores the characters' sense of isolation and disorientation. The use of music, time-lapse photography, and editing is effective in reinforcing the sense of yearning for freedom and escape, but also the sense of melancholy and disquiet. The climax of the film is a reminder that the counterculture movement was not universally accepted and that senseless violence was a real risk for those who challenged the social norms of the time.
