A recent survey conducted by Reading University on the diets and nutrient intakes of its students has revealed some concerning results. Only 28% of the students surveyed were found to be consuming the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables, while 36% of students were found to be consuming more than the recommended amount of saturated fat. These findings have significant implications for the health of the students and highlight the need for education and intervention in order to improve their diets.
The findings of the survey are particularly worrying given the importance of a healthy diet for overall health and wellbeing. The recommended intake of fruit and vegetables is five portions a day, which provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals that are important for maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and stroke, and improving mental health and wellbeing. However, the survey found that only 28% of students were meeting this target, with some students consuming as few as one or two portions per day.
Similarly, the recommended intake of saturated fat is no more than 10% of total daily energy intake, which is important for reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. However, the survey found that 36% of students were consuming more than this recommended amount. Saturated fat is found in foods such as butter, cheese, and fatty meats, and can increase the levels of LDL or “bad” cholesterol in the blood if consumed in excess. This can lead to the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
These findings are particularly concerning given that university students are at a crucial stage of their lives, where lifestyle habits are formed. Poor diet and nutrition can have long-term consequences for health and wellbeing, including an increased risk of chronic diseases in later life. Therefore, it is important that students are educated on the importance of a healthy diet and are provided with the tools to make informed choices about their food and drink intake.
The findings of the survey also have implications for the Dietary Reference Values (DRV) set by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA). The DRV provide guidance on the amounts of different nutrients that people need in order to maintain a healthy diet and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The survey revealed that a large proportion of students were not meeting the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables and were consuming too much saturated fat, indicating that the DRV are not being met by this population.
The DRV for fruit and vegetables recommend a minimum intake of five portions per day, which the survey found was only being met by 28% of students. Similarly, the DRV for saturated fat recommend a maximum intake of no more than 10% of total daily energy intake, which was being exceeded by 36% of students. These findings highlight the need for continued education and intervention to ensure that the DRV are being met by all segments of the population, including university students.
In conclusion, the findings of the Reading University survey on the diets and nutrient intakes of its students have highlighted some concerning trends. Only a minority of students were found to be meeting the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables, while a significant proportion were consuming too much saturated fat. These findings have important implications for the health and wellbeing of the students and underline the need for intervention and education to improve their diets. Additionally, the findings emphasize the importance of meeting the DRV set by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy to ensure that all population groups are consuming a healthy and balanced diet.
