The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization established in 1995 to enhance global trade by encouraging free trade among its member states and reducing trade barriers. It provides a framework of fair trade rules and mechanisms to settle trade disputes between its member states. The WTO has a unique dispute settlement mechanism that is designed to resolve disputes between its members in a fair, timely, and efficient manner. This paper will explain the stages of the WTO dispute settlement procedure and the obligations of parties under the relevant agreements and articles, using the example of the United States and European Community's dispute over biotech products.
The dispute between the United States and the European Community (EC) over biotech products began in the late 1990s. The US complained that the EC's regulatory measures on biotech products are not based on scientific evidence and are therefore in violation of the WTO agreements. The US argued that the EC's measures on biotech products created an unnecessary trade barrier that prevented US products from entering the European market. The EC, on the other hand, argued that its measures were necessary to protect human health and the environment, as well as to ensure public acceptance of biotech products.
The WTO's dispute settlement procedure has four main stages: consultation, panel establishment, panel proceedings, and appeals. In the first stage, consultation, the complaining party requests consultations with the respondent state to resolve the dispute. The consultations aim to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problem without resorting to litigation. The consultations must be held within 30 days, and if they fail, the complaining party can request the establishment of a panel to inquire into the dispute.
In the US-EC biotech dispute, the US requested consultations with the EC in May 2003. The consultations were held in July 2003, but no agreement was reached, and the US requested the establishment of a panel in September 2003.
The second stage of the dispute settlement procedure is the panel establishment. An independent panel of experts is established to examine the dispute, consider the arguments and evidence submitted by the parties, and issue a report with its findings and recommendations. The panel must be established within 45 days of the request, and its report must be issued within 6 months of the panel's composition.
In the US-EC biotech dispute, a panel was established in November 2003, comprising three experts appointed by the WTO Director-General. The panel's report was issued in September 2006, concluding that the EC's regulatory measures on biotech products violated several WTO agreements. The panel recommended that the EC bring its measures into compliance with the WTO agreements or face the risk of trade retaliation.
The third stage of the dispute settlement procedure is the panel proceedings. The parties can submit written arguments, evidence, and comments on the panel's report and engage in a hearing with the panel. The parties can also respond to questions from the panel and make oral arguments. The panel's report is confidential during this stage, and the parties can only comment on it if they have been given permission by the panel.
In the US-EC biotech dispute, the parties submitted written arguments and evidence, participated in a hearing with the panel, and made oral arguments. The panel's report was confidential during this stage, and the parties could only comment on it if they have been given permission by the panel.
The fourth stage of the dispute settlement procedure is the appeals stage. Either party can appeal the panel's report to the WTO Appellate Body, which reviews the panel's legal findings and conclusions and issues a final appellate report. The Appellate Body must issue its report within 60 days of the appeal.
In the US-EC biotech dispute, both parties appealed the panel's report to the Appellate Body. The Appellate Body issued its report in February 2008, upholding the panel's findings and recommendations that the EC's regulatory measures on biotech products violated several WTO agreements. The Appellate Body recommended that the EC bring its measures into compliance with the WTO agreements or face the risk of trade retaliation.
Under the WTO agreements, parties have specific obligations during the dispute settlement procedure. These obligations include the obligation to observe the deadlines and other procedural requirements, the obligation to make efforts to reach a mutually acceptable solution during consultations, the obligation to cooperate with the panel and provide evidence, and the obligation to comply with the final report of the panel and the Appellate Body.
In the US-EC biotech dispute, both parties observed the procedural requirements, participated in the consultations, cooperated with the panel, and complied with the final report of the Appellate Body. The EC amended its regulatory measures on biotech products in June 2010 to comply with the WTO agreements, and the US lifted its trade sanctions against the EC in July 2010.
In conclusion, the WTO's dispute settlement procedure is an important mechanism for resolving trade disputes between its member states. The procedure has four main stages: consultation, panel establishment, panel proceedings, and appeals. Parties have specific obligations under the relevant agreements and articles, including the obligation to observe the deadlines and other procedural requirements, the obligation to make efforts to reach a mutually acceptable solution during consultations, the obligation to cooperate with the panel and provide evidence, and the obligation to comply with the final report of the panel and the Appellate Body. The US-EC biotech dispute is an example of how the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism can be used to resolve complex trade disputes, and how parties can comply with their obligations under the relevant agreements and articles.
