The popularity of Lijiang as a tourist destination is growing rapidly, and it is important to understand the consumer group that is driving this trend. Through tourism marketing segmentation, characteristics and behaviors of the consumers can be analyzed, which can help in promoting tourism in Lijiang. Additionally, the Purchase-Consumption System Model (PCSM) can provide insights into tourists' behavior during leisure travel, which can help in making recommendations for the Lijiang Tourism Bureau manager.
The consumer group driving the tourism trend in Lijiang is diverse and includes different nationalities, ages, and interest groups. However, one significant and influential group is the Chinese middle class. The Chinese middle class has been growing in numbers and purchasing power, leading to an increase in leisure travel. According to a report by Chinaâ€™s State Council, the size of China's middle class reached 400 million in 2019 and is expected to grow to 600 million by 2025. The middle class seeks authentic cultural experiences, luxury, and high-quality services, which Lijiang can offer. Besides, with the Covid-19 pandemic, Chinese tourists are looking to explore their own country's domestic destinations rather than traveling abroad, making Lijiang an ideal destination.
Tourism marketing segmentation can be used to analyze the Chinese middle-class tourists' characteristics and behaviors. Demographic segmentation can group customers according to age, gender, and income. In this case, the Chinese middle class falls under the demographic segment. Psychological segmentation can group customers according to their personalities, lifestyles, interests, and values. In Lijiang, tourists' psychological segmentation highlights their interest in culture, history, nature, and adventure. Behavioral segmentation can group customers based on their purchasing behavior, usage behavior, and brand loyalty. This segment can help identify the types of products or services the tourists are interested in and their shopping preferences. Through these segments, the Lijiang Tourism Bureau can tailor their marketing efforts to appeal to these customers by providing unique and high-quality experiences.
In the PCSM, the tourist's behavior can be divided into six stages: pre-purchase, purchase, consumption, post-consumption evaluation, divestment, and re-purchase. Understanding the tourists' behavior during these stages can help in making recommendations for the Lijiang Tourism Bureau to enhance the tourist experience and increase their satisfaction.
During the pre-purchase stage, tourists can use a variety of channels to search for information and plan their trip. The Lijiang Tourism Bureau can attract more tourists by establishing a strong digital presence through social media, online travel agencies, and search engine optimization. Offering online reservations and transparent pricing can reduce the uncertainty and increase trust, making the planning process more convenient for visitors.
During the purchase stage, tourists are more likely to visit attractions with high-quality services, such as restaurants and hotels. Offering package deals, discounts, and perks such as free transport or curated experiences can attract visitors, leading to a higher conversion rate. Additionally, customizing packages to suit the tourists' interests can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
During the consumption stage, tourists enjoy the experiences Lijiang has to offer, such as sightseeing, hiking, shopping, and other cultural activities. Ensuring that these experiences meet the tourists' expectations and providing high-quality services can lead to a positive experience, increasing the likelihood of repeat visits and positive word of mouth.
During the post-consumption evaluation stage, tourists are likely to share their experiences with friends, family, or leave reviews online. Providing an excellent post-consumption service by addressing any issues, thanking visitors for their visit, and asking for feedback can enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat visits.
During the divestment stage, tourists leave Lijiang, leading to the potential loss of customers' loyalty and positive word of mouth. The Lijiang Tourism Bureau can encourage visitors to return by offering discounts, loyalty programs, or asking for feedback through surveys. Maintaining communication with visitors via social media, email newsletters, or online reviews can increase engagement and inspire repeat visits.
In conclusion, the Chinese middle class is driving the tourism trend in Lijiang by seeking authentic cultural experiences, luxury, and high-quality services. Tourism marketing segmentation can be used to analyze the tourists' characteristics and behaviors of the Chinese middle class, leading to successful marketing campaigns. Additionally, the PCSM can be used to provide valuable insights into tourist behavior during leisure travel and make recommendations for the Lijiang Tourism Bureau manager. By understanding tourists' behavior during the six stages of the PCSM, the Lijiang Tourism Bureau can tailor their marketing efforts and provide high-quality experiences, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word of mouth, ultimately driving tourism growth.
