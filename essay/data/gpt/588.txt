Constantin von Neurath was one of the key figures leading the German occupation of Czechoslovakia during the period of Nazi control. He served as the protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia from March 1939 to September 1941 and was appointed as a "protector" by Adolf Hitler. His unique views and policies aimed at bringing stability to the region, defending Czech autonomy and maintaining peace and order in the protectorate. In this essay, I will examine his views and policies as a representative of the German Reich in Bohemia-Moravia, compare them with Hitler and other Nazi Party leaders, and evaluate his effectiveness in defending Czech autonomy and maintaining peace in the protectorate.
Born in Kleinglattbach on February 2, 1873, Constantin von Neurath was initiated into the military tradition at a young age. After his studies, Neurath started his diplomatic career in 1903. He was a brilliant diplomat, serving at Vienna, Bucharest, Turkey, Madrid, and London before he was appointed as the ambassador to Rome in 1930 and Foreign Minister in 1931. Neurath held this position until February 1938 when he resigned a few months before the Munich agreement was signed. Despite being a National Socialist, Neurath did not approve of the aggressive foreign policy of the Nazi Party.
In March 1939, after the occupation of Bohemia-Moravia, Hitler appointed Neurath as the protector of the German protectorate. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was a result of Nazi Germany's occupation and annexation of the Czechoslovakian territories. The Nazi regime renamed the Czechoslovakian state as "Bohemia and Moravia" after their occupation of Sudetenland, which led to the disintegration of the country. Neurath aimed to bring stability to the region, defend Czech autonomy and maintain peace and order in the protectorate.
One of the significant steps taken by Neurath was to try to find a workable way of accommodating the Czech population within the new protectorate. He declared that the protectorate was an independent country and had its military, police, and administration. Neurath hoped that these measures would assuage those who were afraid of Nazi domination, but he remained unsuccessful in winning the Czech people's trust. Nonetheless, Neurathâ€™s policy of granting Czechs a degree of autonomy was essential during the initial stages of the Protectorate as it helped to mitigate nationalist sentiments against the Nazi regime.
Another significant contribution of Neurath to the Protectorate was the creation of a unified legal system that included both Czech and German legal traditions. This move aimed at maintaining law and order in the protectorate, given that the legal systems of the German protectorate and Czechoslovakia were vastly different. The new legal system was intended to be impartial and provided for separate courts to deal with different sections of the populace; it also allowed Czech lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals to continue practicing their professions. This move worked well, as there was no complaint of bias towards the Germans in the judicial system.
Another significant move by Neurath was the establishment of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. This agency aimed at promoting the emigration of Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia to other countries, primarily Palestine. By creating a legal and orderly emigration program, Neurath aimed to prevent the Nazis from resorting to brutal means to remove Jews from the area. This action took place before the mass deportation of Jews started, showing that Neurath sought to control the situation and prevent the more infamous ""Final Solution.
Although Neurath was not averse to robbing Czechoslovakia of its resources, he was more interested in preserving the peace and security of the protectorate. He opposed outright pillage and commanded the German occupation forces to refrain from exploitation and mistreatment of the Czech population. Neurath also urged the German settlers to learn the Czech language and culture, and urged them to respect the rights and traditions of Czechs. He saw the value of cultural exchange in bringing stability and unity to the region. This policy led to the injection of a little more fellowship into the Protectorate. Reciprocal visits, cultural exchanges and meetings between high-ranking officials were organized to promote the relationship between the Germans and the Czechs.
Neurath's policies on the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia differed from Hitler's and other Nazi Party leaders in several ways. Hitler was entirely focused on total domination, the extermination of the Jews, and the persecution of Czechs in the protectorate. Hitler perceived Czechoslovakia as a geographically pivotal state in Europe and sought to eliminate it as a potential ally of the Allies in World War II. Other Nazi Party leaders were only interested in pillaging the region's resources and using the Czech population as forced labor.
Neurath, on the other hand, aimed to maintain peace and stability in the region. He saw the intrinsic value of Czechs as partners and treated them with a degree of respect and tolerance. Neurath did not approve of the mass deportation of Jews and aimed to control its execution in a straightforward, orderly and legal method. After the war, Neurath was put on trial for "crimes against peace," but he was found guilty of only minor offenses as the judges were impressed by his attempts to moderate the Nazi regime and smooth the occupation in the Czech lands.
However, Neurath's policies had significant limitations, mostly because his authority was limited. Although Hitler had appointed him as the protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia, the Nazi Party controlled the administration of the protectorate. The SS had significant powers and operated independently of Neurath, pursuing goals contrary to his. The Nazi Party's top leaders intervened often in Bohemia-Moravia, undermining Neurath's authority, particularly after the outbreak of world war II. The occupation policies became increasingly harsh, with the brutal suppression of any form of open resistance from the people in the protectorate.
In conclusion, Constantin von Neurath was a unique figure in the Nazi regime, with a different outlook and approach to governance and occupation. He aimed to bring stability to the region, defend Czech autonomy and maintain peace and order, which differed from Hitler and other Nazi Party leaders. Neurath's policies of autonomy and preservation of Czech culture infused some degree of fellowship into the protectorate. Although his authority was limited, his contributions to trying to establish boundaries on Adolf Hitler's foreign policy during World War II were notable. His policies towards the Jews of the protectorate aimed at legal, orderly and expeditious emigration, which prevented the Nazis from resorting to such brutal methods of mass deportation. Despite limitations, Neurath was considered a positive thinker and peaceful collaborator during his period in the protectorate, and his actions were undoubtedly commendable at the time of his ruling.
