Throughout early modern England, the practice of public executions was an effective form of control, punishment, and entertainment. Public executions served as a symbol of the authority of the monarch and a means to deter crime within society. In order to maintain control and enforce moral values, the set-piece speech played a crucial role in the execution process. As the attitudes towards public execution evolved over time, the existence of this event became a contested issue in society. This essay will examine the purpose of public executions in early modern England, how they were perceived by society, the significance of the set-piece speech, and the changing attitudes towards public executions.
Public executions in early modern England were primarily used as a warning to potential criminals and as a spectacle to entertain the masses. Executions were seen as the ultimate form of punishment and were often carried out in public to maximize their effectiveness. Public executions served as a display of governmental power and were designed to be a brutal reminder of the consequences of criminal activity (Gatrell 3-4). The display of an execution in a public square was an opportunity for the government to showcase the power and authority of the ruling monarch and would often be attended by large crowds of people.
Another significant aspect of public executions was the role they played in the justice system. Public executions were seen as a necessary form of punishment to maintain order and deter crime within society (Sharpe 22). The idea was that if a potential criminal could witness the severity of the punishment, they would be less likely to commit a crime. Executions were often used as a means of enforcing the law, while also providing an outlet for the community to express their disgust towards criminals.
The significance of the set-piece speech in the execution process was used as a tool to reinforce the authority of the monarch and to reinforce moral values. The speech would often be delivered by a priest or a minister and would appeal to the convicted person to confess their sins and repent before their execution (Sharpe 24). This speech was also used as an opportunity to reiterate the authority of the monarch and the importance of holding allegiance to the Crown. The set-piece speech was an attempt to remind the condemned that they should accept their punishment with grace and humility and encourage them to turn to God for forgiveness.
The set-piece speech also played a crucial role in the control of the audience and the perception of the execution. The speech was used to convey a narrative of the morality of the situation, creating a story of good versus evil in which the monarch was in charge of maintaining the balance of power in society (Sharpe 24). The speech would often be crafted to appeal to the audience's sense of morality and justice and was an essential tool for ensuring that the audience would comply with the authority of the monarch.
The attitude towards public executions varied within society, and over time, evolved with a growing concern for the morality of the act. For some, the public execution of criminals was a necessary aspect of justice, and they saw it as a just punishment for those who had committed heinous crimes. On the other hand, some in society began to question the morality of such a spectacle. The humanitarian movement of the 18th-century spearheaded by John Howard, sought to reform the justice system and viewed public executions as a barbaric act, claiming that it served no meaningful purpose other than to excite the sadistic desires of the crowd.
Public executions were also condemned by those who saw it as an opportunity for disorder and chaos within society. The crowds that gathered to watch an execution were often large, and many feared that these crowds were encouraged by the violence of the spectacle (Gatrell 73). The concern was that such a display of violence could lead to criminal behavior and other acts of violence within the community.
The changing attitudes towards public executions also coincided with wider cultural changes within society. There was a shift towards a more refined and sophisticated society that viewed public executions as a relic of the past. As the Enlightenment era progressed, there was a growing concern towards human rights and the role of the government in enforcing punishment. The idea of rehabilitation became increasingly popular, with people advocating for a more humane punishment system that would allow convicts to reform and be integrated back into society.
In conclusion, public executions played a significant role in early modern England, serving as a means of punishment, control, and entertainment. The set-piece speech was central to the execution process, reinforcing the authority of the monarch and encouraging the acceptance of the punishment. As the attitudes towards public executions changed, the spectacle became a contested issue in society, with some advocating for its reform while others saw it as a necessary aspect of justice. Overall, public executions were a reflection of the changing attitudes towards punishment and justice in society, and they represent a significant chapter in the history of early modern England.
