Iain Sinclair's essay "Lights Out for the Territory" draws a compelling juxtaposition between the modern-day metropolis of London and H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel, "War of the Worlds." At its core, Sinclair's essay aims to highlight the vulnerabilities and performances of the twenty-first-century metropolis by examining how it has evolved since Wells' time. This essay will explore how Sinclair's essay and Wells' novel connect, what lessons can be drawn from their comparison, and how this can teach us about the vulnerabilities and performances of the modern-day metropolis.
On the surface, "Lights Out for the Territory" and "War of the Worlds" may seem worlds apart. Still, both works share common themes and ideas. "War of the Worlds" is set in Victorian England during the late 19th century, where London was the center of British culture and commerce. The novel tells the story of an alien invasion of the earth, and the ensuing battle between humans and aliens.
Sinclair's essay, on the other hand, is set in contemporary London, and explores the city's cultural, social, and political dimensions through a series of essays. Like "War of the Worlds," Sinclair's work is also concerned with power dynamics and the impact of larger forces on the individual. Both works are intricately concerned with the city's ability to withstand outside threats; while "War of the Worlds" focuses on extraterrestrial invasion, "Lights Out for the Territory" focuses on the real-world threats posed by urban decay, economic collapse, and social unrest.
Sinclair's work is heavily influenced by Wells' novel. Old Street, a district in London, is described by Sinclair as "the scene of the first Martian landing," alluding to the novel's opening. Sinclair is keenly aware of the ways in which London has transformed since the Victorian era, and it is evident that this awareness is rooted in the city's rich literary history. Through the novel, Wells asks important questions about the role of technology, humans' reliance on it, and the limits of progress.
Similarly, Sinclair questions the limits of contemporary progress, particularly in the face of economic downturns, ecological disasters, and political upheavals. For Sinclair, these threats are an outgrowth of the limitless growth and expansion agenda of contemporary capitalism. Sinclair quotes a line from the novel, "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched," to suggest that this same sentiment can now be applied to the present day, where the world is being watched by invisible forces that dictate our actions and shape our future.
One of the most significant lessons to be derived from the comparison of "Lights Out for the Territory" and "War of the Worlds" is an awareness of the precariousness of urban life. Wells' novel underscores the fragility of human civilization in the face of seemingly unstoppable outside forces, while Sinclair's essays remind us that contemporary civilization is equally as fragile, even in the absence of extraterrestrial threats.
Today's urban metropolis is particularly vulnerable to disruption or breakdown, whether due to climate change, global pandemics, economic crises, or political unrest. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has highlighted the fragility of modern societies and their over-reliance on complex supply chains, transportation networks, and globalized systems of production and distribution. In this sense, Sinclair's work is a warning about the dangers of unchecked neoliberal globalization.
Moreover, despite all the technological advances since Wells' time, Sinclair highlights how urban life can still be oppressive, isolating, and alienating. His portrayal of London depicts a fragmented city that is often unwelcoming, hostile, and exclusionary to its inhabitants. The residents of London are desperate to find meaning and toconnect with one another, but instead, they are thwarted by the very infrastructure that they depend on. Sinclair's work expresses a sense of disillusionment with the promise of modernity and the failures of contemporary urban planning.
Finally, we can gather from both works that the power dynamics associated with urban life are critical in shaping outcomes. The main protagonist in "War of the Worlds" is a scientist, whose knowledge of the natural world provides an advantage in strategizing against the aliens. In contrast, Sinclair's essays emphasize the uneven distribution of power in the city, where the privileged control the narrative and the majority are excluded from decision-making. The dangers of unbridled capitalism are further highlighted through Sinclair's work.
In conclusion, "Lights Out for the Territory" and "War of the Worlds" are both works that offer significant insight into the vulnerabilities, performances, and power structures of the twenty-first-century metropolis. While the two works may seem to be wildly dissimilar, they share a common thread when it comes to human civilization's precariousness in the face of environmental, economic, and social upheaval. As we navigate the challenges of the twenty-first century, we should learn from these works' insights and develop strategies that prioritize sustainability, inclusivity, and resilience.
