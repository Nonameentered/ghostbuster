Ken Booth is a prominent scholar of International Relations (IR), who has made significant contributions to the field with his concept of 'utopian realism'. According to him, utopian realism implies the establishment of a world order that reconciles the ideal with the actual by engaging the core values of liberalism and realism. Although Booth's 'utopian realism' has its application to the current world order, the question remains: is it feasible? This essay aims to examine the four main propositions of Booth's 'utopian realism' and determine the feasibility of 'utopian realism' as an IR concept.
Booth's first proposition states that "States can change their behaviour and attitudes as a result of the kind of dialogue with others that is based on empathy and mutual respect". Empathy and mutual respect are necessary ingredients for dialogue, which plays a vital role in improving relations between States. However, in the context of international relations, dialogue lacks the practicality of reducing tensions and conflicts. Dialogue is not a tangible means of addressing conflicts when faced with grave threats to State sovereignty, such as international terrorism or territorial disputes. In such situations, there is no room for dialogue and empathy. States are compelled to take preemptive measures, leading to hostility in international relations.
Booth's second proposition states that "The search for security can be fitted into a broader international context, in which the central issue is a long-term war against poverty, social inequality, and environmental degradation". It is a noble idea to seek security in the context of a broader international context. However, it is uncertain if this could be a plausible solution to the issues that beset the world today, given the complexities of the global environment. In today's world, security and foreign policy are inextricably linked to survival as a state. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that the search for security could be tempered by other broader issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.
Booth's third proposition states that "The goal of an embryonic world order should be the achievement, over the long term, of global justice". The pursuit of justice is a noble goal, something that all nations aspire to accomplish. However, when it comes to international relations, defining justice is a contentious issue. Different States have their interpretation of what constitutes justice, and it is not easy to get a global agreement on what it entails. The divergent ideologies and value systems of different States make it difficult to reach a common understanding of what is just.
Booth's fourth proposition states that "The management of global interdependence necessitates the creation of new forms of global socio-economic governance". It is an agreement that the world has become more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. The international community must work together to tackle emerging global issues such as pandemics, climate change, and cyber threats. However, nation-states remain the primary actors in IR, and national interests remain a top priority for any government. It is, therefore, unrealistic to expect a relinquishing of national sovereignty for the creation of global socio-economic governance.
A critical examination of Booth's propositions suggests that it is difficult to implement utopian realism as a concept for International Relations. The intricate balance between liberalism and realism may prove elusive in practice. Even if empathy, mutual respect, and dialogue may be practicable in some situations, they are unlikely to resolve major international conflicts, which require a more substantial and firm approach. The merging of national interests with global socio-economic governance, necessary for global order, seems idealistic.
Booth adapts Nye's concept of "process-utopias" as a means to effect change, and this may offer a window of promise for the feasibility of 'utopian realism' as an IR concept. Process-utopias involve the creation of institutions and norms that gradually shift the beliefs and actions of States towards a more utopian view of international relations. This process involves small, incremental progress towards a broader goal. By looking outside of traditional IR discourse, Booth recognizes the need for change within the international order and offers the concept of process-utopias as a feasible path towards a more utopian reality.
Booth's 'utopian realism' is a useful concept that provides a critical lens through which the current world order may be analyzed. However, there remains a significant challenge in implementing it as a viable IR concept. While the idea of reconciling the ideal with the actual is a noble idea in the abstract, the reality of international relations, characterized by a complex web of state interests, makes it unlikely to achieve a durable global order. Thus, an alternative model for the international order is necessary to meet the end of reconciling the ideal with the actual.
Overall, it can be concluded that while Booth's 'utopian realism' offers valuable insights into the idealistic vision of global order, it falls short in its practicality. With the current state of international relations characterized by an increasingly complex interdependence, reliance on national sovereignty, and the diversity of States' ideologies and interests, it is unlikely that a global order based on utopian realism is feasible. A more viable alternative model for the international order is necessary, one that reconciles the ideal with the actual by acknowledging State interests and the limitations of global governance.
