Violence has always been a dominant thematic element in Latin American cinema, as the subcontinent is beset by political instability, deep-seated social inequality, and acute economic hardships. Violence can often be seen as a response to political oppression or social upheaval, as it is frequently used as a means of resistance. The use of violence in contemporary Latin American cinema reflects not only the region's violent history, but also the ongoing struggles and challenges encountered by the people.
Three critically acclaimed Latin American films from recent years serve as prime examples of the role of violence in shaping the stories and characters. These movies are "City of God" (2002) directed by Fernando Meirelles; "The Squad" (2011) directed by Jaime Osorio Marquez, and finally, "Pájaros de Verano" (2018) directed by Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra. These films tell poignant stories of how violence erupts in Latin America, both as a response to the system's structures and as an effect of the economic struggles.
"City of God" is a classic masterpiece of Latin American cinema. Set in the favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro, the movie depicts how the locals are brutally caught in the crossfires of conflicting gangs and law enforcement. It is a heart-rending tale of life amid the chaos of urban violence. The director, Meirelles, uses violence in "City of God" as a terrifying reminder of just how perilous and hopeless the situation is for the locals. Yet, in the midst of all this, the characters come alive, and their struggles are portrayed vividly, bringing to light the issues of poverty, drug trafficking, and the largely ignored political struggles of the time.
"The Squad" tells a story of five soldiers sent to an isolated Colombian foothill base, which is rumored to have been attacked by an insurgency. The terrified soldiers must fight their way back to civilization after discovering that they are not alone. The movie, directed by Jaime Osorio Marquez, is fiercely violent: limbs fly, blood spews, and gunfire rages throughout. However, it shows that the soldiers, far from being the usual macho caricatures of soldiers, are intimately shaped by the violence they encounter. In "The Squad," violence serves not only as a driver of the plot, but also as a lens through which the viewer examines how the soldiers respond to the most trying conditions, how they react to the loneliness, and how they cling to their humanity in the hopelessness of the situation.
Lastly, "Pájaros de Verano" depicts the emergence of the drug trade in rural Colombia in the late 1960s, focusing on the effects of the drug culture in traditional indigenous communities. The film shows how various parties make use of the drug trade, either to make quick cash or to assert their power. The directors Gallego and Guerra excellently portray the gradual descent of characters from idealism to fully-fledged violence, delving into the complex society of the Colombia of the time. The landscape of violence in "Pájaros de Verano" is more expansive than that in "City of God" or "The Squad." The movie depicts violence as an economic engine, a generator of immense wealth, and power, but it also shows how the spread of violence in society has a deep spiritual impact on people involved, how it erodes the traditional customs and beliefs of the indigenous peoples of the region.
In all three films, violence drives the plot, and as the violence escalates, the characters become more complex, more human, and more flawed. Violence is used as a conduit to explore the characters' development, their response to life's harsh circumstances, and how they come to terms with their actions. The role of violence in these movies also lies in its ability to amplify the societal values that exist in Latin America. These films make it clear that the violence engulfing Latin America is not random; it reflects the flaws and limitations of the economic and political systems that are in place.
The directors' use of violence is not merely gratuitous; it has a didactic function that invites the viewer to analyze related social issues. The depictions of violence in these films are meant to give the viewer a measure of the experiences of the characters. The viewer is invited to almost develop a visceral connection to the violence, to share in its outcomes. This connection serves to deepen the viewer's understanding of the characters, their decision-making, and how it relates to the larger social context. Ultimately, the role of violence in contemporary Latin American cinema is to highlight the socio-economic and political issues dominating the region and encourage discourse around those issues.
In conclusion, violence is an integral feature of contemporary Latin American cinema that speaks to the complexities of Latin American society, its myriad challenges and struggles. These films demonstrate that violence is a pervasive feature across all strata of society, and is a reflection of larger systemic issues. By utilizing violence as a didactic tool, these directors elucidate the intersection between cultural practices, power structures, and violence. These films' use of violence provides the viewer with an unflinching look at the region's violent past and present and the complex realities that continue to shape the contemporary Latin American experience.
