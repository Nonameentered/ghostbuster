Malibu Garden Furniture Ltd is a company that specializes in the manufacturing and sales of garden chairs. Based on Burt Lanchester’s forecast of costs and cash flow information, I would recommend several actions to the company to improve its performance in January 2006. In this essay, I will explain how the profit forecast and cash flow forecast can be used to make these recommendations, and how changing the sales price and production schedule can improve the company’s performance.
The profit forecast indicates that the company’s gross profit margin is 30%. This means that for every £1 of revenue generated by the sale of garden chairs, the company is earning £0.3 in gross profit. However, upon further analysis, we note that the company is spending £6 on direct material and direct labor to manufacture a chair, and it is selling each chair for £20. This means that the company’s profit margin is actually 20%, not 30%. To increase the profit margin, the company should reduce the cost of production. This can be achieved by sourcing cheaper raw materials or negotiating better prices with suppliers.
Similarly, the cash flow forecast indicates that the company is likely to experience cash flow problems in January 2006. The forecast shows that the company will have a cash balance of £1,000 at the beginning of the month, and it will receive £8,000 from sales. However, the company will need to pay out £9,200 for costs and expenses, leaving it with a negative cash balance of £200. To address this cash flow problem, the company should look for ways to reduce its costs and expenses. This could include reducing its payroll expenses or delaying the payment of certain bills until the cash flow situation improves.
To improve the company’s performance, it can also change its sales price and production schedule. Increasing the sales price of the garden chairs from £20 to £22 would help the company increase its gross profit margin. With a new gross profit margin of £6 per chair, the company can reinvest the additional £2 in profit earned from each sale back into the business. Investing in research and development could help the company create new products or improve the manufacturing process, which could lead to reduced production costs.
Alternatively, the company could focus on increasing sales volume by lowering the sales price to £18 per chair. While this would decrease the gross profit margin to £4 per chair, it would allow for increased sales volume, which would increase revenue and profit. Increasing volume would also help the company to create economies of scale, and drive down costs of production further.
Lastly, changing the production schedule could also help to improve the company’s performance. By manufacturing more chairs in one production run, the company could create economies of scale, reducing the cost of manufacturing. This cost reduction would increase the gross profit margin of each chair. Scaling up production could be achieved by increasing the number of working days, or running the production for a longer period of time. Another way to scale up would be to analyze the supply chain and production process to identify bottlenecks and opportunities of increasing efficiency.
In conclusion, Malibu Garden Furniture Ltd should take a number of steps to improve its performance based on the forecast of costs and cash flow information. By reducing the cost of production, the company can increase its profit margin. By changing the sales price and production schedule, the company can drive sales volume and create economies of scale. Careful management of cash flow and expenses can also help to mitigate the risks of working capital shortage. With these recommendations, Malibu Garden Furniture Ltd can achieve success in January 2006 and beyond.
