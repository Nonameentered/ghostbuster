Money and happiness are two concepts that have been debated over for ages. While some consider money to be the key to happiness, others believe that true happiness comes from non-monetary sources. This debate has led economists and psychologists to explore the relationship between money and happiness. Economists tend to look at things from a rational standpoint and believe that money can buy happiness. Psychologists, on the other hand, consider more subjective elements and realize that money only has a limited relationship with happiness. In this essay, we will explore the relationship between money and happiness according to economists and psychologists, analyze how an individual's happiness relates to their income, and why the relationship is not as straightforward as originally thought.
Economists argue that money plays a significant role in bringing happiness to an individual. As people accumulate more wealth, they have access to more resources and opportunities, leading to happiness in various aspects of life. For example, money can provide individuals with access to better healthcare, better education for their children, and better chances of securing assets like a home or a car. According to studies done by economists, people in wealthier nations are happier than those in poorer countries, and people in wealthier neighborhoods report higher levels of happiness than those in poorer areas. Furthermore, economists propose that higher levels of income lead to more independence and that money enables people to have more control over their lives.
Psychologists, on the other hand, argue that the relationship between money and happiness is not as straightforward as economists believe. While having enough money to meet basic needs is essential for happiness, having excessive wealth does not always correlate with happiness levels. In fact, psychology research shows that individuals with higher incomes in Western societies have not experienced an increase in overall happiness in recent decades. Psychologists believe that this is due to a lack of intrinsic motivation once one's basic needs are met. Once people have their needs met, they start looking for happiness in places that money cannot buy, such as good relationships, a sense of purpose, and engagement in fulfilling activities. An individual's happiness is also linked to social comparisons, leading to the phenomenon called the “hedonic treadmill,” where a person continuously seeks more money and material things without any gain in happiness.
An individual's happiness level in relation to their income is often surveyed to establish the relationship between money and happiness. Studies have shown that people with lower incomes tend to report lower levels of overall happiness compared to those with higher incomes. However, these reports are often relative to a particular point in time. For example, people who have recently experienced an increase in income may experience a higher level of happiness, while those with a recent decrease in income may feel less happy. Hence, happiness in relation to income is often context-dependent. Furthermore, the relationship between income and happiness is not consistent. As previously mentioned, once an individual's basic needs are met, happiness linked to increasing incomes diminishes.
Despite the extensive research on the relationship between money and happiness, the results have been inconclusive and inconsistent. The lack of consistency arises from a variety of factors. Firstly, individual differences create different needs and standards of living, meaning that the amount of money required to achieve happiness varies from person to person. Some people may be content living a modest, sustainable lifestyle, while others may require more elaborate needs to feel happy. Secondly, external factors, such as societal values and norms, can influence the expected relationship between money and happiness. Some societies place a high value on material possessions, while others emphasize spiritual or community values. Finally, happiness itself is a subjective phenomenon, and different people may capture different aspects of what happiness means to them.
In conclusion, economists and psychologists have contrasting opinions on the relationship between money and happiness. While economists believe that money can buy happiness, psychologists argue that the relationship between the two is complex and not straightforward. While having enough money to meet basic needs is critical, having excessive wealth does not always correlate with happiness levels. Happiness is a subjective phenomenon, and people may derive different aspects of happiness from various sources. Thus, the relationship between money and happiness is individualistic and context-dependent. Instead of material possessions, people can find intrinsic motivation in relationships, purposeful activities, and community involvement.
