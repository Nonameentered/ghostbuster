British Steel, the erstwhile nationalized steel manufacturer of the United Kingdom, was privatized in 1988. The company was rechristened as Corus in 1999 after a merger between British Steel and the Dutch company Koninklijke Hoogovens. Between 1990 and 2001, Corus faced numerous challenges, including declining profitability, intense competition from domestic and international players, and inadequate investment in the company’s infrastructure, among others. This essay aims to provide an overview of these challenges and the measures taken by Corus to address them effectively.
One of the significant challenges faced by Corus during the 1990s was declining profitability. The primary reason for this decline in profitability was the adversity of the global steel industry during this period. Stronger competition from cheap foreign steel imports, particularly from low-cost Asian producers, and the reduction in demand for steel in the UK were some of the reasons that contributed to the falling profits of Corus. To address this challenge, Corus made strategic changes to its business model with an emphasis on increasing efficiency through investments in technology and rationalization of plants, restructuring its workforce, and forging partnerships with other companies to leverage the company's strengths.
In addition to profitability, Corus faced operational challenges that put a strain on the company's capabilities such as the inadequate investment in the company’s infrastructure. One of the issues was Corus’s outdated steel plant, which made it challenging to compete with other steelmakers in Europe and Asia. The company had insufficient funds to invest in modernizing and upgrading its manufacturing facility to meet the changing market demands. To address this issue, Corus introduced a restructuring program in 1999, which involved closing some of its inefficient plants and laying off a significant number of employees to cut down operational costs. Corus invested in newer technologies, such as thin-slab casting, to improve production efficiency and increase the quality of its steel products.
Competing with domestic and international players was another challenge faced by Corus in the 1990s. The fragmented nature of the UK steel industry created numerous small-scale producers, which caused oversupply and intense competition, leading to reduced profits for all the steelmakers. Additionally, Asian producers gained a significant market share in the UK, aided by their low production costs and advanced technologies. To address this challenge, Corus embarked on a program of consolidation and formed partnerships with other companies to capitalize on their respective strengths. For instance, Corus partnered with Brazil’s Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world’s largest iron ore miner, to secure a long term iron ore supply agreement. The company also entered into a joint venture with IJmuiden Steelworks of the Netherlands to create a single entity that would operate more efficiently and become more competitive.
The management of Corus also faced challenges related to its environment and sustainability. In this context, the issue of environmental pollution became a significant concern for the company. The company was determined to make its manufacturing processes cleaner, safer, and more sustainable. This goal reflected the company's philosophy of creating value for its shareholders by operating responsibly and sustainably. Corus implemented various initiatives to ensure that its manufacturing processes met the environmental standards stipulated by the government. For instance, the company invested heavily in reducing the level of carbon emissions associated with its operations to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, which the UK ratified in 2002. Corus aimed to decrease its carbon footprint by 45% by 2010 and achieved a 35% cut in carbon emissions by the end of 2002.
Finally, the issue of availability of resources was another significant challenge that confronted Corus during the 1990s. The company needed to invest in newer technologies and manufacturing processes to stay competitive. However, the lack of sufficient funding to finance these projects posed a major problem for the company. The company had to explore different funding sources, including debt financing and asset-backed securities to fund its expansion plans. Corus also had to seek government assistance, both at the national and regional levels, to help finance its modernization plans.
In conclusion, Corus had to overcome multiple challenges during the period between 1990 and 2001 to remain competitive in the global steel industry. The critical challenges that the company faced included declining profitability, intense competition from domestic and foreign competitors, outdated infrastructure and manufacturing processes, environmental concerns, and a lack of sufficient resources to invest in new technologies and processes. The company addressed these challenges through a range of strategies, including investing in technology and plant rationalization to improve operational efficiency, forging partnerships with other companies to leverage its capabilities, restructuring its workforce, and focusing on environmental sustainability. These measures helped the company navigate a difficult period and set a foundation for its future growth and development.
