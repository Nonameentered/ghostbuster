In the book, the narrator portrays her father's life through the lens of social conditioning and class divisions. The impact of these factors is evident in the way the narrator perceives and portrays her father's struggles, achievements, and character. While the narrator acknowledges her father's admirable qualities and achievements, she also highlights the challenges he faced due to societal and economic factors. In this essay, I will discuss the impact of social conditioning and class divisions on the narrator's portrayal of her father's life in the book.
Firstly, the narrator's portrayal of her father's life reflects the impact of social conditioning on her own perception of her father and his achievements. The narrator belongs to a middle-class family, and she has been conditioned to believe that upward social mobility and financial stability are the ultimate goals in life. This conditioning shapes her perspective on her father's life and his achievements. She refers to her father as a "failure" because he struggled to provide financial stability for the family and failed to achieve the middle-class lifestyle that the narrator aspired to. This judgment is a reflection of the social values and expectations that the narrator has internalized. She has been conditioned to believe that financial success is the measure of a person's worth, and she applies this standard to her father's life.
Secondly, class divisions play a significant role in the narrator's portrayal of her father's life. The narrator's family belongs to the working class, and her father works as a factory worker, which is a low-paying and physically demanding job. The working-class lifestyle is portrayed as a struggle, as the narrator describes the hardships her family faced due to financial insecurity and lack of resources. The narrator's depiction of her father's life is reflective of the struggles faced by working-class individuals who are often trapped in a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities. The portrayal of her father's life reflects the broader structural inequalities that exist within society, where individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds have limited prospects for economic security and social mobility.
Furthermore, the impact of social conditioning and class divisions is also evident in the way the narrator describes her father's personality traits. The narrator describes her father as "quiet" and "resigned," which could be interpreted as a lack of ambition or agency. However, her father's reserved personality is likely a coping mechanism that helped him navigate the challenges he faced due to his social status and financial situation. The narrator's perception of her father's character is shaped by societal expectations that dictate how individuals from different class backgrounds should behave. The middle-class values that the narrator has internalized view assertiveness and ambition as desirable traits, while attributes like resilience and adaptability are devalued.
In conclusion, the impact of social conditioning and class divisions on the narrator's portrayal of her father's life in the book is significant. The narrator's perspectives and judgments are shaped by her social and economic situation, which influences the values and expectations she has internalized. Her portrayal of her father's life reflects the structural inequalities that exist within society, where individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds face limited opportunities for social mobility and financial security. However, despite the challenges her father faced, the narrator also highlights his admirable qualities, such as resilience and adaptability. Ultimately, the book offers a nuanced portrayal of the impact of social conditioning and class divisions on individuals' lives and highlights the need for greater social and economic equality.
