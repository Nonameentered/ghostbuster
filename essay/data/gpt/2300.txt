Introduction
The Sandinista government seized power in Nicaragua in 1979 after a long struggle to overthrow the Somoza dynasty. One of the key areas that the Sandinista government sought to transform was the agricultural and rural development strategy. During the struggle against Somoza dynasty, the Sandinista took an ideological position of promoting land reform aimed at redistributing land from the wealthy elites to the poor peasants. This essay explores the steps taken by the Sandinista government to amend Nicaragua's agricultural and rural development strategy in the aftermath of the revolution in 1979.
Background 
Nicaragua is an agrarian society with its economy predominantly reliant on agriculture. Before the revolution, Nicaragua was experiencing severe economic challenges that manifested in growing poverty and the worsening of living standards. The agrarian sector was characterized by land concentration in the hands of a few elites, who exploited the peasants and laborers, limiting the growth of agriculture. In response to the oppressive rule of the Somoza dynasty, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) emerged as a revolutionary movement pledged to bringing an end to the dictatorship and restoring the dignity of the peasants who were suffering the most.
Land Reform
One of the first steps taken by the Sandinista government was to implement comprehensive land reforms aimed at addressing the unequal distribution of land. The new government expropriated some landholdings, including lands owned by the Somoza family and provided the land to the landless peasants. Additionally, the government allocated credits and subsidies for the development of agriculture. The land reform measures taken by the government were aimed at promoting egalitarianism, promoting social justice and reforming the agrarian production system.
Technology Transfer and Research 
The Sandinista government also initiated technology transfer programs in the agricultural sector, aimed at enhancing productivity and efficiency. The new government established several research and technology transfer institutes that trained peasants on the modern farming techniques. These institutes were instrumental in developing better seeds, promoting modern methods of farming, and conserving the environment. The government streamlined administrative procedures to help the farmers access the credit and subsidies that were offered as an incentive to farmers to improve productivity.
Infrastructure Development 
The Sandinista government embarked on several large-scale infrastructure development projects that enhanced the agricultural sector's growth. Among the significant rural infrastructure development projects undertaken included the construction of roads in rural areas, bridges, and culverts, and other transportation facilities. The government also improved the rural electrification and water supply systems, which improved farmers' standard of living. The provision of irrigation schemes which was non-existent before also played a significant role in transforming agriculture. The creation of marketing infrastructure such as warehouses and markets increased the bargaining power of peasants, who could now dispose of their excess produce, granted that the marketing agencies would support them by paying an equitable price.
Implementation of Farm Cooperatives 
The Sandinista government believed in the philosophy that working people needed to have a say in the way economic decisions were made. As a result of this position, the government undertook instructions of farming cooperatives as a way of including peasants in the ownership of the productive assets. The move to gather smallholders and tenure farmers together into producer cooperatives was aimed at creating a large-scale productive unit based on mutualism and shared goals. By pooling together the available resources, peasants could increase their bargaining power when negotiating with the state and agro-processing companies.
Microfinance Programs 
The Sandinista government also instituted several microfinance programs aimed at uplifting the rural population. The programs sought to provide access to micro-credit to smallholders and tenant farmers enabling them to improve product quality and increase the productâ€™s price. Additionally, the provision of microfinance enabled peasants to access modern technology, including irrigation equipment and machinery, which increased their productivity, output, and consequently their incomes. The microfinance programs were instrumental in providing credit to individuals who had been previously excluded from the formal financial system.
Conclusion
The Sandinista government undertook several steps to amend the agricultural and rural development strategy aimed at reducing poverty, creating employment, and promoting social justice. These steps included the implementation of land reform, technology transfer, infrastructure development, farm cooperatives, and microfinance. Despite the success of these initiatives, the Sandinista's rule was characterized by political upheavals, global economic shocks, and the impact of the US trade embargo on Nicaragua's economy, limiting the progress made, and raising questions on how successful the policies had been.
