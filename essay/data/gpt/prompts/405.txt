What was the main issue discussed in the case regarding the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and DNA profiles under s64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 and its compatibility with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950? How did the majority decision conclude on the engagement of Article 8(1), and what was their justification for the retention of such materials? Was there any breach of Article 14, and if not, why did the retention not discriminate against the subsequently acquitted suspect? Lastly, what was the verdict on the compatibility of s64(1A) with the Convention, and how did the Dissenting opinion differ in its reasoning?
