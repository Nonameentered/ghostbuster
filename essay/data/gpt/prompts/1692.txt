Why should literature be studied? Analyze the potential of literature to question authority and social arrangements by examining works such as Sir Walter Raleigh's poem and the feminist movement in Virginia Woolf's writing. Consider different critical approaches such as New Historicism and reader-response criticism in understanding the historical context and meaning of texts.
