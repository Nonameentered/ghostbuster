What is the photoelectric effect and how can it be used to determine Planck's constant? Describe an experiment that uses monochromatic light and a photocell to calculate Planck's constant, including factors such as stopping voltage, capacitor charging, and potential differences. Discuss the sources of error in this experiment and how they can affect the calculated value of Planck's constant.
