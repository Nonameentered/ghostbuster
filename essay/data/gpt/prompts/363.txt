What factors affect enzyme activity and how were these properties investigated in class using alkaline phosphatase? How does pH and temperature influence enzyme activity and what is the effect of co-factors and non-competitive inhibitors on these properties? Describe the Michaelis-Menten constant and how it was determined in this experiment, as well as the effect of phosphate on the reaction and the minimum concentration required for inhibition of alkaline phosphatase. Discuss the order of reaction and the relationship between concentration of pNP and time.
