Discuss Kant's version of transcendental idealism and his belief that our experience of things is how they appear to us as opposed to how they are in and of themselves. Evaluate Kant's arguments for transcendental idealism, including his use of the Copernican Revolution and transcendental arguments. Consider objections to his theory, including the challenge that his arguments assume synthetic propositions are necessary when they may be contingent, and whether his idea of "things in themselves" contradicts his views on experience.
