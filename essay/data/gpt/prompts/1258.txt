What is the aim of the laboratory exercises involving Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board, what hardware elements were used, and how did the author follow the tutorial instructions to create programs for ANDGATE, 4 bit counter, Dflipflop, and 7 segment display count 0-9? How did the simulation results differ from the results obtained when the programs were loaded on the board, and did they perform as expected?
