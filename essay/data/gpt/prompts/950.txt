What are the motives for UK employers to operate direct employee involvement (EI) techniques, and what benefits have they gained from this approach? Analyze empirical evidence from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) and Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) to evaluate the use of direct EI techniques by UK organizations, and assess the key factors shaping direct participation within organizations, including competition and pressure from the product market, the adoption of EI as a part of "soft" human resource management, eliminating the role of trade unions, and fashion. Finally, provide implications for UK organizations based on the critical assessment of the benefits gained through the use of direct EI techniques.
