Describe the process of living radical polymerization using alkyl bromide initiators and copper(I) catalysts with different ligands, and discuss how this process allows for the synthesis of a wide range of polymers with defined architectures and molecular weights. Additionally, explore the effects of different monomers and ligands on the rate of polymerization and the chemical composition of the polymers produced.
