How do NMR spectroscopy and crystal structure analyses support the role of weak hydrogen bonding in the self-assembly of molecules in supramolecular crystalline structures? What factors contribute to the accuracy of NMR data in detecting hydrogen bonds, and how does combining spectroscopic and crystallographic data lead to more conclusive results?
