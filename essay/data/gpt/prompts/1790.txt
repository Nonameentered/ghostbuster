What is the passive insufficiency of the hamstrings and how can it be demonstrated through a comparison of the range of active hip flexion when the knee is allowed to flex vs. when it is fully extended? What are some clinical implications of this phenomenon, and how can the range of movement be accurately measured using electrogoniometry? Explore these questions and their anatomical bases, referencing relevant literature and studies.
