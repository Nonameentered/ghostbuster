What is the interrelationship between gender and globalisation, and how has gender shaped the project of globalisation? In your response, address the following four issues: 1) how has the flexibilisation of the labour force shaped the project of globalisation, and in what ways has this process excluded or disadvantaged women? 2) how have structural adjustment programs played a role in enmeshing women into patriarchal structures within globalisation and capitalism? 3) what has been the impact of transnational migration on gender identity, in particular in regards to domestic labour, and how has this provided the base for the new global economy? 4) how has gender shaped the concept of "global imperialism", and has there been a globalisation from below which has enabled women to resist the patriarchal forces within globalisation?
