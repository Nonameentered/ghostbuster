What is the objective of the experiment using strain gauge? How does measurement sensitivity affect the experiment, and what factors should be taken into account? Explain the theoretical balance condition of the Wheatstone bridge circuit. How is the output voltage affected by the applied force, and what is the linear relationship between system output and loading force? How can noise level be reduced, and what is the sensitivity of the force sensor? Lastly, compare the system output with and without feedback capacitor when there is no applied force and when a force is added to the system.
