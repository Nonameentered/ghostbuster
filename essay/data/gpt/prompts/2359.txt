What is the significance of palynological and macrobotanical studies in understanding the Mesolithic subsistence system? How can the evidence of anthropogenic forest disturbance be distinguished from natural disturbance factors, and what is the role of deliberate forest clearance in Mesolithic promotional strategy? Evaluate the degree of human and natural disturbance factors to past environment and introduce the evidence of seasonally movements and settlement patterns with palaeobotanical records. Finally, discuss the methodological and interpretational limitations in palaeobotanical analysis.
