Does functionalism offer a more plausible theory for intentional states compared to sensations and other states of consciousness? Discuss functionalism theory, criticisms raised about its ability to account for sensations and phenomenal consciousness, and evaluate whether they disprove functionalism. Illustrate the thesis that functionalism offers a more plausible theory of intentional states than sensations and other states of consciousness with reference to qualia and Nagel's criticism of functionalism's ability to account for phenomenal consciousness.
