What is the Charpy Impact Test and how can it be used to measure the toughness of steels of different carbon compositions and their ductile to brittle transition behavior as a function of temperature? How do factors such as temperature, carbon content, and heat treatment affect the toughness of steel, and what are the implications of these factors on the maximum impact energy the steel is able to withstand? What points can be deduced from the investigation on steels using charpy impact testing, and how can this analysis be used to aid designers in the selection of materials?
