What were the findings of the study completed by 67 food and nutrition students at the University of Reading in October 2005? What were the nutrient intakes of Reading University students according to the food frequency questionnaire issued? What are the Dietary Reference Values (DRV), Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNI), and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) set by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food (COMA) in 1991? How do the nutrient intakes of the Reading University students compare to the DRV and RNI for Vitamin C and iron? Do the students' salt intakes align with the UK government's recommendations? How might the results of the study have been affected by the participants' weight, physical activity, and honesty in reporting their diets?
