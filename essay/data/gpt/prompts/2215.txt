What is the process for synthesizing diphenylsilanediol and converting it into octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane? What is the importance of organo-dichlorosilane in the formation of silicone and how does the process of cyclopolysiloxanes occur? How do compounds with the formula R2CO differ from organosilicon compounds, and what role do vacant d-orbitals play in the bonding of silicon? Additionally, what safety precautions should be taken during the experiment?
