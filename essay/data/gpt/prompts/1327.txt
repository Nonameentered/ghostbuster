What is principal component analysis and how can it be used to analyze data? What are the limitations and potential biases involved in using PCA, and what factors should be taken into account when interpreting the results? How can metric scaling and log-scaling be used to improve the accuracy and consistency of PCA results, and what implications do these techniques have for the interpretation of data? What are some of the key challenges involved in applying PCA to real-world datasets, and how can these challenges be addressed through careful selection of data and appropriate statistical techniques?
