To what extent was Martin Luther responsible for the 'great religious upheaval' of the Reformation in Germany? Analyze the impact of Luther's personality and ideas, and examine the means by which his ideas were disseminated. Consider the role of other Protestant reformers and the argument made by some historians that conditions in Germany were already ripe for Reformation due to anticlericalism, a general religious malaise, and humanist influences. Define the early Reformation, and assess Luther's importance in initiating and contributing to its early success.
