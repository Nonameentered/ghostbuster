"Analyse the England and Wales precipitation record from 1767 to 2001, specifically looking at seasonal differences, probabilities of extreme rainfall events, and evidence of long-term trends. Describe the data set, including its distribution and skewness, and investigate the relationship between total autumn rainfall and drought years. Furthermore, examine the hypothesis that summer rainfall has an equal population mean to winter rainfall and test this hypothesis. Finally, discuss the trends observed in each season and estimate their significance."
