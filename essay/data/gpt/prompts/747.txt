Is the study of management as a natural science able to capture the psychological and social aspects of management? Discuss the limitations of using natural scientific techniques and whether the positivist view is applicable in the study of management. Analyze the methods used by positivists for gathering data, including description, prediction, control, and explanation, and compare them to the interpretatists or phenomenologists who believe that reality is socially constructed and patterns of human behavior are inferred. Evaluate the ways in which social scientists try to control human behavior through organizational intervention and training and discuss the limitations of determinate predictions used in the study of natural sciences in the context of management. Finally, compare the radical functionalist view of management as scientific, positivist, and objective to the current socio-psychological perspective of organizational behavior that focuses on intrinsically human behavior.
