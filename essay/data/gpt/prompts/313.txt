What is the concept of credit rationing and how does imperfect information play a role in explaining it? Provide a critical analysis of the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models and their impact on the efficient allocation of resources from both a micro and macro perspective. Discuss the empirical evidence on credit rationing and its possible impact on the Argentine economy, and address the criticisms of the imperfect information assumption's ability to explain credit rationing.
