What is the significance of quaternions in relation to rotations in four dimensions? How do division algebras relate to proofs by Hurwitz and Frobenius, and what is the Cayley-Dickson construction? Discuss the applications of these concepts in geometry and hyperdimensional objects. Additionally, explore the relationships between different representations of quaternions and intriguing facts about their properties.
