How can a bookcase be redesigned to achieve a reduced environmental impact? Use the Weight of Nations report's forecast for global population, economic activity, energy consumption, and manufacturing activity to guide your analysis. Consider the materials and design of the bookcase, the system boundaries for your analysis, and the potential for reducing material usage while maintaining the social functions and aesthetic appeal of the product. Use the Datschefski approximation analysis and life cycle analysis to refine your redesign proposal and assess its environmental impact.
