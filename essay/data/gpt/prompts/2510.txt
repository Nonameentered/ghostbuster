What is the evidence for prehistoric hunter-gatherer subsistence? How do osteological refuse hunting methods and site function assist in identifying simple and complex societies? Evaluate the evidence involved during interpretation with the use of case studies, including the waterlogged site of Star Carr, the semi-subterranean huts of Ohalo II, and the riverside huts of Lepenski Vir. How does the age and season of death of animals provide insight into hunting strategies and the season of occupation?
