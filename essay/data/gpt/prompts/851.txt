How was a cantilever beam-type force sensor designed and constructed for force measurement? What was the sensitivity value and could it be improved? How was the output voltage converted from a Wheatstone bridge circuit to a digitized signal using an operational amplifier circuit? What were the results of tests and analyses, including graphs and equations, and what improvements could be made to reduce uncertainty?
