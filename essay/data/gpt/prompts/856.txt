What are the theoretical and practical design considerations of motor vehicle disc brakes, and how do they relate to the braking performance of a typical saloon car weighing 1000 kg? What are the variables associated with the design of a disc brake, and how can they be quantified to determine the torque requirement for maximum braking performance? Lastly, how can different pad materials affect the torque provided by the disc brake?
