What is phylogenetic systematics, and how is it used to construct a consensus phylogeny tree at a molecular level? What are the procedures involved in this process, and how can one read a phylogeny tree? Discuss the evaluation of some methods and computational implements involved in this process. Additionally, what are some theoretical problems with evolutionary changes between sequences, and how do they impact the construction of phylogeny trees? Finally, how does the study of phylogenetic systematics contribute to our understanding of evolution, and what prospects are there for continued development in this field?
