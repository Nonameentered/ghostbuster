Evaluate the success of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policy in response to the Great Depression. Consider both short-term and long-term impacts, and the perspectives of historians from different backgrounds and political leanings. Analyze the key policies and achievements of the First and Second New Deal phases, including relief, recovery, and reform efforts such as the Emergency Banking Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Public Works Administration, the National Recovery Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Discuss both positive and negative consequences, such as increased government intervention in business, diminished entrepreneurial independence, and improved social welfare programs.
