How has the development of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar impacted sociology? Can critical realism provide a foundation for the development of sociological theories and empirical evidence that can make a worthwhile contribution to society beyond academia? How has Margaret Archer's immanent critique of traditional sociological ontologies using realist ontology contributed to sociology? These questions and more are explored in a dissertation that examines the strengths and weaknesses of critical realism as a perspective in sociology through a discussion of the concept of power in the works of C. Wright Mills, Parsons, and Lukes.
