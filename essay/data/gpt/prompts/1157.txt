What is fortification in food and what are the arguments for and against it? Explore the benefits and potential drawbacks of adding micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals) to food, including how this practice can address deficiencies, ensure the expected nutritional value of food, and increase profit/market share for the food industry. Examine examples that support both sides of the argument and consider the implications of widespread fortification practices, including the potential for blurring the distinction between foods, supplements, and drugs, eroding the ability for authorities to protect the public from harmful substances, and increasing confusion among the public about how to achieve the recommended diet.
