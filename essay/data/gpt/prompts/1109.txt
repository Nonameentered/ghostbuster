What was the intended outcome of the assessed assignments in this module, and how was it achieved using Monte Carlo methods? Describe the changes made to the program throughout the assignments, including the addition of OpenMP, simulated annealing, and parallel tempering, as well as the switch from Fortran to Python. Finally, explain the results of the 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster simulation, including the global minimum energy configuration and the symmetry of the cluster.
