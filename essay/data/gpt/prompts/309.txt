What factors determine economic growth and how can they be tested? Discuss the validity of Solow's theory of convergence and the importance of including human capital in economic growth models. Analyze the results of a cross-sectional sample of 54 countries from 1994-2000 using the augmented Solow model with data for Real GDP growth per capita, Investment, Initial GDP, and secondary school enrolment as a proxy for human capital investment. Examine the evidence for conditional convergence, absolute convergence, and club convergence and discuss the potential limitations of the study.
