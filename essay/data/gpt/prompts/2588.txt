What factors can affect the roughness length and friction velocity, and how can these be measured using wind speed measurements? How did changes in wind conditions and surrounding terrain affect the measurements in this study, and what were the results? How can varying u* and T* affect vertical wind speed and temperature profiles, and under what conditions do these profiles become logarithmic or linear? How did the average surface sensible heat flux and Obukhov length vary during the wind speed measurements taken in this study?
