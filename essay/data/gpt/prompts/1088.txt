What is X-ray diffraction and how is it used to determine the structure of crystalline solids? Consider different types of crystal lattices, allowed Miller indices, the relationship between lattice parameter 'a' and plane separation 'd', and the use of Bragg's Law in interpreting X-ray diffraction patterns. Describe the method of X-ray diffraction and the equipment used in this experiment.
