What are the limitations and discrepancies in the Drude and Sommerfeld free electron models? How were these assessed and validated using solid state simulations? What fundamental laws were used to probe the accuracy of these models? What are the major pitfalls of the Drude simulation? How do both models fail to account for positive charge carriers in certain metals and magnetoresistance? What investigations were carried out during this experiment and how do the simulations fall short of imitating the behavior of real electrons within metals?
