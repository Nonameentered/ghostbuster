Describe two observations of a family attending a clinic for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using attachment theory to analyze the behaviors observed and the resulting possible implications for the child's future mental health. Use Erikson's developmental theory (1980) as a framework and discuss a genogram in the appendices that illustrates the complexity of this family system.
