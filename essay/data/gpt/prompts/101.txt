Design a compact gearbox for an electric drill that uses an epicyclic two-stage reduction to produce a 25:1 speed reduction from a motor developing 36W at 9000rpm, with the first stage using nylon gears and the second stage using phosphor bronze material. Use a minimum recommended sun gear of 16 teeth and a module of 1.0, and consider the use of plastic gears for one stage of speed reduction. Compare your design to other gearboxes from similar commercial units. Also, design a bearing arrangement to carry the thrust load axially along the drill, considering the maximum thrust a user can exert onto the drill.
