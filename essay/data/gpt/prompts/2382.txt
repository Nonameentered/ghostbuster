What were the effects of tillage in autumn on litter decomposition and soil invertebrate diversity and abundance in the following spring? Were there any statistically significant outcomes, and what were the possible biases in the experimental design? How does agricultural practice affect the functioning of soil ecosystems, and what changes have been observed in the UK? What recommendations do the authors have for future research?
