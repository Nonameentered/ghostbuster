What are the aims of an experiment that uses the haemagglutination property of certain viruses and end point dilution to determine the HA and HI titres of a virus stock, identify the virus based on its reactivity with known antisera, and calculate the concentration of virus or antibody in the stock? How can haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assays be used to identify an unknown virus, and what factors contribute to the specificity and precision of these assays?
