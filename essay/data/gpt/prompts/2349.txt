What properties of two metal acetylacetonate complexes are investigated in this practical, and what methods are used to obtain the results? How do the results of UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy provide insights into the structure of the complexes, and what is the significance of the d-d transition in the vanadyl bis(acac) complex? What was difficult about locating the band I & III peaks for the manganese tris-acetylacetonate in Toluene, and how might this issue be addressed?
