What is the extent to which hunting is superior to scavenging among Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthals? Evaluate the subsistence strategies of Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthals using an array of sites including both open air sites and rock shelter/cave sites such as Il'Skaja, Mauren, Combe Grenal, and Guattari Cave. Consider the various problems encountered when evaluating these subsistence strategies, including preservation prospects for plant material, bone decay, erosion, and movement, as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between bones introduced by humans and those brought in by carnivores. Assess the evidence supporting specific hunting and scavenging, noting the climatic changes and faunal changes that may contribute to these strategies. Finally, consider the degree of social organization and forward planning implied by these subsistence strategies.
