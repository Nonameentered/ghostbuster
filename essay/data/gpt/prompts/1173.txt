What is the potential function and how is it used to represent the values of the forces which drive electrical particles? How is the Laplacian considered in the potential function? Discuss Green's theorem and its relation to singular values of continuous functions. How does the formula for charge density relate to the forces exerted on the surface of a body? Provide an example of a potential function within an earthed, perfect conductor. Explain the reciprocity theorem and how it relates to the potential function. Finally, consider a body with electricity spread over its interior.
