What is the most effective method for determining the concentration of iron in a drink? Compare and contrast the calibration plot method and the standard addition method, and explain why one method is better than the other. Additionally, discuss the use of atomic absorption spectroscopy in determining the concentration of transition metals, including the fuel/oxidant system used and the temperature of the flame. Finally, calculate the concentration of iron in a given sample of a beverage based on the formula provided and information about the concentration of Ammonium ferric citrate in the drink.
