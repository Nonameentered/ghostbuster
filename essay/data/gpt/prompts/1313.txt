What is the process for the self-assembly of R- and S-dendron rodcoils to form helical ribbon-like mirror image nanostructures, as described in the article? What factors contribute to the self-assembly, and how do the coil segments in the dendron rodcoil molecules relate to the solubility of the resulting nanostructures? What techniques are used to observe and analyze the handedness and structure of the self-assembled nanostructures, and what are the implications of the observed phenomena?
