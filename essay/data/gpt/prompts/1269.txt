What is the role of drag in the design of road vehicles, and how can the Buckingham Pi method be used to derive key parameters associated with drag? How can prototype scaled modelling or computational fluid dynamics software be used to provide useful information on the aerodynamics of racing cars? What is the difference between streamlined bodies and buff bodies, and how does this impact drag? What elements of car design can engineers control, and how do aesthetics and aerodynamic drag performance affect each other?
