What are maternal effect genes, and how do they contribute to early embryonic development in the C. elegans nematode? Describe the process of asymmetric cell division and cell to cell interaction, and explain the role of maternal genes in establishing the anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and left-right axes. Discuss the localization and function of PAR proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6, and SKN-1 in determining cell fates, and examine how mutations in these genes affect embryonic development.
