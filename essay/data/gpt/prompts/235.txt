Explain the metabolic pathway involved in the breakdown of glucose, including the roles of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Discuss the anabolic and catabolic roles of the central metabolic pathways, as well as the production of building blocks such as glucose-6-phosphate, acetyl CoA, and pyruvate.
