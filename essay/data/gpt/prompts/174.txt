Discuss the development of the Annales School of historical thought, focusing on the contributions of Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, as well as the leadership of Fernand Braudel. Analyze the themes of continuity and departure throughout the school's history and consider whether the "Age of Braudel" contradicted or conserved the ideals of its founders. Pay particular attention to the interdisciplinary approach to history and the role of geographic history in the school's development.
