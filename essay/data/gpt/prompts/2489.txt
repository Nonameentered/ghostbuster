What are the dietary reference values (DRV) of the UK and how do they compare to the dietary intake of male and female students? What dietary values do male students particularly struggle with, and what are the potential health risks associated with excess intake of certain macronutrients and micronutrients? What are some recommendations for male students to improve their dietary intake, and what are some potential errors or limitations to consider when examining dietary intake using retrospective surveys like the FFQ?
