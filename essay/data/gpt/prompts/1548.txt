What are the different evolutionary mechanisms and forces classified by geneticists that affect the frequency of alternative genotypes in populations from one generation to the next? How does sexual reproduction, natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and recombination contribute to genetic evolution? Discuss the role of gene frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in determining genotypic frequencies in a population. Can sexual reproduction be considered as random mating between individuals and what are the competing dichotomies in sexual selection theory? How can mutations slowly add new genetic variation to populations and transform them through natural selection?
