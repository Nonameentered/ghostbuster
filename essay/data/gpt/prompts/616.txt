What are the goals and methods of investigating the rate of a chemical reaction, and how is this affected by temperature? What is the overall rate equation and mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in an acid permanganate solution? How is the activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reaction calculated using Arrhenius's equation, and what are the limitations of this method?
