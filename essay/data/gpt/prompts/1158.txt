Discuss the problematic comparison between holistic healing systems and scientific medicine, particularly in the context of the increase in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the past decade. Analyze the potential for CAM to provide an alternative or complementary source of medicine, considering the contrast in consultation systems, patient participation, and disease prevention. Examine the differences between the biomedical model and CAM practices in terms of the hierarchical structure, patient responsibility, and specialist knowledge. Assess the challenges in accommodating CAM within the NHS structure and the potential for public pressure to influence the decision-making of the medical profession.
