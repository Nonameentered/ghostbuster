How does Angela Carter use fairytale and myth to challenge a male dominated world in The Magic Toyshop? Discuss the ways in which she turns these stories on themselves to point out the ways in which they themselves have constructed the patriarchal society that women find themselves trapped in. Consider the characters of Uncle Philip and Finn, as well as the story of Leda and the Swan. In what ways does the novel function as a reactionary fairytale, and in what ways does it subvert traditional fairytale tropes? Finally, address the critique that Carter fails to offer a alternative to the male-dominated society she critiques.
