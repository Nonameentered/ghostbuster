What was the basic objective of the laboratory sessions using Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks, and how did they assist in gaining knowledge about fluid dynamics and car aerodynamics? How was a car designed in a wind tunnel and what properties were analyzed? How were drag coefficient and drag force calculated and what conclusions were drawn from the results? What additional entities could be measured and interpreted using the software used in this laboratory?
