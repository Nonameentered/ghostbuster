What is the Tripartite theory of knowledge and why does the author argue that there is not a good alternative to it? How do the alternatives to the theory either clarify its terms or concepts or are unsound? What assumptions does the author make about knowledge, senses, and reality? How does the author define different types of knowledge and how does the theory of justification play a role in the Tripartite theory of knowledge? What is the Gettier problem and how does it challenge the Tripartite theory of knowledge? How do the author's examples show that the Gettier problem is unsound or requires extra attention?
