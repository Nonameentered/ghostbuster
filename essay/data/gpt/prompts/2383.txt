How has genetic analysis been used to gain insights into the morphology, physiology, and evolution of the plant world? Provide examples of studies on DNA and the development of cells, leaf structure, flower morphology, and flowering time, as well as the ABC model and the role of S-genes in regulating self-incompatibility. Discuss the application of genetic analysis in the study of the sex determination process in maize, polymorphism in fern species, and the future potential of AFLP DNA-fingerprinting techniques and Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis.
