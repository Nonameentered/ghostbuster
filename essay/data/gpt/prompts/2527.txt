How do psycholinguists determine how words are stored and retrieved from within the mind? Discuss the use of word-association tests in determining the relationships between words and how reliable they are in determining the structure of semantic memory. Consider the limitations of these tests and the potential for priming to provide a more accurate understanding of the connections between words in the mental lexicon. Additionally, conduct your own word-association test and assess the commonalities among participants, taking into account the frequency of the chosen stimuli and any potential differences between age groups.
