What were the core principles that remained unchanged in Lenin's political ideology and how did they play a role in the development of Bolshevism? How did the shift from being the opponent of the autocracy and bourgeoisie to becoming the sponsor of realistic government functions occur for the Bolshevik party? To answer these questions, the essay will take a chunk of Lenin's writings between 1914 and 1921 and consider the fundamentals of organization, production, the role of the party, and society, as well as the intellectual formation of young Lenin and the origins of Bolshevism, as explained by historian Richard Pipes.
