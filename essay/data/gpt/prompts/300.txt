What are the underlying reasons for the general trend of contraction in the social housing sector? Analyse the housing policies of the UK, the Netherlands, France and Sweden since the mid-1970s, with particular attention to the absence of the main conditions that necessitated the initial building of social housing, the allure of homeownership, the self-eroding dynamic within social housing, and the widely perceived global economic pressures for fiscal prudence. Additionally, give reasons why social housing is not completely doomed, emphasising the differences in housing policy and funding between the UK, the Netherlands, France and Sweden.
