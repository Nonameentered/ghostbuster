What are the factors to consider when deciding whether to use AC or DC through the pantograph and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each? How does the resistivity of the conductor impact the cross-sectional area of wire required and its shape? How can corrosion be limited and maintenance be improved through the joining of the wiring on the pantograph?
