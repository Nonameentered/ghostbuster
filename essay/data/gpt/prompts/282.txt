What is behavioural finance, and how does it depart from traditional academic models of financial markets? Discuss a specific departure from these models and explain the failure of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) in relation to it. Additionally, propose an investment strategy that exploits market anomalies resulting from the malfunction of the EMH and evaluate its effectiveness. In doing so, consider the ethical implications of potentially being considered a noise trader and the technical analysis indicators supporting your trading strategy.
