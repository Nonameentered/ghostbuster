What are the three methods investigated in this report for estimating the performance of an I section beam subjected to pure torsional loads, and what comparisons were made between them? What factors need to be taken into account when designing structures that may subject non-circular sections to torsional loads, and how do these factors affect the accuracy of theoretical calculations?
