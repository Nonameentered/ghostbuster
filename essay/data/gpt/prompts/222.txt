Discuss Quine's naturalized epistemology and his reasons for urging us to abandon traditional epistemic search for justification. What is his vision of epistemology as an empiric discipline, and what are the various philosophical implications of naturalizing epistemology? Is normative epistemology as useless or impossible as Quine suggests? Can traditional epistemology still satisfy our intellectual curiosity, or should we embrace naturalized epistemology instead?
