What impact does the introduction of the euro have on trade in the eurozone and is it significant? Discuss the effects of a common currency on trade, including the elimination of exchange rate transaction costs, risk of exchange rate volatility, and increased market and price transparency. Analyze empirical studies on the impact of currency unions on bilateral trade and use a gravity model of international trade to measure the amount of trade between countries. Compare trade for EMU country-pairs before and after the creation of the currency union with other country-pairs used as controls.
