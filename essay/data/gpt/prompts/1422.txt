What factors affect the drag force on a cylinder when immersed in a fluid, and how can the effect of drag be reduced? How is the Reynolds Number of the fluid flow related to drag force, and what is the role of streamlining in reducing drag force? What methods can be used to determine drag force, and how does the flow field over a cylinder change as the Reynolds number increases? Explain the basic hydrodynamic theory for this experiment and how it predicts the velocity and pressure distribution about the circumference of a circular cylinder immersed in a fluid stream.
