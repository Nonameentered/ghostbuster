What is Stokes Drift and how can it be numerically solved using an explicit method? How does the addition of waves affect the displacement of a parcel in the ocean? Can the computer model agree with the theory that at small values of wave amplitude, the approximate solution for Stokes Drift is correct? How do waves assist in the displacement of a parcel and what is the main effect from waves in the numerical model?
