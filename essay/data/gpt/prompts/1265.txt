How can strain gauges be used to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam? Describe the measurement system required and the components involved, including the use of a Wheatstone deflection bridge, an operational amplifier, and a low-pass filter. Explain how the sensitivity of the system is increased by using two strain gauges and how the output voltage is related to the applied force. Discuss the assumptions and calculations involved in determining the range of the force sensor, using the Young's modulus and fatigue strength of the beam. Finally, describe the circuit diagram of the Wheatstone bridge and explain how an amplifier is used to provide an appropriate output voltage.
