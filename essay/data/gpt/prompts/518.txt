What are the possible grounds for judicial review for students who have been disciplined or expelled from school? How might a student use the grounds of non-citation of relevant considerations, the right to a hearing, or the rule against bias to argue their case in court? Can the principles of proportionality or Wednesbury unreasonableness be used to challenge a school's disciplinary policy?
