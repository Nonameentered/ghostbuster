What are the functions and structures of the Immunoglobulin G molecule? How does the variation in constant and variable regions give rise to five different classes of immunoglobulins, with IgG being the most abundant? What is the role of antibody-antigen complex formation in the immune response? How does the immunoglobulin gene rearrangement result in millions of different molecules? Discuss the structure of IgG and the role of the 12 immunoglobulin domains, as well as the immunoglobulin fold. What is the importance of disulphide bonds in the IgG molecule?
