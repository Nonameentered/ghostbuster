What are the three methods of heat transfer? How can the amounts for which each method contributes be calculated? What is the ideal method for calculating heat transfer via radiation and why is an alternative method used in this experiment? How do varying pressures affect the efficiency of heat transfer in the Parani effect? What are the main inaccuracies in the experimental procedure?
