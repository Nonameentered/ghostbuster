Discuss the idea of motherhood as a woman's destiny or source of subordination, using the argument that maternal instinct may not be innate and exploring the societal pressure for women to become mothers. Explore the role of motherhood in providing women with a sense of identity and status and how it may perpetuate negative stereotypes for those who do not conform. Additionally, consider alternatives to the division of parenting roles and the assumptions that underlie them, proposing how motherhood can be seen as a choice rather than a prescribed destiny for women.
