What is the role of violence in contemporary Latin American cinema, and how does it contribute to our understanding of the film's story and characters? Using three critically acclaimed films from recent years as case studies, this essay will examine the manifestations of violence shown, how it is used by directors/writers, the effect it has on the viewer, and how it reflects the realities of modern Latin American society. Additionally, the essay will explore what societal values/views the films expose regarding violence, and how violence in these films has a didactic function that invites an analysis of related social issues.
