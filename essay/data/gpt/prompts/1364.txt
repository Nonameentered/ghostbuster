Evaluate Amnesty International's Stop Violence Against Women campaign from a feminist perspective. Assess the campaign's engagement with feminist debates surrounding violence against women, including its definition of violence against women, its acknowledgement of gender-based violence as a result of patriarchy and structural inequality, and its addressing of the acceptance of violence in society through blame culture, the invisibility of violence against women, and the public/private divide. Compare and contrast Amnesty's writings on violence against women with feminist literature on domestic violence and rape, and assess the campaign's inclusion or exclusion of other social divisions in its writings on violence against women.
