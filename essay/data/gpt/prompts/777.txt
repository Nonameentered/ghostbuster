What are the steps involved in using different numerical methods to approximate an integral and solve an initial value problem? How can Lagrange interpolation, Romberg integration, and predictor-corrector methods be used? What is the importance of using implicit methods for stiff problems and how can the stability of approximation solutions be proven using the Runge-Kutta method?
