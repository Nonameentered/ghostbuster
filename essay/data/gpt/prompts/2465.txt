What is the process for measuring the second moment of area of a beam and what are the different configurations used in the test rig? How do the experimental and computer calculated deflection profiles compare and what factors may contribute to any differences observed? What is the process for predicting the deflection profile using the integration method and how is the required reaction force calculated for setup one?
