Does social class influence leisure choices in the opera sector? Analyze the traditional paradigm of social class and its influence on leisure choices, as well as the influence of postmodernism and the mass media. Consider the effects of these paradigms on the opera sector to answer the question. Discuss the objective and subjective dimensions of social class, and analyze the upper class, middle class, and working class, as well as the emergence of the "celebrity elite" as a separate leisure class. Additionally, explain Pierre Bourdieu's theory on the reasons for leisure choices, including the role of habitus and cultural capital. Finally, discuss the argument about the decline of social class and give reasons for why it is not declining.
