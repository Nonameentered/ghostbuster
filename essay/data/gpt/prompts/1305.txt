Describe the simultaneous use of nitroxide mediated radical polymerisation (NMRP) and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) initiators in the formation of polystyrene. What are the potential outcomes and mechanisms of this combination? What conclusions can be drawn about the independence of NMRP and ATRP mechanisms?
