Discuss the concept of human rights, questioning their existence and whether or not they are justified. Use examples such as the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the idea of life as a gift to examine different perspectives on human rights and their origins. Consider the responsibilities of society and individuals in upholding human rights, as well as the role of gift-givers such as nature or parents in shaping these rights.
