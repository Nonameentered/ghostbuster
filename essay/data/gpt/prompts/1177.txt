Describe the investigation and analysis of the performance characteristics of a 'PLINT limited' centrifugal pump at different speeds and deliver pressures, including the collection and analysis of data, plotting of graphs, and determining factors such as efficiency. Discuss the results and implications of the investigation, including the usefulness of pump performance characteristics in selecting a pump for a particular system.
