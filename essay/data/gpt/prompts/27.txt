What was the aim of the experiment? How was conjugation used to establish the order of genes important in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism? How does genetic exchange in bacteria lead to evolution and the spread of multiple drug resistance? What order of genes was established in the experiment and how was this done? What is the importance of using a more precise method for mapping the chromosome, such as restriction enzyme treatment of the total DNA?
