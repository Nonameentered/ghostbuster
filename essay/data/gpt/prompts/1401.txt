What are the virtues and drawbacks of single- and multi-strategy research within the context of nursing? Provide a critical discussion of the use of these methodologies by comparing 'The delivery of quality nursing care: a grounded theory study of the nurse's perspective' by Anne M. Williams and 'Integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies for the assessment of health care systems: emergency medicine in post-conflict Serbia' by Brett D. Nelson and colleagues. Emphasis should also be placed on discussing the epistemological and methodological complexities involved in multi-strategy research and ascertaining the appropriateness of the researchers' choice of methodologies in relation to their specific research aims and objectives.
