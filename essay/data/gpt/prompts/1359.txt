What is the relationship between the strength of respiratory muscles in cystic fibrosis patients and their level of malnutrition and lung damage? Explore this relationship using a multiple linear regression model with PEmax as the dependent variable, taking into consideration the various variables that measure aspects of lung volume and malnutrition in a data set of 25 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Consider data reduction and summary, the presence of outliers, and the potential for multicollinearity.
