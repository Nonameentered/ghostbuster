What is the relationship between viscosity and flow of a fluid? How can the viscosity of a fluid be quantified? How does the temperature, composition, and concentration of a solution affect its viscosity? What is micellization and how does it affect the viscosity of a solution? How can viscometric measurements be used to understand the rheology of a polymer solution?
