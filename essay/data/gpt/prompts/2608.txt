What is the purpose of the Intensive Observation Period and what variables were measured to quantify the surface energy balance? How were the values for the measured variables derived and what sources of error influenced them? What are the different processes through which energy is exchanged between the Earth's surface and atmosphere, and why is understanding them important?
