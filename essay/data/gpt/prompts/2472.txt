What is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)? Explain the process and techniques used in CFD, as well as the different sectors of industry that utilize it for designing and solving fluid flow problems. Additionally, describe the three methods used for solving the Navier-Stokes equations and provide an overview of the CFX process. Finally, walk through a tutorial of creating a static mixer geometry and refining the mesh to increase accuracy and resolution using inflated boundary layers.
