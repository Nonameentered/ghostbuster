Examine the development of Bertolt Brecht as a playwright and his use of epic theatre to challenge the traditional genre of naturalism. Focus on three plays that illustrate the progression in Brecht's use of epic technique, connected by their use of specific themes and particularly in their portrayal of the plight of the individual. Analyze the social and political context of Brecht's work in the early 1920s Germany, his response to the socio-political condition, and how it is reflected in his plays. Discuss Brecht's belief that theatre must not only reflect the world but most importantly, change it and how he used his theories of epic theatre to achieve this.
