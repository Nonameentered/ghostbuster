To what extent should employers be responsible for the mental health and wellbeing of their employees? Analyze the House of Lords decision in the case of Somerset County Council v Barber and discuss whether it adequately balances the constraints upon the employer with the interests of the employee. Consider the developments in the workplace over the last thirty years and the extent to which an employer should be able to rely on the realities of modern work to determine the standard of care they owe to their employees. Evaluate the arguments for individual responsibility and adherence to contractual responsibility, as well as the challenges faced by employers in predicting and preventing psychiatric harm.
