How does HIV/AIDS impact the economic development of non-OECD countries, and does under-education contribute to the spread of the disease? This essay uses a sample of 50 non-OECD countries to examine their HIV prevalence levels and primary school completion rates, and compares them to each country's average rates of annual growth. Additionally, the essay explores the frequency distributions of these social indicators and calculates two sets of unweighted averages for the "faster-growing" and "slower-growing" groups of countries.
