How did the implementation of Structural Adjustment Programmes in Brazil impact the rise of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Rural Workers in the 1990s? Discuss the policies introduced by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, including trade liberalisation, inflation control, and fiscal deficit reduction, and their effects on poverty and inequality in rural areas. Analyze the role of the MST in response to these policies, including the increase in land occupations and radicalization of rural conflicts, as well as public demonstrations for agrarian reform. Consider the relationship between the MST's fight for access to land and its opposition to the neo-liberal order, as well as the World Bank's response with a release of $90 million to fund purchase of land and settlements.
