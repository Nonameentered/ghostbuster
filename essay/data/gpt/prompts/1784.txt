What are the challenges that international students, particularly Chinese students, face when obtaining a graduate degree in the UK? This essay provides a case study of one Chinese student and explores the possible difficulties stemming from differences in cultural and academic norms and expectations, or from gaps in linguistic competence. The study focuses on the student's research and writing skills and draws tentative conclusions on the effectiveness of her current study programme, as well as recommendations for her interim period between the end of this semester and her Masters programme. The essay also suggests that there should be more flexibility built into EAP courses and considers the implications for course design. Finally, the essay proposes a longitudinal study that tracks students through their EAP course and into their Post-graduate studies to truly assess the success of an EAP course in preparing a student.
