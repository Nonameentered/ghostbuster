What is the importance of the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume, and how was this ratio measured in an experiment involving an oscillating piston in a trapped mass of gas in a tube? Discuss the results obtained for Air, Nitrogen, and Argon, and compare them to accepted and theoretical values. Additionally, what errors were present in the experimental setup, and how can they be improved?
