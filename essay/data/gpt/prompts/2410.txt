Describe the computer program that will be written to model the atomic structure of melt-spun amorphous Dy7Ni3, including the use of the Metropolis Monte Carlo method and the optimization of parameters to fit with experimental data. Explain the potential energy calculations that will be used to determine the most appropriate values for the interatomic distances between Ni-Ni, Ni-Dy, and Dy-Dy, and discuss the use of ghost boxes to prevent edge effects in the model. Finally, describe the potential significance of the research in understanding amorphous metals and rare earth-transition metal glasses.
