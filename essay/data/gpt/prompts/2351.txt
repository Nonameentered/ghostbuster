What is molecular modelling and how is it made possible through the use of IT? Explain the computational chemistry applications of certain computer software and how they allow for the design, manipulation, and measurement of organic molecules. Describe the process of calculating the steric energy and the drawbacks of using statistical semi-empirical methods. Provide examples of molecules created using molecular modelling software and explain the process of energy minimization.
