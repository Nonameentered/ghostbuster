What are the applications and limitations of computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis in the design of a formula 1 front wing and nose section? How does FEA provide designers with a powerful tool for analyzing designs quickly and reducing the timescale? What are the structural requirements that the front wing and nose section must meet to provide more grip and generate downforce? What are the benefits of wind tunnel testing compared to these software programs?
