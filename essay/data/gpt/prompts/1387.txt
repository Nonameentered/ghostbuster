Is Ken Booth's concept of 'utopian realism' a feasible IR concept? Explain your position, providing a close examination of the four main propositions made by Booth's 'utopian realism'. Additionally, examine if Booth's application of Nye's idea of "process-utopias" could be used to catalyse a paradigm-shift required to make 'utopian realism' a feasible IR concept. Finally, offer your conclusion on the feasibility of 'utopian realism' as an IR concept and propose any alternative models for the international order that could potentially meet the end of reconciling the ideal with the actual.
