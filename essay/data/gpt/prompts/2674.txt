What are the main factors that determine the germination of weed seeds in the soil environment, and how do they interact to affect germination? Describe an experiment that investigates the effects of alternating temperatures, light, and nitrate nutrient on seed germination, including control groups and statistical analysis. What factors were found to be significant in influencing germination, and how do they contribute to the increase in germination observed under different treatments?
