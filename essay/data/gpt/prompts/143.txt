How can the number of thiol groups in the protein ovalbumin be determined, and how does the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) affect this measurement? What factors can impact the accuracy of this measurement, and what are some methods that can be used to remove denaturants like SDS from a protein solution? Additionally, how does the structure of polypeptides impact the refolding of a protein after denaturation, and what experiments have been conducted to study this phenomenon?
