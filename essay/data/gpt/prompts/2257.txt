What is evolutionary computation and how does it apply to the field of artificial intelligence? Can you provide examples of how genetic algorithms have been used to solve practical problems? Further, how does the use of evolutionary computation impact the development and application of intelligent machines such as robots? Provide specific examples and discuss the potential benefits and challenges of this approach.
