What is the aim of the experiment and how is it achieved using electrochemical methods of analysis? Discuss the theory of galvanic cells and how they can be used to determine concentrations via calibration plots of known concentrations. Describe the procedure of the experiment including how standard solutions were prepared and how the potential difference of each solution was measured.
