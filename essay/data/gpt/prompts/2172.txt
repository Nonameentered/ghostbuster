What role did Christianity play in shaping our understanding of religion and, in turn, our interpretation of the Roman imperial cult? Can we truly classify the imperial cult solely as a political entity, or were there elements of religion involved? To answer these questions, this essay examines the polytheistic nature of Roman religion and compares it to the monotheistic viewpoint of Christianity. It also looks at the Japanese imperial cult and whether it can help us better understand the relationship between politics and religion in the Roman Empire.
