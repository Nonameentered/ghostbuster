Discuss the concept of taxonomic classification and its relation to the identification of the earliest potential members of the Homo genus during the Pliocene. Consider the distribution of early hominids in relation to their tool-making abilities and evaluate the differing interpretations of the genus category within the taxonomy debate. Additionally, analyze the impact of discoveries in the Olduvai Gorge on the redefinition of membership criteria for the Homo genus. Finally, explain why a decisive adjudication on the earliest members of the Homo genus cannot be attained.
