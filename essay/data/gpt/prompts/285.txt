Discuss the inter-confederal ideological divisions between the CGT and CFDT in the French labour movement, and the significance of the issue on trade union membership, collective bargaining, neo-corporatist industrial relations, and the industrial relations system. Analyze recent evidence claiming that the CGT and CFDT have overcome traditional ideological divisions, and critique the nature of the change found, arguing whether the unions remain divided or not. Finally, present an overview of recent inter-confederal divisions in the French trade union movement as a whole.
