What were the findings of a series of experiments using a simple climate model? How did the model attempt to identify radiative forcings responsible for observed temperature changes since 1850? What were the results when all anthropogenic forcings were turned on? How does the climate feedback parameter affect climate response and equilibrium temperature? What are the implications of these findings for assessing observed temperature rises?
