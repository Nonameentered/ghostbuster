What is surface tension and how can it be measured? Discuss the methods of Jaeger and Cambridge, as well as the comparison of surface tension values with water. How does temperature affect the surface tension of liquids and solids? Discuss the determination of surface activity in liquids and solids. Include any errors or discrepancies encountered during the experiments.
