What is the relationship between gender and pay amongst employees in a bank? Provide a detailed analysis of the demographics of the bank's personnel, looking at factors such as education level, age, race, job position, and pay scales. Analyze any differences in pay between male and female employees and whether they are related to job positions or other factors. Consider how race intersects with gender and pay, and whether there are any significant disparities in pay based on both categories.
