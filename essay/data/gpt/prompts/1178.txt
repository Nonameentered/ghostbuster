What was the aim of the project investigating the influence of a wall on the movement of a vortex ring travelling in water? Describe the modifications made to the existing vortex ring generator and how the variables were altered. What was discovered about the effect of a wall on the movement of vortex rings and at what particular distance did the wall begin to influence the rings? Provide examples of natural occurrences of vortex rings and describe the process of vortex ring formation. Finally, discuss the factors that determine whether a vortex generator produces initially laminar or turbulent rings.
