What were the primary concerns when designing the site's layout? How was usability and navigation addressed? What type of information does the site provide, and how is it linked to typical user behavior? How was debugging done, and what were the results? Was the site evaluated against the coursework specification? If so, were all the facilities identified in the requirements implemented, and how does the end product perform? Are there any limitations to the site, and how can current operations be improved?
