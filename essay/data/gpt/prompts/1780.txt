Describe and analyze your role in an interaction with a nine-year-old girl and her mother who were admitted to the ward for a tonsillectomy. Reflect on what you learned and how you felt throughout the interaction/experience. Create a hypothesis that reflects what you think about what was going on, and discuss different theories and apply them to the situation. Finally, discuss how this experience will help you be aware of extra issues, like attachment or regression, in your future practice.
