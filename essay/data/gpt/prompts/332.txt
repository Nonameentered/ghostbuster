What are the theories and explanations related to intergroup relations and prejudice? To what extent can these theories contribute to our understanding of societal conflict and hostility, and ultimately help reduce terrorist acts and political violence? In particular, how do the social identity theory, realistic conflict hypothesis, and social dominance theory explain intergroup conflict and hostility between America and the Middle East? How effective are proposed solutions such as the contact hypothesis or the formation of superordinate goals in reducing violence between these groups? What role does religion play in this conflict, and how does it contribute to differentiation and prejudice?
