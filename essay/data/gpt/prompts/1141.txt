How did Augustin-Louis Cauchy advance the field of real analysis, and what were his major contributions to the definitions of infinite quantities, limits, and continuity of functions? Additionally, how did his work disprove Lagrange's belief about Taylor Series and lead to his development of the definite and indefinite integral? Finally, what criticisms have been made of Cauchy's proofs, and how do they impact our understanding of his contributions to the field of calculus?
