What is the mechanism of action of -lactams and how do they inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis? How do -lactamases affect the activity of -lactams and how can the inactivity of -lactamases towards peptides and peptidoglycan be exploited in -lactam synthesis? What are some possible explanations for why mimetic peptides have shown low levels of inhibition against DD-peptidases in other investigations?
