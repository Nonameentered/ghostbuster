What is the advantage of using ELISA over Western blots to detect and quantify antigens? How can an ELISA be set up to determine if monoclonal antibodies recognize Protein X in its pure and denatured forms? Why is it important to test animal serum for antibodies before injecting it with an antigen? How does the production of polyclonal antibodies differ from that of monoclonal antibodies in terms of protein requirements?
