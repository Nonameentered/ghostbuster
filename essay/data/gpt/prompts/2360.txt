What are the different results in archaeological and stable isotope evidences for examining the diet shift between Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic in Northwest Europe? How do transition theories and models, as well as archaeological material records and stable isotope measurements of human skeletal remains, inform our understanding of the dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition? What are the limitations and sample biases of stable isotope methodology, and how do they impact the interpretation of dietary shift?
