What are the different dispersal strategies in primates, and what are the various hypotheses put forward to explain why primates disperse? Using three examples of dispersal types, female-biased dispersal in chimpanzees, male-biased dispersal in East African vervet monkeys, and both-sex dispersal in red howler monkeys, discuss how these strategies affect genetic consequences on the individual, social group, and species population structure.
