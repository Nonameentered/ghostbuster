What is Jaeger's method for determining surface tension and how was it used in an experiment to determine the surface tension of distilled water? How was the Cambridge tension balance used to determine surface tension, and how did the results compare to literature values? Additionally, what is the relationship between surface-active components and surface tension, and how does the addition of substances such as sodium chloride, sugar, and detergent affect surface tension?
