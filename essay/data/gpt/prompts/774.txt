What is the current state of development in the field of real analysis and what is the key concept that remains uncertain despite recent attempts at formalization? What is Cauchy's definition of continuity and how does it appear to be inconsistent with his own theorem? In what way has progress been made towards making calculus more rigorous and how does Cauchy's definition of the derivative differ from Lagrange's attempt to set up a framework for calculus? What are some of the challenges that may arise in applying the rules of differential calculus to unusual functions that have recently been considered?
