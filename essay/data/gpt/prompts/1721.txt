What is the Jominy End Quench Test and how is it used to determine a steel's hardenability? Discuss the hardenability of EN9 and EN24 steels and their typical uses in engineering. How can hardenability be used to ensure the right material choice is made for a specific engineering application? Describe the effect of adding alloying elements to steel on hardenability and how this can prevent cracking or distortion. Use the results of the Jominy End Quench Test to explain the relationship between hardenability and depth of hardness in the two tested steels (070M55 and 817M40). Finally, discuss how hardening of steels is done and why it may be necessary in different engineering applications.
