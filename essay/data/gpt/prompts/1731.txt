In what ways does the care provided to a patient, referred to as Mary, meet her individual priorities? Reflect on the assumptions of both the patient and nurses, patient rights to access treatment and services, quality of care in relation to patient priorities, and the concept of personhood and possible barriers to its provision. Use Holm & Stephenson's (1994) model of reflection and incorporate the module themes of personhood and values and assumptions to guide your work.
