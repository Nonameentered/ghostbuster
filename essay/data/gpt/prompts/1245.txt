What is the objective of a laboratory session that involves testing biomaterials using a materials testing machine? How is the tensile testing process conducted and how are the results analyzed? How do factors such as heat treatment, prior history of plastic deformation, strain rate, and temperature affect the nature of the stress-strain curve for materials and how can this information be used to measure the ductility of materials? What are some limitations of the testing process and how do they affect the accuracy of the results?
