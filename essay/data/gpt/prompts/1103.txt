What are the modern variants of the classic two-slit experiment with photons and what questions do they pose for quantum theory? How does delayed choice factor into answering these questions? What is the non-intuitive behavior of quantum objects and how does it relate to the two-slit experiment? What is the explanation for the two-slit experiment and what are some interpretations of this explanation?
