How does the Rosenzweig-MacArthur system model the predator-prey population interaction and how can it be used to study the coexistence of two species? What assumptions are made in the model and how do they limit its accuracy? What mathematical techniques are used to analyze the model and how can they help determine the equilibrium point where both populations survive? What are some potential alternative models that can be used to study this interaction?
