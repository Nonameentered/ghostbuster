What are the techniques of gel electrophoresis and western blotting, and how are they used to isolate and identify proteins? Provide an explanation of the methodology and results of an experiment using these techniques to analyze glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in a laboratory setting. Additionally, discuss the potential challenges in expressing foreign proteins in prokaryotic cells and the differences between transcription and translation promoter sequences in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
