What is the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model of international trade and how does it differ from the Ricardian model? How does the H-O model determine comparative advantage based on factor endowments, and what are the assumptions underlying the model? Explain the concept of Factor Price Equalisation (FPE) and how it ensures world Pareto efficiency. What are the limitations of the FPE theorem and how might Factor Intensity Reversals (FIR) cause the theorem to fail? Use graphs and examples to support your answer.
