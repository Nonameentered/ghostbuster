What is error theory in meta-ethics, and how does it differ from non-naturalist moral realism? Discuss J.L. Mackie's argument for error theory, including his use of the argument from relativity and the argument from queerness. Consider the concept of moderate error theory and how it attempts to address the problem of all moral judgments being false. Analyze the criticisms of moderate error theory put forth by Crispin Wright and Alexander Miller, including the concept of superassertibility and the use of subsidiary norms.
