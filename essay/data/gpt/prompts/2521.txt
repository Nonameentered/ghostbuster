What are the practical implications of a computer model used to study the diurnal evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer and the vertical distribution of a pollutant emitted in both urban and rural environments? How does the model demonstrate the efficiency of the urban boundary layer in dispersing pollutants compared to the rural boundary layer, and what might this mean for the health of those living in these environments and for environmental planning? Also, what further research might be needed to confirm and expand upon these initial findings?
