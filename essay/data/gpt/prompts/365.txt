How does immobilizing enzymes increase their reusability and resistance to denaturation, and what materials can be used besides alginate to create immobilized enzymes? How does the specific activity of native enzymes compare to immobilized enzymes, and how does the number of assays affect the specific activity? What is the role of EDTA in breaking the gel structure, and what other chelating agents have a similar effect? How does restricting enzyme movement through immobilization affect enzyme-substrate complex formation and the accuracy of the results?
