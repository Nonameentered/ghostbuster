How do mathematical models predict the displacement of different beam set-ups, and how accurate are they? Analyze the results of mathematical models and compare them to experimental data obtained through laboratory work. Consider the factors that affect the deflection of beams, such as loading, dimensions, material, and method of support, and the assumptions made to simplify the mathematical model. Determine the accuracy of the mathematical model in predicting practical results and consider errors in experimental work.
