What are the factors that affect the functionality of control systems and how can instability be prevented by adding other devices to them? Can you give an analysis of the different types of control systems such as mechanical, hydraulic, electronic, and pneumatic? How does the addition of controllers improve response time and stability, and how do they affect the damping of the system? What are the basic parts of a control system and what mathematical techniques are used to analyze and simulate them, including the use of the MATLAB software? Lastly, what modifications can be made to control systems to improve their response time and damping?
