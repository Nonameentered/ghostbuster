What are the effects of changing the metal binding ligand and changing the addition time of the monomers on the rate of the transition metal mediated radical polymerization/atom transfer radical polymerization? Describe the experiment involving the preparation of two different ligands and an initiator, and the polymerization reactions to prepare 5 polymers with a range of different methods. Provide an analysis of the results and comparisons made between the different polymers based on their rate constants and graphs.
