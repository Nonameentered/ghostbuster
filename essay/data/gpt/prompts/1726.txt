What are the main objectives and findings of a report investigating the effects of cyclic loading on plain Aluminium Alloy beams? How does post yield loading affect the residual stress and strain profiles in the beams and their fatigue life, and what are the predicted values compared to those obtained through practical testing? What is fatigue and how does it lead to structural damage and failure? Provide examples of beam types and materials tested, and comment on the importance of predicting a component's fatigue properties and guarding against fatigue failure.
