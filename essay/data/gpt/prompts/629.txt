What are the rules of standing that must be considered and applied to determine if an individual is entitled to seek redress in the courts, and how do they apply to the case of James and his objections to a new planning policy on the grounds of noise, the likely fall in the value of his property, and lack of prior consultation before its implementation? What rights is James seeking to protect, and how does the concept of "special damage" factor into the determination of his standing? What are the potential avenues for legal action that James may pursue to seek redress for the public law wrong he has suffered, and what are the potential challenges he may face in achieving success?
