What is WinCoot and how is it used to refine an electron map? What is the structure of lysozyme and how does maltose affect it? What is the active site of lysozyme and what is occupying it? What errors were found in the model using WinCoot, and how were they resolved? What are some potential ways that errors can occur when assigning amino acids to regions of the electron density map? What structural features were identified for certain amino acids in the lysozyme model?
