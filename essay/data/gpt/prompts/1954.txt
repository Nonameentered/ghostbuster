What are the clear zones found on the beach and what species were present in each zone? How does the zonation of species on rocky shores vary depending on exposure and seawater? What factors contribute to the variation in marine life on different parts of the beach? What was not included in the beach survey but could potentially play a large part in the ecology and chemistry of the beach? Why is it important to study the zonation of species on beaches and rocky shores?
