What is the significance of the Gothic genre for women, and how does it privilege their experiences? Using both literary and cinematic examples, discuss the socio-historical context of the rise of Gothic fiction, the work of female Gothic writers, and the role of the Gothic heroine in female subjectivity. Analyze the use of "uncanny" and homely terrors in the Gothic, and the importance of passion and extreme feelings in the genre's extraordinary plots. Evaluate the feminist criticism of the Gothic, including the debate over whether Gothic heroines are submissive or not, and whether this model is promoted to readers. Additionally, explore the nature of the Modern gothic, redefining the term "Female Gothic" and considering it as a separate literary genre.
