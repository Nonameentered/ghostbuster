What is the objective of an acid-base titration and how is it used to measure the total acid concentration in vinegar? Describe the specific reaction used in the titration, the indicator used to detect the end point, and the process for calculating the acetic acid content of the vinegar sample. Additionally, explain the steps involved in preparing and standardizing the NaOH solution and the use of pH paper and barium chloride and silver nitrate solutions in determining the properties of the vinegar samples. Finally, provide an example calculation for determining the % w/v of acetic acid in a given vinegar sample.
