What is the Butterworth filter, and how does its frequency response differ from other types of filters? Describe the process of mapping analog filters to digital filters, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of different mapping techniques. How does the Bilinear transformation method help to maintain frequency performance when filtering in dynamic frequency-sensitive environments? Discuss the importance of pre-warping techniques in sampling digital filters and describe how they were used in the author's filter design. What are some of the challenges associated with implementing digital filters using ADC/DAC, and how can they be addressed? Reflect on your experience with the DSP lab and describe what you learned from the project.
