To what extent are mathematical models useful in accurately calculating deflection due to bending and torsion behavior? Examine the models derived from simple linear elastic theory, including judgements of the approximations involved, and compare them against experimental data obtained from two separate rigs. Consider the limitations and variables involved in accurately modeling bending and torsion behavior.
