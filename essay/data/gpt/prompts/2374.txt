Describe the natural phenomenon of thunderclouds and the physics principles that lead to the production of lightning, including charge separation and electrical discharge. How does the intensity of a lightning storm relate to these mechanisms? Can exploring other types of lightning, such as cloud to atmosphere discharge, lead to new understandings in physics?
