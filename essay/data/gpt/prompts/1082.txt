Does morality require religion in order to be justified? Consider the viewpoints of moral relativism and moral objectivism, and evaluate whether the relativist's position requires religion for justification. Discuss the potential slip into subjectivism and nihilism for the relativist, and explore the idea of incorporating a universal morality based on a grounding in human and sentient-being nature. Finally, consider whether the relativist may turn to religion to enforce her outlook of morality.
