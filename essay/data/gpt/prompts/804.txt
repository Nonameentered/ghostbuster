What is the significance of drag in vehicle design? How does the type of body affect the level and type of drag? Explain the impact of pressure drag and skin friction and how they differ for bluff and streamlined bodies. How does drag relate to turbulence and boundary layers? How do engineers balance aesthetics with aerodynamic efficiency when designing vehicles? Can scale models be used to test aerodynamics, or are advanced computer programs needed? Provide examples of drag calculations for a coach and a racing car.
