What is pattern grammar and how has corpus linguistics provided an analytical tool for theorizing about patterns and meaning?

How do principles like the open choice principle and the idiom principle contribute to our understanding of how English speakers choose and use language? Finally, how do patterns and meaning relate to each other, and what difficulties arise in defining and predicting this relationship?
