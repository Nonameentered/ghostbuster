Discuss the molecular mechanisms by which colorectal cancer arises, focusing on the sporadic mutations that exist and how they cause tumors to develop. Consider the three main signaling pathways involved in colorectal cancer: the Wnt Pathway, the Ras/MAPK pathway, and the PI3K/PKB pathway, and how these pathways are disrupted in tumorigenesis. Analyze the mutations found in the commonly mutated genes in human colorectal cancer, including APC, K-Ras, and B-Raf, and how these mutations confer a survival advantage to tumor cells.
