What was the purpose of the experiment involving a circuit with resistance and inductance connected in series? Describe the results and relationship between the number of turns and inductance, and how the addition of a capacitor can counteract the effects of the inductor. Also, explain the concept of harmonics in circuits and how inductors act as low-pass filters. Provide specific details and data from the experiment to support your explanation.
