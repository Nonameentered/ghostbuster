What is the effect of normalisation and tempering on the ductility, toughness, and strength of steel? How does the amount of carbon in steel affect its fracture energy and resistance to fracture? What is the difference between brittle and ductile fracture, and how are these related to the crystalline appearance of the steel? How does the tempering temperature affect the proportion of martensite and pearlite/ferrite in steel, and how does this affect its fracture energy and resistance to fracture? What are some potential sources of variation in heat treatment and their effects on the results of fracture tests?
