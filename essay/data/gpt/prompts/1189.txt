What are the different parameters and control methods used to analyze a first order plus deadtime system in a report? How does analogue control and discrete control differ in terms of the effects on system stability? How does the Ziegler Nichols design values affect the design of a Dahlin controller for this system? What are the characteristics of the proportional only controller and how does the Dahlin controller improve upon it? Finally, what is the transfer function of a Ziegler Nichols tuned discrete PID controller using the Dahlin control method?
