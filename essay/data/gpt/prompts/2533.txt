Can artificial neural networks be used to predict the occurrence of tremor in Parkinson's disease from local field potentials recorded from sub-thalamus? Consider the limitations of current Parkinson's disease therapies and the potential benefits of demand-driven intelligent stimulators. Analyze the experimental results presented in the essay and evaluate the accuracy of the neural network predictions. Discuss the impact of the number of hidden neurons on training and generalization performance and potential sources of errors.
