How have the theories of Anthony Giddens and Pierre Bourdieu impacted the field of Archaeology, and how do their theories differ and overlap? Explain the concepts of habitus and field, and discuss how these ideas can be applied to better understand past societies and individual actions as seen in archaeological records. Consider criticisms of Bourdieu's theory of habitus and how it interacts with Giddens' Structuration Theory. Finally, provide an example of how Giddens' Structuration Theory can be applied to the analysis of a specific archaeological artifact or site to better understand how social structures and agency interact.
