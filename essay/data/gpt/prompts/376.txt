Explain the organization and structure of centromeric chromatin in mammals, including the role of histone proteins, nucleosomes, and the kinetochore complex in cell division. Consider the differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin, as well as the lack of conserved DNA sequence in centromeres across species.
