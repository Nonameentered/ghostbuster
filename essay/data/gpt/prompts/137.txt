What factors led to the divergence between the West (specifically Western Europe) and the East (with a focus on China)? To what extent was this divergence due to connections formed between 1300 and 1800, as opposed to luck and good fortune? In what ways were the economies, state control, and religion of Europe, China, and the Ottoman state similar during this time period? How did archaic and early modern globalisation contribute to convergence in certain areas? How did the passing towards modernity, symbolised by the Industrial Revolution and population growth, contribute to the divergence between East and West?
