What is the principal contribution of micro-morphology analysis and how does it enable the study of sociocultural and environmental information in occupation deposits? How can micro-morphological analysis provide insight into the spatio-temporal and contextual relationships between paintings, artefactual and bioarchaeological remains, and architectural materials within settlements and landscapes in the Neolithic Near East? What is the significance of micro-stratigraphic sequences and micro-residues in accumulated occupation deposits, and how do they contribute to identifying routine practices, microenvironments, aspects of material culture, and exceptional events and changes through time and across space? How does micro-morphological analysis contribute to our understanding of the complex spatial organization and chronological cycles of domestic, ritual, and economic activities within buildings?
