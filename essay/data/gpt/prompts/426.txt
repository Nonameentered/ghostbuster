How do mutational events give rise to molecular disease? Discuss the types of mutations that can cause molecular disease and provide examples of specific conditions in each category. What are the five main types of molecular disease? What is the difference between point mutations and length mutations? How do chromosomal abnormalities contribute to molecular disease? Why is more research necessary in this area?
