What is the purpose of the experiment and what conclusions were drawn from the results obtained? How is Newton's 2nd Law related to rotational and linear motion in this experiment, and what physical behavior does the 2nd moment of mass exhibit? Additionally, what is the method used to determine the moment of inertia of the three discs, and how are the experimental results compared to the theoretical relationship? Lastly, what is the importance of making justifiable assumptions during the experiment?
