How does Simmel's approach to sociology differ from Durkheim's, and how does his concept of forms-of-sociation inform his perspective on the social bond? What is the function of the separation between form and content in Simmel's theory, and how does this contribute to his view of society as a result of the constant reciprocal interaction and mutual pressure of concretely realised social forms? How does Simmel's focus on the microsocial element of society limit his overall theory, and how does this become apparent in his essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life"? Ultimately, what are the strengths and weaknesses of Simmel's reductionist sociology?
