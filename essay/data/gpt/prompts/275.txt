What are the major developments in international criminal law that have occurred over the latter half of the twentieth century? How have these developments attempted to end the impunity of government leaders who commit the gravest breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law? What are the limitations of these developments, and how do they depend on the political will and readiness of states to limit their sovereignty and submit to international jurisdiction? Analyze and assess the operation and limitations of the International Military Tribunals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Genocide Convention, and the ad hoc criminal tribunals established under the auspices of the UN Security Council, and discuss whether they demonstrate that war criminals can no longer behave with impunity.
