What are the limitations of physical modelling for structural analysis? Describe an experiment conducted to determine the maximum load that four different frameworks can support before one member begins to buckle, and compare the results with the theoretical buckling loads. How were the structures constructed, what instruments and apparatus were used, and what assumptions were made during the experiment? What were the observations and results of the experiment, and what possible errors were identified?
