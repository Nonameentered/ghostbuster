Describe an experiment to identify two radioactive sources and determine their attenuation coefficient through the use of a sodium iodide scintillator crystal, photomultiplier tube, and Multi-channel Analyser. Discuss the key features of the gamma-ray energy spectra and how they were analyzed to identify the sources. Evaluate the accuracy of the results and identify potential sources of error.
