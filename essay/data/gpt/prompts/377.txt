What is genetic recombination and how does it occur in bacteria? Compare and contrast homologous and non-homologous recombination, providing a molecular explanation of the processes involved in each. Describe the specific roles of enzymes involved in homologous recombination using E. coli as an example. How does the process of homologous recombination differ from that of bacteriophage recombination and what are the implications of these differences?
