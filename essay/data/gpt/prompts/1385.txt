To what extent do poorer countries grow faster than richer ones after accumulating a knowledge base and technology? Analyze the convergence hypothesis using the techniques of econometric analysis based on theory from the Solow Model. Extend the analysis to compare the seminal papers on the subject by Baumol and De Long and build your own model using data from the Penn World Table. Analyze your results and conclude with possible policy suggestions to induce convergence and growth where missing.
