What is data encryption and how is it achieved? Compare and contrast block and stream ciphers and discuss their applications in ensuring security and privacy in insecure communication media. Are there any potential challenges in implementing and comparing these encryption algorithms? How can the project be further developed to investigate the selection of encryption algorithms for specific applications or compare them based on criteria other than speed and resistance to attack?
