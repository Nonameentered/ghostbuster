What are the strengths and weaknesses of Esping-Anderson's "The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism" from a feminist perspective? How do feminists critique Esping-Anderson's conceptualization of the welfare state's origins and development, gender-blind stratification and decommodification concepts, and marginalization of the family in his analysis of the state-market nexus? Do these critiques contaminate Esping-Anderson's empirical findings, or is his typology consistent with analyses that factor in women's roles? How does Pfau-Effinger's work on culture and gender arrangements further illuminate the gender-insensitive nature of welfare-regime theory as a whole?
