What are maternal effect genes and how do they affect early development? Provide examples of how maternal effect mutations affect cell fates in the early embryo and explain the role of PAR proteins in establishing polarity during the first cell cycle. Provide evidence for the autonomous specification of cell fates in the EMS blastomere and the role of SKN-1 and MEX-1 in regulating transcription and cell fate determination. Finally, discuss the role of PIE-1 in establishing asymmetry in the germline and early embryo.
