What is system identification and how is recursive identification useful for adaptive control, estimation, and signal processing? Describe the process of using recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for parameter estimation and modeling of a mechanical "master" robot of a master/slave telemanipulator. How does the inclusion of Instrument Variables or a PLS noise model affect the results? Summarize the report and discuss the effectiveness of RLS algorithm and the optimal model for representing the dynamic system.
