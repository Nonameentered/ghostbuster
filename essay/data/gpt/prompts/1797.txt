What is SARS and how does it impact respiratory function? Discuss the pathogenesis of SARS, including its histological appearance and the effects of pulmonary edema on mechanical respiratory function and gas exchange. Additionally, explore how SARS affects the pneumocytes in the lung and how air space consolidation and ventilation/perfusion mismatch contribute to hypoxemia.
