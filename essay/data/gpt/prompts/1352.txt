What is the relationship between women's human rights and religious freedom? Trace this relationship through the context of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. Use case studies from India to highlight the different positions taken by religious ideologues and feminists regarding women's rights. Discuss the limitations of the CEDAW, including its weak enforcement mechanism, reservations made by States, and criticisms of embodying a male-based model of equality. How does the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief guarantee the freedom to practice one's own religion without fear or discrimination?
