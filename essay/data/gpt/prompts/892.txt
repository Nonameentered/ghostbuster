What are the different types of drag found on road vehicles, and how do they affect the design and performance of cars and coaches? How can designers use aerodynamic principles to improve the fuel efficiency, speed, and passenger comfort of their vehicles, and what types of shape and aerodynamic aids are commonly used in racing cars and other high-performance vehicles? Finally, how do engineers use scaled models, CFD, and CAD to test and refine their designs?
