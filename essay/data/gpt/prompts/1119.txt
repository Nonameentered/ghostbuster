To what extent did Judaeo-Christian theology inspire the development of English common law and the secular legal profession? Evaluate the significance of such theology in light of the influences of mediaeval and early modern commentators, such as Sir John Fortescue, William Dugdale, and Sir Edward Coke, as well as modern jurists. Consider the context of encroaching Roman civil law and the strict Canon rules of the church, and how Judaeo-Christian teachings were used to legitimize and strengthen common law against inequitable ideas.
