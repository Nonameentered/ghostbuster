What are the different characteristics of laminar and turbulent flows through a pipe? How can the Reynolds number and properties of the working fluid be used to measure pressure drop in an experiment? What are the implications of shear forces in engineering applications, and how can the coefficient of friction be reduced to address these issues? Lastly, how can mass flow rate and density be measured experimentally and what role does meticulous experimental technique play in minimizing human errors?
