What approaches can be used to efficiently synthesize 1,2-diamines using diazetidine as a building block? How can asymmetric lithiation/electrophilic substitution reactions be used in this synthesis? What is the mechanism behind the cycloaddition of diazetidine, and what are the implications of recent research in this area? How can photochemical approaches be used in this synthesis, and what techniques are best suited for product purification and characterization?
