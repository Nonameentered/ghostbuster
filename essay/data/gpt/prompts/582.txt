What is the relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness? Explore the evidence and examine the finding of Carroll's study that concludes that there is not a significant relationship between letter knowledge and phonological awareness. Investigate whether the lack of significance in the path analysis was due to the substantial differences in letter awareness between Time 2 and Time 3 in the original study. Conduct an 8 month longitudinal study to examine the influence of both language development and letter knowledge on phonological development.
