Examine the portrayal of Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins in historical commentary and assess the extent to which de Valera's comments about Collins in 1966 have been corroborated by historiography. Analyze the political ambition, political achievements, and mystique of both de Valera and Collins in order to comprehend their role in Irish history, while keeping in mind the social, political, and economic context within which they worked.  Consider whether de Valera's failure to be remembered in a positive light may be due to political or social issues, and whether his agenda was not in line with the majority of Irish opinion. Evaluate the criticisms that de Valera lacked social and economic policies, and examine the focus of his attempts at disengagement from Britain to ascertain what his main political aspiration was. Ultimately, determine whether de Valera deserves a different depiction in history, and whether he achieved successes that should make him more sympathetically remembered.
