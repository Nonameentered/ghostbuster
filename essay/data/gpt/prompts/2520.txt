What were the observed weather patterns during the 2006 "Experiencing the Weather" field weekend near Swanage, Dorset in southern England? What factors contributed to the observed changes in air temperature and humidity, and how were these changes reflected in the data gathered by different student groups? What implications do these findings have for our understanding of weather patterns in coastal areas and regions with large water bodies? What were the key features of the tephigrams generated during the weekend, and how do these help us to understand the stability of the atmosphere over the study area during this time period?
