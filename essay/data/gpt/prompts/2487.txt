What is the most efficient and cost-effective type of solar cell to use for a proposed PV array on a sloping roof near Reading, UK? How does the annual yield and cost of electricity produced vary with different cell types? How does the array's output compare with the optimum output and with an identical array in Benin, Nigeria? What is the potential profit and funding available for the project?
