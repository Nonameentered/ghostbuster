How can the sodium chloride content in foods be determined, and what are some potential sources of error in the process? How was this method applied specifically in the context of a determination of salt in butter, and what were the results? How can the variability in results among different teams be explained or accounted for? What are some of the implications of these findings for understanding salt content in food products more generally?
