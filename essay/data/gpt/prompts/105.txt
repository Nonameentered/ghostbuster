Discuss the different approaches to playwriting during the period following the Restoration of Charles the Second, and how these approaches affect the components of different plays, particularly Restoration Comedies. Consider the social and political values reflected in the plays, as well as the use of theatrical techniques by French and English cultures. Analyze the differences in characterisation, humour, and the effectiveness of the plays in reflecting the society and manners of the period. Provide examples from plays that use either a satirical or sentimental approach to demonstrate these differences.
