What are the two most central theories of price determination, and how do they differ in their emphasis on import prices? How does bargaining coordination affect mark-ups and wages, and what is the theoretical justification for including coordination as an explanatory variable in the mark-up equation? What are the implications of Nunziata's findings for the determinants of labour costs and wages in OECD countries, and how do they relate to the issue of price formation? Finally, how does Ashworth's estimation of a non-stationary panel data set for 13 OECD countries shed light on the pro-cyclical nature of the mark-up, and how do Chevalier's findings challenge traditional assumptions about mark-up dynamics during recessions?
