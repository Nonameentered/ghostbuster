What was the apparatus used in the experiment? How was calibration done before the Intensive Observation Period? What was noted during the experiment and how was wind speed measured? How accurate were the measurements and what did the graph of wind speed against ln(z) show? What was the roughness length and what was the observed lapse rate near the surface? What assumptions were made during the analysis of the experiment and how did non-neutral conditions affect the results? What was the estimated value of sensible heat flux using the eddy correlation method and the profile method, and how were they related to the distance between the two temperature sensors?
