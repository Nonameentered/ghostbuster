What are the three axes involved in the patterning of the vertebrate limb, and how do they interact with each other to produce complete and correct morphology? Explore the role of signalling centres such as the AER and ZPA in limb induction and patterning, and discuss the interplay between Fgf and Wnt signalling pathways. Lastly, consider the current understanding and potential future directions in limb patterning research.
