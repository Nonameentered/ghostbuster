How do beauty adverts construct our understanding of feminine beauty? Analyze the symbolic and photographic codes used in two contrasting beauty adverts in order to identify the predominant ideologies behind them. Consider areas in which the versions of typical feminine beauty are challenged and where they conform, including the use of colour, appearance of human beings, background/setting, lighting/editing, captions/brand names, and linguistic codes. Additionally, analyze how perfume as a product is particularly challenging to advertise given that it has no denotation.
