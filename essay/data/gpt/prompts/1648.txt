What is the occupational behaviour frame of reference and how can it be used to develop an intervention plan for individuals with a moderate learning disability? Using the example of May, discuss the short and long term goals that can be set for her to achieve her highest potential and improve her quality of life. Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention plan by interviewing May, her husband, and Day Centre staff, and comparing her perspective of her performance, problems, and goals before and after intervention.
