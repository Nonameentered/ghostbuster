Can the existence of God be proved through the Teleological argument/argument from design? Provide arguments for and against the notion that God is a plausible explanation for the order observed in the universe, and whether his existence can be proved using the principle of Occam's Razor. Consider the limitations and implications of the argument from design and examine the position that the order in the universe can be explained by chance.
