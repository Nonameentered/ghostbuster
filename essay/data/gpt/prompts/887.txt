What experiment was conducted to explore the design of a measurement system for measuring low-level force? How was the output of the system observed and what errors were associated with it? What components were used to measure low-level force and what was the overall equation for output voltage against loading force? What data was collected using Labview software and what was the linear range and sensitivity of the force sensor system? What was the maximum loading force allowed for the system and how was it calculated? What graphs were produced and what did they represent? How did the sensitivity of the measurement system depend on the output voltage and loading force? What was the reason for errors increasing with increasing loading force?
