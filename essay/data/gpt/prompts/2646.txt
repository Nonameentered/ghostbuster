What is the procedure for carrying out a diazonium coupling reaction between a Diazonium Salt and phenol via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism? What are the precautions that need to be taken during the experiment? Describe the reaction mechanism to rationalize the formation of the Azo dye.
