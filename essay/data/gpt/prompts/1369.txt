Compare and contrast the social policies of Hitler's Nazi government with the New Deal policies of Roosevelt's Democratic government from 1932 to 1937. Analyze the extent to which the Nazi went further than Roosevelt in various social policies including: programmes to deal with mass unemployment, attempts to stimulate industrial recovery and social welfare and social insurance reforms. Explore the differences between relations in both countries between the state and the trade union movement and the state and business community to examine the restrictions placed on democratic governments by economic interest groups. Also, examine why Germany was able to achieve full employment and economic recovery much earlier than the United States.
