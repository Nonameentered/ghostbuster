What is the significance of studying molluscan data in determining the changing landscape throughout history and prehistory, and how can it be used in combination with other bioarchaeological evidence? Using the Ufton Green area in the Kennet Valley as a case study, analyze the mollusc assemblage from core 50 and examine the distribution of mollusc species to interpret the environmental landscape and changes in land-use, potentially caused by human activity and impact on the environment.
