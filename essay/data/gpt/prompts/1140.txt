Does globalisation cost job in Britain? Analyze the increase in cross-border flows of goods, capital, and labour to determine if it has caused adverse impacts on the employment statistics of the British labour market. Use international trade, foreign direct investment, and international migration flow as key indicators and apply multiple-regression to examine the changes in these factors and their impact on employment statistics. Perform the analysis at two levels - a national analysis and an industry analysis - to provide a balanced assessment of the increase of cross-border flows of market factors and to include indirect effects into the assessment of employment condition.
