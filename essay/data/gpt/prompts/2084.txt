What are the syntactic rules governing quantifiers in negative and interrogative contexts, both of which are non-assertive environments? How do these rules interact with semantic interpretations, scope relationships, and pragmatic factors, and to what extent can they satisfactorily capture the behavior of quantifiers in contemporary English? What are the systematic differences in the manifestation of quantifiers in negative and interrogative clauses across languages, and how do assertive and non-assertive quantifiers contribute to the understanding of the nature of quantifiers in natural language?
