What questions arise when comparing the sustainability and land use management of two ancient oasis settlements in Oman? How do the aini-aflaj irrigation systems contribute to their survival?

What role does the transfer of animal manure play in their nutrient supply? Given the rapidly changing economy of Oman, can these systems withstand the challenges posed by overpopulation, rising labor costs, and heavy use of mineral fertilizers?
