What is Stokes drift and how does it affect the transport of water masses in the ocean? Describe the investigation of certain characteristics of Stokes drift, such as wave amplitude and phase speed, using a MATLAB computer program. What is the significance of the findings regarding the impact of wave-driven components on the magnitude and direction of Stokes drift? How does Stokes drift affect the net transport of water, and what are the factors that influence its positive or negative effects?
