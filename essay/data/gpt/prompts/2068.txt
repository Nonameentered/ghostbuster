What were the methods used to collect and calculate the species diversity of four different habitats in the Rennes field centre in Brittany, and what were the results? How did abiotic and biotic factors affect the diversity of each site? What factors may explain why the most diverse site had a greater variety of invertebrates, and what factors may affect the distribution of organisms in different habitats?
