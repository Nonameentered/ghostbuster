What are some of the criticisms made against anti-war pacifism by its main philosophical rival, the just war theory, and how does the anti-war pacifist respond to these criticisms? In your response, be sure to discuss whether the legitimate right of self-defence held by individuals can be extended to political communities, the moral basis for supporting military action in countries that fail to adhere to human rights norms, and the positive alternatives that anti-war pacifism has to offer. Additionally, provide an argument against the current presumption society has in favour of war.
