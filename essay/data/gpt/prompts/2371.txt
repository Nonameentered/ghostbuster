How can self-organised criticality be applied to model future predictions of natural disasters, specifically forest fires? What is the simplified model used to demonstrate how a forest fire can be a self-organised critical system and what are the assumptions and technicalities that have been ignored in the model? How does the lack of time scale in weak chaotic systems allow for long-term predictions and what are the potential implications for predicting the spread of diseases and forest fires?
