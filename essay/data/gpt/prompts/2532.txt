What is the major concern of this assignment and what methods are used to compare controllers for various systems? How do feedback control systems play a vital role in dynamic systems, and what are some advantages and disadvantages of proportional controllers, PID controllers, Modified Ziegler-Nichols (MZN) PID controllers, and Bode's Maximum Available Feedback (MAF) design method? What were the results of the tests on different systems using these methods?
