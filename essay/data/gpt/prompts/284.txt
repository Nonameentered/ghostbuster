Discuss the appropriateness of using measures of elected union representatives as a reflection of union support or influence, considering the reduction in elected union representatives, where these representatives are dominant, and how this reflects union influence. Analyze the relative roles and duties of representatives, mainly focusing on comits d'entreprise as current data is widely available. Evaluate the factors affecting the unions' ability to organize and their commitment to organizing in the workplace, as well as the strength of unions in representation structures within larger firms versus smaller ones. Consider recent evidence on comits d'entreprise elections and the joint drive for unionization in companies launched by CGT and CFDT.
