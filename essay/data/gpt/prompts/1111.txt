What are the criteria that define science and how can we determine whether a theory is scientific or pseudoscientific? Discuss the contrasting views of Karl Popper's falsification criterion and Thomas Kuhn's puzzle-solving criterion, as well as Imre Lakatos's hard core/protective belt ideas and Thargard's views on astrology. Examine whether demarcation criteria exist to differentiate science from non-science and what conditions such criteria must have in order to be satisfactory. Finally, provide your own views on what criteria science should have in order to be considered genuine.
