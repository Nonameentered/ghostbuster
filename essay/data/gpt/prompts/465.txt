Evaluate Marx's conception of the capitalist social order and its applicability to the observable phenomenon of the 'globalisation of capital', particularly the internationalization of production. Analyze the foundation of Marx's argument based on the necessity of class conflict and the interdependent relationship between the capitalist and the worker, and examine examples of the contradictions which result from this antagonistic relationship, such as the fall in the rate of profit. Consider the application of Marx's conception to the 'globalisation of capital', including the tendency to separate the producer from the consumer and its impact on industries in developed countries.
