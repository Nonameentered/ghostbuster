What was the aim of the experiment and how was alkaline phosphotase used to study enzyme kinetics, specifically the effects of pH, temperature, and product inhibition? What factors can affect enzyme activity and how can enzyme kinetics be measured? How was the Michaelis constant and order of reaction calculated, and what were the results of the experiment?
