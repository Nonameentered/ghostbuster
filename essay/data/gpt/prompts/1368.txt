Compare the success of the Swedish left in creating a lasting welfare consensus in contrast to the failures of the British left in producing a similar result during the Great Depression. Analyze why the British left was unsuccessful in the 1930s, and examine its successes in the 1940s in producing a lasting welfare settlement. Define a lasting welfare settlement as adherence to Keynesian economic policies, including commitment to full employment, state intervention, economic planning, and significant welfare reform. Contrast these policies with the laissez faire approach of public expenditure cuts, the free market, and acceptance of unemployment as a natural part of capitalist society.
