What is the objective of the experiment and how is it conducted to measure the moment of inertia of various discs? What is the theoretical derivation of the value of moment of inertia of a disc and how is it related to the experimental values obtained? What are the limitations and sources of error in the experimental method and what improvements can be made to increase the accuracy of the results?
