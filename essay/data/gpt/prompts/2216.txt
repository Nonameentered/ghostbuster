What is ferrocene and how does it react? Explain the process of separating the products of the acetylation of ferrocene using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography, and how the Rf value is used to determine the identity of a spot on the TLC plate. Finally, describe how NMR spectra is used to analyze and identify the chemical shifts of the protons present.
