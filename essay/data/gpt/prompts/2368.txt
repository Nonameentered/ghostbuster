What are the processes involved in cloud formation and precipitation, and how do they work? Which factors are involved in the production of rain, and what are the two main processes that can cause precipitation? How do warm clouds and cold clouds differ in terms of precipitation formation, and what are the key factors involved in their formation? Discuss the role of condensation nuclei and their impact on cloud droplet formation.
