What are the primary characteristics of a sensor and what are the steps involved in wet etching of a single crystal of silicon? How does the response of a Tin oxide gas sensor depend on the temperature of the chemical reaction taking place? Discuss the deficiencies of chemical sensor technology and its commercial success, with an exception to it.
