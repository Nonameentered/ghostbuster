What is the focus of this practical investigation and how is bonding characterized in substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl? What strategies are involved in bonding and how do they affect the energy levels and vibrations of the compounds? How is group theory used to explain the number of observed vibrational modes? What evidence is provided by IR and NMR spectra, and X-Ray data to support the delocalized nature of bonding in these complexes?
