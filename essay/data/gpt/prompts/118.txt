What were the major objectives of the laboratory in understanding the characteristics of a three-phase induction motor, and how were those objectives achieved through the use of a dynamometer and tachometer, and the measurement of torque, speed, current, mechanical power, power factor, and efficiency? How do the graphs and data help to illustrate the relationship between these attributes, and what is the significance of the results for the performance of the motor and the concept of power factor?
