What is the Heckscher-Ohlin model and what are its underlying assumptions? In what ways does it differ from the Ricardian model? How does it predict patterns of trade and production based on the differences in relative factor endowments between countries? What are the implications of the model for modern policy-making? How do real-world factors like economies of scale and market distortions challenge the assumptions of the model?
