What are some of the potential applications of STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) manipulation techniques in nanotechnology and how do they work? What is the significance of using an STM tip as an engineering tool? How has this technology been used to create atomic-scale structures, synthesize single molecules, and conduct controlled chemical reactions on a single molecule scale? In what ways can this technology be used for computational purposes and what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical computation on a nanometre scale? Provide examples and scientific evidence to support your answers.
