What is the model of communication system developed by Matlab and Simulink and what are the various digital modulation schemes used and tested with relative performance easily compared in the implementation part? How does the choice of modulation method crucially affect the ease of implementation and the noise tolerance? What are the different modeling schemes given in the report and how are the bit/packet error rate performance compared and contrasted along with theoretical grounding for the relevant results? What are the trade-offs between the merits and disadvantages of these solutions in different practical situations such as transmission speed, reliability, power and complexity issues? How is multi-carrier modulation (OFDM) implemented and what are the further issues and problems that arise with its practical application?
