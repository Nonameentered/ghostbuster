Explain the role of centromeres in accurate chromosome segregation during division. How is centromeric chromatin organised, and what is the relationship between this organisation and the formation of the kinetochore? What are the defining features of heterochromatin in centromeres, and how do they contribute to proper chromosome movement? Discuss the core kinetochore proteins found in centromeric chromatin, their functions, and their importance in centromere assembly and cohesion. Finally, describe the structure and composition of centromeric nucleosomes and their relationship to the strength of microtubule pull during division.
