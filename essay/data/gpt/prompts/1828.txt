What are the main methods of revenue collection for local government in the UK, and how do they impact local democracy? Discuss the pros and cons of each taxation method, including local property taxes, user charging, local sales tax, and local income-tax, and their implications for accountability and financial independence at the local level. Consider the trade-offs between local autonomy and central government control, the differences between rural and urban areas, and the potential impact on voter participation. Provide examples from other countries, such as the US Federal system or Belgian language conflicts, to illustrate the potential risks and benefits of different revenue collection methods.
