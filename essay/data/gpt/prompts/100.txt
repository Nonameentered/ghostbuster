What are the frictional forces inherent in laminar and turbulent pipe flow? How can an estimate of the friction factor be obtained and compared with established results? What is the difference in pressure gradient and flow rate between laminar and turbulent flow? Is friction factor dependent on surface roughness or Reynolds number? How do additional shear stresses affect friction factor and where can these values be found on the Moody chart? Discuss the velocity profile development region for both laminar and turbulent flow.
