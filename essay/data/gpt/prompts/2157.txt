How does class and gender affect the way people speak? Analyze the linguistic evidence to make assumptions about age, gender, and social status in relation to language traits and social variables. Examine the effects of class and gender on language, discuss how they are linked, and explore the use of language as a means of identifying oneself with a particular social group. Provide examples of dialects, accents, lexical and grammatical variations, and prestigious language features in different societies.
