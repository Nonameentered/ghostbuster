What is the hemispheric asymmetry hypothesis in the mental lexicon, and how can it be tested in a single split-brain patient? How do the opposing views of object similarity and association in the semantic space factor into this hypothesis? How can the false memory paradigm be used to support both theories of semantic organization? Furthermore, what limitations may have influenced previous research, and how can a new study overcome these limitations to find a double dissociation between hemispheric specialization and semantic lexicon organization?
