The problem being solved in this coursework is navigating a maze using a LIFO (last in, first out) stack data structure. The LIFO stack is being used to keep track of the path taken through the maze so that if the current path leads to a dead end, the program can backtrack to the previous intersection and try a different path.
By using a LIFO stack, the program can keep track of the order in which intersections were visited in the maze. When the program reaches a dead end, it can easily pop the last intersection from the stack and return to that intersection to explore other paths.
The maze can be modeled as a two-dimensional array or grid. Each cell in the grid represents a space in the maze, and each cell can be either a wall or a pathway. The starting point and the end point of the maze can be marked on the grid. The program will then use the LIFO stack to navigate the maze by following paths and backtracking when necessary.
This modeling approach is efficient and easy to implement. It allows for the maze to be easily visualized and modified if needed. Additionally, the use of a LIFO stack simplifies the navigation process, making it more accurate and efficient. This coursework offers an effective solution to the problem of navigating a maze and demonstrates the usefulness of LIFO stacks in solving certain types of problems.
