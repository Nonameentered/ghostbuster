Factors Contributing to Poor Performance:
Renold did not perform well in the year ending 31, and this can be attributed to various factors. One of the factors that contributed to the poor performance of Renold is increased competition. The manufacturing sector is highly competitive, and Renold has to compete with other firms that supply similar products. Additionally, there was a significant increase in raw material and energy prices, which increased the cost of production for Renold. The increased cost of production led to a decrease in profit margins, which negatively impacted the performance of Renold. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and caused a decrease in demand for Renold's products.
Another factor that contributed to the poor performance of Renold is poor management decisions. Renold incurred significant costs due to the implementation of a new IT system that did not work as intended. The IT system caused a delay in the supply chain, which negatively impacted the operational efficiency of the company and led to an increase in costs. Additionally, the poor management decisions led to a decrease in employee morale, which reduced the productivity of the company.
Steps to Combat Cost Increases:
Renold has taken several steps to combat cost increases, which will help to improve the performance of the company. One of the steps that Renold has taken is the implementation of a new cost management system. The new cost management system is designed to identify areas where the company can reduce costs. The cost management system has helped the company to reduce costs by streamlining production, reducing waste, and optimizing the supply chain.
Moreover, Renold has implemented a new IT system that has improved the operational efficiency of the company. The new IT system has helped the company to reduce costs by automating processes, improving inventory management, and streamlining production. Additionally, Renold has invested in new technologies that have improved the quality of its products, reduced the cost of production, and increased its competitiveness.
Financial Performance Analysis:
In this section, we will analyze the financial performance of Renold using ten selected ratios:
1. Current Ratio: Current assets divided by current liabilities

= 0.59
The quick ratio measures the ability of a company to pay its short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets, such as cash and accounts receivable. A quick ratio of 0.59 shows that Renold may struggle to pay off its short-term liabilities without the sale of inventory.
