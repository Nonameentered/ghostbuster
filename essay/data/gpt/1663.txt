In recent years, the rapid development of media technologies has had a profound impact on the European media industry, affecting social ideas, the social economy, lifestyle, and behavior. The proliferation of digital media has transformed the way people consume and interact with news, entertainment, and advertising, leading to a proliferation of content and new business models.
The Journal of European Media and Communications Studies aims to assess the impact of these changes on the media industry and society as a whole. It will cover a range of topics, including the emergence of new media platforms, changing patterns of media consumption, the impact of digital media on political communication, and the role of media in shaping social attitudes and behaviors.
The marketing objective for the journal within the first 2 years is to establish a reputation as a leading source of research on media and communications in Europe, attracting high-quality submissions from scholars and researchers from around the world. To achieve this, the journal will need to build a strong editorial board, invest in marketing and promotion, and leverage social media and other channels to reach potential readers and subscribers.
The costs of paper, printing, and binding for a journal typically relate to the subscription price, as these expenses are a significant part of the overall production cost of a print publication. However, digital publishing has significantly reduced the costs associated with printing and distribution, allowing for more flexible pricing models and lower subscription prices. This can make the journal more accessible to a wider range of readers and help to build a larger audience over time.
