When Michel de Montaigne wrote his preface 'To the Reader' at the beginning of his Essays, he set the stage for the themes that he would explore throughout his writing. Specifically, two essays that exemplify Montaigne's core themes of the self, truth, lies, repentance, and individuals' nature are 'On Repenting' in Book III and 'On Liars' in Book I. Montaigne's writing style and language create a sense of trust with the reader and emphasizes the importance of exploring these themes.
The preface sets the groundwork for Montaigne's exploration of the self - an essential theme that runs throughout his Essays. Montaigne notes that he is, "the matter of this book" - a collection of essays that revolve around his own experiences and reflections. By this, Montaigne lays out the groundwork for the idea that his writing will be personal and introspective. He also notes that his essays may contain contradictions, as they are a reflection of his constantly evolving thoughts on the matter. Montaigne admits that he is always changing, and therefore his writing is too.
Furthermore, Montaigne's preface also highlights the theme of truth. Montaigne states that his essays are not meant to be taken as "models" of how one should think, but rather an honest reflection of his thoughts and experiences. He notes that he writes with sincerity and truthfulness, refusing to be ruled by "authority or example." This emphasis on truth sets the stage for a tone of candidness and open-mindedness throughout his Essays.
In 'On Repenting', Montaigne continues to explore the theme of the self. This essay focuses on the idea that all individuals are flawed, and that repentance is a way of acknowledging and confronting those flaws. Montaigne notes that repentance is a "self-reproach" that can lead to self-improvement. He also argues that repentance is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. By exploring the theme of repentance, Montaigne emphasizes the idea that individuals are capable of change. Additionally, Montaigne contrasts this idea with the belief in predetermined fate or destiny - a concept he doesn't subscribe to.
Montaigne's writing style is particularly effective in 'On Repenting'. He uses anecdotes or examples from history to illustrate his points, often with a humorous twist. For instance, he tells the story of a man who frequents brothels but eventually becomes so disgusted with himself that he ceases this behavior. The primary consequence of the story is that it highlights the importance of self-awareness and the capacity for change.
In 'On Liars' of Book I, Montaigne explores the theme of lies. He notes that humans, by nature, are inclined to lie, and that lying can be both harmful and beneficial. Montaigne argues that a lie can be justified in certain circumstances, such as when saving someone's life or keeping a secret that will avoid disharmony. He also urges readers to be cautious when accusing someone of lying, noting that the truth is often subjective and dependent on one's perspective. Montaigne's message is, ultimately, one of balance, arguing that the truth is important, but that one should recognize that absolute truth is often elusive.
To emphasize the importance of truth, Montaigne often uses a straightforward style in 'On Liars'. He lays out his arguments in a clear and logical fashion, using simple language that directly addresses the reader. He also notes that he has no authority on the matter of truth and lies, which reinforces his position as an honest and open-minded philosopher.
Montaigne's preface, 'To the Reader,' serves as a blueprint for his Essays and highlights the themes he explores. These themes include the self, truth, lies, repentance, and individual nature, amongst others. Additionally, his writing style and language create a sense of trust with the reader, emphasizing the importance of exploring these themes truthfully and honestly. Montaigne views the Essays as his philosophical legacy, a candid, sincere reflection of his thoughts and experiences, without imposing his views on readers. Overall, Montaigne's Essays are an invitation to the reader to engage in self-reflection; his goal, to inspire readers to consider and question their attitudes, beliefs and, ultimately, themselves.
