The wave-like behavior of electrons was investigated by the famous experiments conducted by Davisson and Germer in 1927. In these experiments, a beam of electrons was fired at a nickel crystal, and the resulting diffraction pattern was observed by a detector screen. The diffraction pattern showed that the electrons had wave-like properties, just like light waves.
To determine the mass of electrons, J.J. Thomson used his famous cathode ray tube experiment. By passing high voltage through the cathode ray tube, he observed that the negatively charged particles (electrons) were deflected by the magnetic field. Using the principles of electromagnetism, he calculated the mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) of electrons.
Sources of error in these experiments include stray electromagnetic fields, impurities in the nickel crystal, and inaccuracies in the detector screen. To account for these errors, the experiments were performed in vacuum conditions to eliminate stray electromagnetic fields. The nickel crystal used in the experiment was carefully chosen and polished to ensure the absence of impurities. The detector screen was also calibrated to provide accurate measurements.
There were also theoretical errors in interpreting the results of these experiments. The wave-particle duality of electrons was not fully understood at the time, and the resulting diffraction patterns could not be explained by classical physics. The concept of wave-particle duality emerged from these experiments, and it had a significant impact on the development of quantum mechanics.
In conclusion, the wave-like behavior of electrons and their mass were investigated through experiments by Davisson and Germer and J.J. Thomson, respectively. Sources of error were accounted for by performing experiments in vacuum conditions, carefully selecting the crystal, and calibrating the detector screen. Theoretical errors were also overcome by the emergence of the concept of wave-particle duality. These experiments and their results have had a significant impact on our understanding of the microscopic world.
