Occupational Therapy (OT) is a healthcare profession that helps individuals achieve their optimal level of functioning in their daily occupations. An occupation can be defined as any activity that a person engages in that is meaningful to them. These activities could be anything from self-care (e.g. getting dressed, bathing), leisure pursuits (e.g. sports, hobbies), work-related tasks (e.g. typing, lifting boxes), or anything else that gives life meaning.
OT is different from other health professions in that it focuses on the person's ability to engage in daily activities rather than just mitigating the symptoms of an illness or injury. While other health professions may work to cure a disease or injury, OT works to establish a person's ability to engage in their everyday occupations, improve their quality of life, and reduce the impact of their illness or injury on their daily routines.
OT uses a holistic approach to evaluate not only the person's physical abilities but also their mental, emotional, and social functioning. It recognizes the importance of a person's environment, their values, and their individualized occupational goals in developing effective treatment plans.
OT interventions can range from something as simple as modifying a task or activity to teach a person how to use adaptive equipment like shower chairs or prosthetic limbs. Some common interventions include teaching exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and endurance, implementing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to reduce anxiety and depression, and adapting environments to increase safety and accessibility.
During their studies and practices, occupational therapists may use a variety of techniques to engage their clients in meaningful occupations. One such technique is sensory integration therapy, which aims to improve a person's ability to process information from their sensory systems, and improve their behavior and overall functioning. This technique involves using everyday activities that involve sensory stimulation as a means of treatment; examples of these activities include yoga, arts and crafts, and tactile games.
Another useful technique that OTs use is manual therapy, which can be effective for managing pain and restoring range of motion in various body parts. The therapist will use their hands to manipulate joints, muscles, and soft tissue, and the client is often given instructions on exercises they can do at home to support their healing process.
Additionally, OTs may use assistive technology to help clients with disabilities or injuries to perform their daily tasks independently. Assistive technology could include items like modified pens and utensils, voice-activated computers, and adapted vehicles.
Prior experiences, such as a gap year, can be extremely helpful in pursuing a career in OT. A gap year can provide an opportunity to gain experience in related fields, such as volunteering at a hospital or working with people with disabilities. Taking a gap year can also provide time for self-reflection and personal growth, helping to clarify one's motivation and goals for pursuing a career in OT.
Furthermore, experience outside of the healthcare field, such as participating in extracurricular activities or personal hobbies, can also be beneficial. These experiences can provide valuable insights into a person's interests and passions, and help develop important skills, such as communication and teamwork.
In conclusion, occupational therapy is a unique healthcare profession that focuses on helping individuals to achieve their optimal level of functioning in their daily occupations. OT is characterized by its ability to use a holistic approach to treat individuals, and its emphasis on the person's environment, values, and individualized goals. Occupational therapists use a variety of techniques, activities and tools to engage their clients meaningfully. Prior experiences, whether in healthcare or otherwise, can be valuable in pursuing a career in OT. Ultimately, the ability to help individuals achieve personal goals, improve functioning and find meaning in life pursuits are the hallmarks of a fulfilling career in Occupational Therapy.
