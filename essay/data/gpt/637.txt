Judicial review refers to the power that courts have in reviewing the legality and constitutionality of government decisions. It is an essential tool for enforcing the rule of law and protecting individual rights. In Georges' case, there were two separate grounds for judicial review evident-factual grounds and legal grounds. The factual grounds related to a disagreement over the facts of the case, while the legal grounds related to the interpretation and application of the law. This essay will analyze both grounds and examine how courts have applied the standard of review when dealing with convention rights. Additionally, this paper will discuss the difference between the test of proportionality and the sphere of reasonable options available and examine the impact of European jurisprudence on the role of domestic judges in Georges' case.
Factual Grounds for Judicial Review in Georges' Case
Factual grounds for judicial review refer to cases where a court is asked to determine the truthfulness of the facts presented in a case. In Georges' case, the government argued that the police officers who carried out the arrest were not responsible for the injuries sustained by Georges. However, Georges disputed this, arguing that the police brutality had left him severely injured. The court had to review the factual evidence presented by both parties and determine the truthfulness of each version of events.
The standard of review for factual findings is usually one of deference. This means that the court will usually defer to the findings made by a lower court or a tribunal if those findings are reasonable, even if there may be an alternative interpretation of the facts. The reason for this approach is that courts are not equipped to make findings of fact in the same way that a tribunal or lower court might be. As such, the courts give considerable weight to the factual findings made by these other institutions.
Legal Grounds for Judicial Review in Georges' Case
Legal grounds for judicial review refer to situations where a court is asked to review a decision based on the interpretation and application of the law. In Georges' case, the legal ground for judicial review was whether the police officers' actions were consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter is a document that sets out the rights and freedoms of all Canadians and ensures that those rights are protected by the law. The Charter limits the power of the government to curtail those rights without justification.
The standard of review for legal findings is one of correctness or reasonableness. The standard of correctness means that the court determines the correct or incorrect interpretation of the law, usually in situations where there is a legal question of general importance. The standard of reasonableness means that the court determines whether the decision made by the lower court or tribunal was reasonable, given the factual circumstances of the case. In Georges' case, the court applied the standard of reasonableness as it was asked to determine whether the trial judge's decision was reasonable based on the evidence presented.
Convention Rights and Standard of Review
When dealing with convention rights, the courts have adopted a modified standard of review. Convention rights are those rights enshrined in international conventions and treaties that Canada has signed on to. These conventions include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. One of the primary goals of these conventions is to protect individual rights and ensure that governments adhere to certain principles of natural justice.
The modified standard of review for convention rights is one of proportionality, which involves a consideration of whether the government's decision is proportional to the objective it is trying to achieve. The objective must be pressing and substantial, and the decision must be rationally connected to that objective. Additionally, the decision must be the least intrusive option available, and there must be an overall balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of the state. If the government's decision fails to meet these requirements, it will be struck down as a violation of convention rights.
Difference between the Test of Proportionality and the Sphere of Reasonable Options Available
The test of proportionality differs from the sphere of reasonable options available in that the sphere of reasonable options refers to situations where there is a range of possible options that are reasonable in the circumstances. The court then determines which option is the best fit based on the available evidence. The test of proportionality, on the other hand, involves a weighing of factors and a consideration of whether the government decision is proportional to the objective it is trying to achieve.
The impact of European Jurisprudence on the Role of Domestic Judges in Georges' Case
European jurisprudence has had a significant impact on the role of domestic judges in Canada. The Charter, for example, draws heavily on the European Convention on Human Rights. In Georges' case, the court had to consider not only the Charter but also the European Convention on Human Rights and look to cases decided by European courts to inform their decision.
European jurisprudence has also influenced the way that the Canadian courts interpret and apply the law. Canadian courts often look to European decisions for guidance on how to interpret the Charter and how to balance the need for individual rights against the interests of the state. In the long run, this can lead to greater consistency in the way that individual rights are protected across countries and can help ensure that governments are kept accountable for their decisions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Georges' case involved two separate grounds for judicial review; factual grounds and legal grounds. The court applied the standard of deference to factual findings and the standard of reasonableness to legal findings. When dealing with convention rights, the court adopted a modified standard of review based on proportionality. The test of proportionality differs from the sphere of reasonable options available in that the former involves a weighing of factors, while the latter involves a consideration of which option is the best fit. Finally, European jurisprudence has had a significant impact on the role of domestic judges in Canada and has influenced both the interpretation and application of the law.
