Euripides is a master of Greek tragedy who conveyed some of the most profound and universal themes of human life through his plays. "Medea" is one such play, a dramatic masterpiece that explores the depths of human emotion and the consequences of destructive actions. The play portrays the story of a woman, Medea, who becomes enraged by her husband's betrayal and takes revenge by killing her own children along with her husband's new bride. Euripides's message in "Medea" resonates with the audience till date - the destructive power of jealousy, the complexities of human nature, and the consequences of actions taken in the heat of the moment.
The play Medea is primarily a story of a woman who is broken and is seeking revenge for an act of betrayal done upon her by her own husband. Jason, her husband, saw Medea as an obstacle to his own personal and political ambitions. He sought a marriage with the daughter of the King of Corinth in order to cement his power in the region. However, this act—of wedding someone else—was a betrayal that Medea could not abide, and she became determined to take revenge on Jason.
Euripides presents Medea as an intelligent and resourceful woman who is driven to take revenge on her husband. Rather than portraying her as a supernatural monster-like figure, he makes her a complex character. From the very start of the play, the audience is given an insight into her character. She is portrayed as both a victim and a villain – in equal parts. While she is aware of what she is doing, her own pain and anger at Jason's betrayal cause her to commit heinous crimes.
It is understandable that Medea feels betrayed and abandoned. She has left everything behind for Jason - has killed her own brother for his sake, borne him children, and is now being cast aside like an old rag for someone new. The pain that she feels is very real, and one can sympathize with her. However, the extreme lengths that she goes to, to exact her revenge, make her a complex and multi-layered character. 
Medea's actions are brutal, she murders her own children to inflict maximum pain on Jason as he has to live with the guilt of the heinous act she has committed.  Such an act is something that can never be reconciled with, let alone understood. However, her actions need to be examined in the context of the societal norms of her time. In Athens, women were powerless, second class citizens with very few rights. Medea was not just a wronged wife, she was also a foreigner in a strange land, with no support from anyone – not even the gods. At that time, a woman of Medea's stature had no other recourse but violence if she wanted to be heard and to seek justice.
Another element that makes Medea a complex character is her status as a sorceress. Euripides gives Medea access to supernatural powers, making her capable of hurting Jason in ways that his physical power could not match. This adds an interesting dimension to Medea's character. Is she a character of the ancient world, who has been granted supernatural abilities to exact her revenge? Or is she a powerful modern woman, who is carving out her own path and demanding respect and attention from those around her?
The underlying message communicated through the story of Medea is the destructive nature of jealousy. Medea is consumed by jealousy and this causes her to take extreme actions that have severe consequences. Her actions are so devastating that they lead to the destruction of an entire household. Euripides illustrates how deeply jealous rage can impact an individual's decision making abilities and make them incapable of thinking rationally and logically. Jealousy is not just destructive to the one affected by it but can have far-reaching consequences.
Euripides also draws attention to the fact that women at the time did not have any recourse to justice and were often powerless. It is unfortunate that even today, women in some parts of the world are still struggling to be heard and to stand at an equal footing with men. Today, a Medea-like character would have many avenues to seek justice, but in her time, living in a patriarchal society where women's voices were silenced, the only recourse left for Medea was to take matters into her own hands.
In conclusion, Euripides brings to light the dangerous consequences of jealousy in “Medea,” and how embracing it can lead one to act in destructive ways. The author also highlights the difficulties that a woman would face in ancient times when mistreated by the men in her life. Medea is a complex character, who deserves to be understood not just as a vengeful character depicted through a supernatural lens, but as a woman who has been wronged in a society where her voice has been silenced. The audience can sympathize with her plight, even if her actions are not justifiable. Medea remains a timeless classic that still captivates and resonates with audiences today.
