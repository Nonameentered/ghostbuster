Humor has been used by humans since time immemorial. It has been a tool for breaking the ice, spreading joy, relieving stress, and entertaining the masses. Humor has been used in various mediums, such as literature, drama, stand-up comedy, and sitcoms. Among these mediums, sitcoms have been the most popular and prolific. The American sitcom "Friends" is a prime example of a show that has achieved great success by using humor effectively. Sitcoms use various pragmatic frameworks, such as Grice's conversational maxims, Brown and Levinson's Politeness theory, and Leech's Politeness Maxims to achieve the expected humor effect in their scripts. In this essay, we will analyze the chosen script from the American sitcom "Friends" to understand the peculiarities of humor used.
Grice's conversational maxims are the guiding principles behind successful communication. The four maxims are the Maxim of Quantity, the Maxim of Quality, the Maxim of Relevance, and the Maxim of Manner. The Maxim of Quantity states that speakers should provide the right amount of information needed for a communication to occur. The Maxim of Quality states that speakers should only say what they believe to be true. The Maxim of Relevance states that speakers should only discuss topics that are relevant to the conversation. The Maxim of Manner states that speakers should communicate in a clear and concise manner. The use of these maxims is crucial to the production of sitcoms.
In the chosen script from "Friends," the use of the Maxim of Manner is apparent. In an episode titled "The One Where Chandler Can't Cry," Chandler appears to be upset but can't cry. When questioned about it, he says, "You know, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be open here, but it's not like it's easy to just go from being completely closed off to sharing everything with someone. I wish it was, but it's not." Chandler's use of negative phrasing is a clear example of how ignoring Grice's Maxims can lead to humor. Instead of saying, "I find it difficult to express my emotions," he uses a double negative to say, "it's not like it's easy to just go from being completely closed off to sharing everything." This lack of clarity and adherence to the principle of manner in his communication leads to unintended humor.
Brown and Levinson's Politeness theory suggests that speakers use politeness strategies to achieve their goals while being mindful of how their language usage can affect the listener's self-esteem. The theory suggests that politeness strategies are often used in situations of uncertainty or imbalanced power dynamics. The strategies include positive politeness, negative politeness, bald-on-record, and off-record communication.
In the chosen script from "Friends," Joey displays an understanding of the principle of positive politeness. When Chandler asks him to watch a sad movie with him, Joey replies, "Yeah. That's what friends do! They support each other in depressing times." Joey's use of a positive, supportive phrase is an example of how positive politeness can be used to create humor in a tense situation. The humor comes from the ironic use of positive politeness in the context of watching a sad movie.
Leech's Politeness Maxims suggest that speakers use various linguistic devices to achieve politeness in their communication. The six maxims are the Maxim of Tact, the Maxim of Generosity, the Maxim of Approbation, the Maxim of Modesty, the Maxim of Agreement, and the Maxim of Sympathy.
In the chosen script from "Friends," Monica's use of the Maxim of Agreement is evident. When Chandler apologizes for not being able to cry, Monica replies, "It's okay. It's not like it's that big of a deal." Monica's use of the phrase "It's not like it's that big of a deal" is an example of the Maxim of Agreement, where she is trying to lessen the impact of Chandler's insecurities. This use of language leads to humor when Chandler humorously responds, "Well, if it's not a big deal, could you leave the room for a second? I'd like to cry now."
In conclusion, sitcoms use various pragmatic frameworks, such as Grice's conversational maxims, Brown and Levinson's Politeness theory, and Leech's Politeness Maxims to achieve the expected humor effect in their scripts. The chosen script from the American sitcom "Friends" demonstrates how these frameworks can be used to achieve unexpected humor in the dialogues. The use of negative phrasing and positive politeness create humor, while the use of the Maxim of Agreement leads to unexpected humor. Understanding these pragmatic frameworks is crucial to creating successful and entertaining sitcoms, and "Friends" is a prime example of how humor can be used effectively to engage the audience.
