Tinea capitis is a fungal infection that affects the scalp, hair, and the adjacent skin. This condition is common in children but can also affect adults. Tinea capitis is also known as scalp ringworm, and it is caused by several different species of fungi, mainly Trichophyton and Microsporum. The fungus that causes tinea capitis thrives in warm, humid environments, making it an infectious condition that can easily spread from one person to another. The infection can present in several clinical patterns, including diffuse scaling, a patchy scaly plaque, or a single bald spot with scaly edges. This paper discusses the clinical patterns, differential diagnoses, and treatment options for tinea capitis.
Differential Diagnoses for a Diffuse Distribution of Scale on the Scalp
A diffuse distribution of scale on the scalp can be a sign of different conditions. Other diagnoses that usually come to mind when presented with this symptom include psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, alopecia areata, and drug reactions. Besides, there are other less common conditions that can mimic tinea capitis, such as lichen planopilaris, discoid lupus erythematosus, scalp folliculitis, and bacterial folliculitis.
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects about 2 to 3% of the population. This condition causes thick, scaly plaques on the scalp, elbows, knees, and other areas of the body. In psoriasis, the scales are usually thicker than those seen in tinea capitis, and the affected skin shows more erythema and plaque formation. Unlike tinea capitis, psoriasis does not typically cause hair loss.
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that affects the scalp, face, and other oily areas of the body. It is characterized by redness, itching, and flaking of the skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can cause diffuse scaling on the scalp, like tinea capitis. However, it tends to produce thicker and greasier scales than those seen in tinea capitis, and the rash is often associated with yellowish or grayish crusting in the affected area.
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that affects the hair follicles, causing bald patches to develop spontaneously on the scalp or other areas of the body. The hair loss caused by alopecia areata is usually sudden and patchy. Unlike tinea capitis, the affected areas of the scalp do not exhibit scaling or inflammation.
Drug reactions can also cause scaling of the scalp. Some medications, such as lithium and antiepileptics, can cause a diffuse rash that mimics tinea capitis. This rash usually resolves after stopping the medication.
Lichen planopilaris is an inflammatory condition that leads to permanent hair loss due to the destruction of hair follicles. It can present with erythematous, scaly plaques on the scalp or bald patches with scaly borders. Lichen planopilaris is usually treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy and topical steroids.
Discoid lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune condition that causes scaly, coin-shaped lesions on the scalp and skin. The lesions often leave scars, and the affected hair follicles may be permanently destroyed, leading to hair loss. The condition requires treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents.
Scalp folliculitis, also known as acne necrotica, is an inflammatory condition that affects the hair follicles. It results in pustules and papules that can coalesce into painful nodules. Scalp folliculitis can mimic tinea capitis, particularly in the initial stages, but it responds well to topical steroids and oral antibiotics.
Bacterial folliculitis is a bacterial infection of the hair follicles. It can cause pustules, papules, or crusts on the scalp that can be mistaken for tinea capitis. The condition usually responds well to oral antibiotics.
Clinical Patterns of Tinea Capitis
The clinical presentation of tinea capitis can range from mild to severe, depending on the species of fungus that causes the infection. Causative organisms include Microsporum canis, Trichophyton violaceum, Trichophyton tonsurans, and others.
The most common pattern of tinea capitis is diffuse scaling of the scalp. This pattern is caused by the infection of the hair shafts by Trichophyton tonsurans. In this pattern, the affected scalp is scaly and itchy, and the scales can resemble dandruff, but are usually larger and thicker. The hair may be broken or brittle, and there may be patchy hair loss without visible inflammation.
Another pattern of tinea capitis is the black dot pattern. This pattern is caused by the fungus Trichophyton violaceum. In this pattern, the hair follicles are infected, resulting in the formation of black dots at the base of the hair shaft. The black dots are due to the fact that the fungus destroys the part of the hair shaft that is closest to the scalp, thus making the hair appear as if it were cut short. The black dots are surrounded by an erythematous halo, which makes them more visible. The affected scalp is also itchy, and there can be scaling and crusting.
The kerion pattern is a severe form of tinea capitis that is caused by the fungus Microsporum canis. In this pattern, the infection spreads to the surrounding skin, causing inflammation, swelling, and pus-filled, painful nodules. The affected hair may be loose and easy to pull out. The kerion pattern is usually associated with marked lymph node enlargement, due to the severe inflammatory response elicited by the fungus.
The last pattern of tinea capitis is the inflammatory pattern. In this pattern, the affected area is reddish in color, inflamed and crusted. The hair is matted and there may be pus-filled blisters. This pattern can be caused by several species of fungi.
Treatment Options for Tinea Capitis
Tinea capitis is usually treated with oral antifungal medications that are taken for several weeks. The medication of choice depends on the causative organism. Griseofulvin is the medication of choice for Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton violaceum, while terbinafine is the preferred medication for Microsporum canis. There are other medications available, such as itraconazole and fluconazole, but they are not preferred first-line agents.
Topical antifungal medications are usually not effective for tinea capitis because the fungus penetrates deeply into the hair shafts. However, topical agents can be used as an adjunct to oral therapy to reduce the risk of contagion. Selenium sulfide, ketoconazole shampoo, and ciclopirox shampoo can be used topically to help control and prevent the spread of the infection.
Oral antibiotics may be required to treat secondary bacterial infections that can complicate tinea capitis. Topical steroids can be used to manage the inflammation associated with the kerion pattern of tinea capitis, but they should be used with caution, as they can exacerbate the underlying fungal infection.
Prevention of tinea capitis involves good hygiene and avoiding close contact with infected persons or animals. Regular washing with shampoo and soap can also help prevent the infection. If a family member or a pet is diagnosed with tinea capitis, it is recommended that others in the household be checked for signs of infection.
Conclusion
Tinea capitis is a common fungal infection that affects the scalp and hair follicles. It is caused by several species of fungi, and the clinical presentation depends on the causative organism. The most common pattern of tinea capitis is diffuse scaling, but other patterns include the black dot pattern, the kerion pattern, and the inflammatory pattern. Differential diagnoses that should be considered include psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, alopecia areata, and drug reactions. The treatment of tinea capitis involves oral antifungal medications, topical antifungal agents, and sometimes the use of oral antibiotics or topical steroids. Regular washing and good hygiene can help prevent the infection.
