Love is a complex and intricate emotion that has been explored and represented throughout history in various forms of art, including literature. This is particularly evident in Jane Austen's Emma and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, two works that present parallel and contrasting perspectives of love and courtship, and the role of dancing in this process. Ultimately, through the development of their central romantic relationships, both authors reveal the inherent complexities and challenges of love, highlighting how the expression of this emotion is influenced by social norms, power dynamics, and personal desires.
Dancing is a central motif in both Austen and Goethe's work, serving as a medium through which the courtship and emotional connection between characters are developed and explored. In Emma, dancing is presented as a social occasion, where the rules and conventions of polite society are enforced and expectations of appropriate behavior are established. This is evident in the opening scene of the novel, where the polite conversation of the characters is set to the background of a country dance. As the novel progresses, dance becomes a means of communication between the characters, allowing them to express themselves and their feelings non-verbally. For example, Emma's refusal to dance with Mr. Elton is a means of expressing her disinterest in him, while her willingness to dance with Frank Churchill symbolizes her attraction to him. Similarly, Mr. Knightley's invitation to dance with Emma demonstrates his growing admiration and love for her.
In contrast, in The Sorrows of Young Werther, dancing is portrayed as a more personal and emotional experience, where the individual is granted the freedom to express their emotions and desires. This is exemplified in Werther's participation in a village dance, where he is captivated by the beauty and sensuality of Lotte, the object of his affection. In comparison to the rigid social expectations of Austen's world, dance in Goethe's work symbolizes a moment of freedom and release from the established social norms and conventions. As Werther becomes increasingly obsessed with Lotte, the pair's dancing takes on a more intimate and charged tone, ultimately leading to the development of a romantic relationship.
Despite the similarities in the use of dance to develop romantic relationships in both works, Austen and Goethe's portrayal of love and courtship differs significantly. In Emma, the development of the central romantic relationships is grounded in common social and economic interests; the characters' shared social status and financial stability are essential requisites for a successful union. The marriage between Mr. Knightley and Emma is ultimately a result of their mutual respect and affection for each other, combined with a shared social status and similar economic interests. Similarly, the relationship between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill is doomed to fail because of the difference in social status and wealth.
In contrast, in The Sorrows of Young Werther, love is depicted as an intense emotional experience, one that is often at odds with established social and cultural expectations. Werther's infatuation with Lotte, a woman who is already engaged to another man, highlights the complex and often conflicting emotions and desires associated with love. In this work, love is portrayed as an emotional journey, one that involves a deep search for meaning and emotional fulfillment. As Werther becomes increasingly obsessed with Lotte, his desire for her becomes the driving force behind his existence, leading to his eventual descent into madness.
Furthermore, Austen and Goethe's portrayal of love is also heavily influenced by power dynamics, particularly concerning gender. In Emma, the male characters are often portrayed as having a more socially and economically dominant position than their female counterparts. This is evident in the relationship between Mr. Knightley and Emma, where Mr. Knightley's social position and economic stability grant him a certain level of power and influence over Emma. Similarly, in Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill's relationship, Frank's wealth, and social status give him a certain level of power and control over Jane.
Contrastingly, in The Sorrows of Young Werther, Werther's obsession with Lotte is grounded in his desire for female agency and empowerment. Werther's love for Lotte is based on her independence and ability to reject established social norms in favor of her own desires. As Werther becomes increasingly obsessed with her, Lotte becomes a symbol of his desire for personal freedom and genuine emotional connection.
In conclusion, both Austen and Goethe's work explores the complexities of love and courtship, highlighting the role of dance in developing romantic relationships. Through their portrayal of the central romantic relationships and the inherent social and cultural dynamics that shape these relationships, both authors provide compelling perspectives on the nature of love, and the challenges associated with expressing this emotion. Ultimately, Austen and Goethe's work serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring and inextricable relationship between love and human experience, and the profound influence that social and cultural expectations have on this emotion's expression and development.
