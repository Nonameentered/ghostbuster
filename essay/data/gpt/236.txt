Proteins are the building blocks of life and they are involved in almost every process within living organisms. Understanding protein structure and function is vital for many research areas, including drug discovery and disease treatment. Two important techniques used to isolate and identify proteins are gel electrophoresis and western blotting. In this essay, we will discuss the techniques of gel electrophoresis and western blotting, how they are used to isolate and identify proteins, and examine an experiment that analyzes glutathione-S-transferase (GST). We will also touch on the challenges of expressing foreign proteins in prokaryotic cells and differences between transcription and translation promoter sequences in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Gel electrophoresis is a technique that separates proteins based on their size and charge. The protein sample is loaded onto a gel, which is usually made of polyacrylamide or agarose. A voltage is applied across the gel, causing the proteins to migrate towards the positive electrode. Smaller, negatively charged proteins move faster through the gel than larger, positively charged proteins. Once the proteins have separated, the gel can be stained with a dye such as Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands.
Western blotting is a technique that uses antibodies to detect specific proteins. After the proteins have been separated by gel electrophoresis, they are transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. The membrane is then incubated with primary antibodies that bind to the target protein. Secondary antibodies that are conjugated to an enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase, are added to the membrane. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction that produces a visual signal, such as chemiluminescence or fluorescence, which can be captured using X-ray film or a scanner.
An experiment that utilizes both gel electrophoresis and western blotting to analyze GST is as follows:
First, the protein sample is prepared. The sample is mixed with a loading buffer that contains a reducing agent to break any disulfide bonds and a detergent to denature the proteins. The sample is then heated to 95Â°C for 5 minutes to ensure complete denaturation.
Next, the sample is loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel. The gel contains a series of wells that are formed by a comb. The protein sample is loaded into the wells, and an electric current is applied to the gel to separate the proteins based on their size and charge.
Once the proteins have been separated, the gel is removed from the apparatus and placed onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins are transferred to the membrane by applying a current across the gel and membrane.
After transferring the proteins, the membrane is washed and incubated with primary antibodies to GST. The primary antibodies bind specifically to GST.
The membrane is then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies that are conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The secondary antibodies bind to the primary antibodies, forming a sandwich complex. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction that produces a signal that can be detected by chemiluminescence or fluorescence.
The results of the experiment are visualized on X-ray film or a scanner as bands on the membrane. The position of the band indicates the molecular weight of the protein, and the intensity of the band indicates the amount of protein present in the sample.
Foreign proteins can be difficult to express in prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli, because they lack the post-translational machinery that is present in eukaryotes. Many eukaryotic proteins require modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation, that cannot be replicated in prokaryotes. Additionally, certain proteins may be toxic to the host cell, or they may form inclusion bodies that are difficult to solubilize.
Transcription and translation promoter sequences also differ between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the promoter sequence is located upstream of the transcription start site and usually contains multiple cis-acting elements that are recognized by transcription factors. In contrast, prokaryotic promoter sequences are located upstream of the transcription start site and consist of a consensus sequence and a -10 and -35 region that are recognized by RNA polymerase.
In conclusion, gel electrophoresis and western blotting are powerful techniques used to isolate and identify proteins. An experiment that analyzes GST using these techniques involves preparing the sample, separating the proteins by gel electrophoresis, transferring the proteins to a membrane, and incubating the membrane with primary and secondary antibodies. Challenges arise when attempting to express foreign proteins in prokaryotic cells due to the lack of post-translational machinery and differences in promoter sequences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Despite these challenges, gel electrophoresis and western blotting remain essential tools in the study of protein structure and function.
