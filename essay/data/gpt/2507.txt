Cranial modification, the process of intentionally altering the shape of the skull, has been a practice in various societies throughout history. The methodologies, as well as the cultures in which it takes place, can be quite diverse. Cranial modification can be seen as a form of body art or a symbol of social status and cultural significance. However, it can also be mistaken for pathological conditions that result in similar appearances. This essay will examine the practice of intentional cranial modification and how it can be distinguished from pathological conditions resulting in similar appearances.
The practice of intentional cranial modification dates back to various civilizations, ranging from prehistoric societies to more modern ones. In South America, the pre-Inca culture of the Paracas people, for example, utilized head binding to elongate the skull, giving it a conical shape. Similarly, the Mayan civilization in Central America also practiced cranial modification, wherein a board was bound to the forehead, causing it to flatten. This was believed to be a sign of nobility and high social status. 
In Africa, the Mangbetu people would wrap the heads of newborns tightly with cloth, resulting in a narrow and elongated skull shape. Egypt is also known for cranial modification practices, which they performed for cosmetic and cultural reasons to resemble gods. In Europe, the practice was common in ancient Greece, Phrygia, and Carthage. 
The methodology for cranial modification varies depending on the culture and historical period. The Mangbetu people, for example, would tightly wrap the heads of newborns with raffia cloth, changing it every few days for the first year of life. In contrast to this, the Paracas people of South America used wooden boards that were bound to the heads of infants, helping to create a conical shape. Similarly, the Mayan civilization bound a flat board to the forehead during infancy, causing it to flatten.
The practice of cranial modification can be attributed to various factors, including social status and cultural significance. In ancient Egypt, the practice of cranial modification was known to transform human beings into deities, a practice closely connected with religion. In South America, the Paracas people who were known to modify their skulls, believed that deformed skulls were a symbol of social and religious status. They believed that the gods had elongated heads, so by doing so, they could become closer to these gods and have a higher social position.
In addition to cultural significance, the final shape of the skull can also be influenced by the deforming apparatus used by the society, and the length of time it is used. The Mangbetu peopleâ€™s elongated heads were achieved through tightly wrapping the heads with raffia cloth, which would over time reshape the skull. In Egypt, various techniques were used including creating a conical shape, and the use of head cones to elongate the skull in a process known as cranial compression. The final shape of the skull was achieved by applying pressure on the skull plate during adolescence, with some cultures using boards up to several years.
Despite the cultural significance and methodology of cranial modification, it can be easily mistaken with pathological conditions that result in similar appearances. Pathological conditions like craniosynostosis, a condition in which growth plates in the skull close prematurely leading to an abnormal head shape can be similar to those who have intentionally modified their skulls. It is important to distinguish these conditions from intentional modifications through various measures.
In the case of craniosynostosis, there are a few characteristics that are distinct from intentional modifications. Children with craniosynostosis tend to have cranial deformities that are not typical of intentional modification, such as bulging or sunken fissures. Intentional modification also usually involves a change in the overall shape of the skull, whereas craniosynostosis only affects specific parts of the skull.
Misinterpretation of abnormal skulls can lead to further studies and testing, and it is important to perform a differential diagnosis. For example, CT scans can be used to distinguish different types of cranial modifications and their potential pathological conditions. Multiple tomographic reconstructions can provide crucial information about the health of the skull structures, helping to differentiate between intentional and pathological cranial modifications. Genetic testing can be used to diagnose craniosynostosis by monitoring genes that direct bone development.
In conclusion, the practice of intentional cranial modification is an ancient practice that takes on various forms throughout history. It is a sign of social status and cultural significance, with the final shape of the skull being influenced by the deforming apparatus used and the length of time it is used. However, it is important to distinguish intentional modifications from pathological conditions that result in similar appearances through testing and diagnoses. The misinterpretation of abnormal skulls can lead to further confusion, and proper differential diagnosis techniques need to be employed.
