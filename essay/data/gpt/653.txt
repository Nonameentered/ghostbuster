The -lactam antibiotics are a class of drugs that are widely used to treat bacterial infections. The mechanism of action of these antibiotics is to inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, which leads to the death of the bacteria. The -lactams are able to inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall because they are able to bind to and inactivate the enzymes that are responsible for synthesizing the cell wall. The purpose of this essay is to examine the mechanism of action of -lactams, how they inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, how -lactamases affect the activity of -lactams, and how the inactivity of -lactamases towards peptides and peptidoglycan can be exploited in -lactam synthesis. Additionally, this essay will explore some possible explanations for why mimetic peptides have shown low levels of inhibition against DD-peptidases in other investigations.
The cell wall is an essential component of bacterial cells and provides structural support, protection, and prevents them from bursting due to the osmotic pressure. The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan, which is a polymer of sugars and peptides, that is cross-linked by transpeptidase enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The -lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, have a common structural feature, a -lactam ring that gives them their name, and is responsible for their antimicrobial activity. The -lactams are able to inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidase enzymes of the bacterial cell wall.
The -lactam ring of the antibiotic molecule mimics the structure of the D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) moiety of the peptidoglycan precursor that the transpeptidase enzymes recognize and bind to. The -lactams therefore bind to the active site of the transpeptidase enzymes and block the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. This leads to a weakening of the cell wall, and eventually failure, causing bacterial cells to lyse and die.
The primary target of -lactams is the transpeptidase enzyme, PBPs, which play a vital role in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. PBPs are responsible for the cross-linking of the sugar-peptide chains that make up the peptidoglycan layer. The -lactam antibiotics bind to the active site of the PBP enzyme, inactivating it, which leads to the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis and ultimately lysis of the bacterial cell.
The -lactams are further categorized into two types; narrow-spectrum and wide-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics target a specific type of bacteria while wide-spectrum antibiotics target a broad range of bacteria. These categories are important to consider when prescribing -lactams in order to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.
However, not all -lactams are effective against bacteria due to the presence of enzymes called -lactamases. These are bacterial enzymes that are able to hydrolyze the -lactam ring in -lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective in inhibiting the transpeptidase enzymes required for peptidoglycan synthesis. -lactamases are usually plasmid-encoded, which enables bacteria to readily transfer resistance genes between one another.
To overcome the activity of -lactamases, novel -lactam antibiotics have been developed that are resistant to degradation by these enzymes. These newer -lactams possess bulky side chains or chemical modifications on the -lactam ring itself, which alter the configuration of the -lactam ring and make it resistant to hydrolysis by -lactamases. An example of such a modification is the addition of a methyl or methylene group to the -lactam ring, producing methicillin and cefoxitin respectively.
Moreover, one can also exploit the inactivity of -lactamase towards peptides and peptidoglycan by developing mimetic peptides. Peptide inhibitors that mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala substrate have been developed that selectively inhibit the transpeptidase activity of PBPs, without triggering the hydrolytic activity of -lactamases. These mimetic peptides are unable to be hydrolyzed by -lactamases because they lack the -lactam ring structure. The mimetic peptides thus operate by fitting into the active site of the PBP enzyme and competing with the D-Ala-D-Ala precursor, thus inhibiting the transpeptidase activity.
However, mimetic peptides have shown low levels of inhibition against DD-peptidases in other investigations. DD-peptidases are another class of enzymes that are involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. DD-peptidases are able to cleave the peptide backbone between two D-Ala residues from the peptidoglycan layer. It has been reported that despite effective inhibition of transpeptidase activity, peptide inhibitors have shown poor inhibition against DD-peptidases, and the reason for this is not fully understood.
One of the possible reasons for the low levels of inhibition of mimetic peptides against DD-peptidases is associated with differences in the active site structure of DD-peptidases and PBPs. It is possible that the differences in the active site structure result in differential specificity for the D-Ala-D-Ala precursor and the mimetic peptide inhibitor. Shortcomings in the development of mimetic peptides may limit their selectivity and the ability to fully mimic the structure of the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety. Therefore, efforts to improve their selectivity through modifications in the structure will be essential.
To conclude, -lactams are antibiotics that specifically target bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidase enzymes necessary for peptidoglycan formation. The -lactams work by mimicking the D-Ala-D-Ala structure and binding to transpeptidase enzymes, thereby preventing them from cross-linking the sugar-peptide layer of the cell wall. The development of -lactamases compromise the activity of -lactams against bacteria, leading to the generation of antibiotic resistance. The inactivity of -lactamases towards peptides and peptidoglycan can be exploited using mimetic peptides. Despite this, mimetic peptides have lower levels of inhibition against DD-peptidases, highlighting the need to further explore and optimize these chemical mimetics. Proper understanding of the mechanism of -lactams and their derivatives is important as it paves the way for the development of more potent and selective antibiotics, enables the classification of existing antibiotics, and assists in designing drug combination therapies that can overcome bacterial resistance.
