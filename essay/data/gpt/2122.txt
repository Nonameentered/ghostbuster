The purpose of this coursework is to provide students with an understanding of binary trees and their implementation. To complete this coursework, students need to understand the basic structure of binary trees and their applications. Binary trees are used in this project as a data structure to represent data in a hierarchical manner. They serve the function of organizing data in an efficient and searchable manner. Different methods of traversal, such as preorder, inorder, and postorder, can be used to traverse the tree. Each method has its own benefits depending on the data we are searching for. The bonus requirement for the project is the implementation of a balanced binary tree, which can be achieved using various algorithms such as AVL or Red-Black.
