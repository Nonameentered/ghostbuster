Introduction
John Locke is a prominent philosopher of the seventeenth century, and his ideas about liberty, political sovereignty, and rights have greatly influenced modern political theory. Central to Locke's political philosophy is the concept of consent, which he believes to be necessary for legitimate political authority. In his theory, there are two types of consent: tacit and express. Tacit consent refers to the situation where individuals abide by the laws of the state and accept its authority implicitly through their actions, while express consent is an explicit agreement made by an individual to enter into a political community. Despite the usefulness of his theory, it has some flaws and omissions that make it somewhat inadequate and inapplicable in the modern world.
The Flaws and Omissions in Locke's Theory of Tacit and Express Consent
1. The Problem of Informed Consent
Locke's theory of consent is based on the assumption of informed consent. However, the problem with this assumption is that individuals may not always make decisions based on complete information. In most cases, individuals are not aware of the full implications of their actions, and this can lead to unintended consequences. For example, a person may tacitly consent to a particular policy, not realizing its unintended consequences or the negative impact it has on their lives.
Moreover, Locke's theory does not take into account the possibility of coercion, manipulation, or fraud in the consent process. The society in which we live is often characterized by subtle coercion: social norms, subtle pressure, and the unequal distribution of resources that can influence people's decisions. This raises the question of whether individuals genuinely consent to the political arrangements that exist, or whether they are unwittingly coerced into accepting them.
2. The Problem of Alienation
Another flaw in Locke's theory is that it assumes that individuals can withdraw consent at any time. This assumption neglects the possibility that individuals may be in situations where they cannot leave a particular political arrangement. For example, people who face systemic discrimination, such as racial, ethnic or gender minorities, may be unable to withdraw their consent without suffering serious consequences.
Moreover, Locke's theory seems to overlook the fact that individuals are often born into political societies without ever giving their explicit consent to be ruled by them. For instance, a person born in a particular state never had the opportunity to express their consent to the social contract at birth. 
3. The Problem of Collective Consent
The theory of tacit and express consent is mostly concerned with individual consent. However, it's worth noting that political communities are often composed of groups with varied interests that may not always align. The question then arises, can the consent of one group represent the consent of all? 
Locke's theory could be addressing this issue indirectly by arguing that political authority should be based on the consent of the majority. However, this brings its exclusionary policies and the danger of the oppression of minorities, which violates the principle of individual liberty. 
4. The Problem of Continuity
The theory of tacit and express consent doesn't address the issue of political transitions, especially the transfer of power in cases of revolution or societal chaos. In such cases, it's unclear how tacit or registered consent can be transferred to new systems or power arrangements. 
Moreover, Locke's theory seems to imply that consent should remain static and unchanging over time, regardless of circumstances. For instance, the theory doesn't address how people's consent can change in times of peace and war, or during economic insecurity. 
5. The Problem of Plausible Deniability
Finally, Locke's theory doesn't account for the issue of plausible deniability, where people may claim they didn't consent to a particular policy or state of affairs when it becomes unfavorable to them. This creates an issue of accountability that is problematic in cases where many people are involved. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, despite its usefulness, Locke's theory of tacit and express consent has some flaws and omissions that make it somewhat inadequate and inapplicable in the modern world. Some of the flaws, such as the problem of informed consent, the problem of alienation, and the problem of continuity, make the theory less applicable to modern political struggles. To overcome these flaws, theorists need to be more attentive to the nuances of power and decision-making, and they need to incorporate more sophisticated models for understanding political transitions, individual autonomy, and collective agency.
