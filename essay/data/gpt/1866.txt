In recent years, Germany has been exploring whether to introduce a smoking ban for all enclosed public places, including pubs and nightclubs. Some argue that such a ban would infringe on personal freedoms, while others contend that it is necessary for public health. Ultimately, I believe that Germany should introduce a smoking ban for all enclosed public places for several reasons: protecting young people from the harms of smoking, reducing the danger of second-hand smoke for non-smokers, and potentially leading to positive improvements for businesses and the economy.
One argument against a smoking ban in Germany is that it would infringe on personal freedoms. Many people believe that they should be allowed to do as they please in public spaces, including smoking. However, personal freedoms are not absolute and must be balanced against the rights of others. Smoking is not only harmful to the smoker, but it also poses major health risks to non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. In public places such as pubs and nightclubs, where people are gathered in close quarters, this danger is especially great. Additionally, the negative effects of smoking extend beyond individual health risks and can have wider societal implications, such as placing a strain on healthcare systems.
Another argument against a smoking ban in Germany is that it would be difficult to enforce. Enforcement may require significant resources and could be complicated by the fact that many pubs and nightclubs rely on tobacco sales for a significant portion of their revenue. However, this argument ignores the fact that many countries have successfully implemented smoking bans and that Germany itself has already enacted smoking regulations in some public spaces. In addition, the benefits of a smoking ban—such as improved public health and reduced healthcare costs—may outweigh the implementation burdens.
Furthermore, some may argue that smoking bans could lead to a decrease in business for pubs and nightclubs. However, research has shown that these fears are unfounded. In fact, smoking bans have been associated with increased patronage in bars and restaurants. A study published in the Journal of Public Economics found that after smoking bans were implemented in New York City, bar and restaurant sales increased by 11.5%. Similar effects have been found in other countries, such as Scotland and Ireland, which implemented smoking bans in 2006 and 2004, respectively. 
Moreover, a smoking ban would have benefits beyond just improving public health and increasing business for pubs and nightclubs—it could also help to protect young people from the harms of smoking. The World Health Organization reports that tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, killing 8 million people annually. Furthermore, while smoking rates have been declining among adults, they remain high among youth. According to the German Federal Center for Health Education, 9% of German adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 are regular smokers, while 28% have tried smoking at least once. By implementing a smoking ban in public places, Germany would send a clear message to young people that smoking is harmful and not socially acceptable.
Finally, a smoking ban would also help to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens, and can have detrimental effects on the health of those exposed to it. By implementing a smoking ban in all public places, Germany would ensure that non-smokers are not exposed to these harmful chemicals while going about their daily lives.
In conclusion, while some may argue that a smoking ban would infringe on personal freedoms and would be difficult to enforce, I believe that the potential benefits of such a ban outweigh these concerns. A smoking ban would help to protect young people from the harms of smoking, reduce the danger of second-hand smoke for non-smokers, and potentially lead to positive improvements for businesses and the economy. Therefore, Germany should take steps to implement a smoking ban for all enclosed public places, including pubs and nightclubs, as soon as possible.
