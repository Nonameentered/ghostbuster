There has always been a strong debate regarding the practice of euthanasia in medical science. Euthanasia, which refers to the deliberate ending of life to reduce pain and suffering, has been one of the most controversial medical issues over the past few decades. Several medical professionals, patients, and society have continued to question whether euthanasia should be sanctioned or prohibited in medical practice. The term euthanasia comes from the Greek language, which means "easy death." This practice has been debated in various countries for various reasons. It involves multiple forms of medical assistance to hasten death, such as lethal injection, physician-assisted suicide, or withdrawal of life-sustaining support.
Euthanasia involves terminating an individual's life to alleviate their pain and suffering, which brings up several ethical and moral questions. On one hand, several medical experts argue that euthanasia is morally justified since it enhances patients' autonomy and enhances their dignity and choice to end their lives. On the other hand, some people argue that euthanasia is incompatible with the principles and values of the medical practice and crossing the boundary of Hippocratic Oath, which swear to do no harm.
Medical professionals are supposed to follow the four fundamental concepts of the medical practice, namely autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles guide clinicians in providing adequate treatment to their patients. Therefore, the issue of euthanasia in medicine raises several ethical problems regarding these principles. For instance, regarding the principle of beneficence, medical practitioners should always act in the best interest of their patients. However, in the case of euthanasia, doctors might be forced to act contrary to what they believe in and end the patient's life to alleviate pain and suffering. This violates the principle as the doctor is initiating an action that leads to death prematurely.
Furthermore, euthanasia raises a constitutional debate regarding the "right to die." According to Dame Cecily Saunders, the founder of the Hospice movement, palliative care should be the primary option for individuals suffering from chronic pain and terminal illness instead of euthanasia. Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life for patients facing chronic illness, rather than euthanizing them. People who feel their lives are unbearable, patients in chronic pain and suffering from terminal diseases, may prefer the use of euthanasia as a way to end their lives. As a result, euthanasia could be seen as enabling the rights of patients who desire the option of hastening their deaths by the clinical practitioner. 
However, there is concern about the potential burden created by the logistics and emotional toll on the doctor who prescribes the medication, and the psychological and emotional effects on individuals who assist in the procedure of ending a patient's life. It is essential to consider the emotional consequences on physicians and medical caregivers in the decision-making to end life. These emotional risks could potentially impact the quality of care for their future patients as well.
In addition, numerous countries have legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, including Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, and The Netherlands. Conversely, some countries have prohibited euthanasia, while others continue to grapple with the significant ethical issues. For example, in Germany, euthanasia is banned, but they allow passive euthanasia, where life-support system is discontinued to allow a patient to die naturally. In contrast, in Australia, euthanasia is prohibited, but the Victoria state recently legalized the practice in certain circumstances. 
Despite the legalisation of euthanasia in some countries, there continues to be contention between various medical professionals and policymakers regarding the practice. The ethical and morality questions lingering on this practice are an essential element in the debate around legalising euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
Euthanasia brings up critical issues regarding Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and life-support decision-making autonomy. A DNR order provides a legal document that a patient does not want to be revived if his/her heart stops or not to be intubated for breathing should he/she requires it. This decision is called an advance directive, and it aims to indicate what measures an individual would and would not authorize if they were not of sound mind to make the decision.
In some cases, families may make decisions to order a DNR for their loved ones if they have no hope of recovery. However, making such decisions is not easy, and healthcare providers and patients' families may struggle with the ethical implications of DNR orders. The decision to DNR could place medical practitioners in moral distress, raising the question of whether the physician is acting in the patient's best interest or in his own.
Moreover, in ending someone's life, there are enormous emotional risks that come with the responsibility of completing the action. Physicians have ethical obligations that can affect the doctor-patient relationship, given the emotional toll of delivering such news. Resuscitation decisions, DNR, and Life support decision-making are essential pillars in the debate of euthanasia. All these modalities provide an insight on how medical practitioners should respond when the situation is beyond control.
In conclusion, the euthanasia debate highlights the importance of several ethical issues and principles in medical practice, including autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. The practice of euthanasia still has room for discussion and requires further exploration regarding various aspects, including DNR orders and life support decision-making. Despite it being legal in some countries, the reason people seek euthanasia is often because they perceive no alternative to their pain and suffering. Instead of legalising this practice, healthcare providers and governments should focus on providing adequate pain management and other forms of palliative care to patients who are seriously ill or suffering from chronic diseases.
Physicians are immensely skilled in advocating for patient-centered care by incorporating medical and psychological aspects to support the patients. They should be able to lead competency in critically evaluating the ethical implications of life-supporting interventions, resuscitation decisions and know when to act in the best interest of the patient. It is through this approach that a medical practitioner and medical practice can remain true to their Hippocratic Oath and provide a high standard of care to their patients.
