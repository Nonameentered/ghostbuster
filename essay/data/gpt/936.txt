Friendships are an essential aspect of college life, as individuals attend university for several years, where they form relationships that can influence their emotional and social wellbeing. Although university residences vary widely, a central feature is the opportunity for students to make connections with their peers through sharing communal spaces, such as dining centers, halls, or lounges. Physical proximity, familiarity, and similarity are three significant factors that affect the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences. This essay discusses the influence of these factors on friendship formation, the impact of passive contacts on friendship formation, balance theory, and how Priest and Sawyer's study contributes to understanding friendship formation.
Physical proximity is a significant factor in friendship formation and maintenance in university residences. Living near potential friends can increase the likelihood of social interaction and lead to stronger relationships. Studies have shown that individuals prefer to interact with others who are geographically close to them (Burt 2000). Such proximity often provides individuals with the opportunity to engage in activities together like meals, studying, and leisure time. This interaction can lead to the discovery of shared interests and can generate deeper conversations. Living in close quarters cultivates familiarity, leading to trust, and consequently, deepening of friendships. For instance, if a student lives next door to another student, they may become friends through frequent interactions, chance encounters, and mutual interests. The students may also plan activities together, such as movie nights. Therefore, physical proximity influences the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences.
Familiarity is another significant factor that influences the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences. Being familiar with someone makes it less likely to judge or critique them, which can make it easier to form deeper bonds. Familiarity can be created through frequent interactions, and shared experiences, such as participation in the same sports team, taking the same class, or living in the same hall. Furthermore, familiarity can lead to shared interests, which plays a crucial role in friendship formation. When individuals have more in common, they are more likely to engage in activities together, thus increasing the depth of their friendship. Individuals who are familiar with one another can communicate more openly, share ideas, and explore different perspectives. Friends who share a past experience also typically have a stronger affiliation. For instance, studies have shown that students who attend the same orientation programs have a higher likelihood of becoming friends (Sampson et al. 2009). Therefore, familiarity influences the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences.
Similarity is also an essential factor in friendship formation and maintenance in university residences. People who have similar beliefs, values, and attitudes are more likely to form strong friendships than those with minimal shared preferences. Numerous studies have shown that individuals select friends that are similar to them, this is often referred to as homophily (McPherson et al. 2001). Homophily can be associated with shared experiences, such as cultural heritage, background, and interests. Additionally, similarity can lead to more meaningful conversations as individuals can share common stories, experiences, and feelings. For instance, students who share a similar religion can come together to participate in religious activities. Moreover, individuals who share similar academic interests are more likely to initiate discussions about class topics, leading to a deeper understanding of class material. Therefore, similarity influences the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences.
Festinger, Schachter, and Back's (1950) study revealed the impact of passive contacts on friendship formation in university communities. The study found that individuals who were randomly selected to attend university with roommates they had never met previously were more likely to become friends with each other. However, participants who lived in private rooms or had chosen their roommates did not form closer connections. The study argued that passive contact was the primary factor in friendship formation, as opposed to similarity or familiarity. The study also emphasized that the more opportunities an individual has to interact with someone, the more likely they are to befriend them. Therefore, passive contact influences the formation and maintenance of friendships in university communities.
Balance theory is a social psychological theory that explains how relationships are maintained based on three elements: balance, imbalance, and symmetry. According to balance theory, individuals seek balance in their relationships and avoid imbalance. This balance is achieved when there are equal amounts of liking between two individuals, and when each person experiences reciprocity in their relationship (Heider 1958). Imbalance occurs when one friend likes the other more than the other likes them, resulting in tension that ultimately damages the relationship. This theory suggests that if an individual likes another person but feels disliked, they are more likely to remain in the relationship if they feel they receive something of value from the relationship (Adams and Rosie 2001). According to balance theory, friendships are maintained when both parties feel that their values are shared and that there is mutual reciprocity in the relationship. Therefore, balance theory influences the maintenance of friendships in university residences.
Priest and Sawyer's (1967) study analyzed the effects of balance theory on friendship formation in university residential halls. The study found that balance theory played a crucial role in maintaining friendships. When individuals perceived imbalance or tension within their friendship, they typically worked to change the power dynamics of a relationship consciously. The study also found that establishing balance could maintain and strengthen friendships. For instance, individuals who received favors from others felt inclined to repay them, thus maintaining mutual reciprocity in their friendships. The study emphasized that balance and symmetry play critical roles in successful friendships. Therefore, Priest and Sawyer's study contributes to understanding friendship formation in university residential halls.
In conclusion, physical proximity, familiarity, and similarity play significant roles in the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences. Physical proximity influences the likelihood of social interaction and, thus, more profound friendships. Familiarity leads to trust and shared values, further deepening friendships. Similarly, shared interests based on similarity lead to more meaningful conversations, which enhance the bonds between friends. Passive contact also has an impact on friendship formation. Balance theory plays a vital role in maintaining the quality and frequency of relationships, facilitating friendship formation. As seen in Priest and Sawyer's (1967) study, balance theory remains essential in strengthening friendships in university residences. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence friendship formation and maintenance can promote social integration, emotional, and mental wellbeing.
