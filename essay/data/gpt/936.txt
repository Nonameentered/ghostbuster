In Anne Bradshaw’s poem, ‘The Author to Her Book,’ the speaker writes about her feelings towards a work that she authored. Throughout the poem, she uses negative language to express her disappointment and frustration with her creation. The significance of the negative language used in this poem is to convey the speaker’s dissatisfaction with her work, and how this contributes to the overall message of the poem.
The negative language used in the poem is evident from the very first line when the speaker calls her book “feeble, hidden, blemished” (line 1). The use of three negative adjectives in one sentence creates a sense of disappointment in the speaker, which is carried throughout the poem. The language is also heavily critical, shown by the speaker’s condemnation of her own work as “ill-formed” and “stain’d” (line 14).
One of the primary functions of this negative language in the poem is to convey the sense of disappointment and inadequacy that the speaker feels towards her work. The speaker’s dissatisfaction with her book stems from its blatant imperfection which was not rectified to her satisfaction. For instance, the speaker laments the fact that her book was published before it was ready, stating that it was “snatcht from [her] own imperfection” (line 6). By highlighting the flaws of her work, the speaker successfully conveys the lack of control she had over the publishing process.
Furthermore, the negative language used also serves to convey the speaker’s dissatisfaction with the publishing industry. Throughout the poem, the speaker refers to herself as a “mother” (line 10) to her book, indicating the personal connection and emotional attachment that authors typically have to their work. However, this connection is not appreciated the way it should be by those in the publishing industry, who view literature from a business perspective rather than an emotional one. This is evident from the speaker’s description of her book as “Rapt with a blur, or cloudiness” (line 18), which highlights the confusion and disorientation she felt when someone else was in control of her work.
Ultimately, the negative language used contributes to the overall message of the poem in a significant way. The speaker’s use of this negative language is an expression of her frustration with the imperfections of her work, as well as the publishing process. This message is primarily directed at the publishing industry, which often fails to appreciate the potential of artistic work, simply because of the significant commercial risks involved. The negative language used in the poem brings attention to this issue and emphasizes the challenges faced by artists and authors in the industry.
In conclusion, Anne Bradshaw’s ‘The Author to Her Book’ is a poem that uses negative language to convey the speaker’s dissatisfaction with her own work and the publishing industry. Through the speaker’s expressions of disappointment and frustration, we see the difficulties faced by artists in the industry who are forced to relinquish control of their work. The negative language used contributes significantly to the poem’s overall message, emphasizing the need for more empathy and respect in the publishing industry, especially for authors and artists who pour their hearts and souls into their work.
