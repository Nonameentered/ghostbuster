The author of the study on the activity budget of an adolescent chimpanzee at Dudley Zoo used a variety of methods to observe and analyze the behavior and movements of the subject. The researcher studied the chimpanzee over a period of six months, collecting data on various aspects of its daily routines and activities.
One method used was direct observation through the use of a behavioral observation data sheet. The researcher made note of the chimpanzee's behaviors and activities every 10 seconds for a total of 240 hours at different times of the day. This helped to provide a comprehensive analysis of its daily routine, such as time spent foraging, resting, playing, and interacting with other chimpanzees.
Another method used was video recordings of the chimpanzee from different angles to capture a better understanding of its movements and behaviors. This method allowed for a more detailed observation, including assessing the frequency, intensity, and duration of particular actions like grooming, feeding, and social interactions.
The data collected during the study revealed that the adolescent chimpanzee spent the majority of its time foraging for food, followed by resting and playing with other chimpanzees. It also showed that the subject spent more time interacting with the adult females in the group, indicating a higher level of social interaction compared to the adult males.
The findings of the study also revealed that the adolescent chimpanzee had a lower activity budget compared to adult chimpanzees in the group. Its activity budget was mainly driven by foraging, suggesting that the subject was still in the process of learning foraging skills and developing social relationships.
In conclusion, by using a combination of observation and recording methods, the author of the study was able to gain insight into the daily activity budget of an adolescent chimpanzee at Dudley Zoo. The findings highlighted the importance of foraging and social interaction in the subject's life, as well as its place in the community. Such studies play an essential role in our understanding of these intelligent and complex animals, and can help inform conservation efforts aimed at preserving their natural habitats and populations.
