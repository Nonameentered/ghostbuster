The Victorian era witnessed a significant shift in Western literature - for instance, the advent of the novel as a popular literary genre. During this period, writers used tragedy to address diverse themes ranging from gender relations, education, and landscape. Two Victorian writers, George Eliot and Charles Dickens, were particularly prolific in exploring these themes.
One of the most significant ways Victorian writers used tragedy was to explore gender relations. In George Eliot's "Middlemarch," for instance, tragedy is used to highlight the constraints and limitations imposed on women in Victorian society. Dorothea, the novel's protagonist, is deeply unhappy in her marriage and feels stifled by her role as a wife and mother. Her education has also been severely restricted, and she is unable to pursue her passions and intellectual pursuits fully. Eliot's use of tragedy shows the consequences of denying women the freedom to fulfill their potential. In contrast, her male characters enjoy greater freedom, with opportunities to pursue personal and intellectual aspirations.
Likewise, Charles Dickens explored gender relations through tragedy. In "Great Expectations," Dickens used tragedy to convey the consequences of male dominance and toxic masculinity on women. The novel's female characters - Miss Havisham and Estella - are deeply traumatised by the treatment they receive from men. Miss Havisham is jilted on her wedding day, leading her to live the rest of her life in misery and isolation, while Estella is raised by Miss Havisham to be cold and unfeeling towards men. Through these characters, Dickens shows the damaging impact of patriarchy on women's emotional well-being.
Education was another critical theme explored by Victorian writers through tragedy. In "Middlemarch," for example, tragedies befall various characters as a consequence of inadequate education. Rosamund, the wife of Tertius Lydgate, is unable to manage the couple's finances due to her lack of education and financial literacy. This lack of understanding leads to devastating consequences for the couple and ultimately results in their financial ruin. Eliot also explores the theme of education in "Adam Bede," where tragedy ensues when Hetty is ill-equipped to handle her pregnancy. Having lacked essential education and information on sex and pregnancy, she goes into labour alone and is subsequently charged with infanticide.
Similarly, Dickens explored the theme of education through tragedy in "Oliver Twist." The novel's eponymous protagonist is raised in a workhouse where the education he receives is woefully inadequate. This lack of preparation condemns him to a life of poverty and struggle, eventually exposing him to violence and criminality. Dickens uses tragedy in "Oliver Twist" not only to highlight the need for a decent education but also to showcase the tragic consequences of failing to provide it.
Finally, Victorian writers used tragedy to explore landscape. Through tragedy, writers could highlight the harsh realities that people faced in the social or physical environments they inhabited. In Eliot's "Silas Marner," for instance, the rustic charm of Raveloe proves shallow when compared to the devastating tragedies that unfold. These tragedies, including Silas's isolation and loss, highlight the fragility of human existence and the importance of social connectedness. Eliot's portrayal of Raveloe's landscape underscores how harsh environments can affect human behaviour and lead to tragedy.
Similarly, Dickens explored landscapes through tragedy. In "Hard Times," the gruelling industrial landscapes of Coketown provide a stark contrast to the tragic lives of its inhabitants. The novel explores the harsh realities and long-term consequences of industrialisation, including economic exploitation and environmental degradation. Through tragedy, Dickens shows the impact of industrial landscapes on the people who inhabit them, highlighting the need for change.
In conclusion, Victorian writers such as George Eliot and Charles Dickens used tragedy to explore themes of gender relations, education, and landscape. Tragedy offered a powerful and compelling way of communicating the social issues of the day and the consequences of inaction. These writers used tragedy to showcase the harsh realities of Victorian society and to advocate for change. While the themes explored may be specific to the Victorian era, they remain relevant today, emphasizing the enduring power of literature to engage with pressing social issues.
