Reflection is the process of considering and analyzing events, experiences, and outcomes with the intent of improving future actions (Brookfield, 1998). Reflective practice is an essential process in healthcare, particularly in decision making. Reflective practice refers to a process of evaluating and reviewing the experiences in the clinical setting through a structured approach that promotes a deep level of analysis and critical thinking. The process involves reviewing and analyzing clinical practices, past experiences, and learning processes to identify areas that need improvement. Reflective practice is widely used in healthcare to continuously improve patient outcomes, enhance healthcare quality, and promote the professional development of caregivers.
Reflective practice provides healthcare professionals with an opportunity to review the challenges and decisions made in the clinical setting. It enables healthcare professionals to ask reflective questions that help to identify where and how their clinical practices could be improved. Reflective practice enables healthcare professionals to identify issues and develop solutions, and even predict and avoid problems in the future. Reflective practice can be used as a decision-making process in healthcare to enhance decision-making abilities. In healthcare, several theoretical frameworks exist that guide caregivers in making decisions; these frameworks include the ethical, legal, and moral frameworks (Thompson et al., 2017).
The ethical framework seeks to guide healthcare professionals in making decisions related to patient management, dignity, and autonomy. This framework is based on the values and principles that underpin the duties and responsibilities of healthcare professionals. It emphasizes the importance of autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence in making healthcare decisions. The ethical framework supports reflective practice by promoting an environment that encourages critical thinking and decision-making based on ethical principles and values.
The legal framework is based on the policies and procedures that govern healthcare facilities, caregivers, and patients. It provides guidance for healthcare professionals on their responsibilities and legal obligations while caring for patients. Healthcare professionals use the legal framework to make decisions that align with the law to ensure that they comply with the law while delivering healthcare services. Reflective practice enables healthcare professionals to understand the laws and regulations that govern healthcare and how they impact their decision-making processes.
Moral frameworks are based on the values and beliefs that guide healthcare professionals in their decision-making processes. The moral framework puts emphasis on the moral values and principles that impact healthcare decisions, including the sources of values and principles, and the contexts in which the decisions are made. Reflective practice helps healthcare professionals to understand their moral values and beliefs and how they can impact decision making. It enables caregivers to identify conflicts between personal morals and beliefs and professional obligations and address them.
Reflective practice can assist in decision-making processes in the clinical setting. Through reflective practice, healthcare professionals can evaluate their clinical decisions and outcomes. An example of a care intervention in which reflective practice was used is with regard to pressure ulcer management in a long-term care facility. In this case, the caregivers were experiencing challenges in pressure ulcer care management, given the increase in the number of patients who had developed pressure ulcers. The caregivers implemented an evidence-based pressure ulcer management program that included a comprehensive pressure ulcer assessment, care planning, patient and family education, and staff education. They also established a system for tracking patient outcomes.
After the implementation of the program, the caregivers started seeing improvements in patient outcomes. There were fewer cases of pressure ulcers, and the quality of care improved. However, the caregivers noted that there was still a challenge in the implementation of the program. The caregivers could not identify the root cause of the challenges that hindered them from achieving the desired results. They utilized reflective practice to evaluate the program implementation process.
Through reflective practice, the caregivers identified that one of the key challenges in implementing the program was the lack of proper communication channels between the healthcare providers and the patients and their families. They realized that poor communication had hindered the program's success. The caregivers used their reflective practice to create communication channels, including weekly communication and documentation, team meetings, and frequent patient and family rounds. Within two weeks, the caregivers started seeing improvements in the communication channels. There were fewer communication breakdowns, and the patients' and families' trust and confidence in the program increased. The caregivers were able to provide effective pressure ulcer care, and the incidence of pressure ulcers decreased significantly.
In conclusion, reflective practice is a critical decision-making process that healthcare professionals use to evaluate their clinical practices and improve their patient outcomes. Healthcare professionals can use theoretical frameworks such as the ethical, legal, and moral frameworks to guide their decision-making processes. Reflective practice enhances critical thinking skills and enables healthcare professionals to identify gaps and challenges in their clinical practices. Reflective practice promotes continuous improvement in healthcare, enhances communication, and improves patient outcomes. Reflective practice is essential for developing effective care interventions that promote patient-centered care and improve overall healthcare quality.
