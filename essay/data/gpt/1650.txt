Professional skills are the competencies, behaviors, and attitudes that an individual possesses to excel in their professional field. They are essential for successful practice and development as a professional in any industry. In the healthcare sector, professional skills play a vital role in providing quality care to patients and enhancing their overall health outcomes. These skills can be grouped into two categories: generic skills and profession-specific skills.
Generic skills refer to transferable skills that are necessary to succeed in any profession. Examples of these skills include communication, problem-solving, time management, and leadership. On the other hand, profession-specific skills are those skills that are unique to a particular profession and are essential to perform specific tasks or duties. Such skills may include clinical skills for healthcare professionals or IT skills for software engineers.
Effective teamwork and reflection are two key areas that demonstrate the importance of professional skills for practice in healthcare settings. In this essay, we will explore the challenges and benefits of effective teamwork and reflection, both from an undergraduate Occupational Therapy (OT) studentâ€™s perspective and a multi-professional viewpoint.
OT students require teamwork skills to work effectively with other healthcare professionals and patients. Due to the nature of their work, they often work closely with other interdisciplinary teams, including physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers, to help individuals of all ages who face challenges related to their physical health, mental well-being, or cognitive performance. During my undergraduate studies in OT, we were assigned group projects that required us to apply multiple capacities from preparing treatment plans to sharing responsibilities and communicating with our colleagues to provide effective and efficient care.
One major challenge we faced during these projects was lack of communication. Often, communication among team members was not adequate, and people failed to share necessary information, which led to work redundancies, and misunderstandings. However, these challenges also created opportunities to develop effective teamwork skills. For example, we learned to communicate effectively by implementing various communication channels such as video conferencing, emails, or other technological tools. Collaborating and sharing ideas with our fellow team members helped me learn a lot about working in teams and how team dynamics play a role in delivering coordinated patient-centered care.
Effective teamwork skills in healthcare settings have multiple benefits. They enable healthcare workers to deliver patient-centered care, reduce Patient safety risks, and achieve better patient outcomes. When different healthcare professionals from different disciplines bring their specialties to the table, their different perspectives, opinions, and approaches help broaden a patient's care, which leads to better decision-making.
Reflection is another essential skill required in healthcare settings. It enables healthcare professionals to reflect on their work practices and think critically about their decision-making and problem-solving approaches. Reflection is also a self-directed process and is particularly important in healthcare settings where critical thinking comes into context.
As OT students, we were taught to reflect on our practice, and it often involved evaluating our experiences with patients and reflecting on the outcomes of our interventions. There were formal reflection opportunities throughout our OT program, like writing reflective essays, receiving feedback from peers, and our professors. However, reflection requires ongoing attention and intention, and as I continue to work as an Occupational Therapy practitioner, the practice of celebrating successes and reflecting on areas for growth continues.
One of the challenges I experienced with reflection was overcoming my biases when reflecting on my interactions with patients. It was initially challenging to reflect on my actions with an open mind because I was quick to judge and often formed opinions about what I needed to do or change and neglected to acknowledge my growth and accomplishments. However, I have learned that it is essential to reflect without preconceptions to identify areas for improvement and better support the people I work with.
Reflective practice has significant benefits for healthcare professionals. Reflective practice helps healthcare professionals identify areas for growth and tailor their approaches to better meet patients' needs. By reflecting on their actions, professionals can identify their biases and become more self-aware, making decisions that align with their values and beliefs. They also become better problem-solvers and decision-makers by continuously evaluating their performance, identifying solutions, and evaluating the outcomes of their interventions.
Finally, effective teamwork and reflection help healthcare professionals to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. The healthcare industry is continually evolving, and with the additional technology capabilities, interdisciplinary teams, and patient-centered care, healthcare professionals need to be adaptable and continually grow and improve their professional skills.
In conclusion, professional skills are essential in healthcare settings. Both generic and profession-specific skills contribute to effective teamwork and reflection, two key areas that are crucial for successful healthcare practices. Through effective teamwork, healthcare providers can deliver patient-centered care, reduce errors, and improve patient outcomes. Reflection enables healthcare workers to identify areas for growth, tailor their approaches, become more self-aware, refine their decision-making, and better meet patients' needs. As healthcare continues to evolve, healthcare professionals' professional skills will continue to serve as a critical differentiator between those who are merely competent and those who excel in their field.
