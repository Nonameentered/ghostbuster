The Rutland Wind Charger Experiment aims to evaluate the performance of a small-scale wind turbine under varying wind conditions. The experiment will examine several factors, including the turbine's power output, efficiency, and energy production under different wind speeds and directions. These factors will be compared qualitatively to determine the turbine's overall performance characteristics. Potential discrepancies that could affect the accuracy of the results include variations in wind patterns, turbulence, and interference from other structures. By analyzing the turbine's performance, the Rutland Wind Charger Experiment hopes to provide valuable insights into the feasibility and potential of small-scale wind power for household and commercial use.
