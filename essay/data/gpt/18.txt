Poland has a long and complex history filled with political upheaval, foreign invasions, and opposition movements. In the 1980s, Poland was under the control of a communist government headed by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. During this time, a groundbreaking development occurred that changed Poland's position in the world, the advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests. The rise of Solidarity is tightly linked with the economic factors and political circumstances that led to its formation. This essay will examine the economic and political factors that led to the advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests in Poland in 1980. Additionally, it will explore how the movement contributed to the development of a new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances.
In the late 1970s, the Polish government went headlong into an economic crisis. The various factors of the crisis included poor performance of the industry and agriculture sectors, rising inflation, and extensive external debt. One of the significant issues that were complicating the situation was the cost of fuel imports. Following the 1973 oil embargo and consequent petrol price inflation, the Polish government became heavily reliant on Soviet oil imports that were sold at an overinflated price. Historians suggest that the Polish government was acquiring the oil at up to twice the amount it was worth on the market. The political affiliation between the Soviet Union and Poland was a significant factor that allowed the oil arrangement to run for as long as it did. 
By 1979, Poland's economy was on the brink of collapse. The international community (IMF, World Bank, and the banks of Western Europe) had suspended all credits to Poland due to its inability to honour its debts. The Polish government was left with no choice but to increase the prices of foodstuffs and other commodities by 50% to reduce the budget deficit. The price hike affected the wage earners and hit a raw nerve with the Polish workers. The workers felt that they were the ones suffering the consequences of the poor economic management by the government.
The rise of Solidarity was therefore a reaction to the deteriorating economic and political situation in Poland. The movement had its roots in a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk in August 1980. The workers of the shipyard had declared a strike to demand wage increases, better working conditions and the right to establish independent trade unions. The newly formed committee of striking workers got broad support from the Polish workers, students, the catholic church and even some intellectuals. The suddenness of the movement and the intensity of the masses was unexpected and caught the government unprepared. 
In his book, "The Polish Revolution: Solidarity", Timothy Garton Ash argues that the labour discontent found expression not only in economic demands but also in political and social terms. Polish history had been marked by confrontationist styles of expressing dissent through political parties or national movements that rallied around intellectual elite groups. The Solidarity movement represented a significant shift in terms of articulation of labour grievances. Rather than solely focussing on material or economic demands, the workers in Solidarity situated themselves in broader political, social, and cultural contexts. They refused to be reduced to mere economic pawns and demanded political power and the right of self-expression. They linked their needs to broader social aspirations; thus, making appeals to cultural and moral values that an intellectual or someone sensitive to the general social ambience would understand.
The movement's broad appeal resulted from a progressive and inclusive trade unionism model that was embodied in Solidarity's programme. Solidarity's programme emphasised the establishment of self-governing groups and worker councils from small workplaces to the national level. The objective of these workers' councils was to exercise control over a range of workplace and social matters that were fundamental to workers' lives. These issues involved matters such as social welfare, health, culture, and pensions. The movement's embrace of a vast membership and its use of the strike as a tactic allowed it to exert political influence as a mass democratic movement. This was quite different from the traditional trade unions that were defined by parochialism and narrow representation.
Solidarity became a multi-faceted social and political movement that challenged the Polish government's legitimacy, setting the stage for a mass citizen revolt against the Soviet-style communist system. The movement's broad appeal and leadership encompassed intellectuals, workers, and artists, among other groups. The movement's organisation and tactics inspired the formation of other anti-communist groups across the Soviet bloc. 
In conclusion, the economic and political factors that led to the advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests in Poland in 1980 were multi-dimensional. The economic reasons ranged from the cost of fuel imports, poor industrial performance, and a heavy external debt burden. On the other hand, the political reasons were marked by a very unresponsive Soviet orientated communist government that had failed to address the needs of the citizens. The movement's ability to transcend economic demands and articulate broader political, social, and cultural concerns, and organise around conciliatory, inclusive, and participatory leadership can be seen as a radical departure from prior labour activism. The transformative impact of the Solidarity movement set the stage for the end of communist rule in Eastern and Central Europe ultimately contributing to the development of a 'new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances.'
