Contract law is a crucial aspect of legal systems across the world, and English contract law is no exception. The law governs how parties make agreements and assign legal obligations to each other, as well as the consequences of breaching the terms of a contract. The key elements of a valid contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. In this essay, we will discuss the role of consideration and intention and how they differ in their functions. We will also explore why consideration continues to survive despite criticisms and how its flexibility is demonstrated in court decisions. Finally, we will analyze the crucial role of intention in domestic and social agreements and identify the factors that influence its determination.
Consideration refers to the exchange of something of value between the parties, which could be goods, money, or services, that in turn results in legal obligations. It is an essential element in English contract law, and without consideration, a contract is not valid. The purpose of consideration is to ensure that both parties receive something of value in the agreement and that they intend to be bound by the terms of the agreement. The concept of consideration serves two main purposes: firstly, it distinguishes legally binding agreements from social agreements, and secondly, it provides a mechanism to enforce agreements with legal consequences.
The primary criticism of consideration is that it is a technical requirement that adds little value to contract law. The rationale behind this criticism is that the focus should be on the substance of the agreement rather than the formalities of the process. However, despite criticisms, the concept of consideration continues to survive in English contract law. One reason for this is that it provides certainty and predictability in contract law, as parties can rely on it to determine the validity of an agreement. Additionally, consideration helps avoid the creation of gratuitous agreements that are unenforceable under the law.
Despite being a technical requirement, the flexibility of consideration is demonstrated in court decisions. Courts have applied the concept of consideration in a variety of ways, recognizing that the exchange of something of value does not always have to be monetary. For instance, in the case of White v Bluett, the court held that forbearance on a legal right to sue could be sufficient consideration if it was genuinely owed. In another case, Chappel & Co v Nestle, the court held that the requirement for consideration was met when the chocolate manufacturer offered records with its product. Such instances highlight the flexibility in the application of consideration in English contract law.
Intention to create legal relations, on the other hand, refers to the parties' intention to be bound legally by their agreement. It is a prerequisite for contracts to be enforceable under the law. In English contract law, there are two types of agreements: social and domestic agreements and commercial agreements. Social and domestic agreements are presumed not to create legal relations, and the burden of proving otherwise lies with the party seeking to enforce the agreement. In contrast, commercial agreements are presumed to be legally binding, and the burden of proving otherwise lies with the party seeking to dispute the agreement.
The determination of intention can be influenced by several factors, including the language used in the agreement, the parties' conduct, and the surrounding circumstances. In domestic and social agreements, the parties' intention is often not clear, and courts must apply objective tests to determine whether legal relations were intended. For instance, in the case of Balfour v Balfour, the court held that the agreement between a husband and wife to pay the wife maintenance while he worked abroad was not a legally enforceable agreement as it was merely a social agreement.
In contrast, commercial agreements are presumed to have the necessary intention to create legal relations. The partiesâ€™ presumption is that they intend to be legally bound by the terms of the agreement. However, even in commercial agreements, intention is not presumed in every case, and the surrounding circumstances are crucial in determining whether the parties intended to create legal relations.
In conclusion, the English contract is a significant aspect of legal systems in the world. The most crucial elements of a valid contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. The role of consideration is to ensure that both parties receive something of value in the agreement, and that they intend to be bound by the terms of the agreement. Despite criticisms, the concept of consideration continues to survive and demonstrate flexibility in English contract law. The intention to create legal relations is also a crucial element of a valid contract, and its determination is influenced by several factors, including the language used in the agreement, the conduct of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances. Whether contracts are domestic and social or commercial agreements, consideration and intention are essential for enforcing agreements with legal consequences.
