Advancements in the field of real analysis have brought about significant progress in understanding the properties of real numbers and functions. Despite recent attempts at formalization, there remains an uncertain key concept - the foundation of the field: the rigorous definition of the derivative.
Augustin-Louis Cauchy's definition of continuity states that a function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as the input approaches that point is equal to the function value at that point. However, Cauchy's definition of continuity appears to be inconsistent with his own theorem. Cauchy's theorem asserts that a function is continuous on an interval if, and only if, the integral exists on that interval. But, according to his definition of continuity, a function could be continuous, yet its integral might not exist.
Progress towards making calculus more rigorous has been significant, especially in the formulation of the definition of the derivative. Cauchy's definition of the derivative defines the derivative of a function f(x) at x to be the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches zero. In contrast, Lagrange's definition sets up a framework that connects the derivative to the concepts of the tangent line and the intermediate value theorem.
Despite these advancements, there are several challenges that arise in applying the rules of differential calculus to unusual functions recently considered. For instance, non-differentiable functions with infinite derivatives present significant challenges. These functions' peculiar properties require analysts to utilize various approaches and new definitions to solve problems.
In conclusion, real analysis is an essential field of mathematics that helps us understand the properties of real numbers and functions. Though significant progress has been made in formalizing many concepts related to calculus, the rigorous definition of the derivative remains an uncertain key concept. While new definitions and approaches provide solutions to challenging problems, it is essential to continue exploring new possibilities that will help deepen our understanding of this critical field of mathematics.
