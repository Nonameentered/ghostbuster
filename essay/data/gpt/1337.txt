The Phillips Curve is a concept in macroeconomics that describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment levels in an economy. It was first identified by New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips in a 1958 article titled "The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957." According to the Phillips Curve, there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment; when the unemployment rate is low, there is upward pressure on wages, which drives up inflation. Conversely, when unemployment is high, there is downward pressure on wages, which dampens inflation. This inverse relationship is sometimes referred to as the "Phillips trade-off."
For decades, the Phillips Curve was a fundamental tool used by policymakers to make decisions about monetary and fiscal policy. The conventional wisdom held that if inflation was deemed too high (generally considered to be above 2%), policymakers could reduce it by increasing interest rates, which would discourage borrowing and spending and lead to lower demand for goods and services. This, in turn, would slow down the economy and reduce inflation, but also lead to higher unemployment. Conversely, if unemployment was deemed too high, policymakers could increase government spending, lower interest rates, or employ other expansionary measures to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment, but at the risk of increasing inflation.
However, in the 1970s, the Phillips Curve broke down. During this period, the U.S. and many other developed countries faced high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously, a phenomenon known as "stagflation." The traditional Phillips Curve relationship no longer seemed to hold, and policymakers were left struggling to understand what had gone wrong.
A number of different theories have been developed to explain the breakdown of the Phillips Curve. These theories are generally divided into three main schools of thought: the Keynesian, Monetarist, and Neo-Classical schools. Each of these schools has a different perspective on why the Phillips Curve relationship failed and what factors were responsible.
The Keynesian perspective attributes the breakdown of the Phillips Curve to external shocks and failure to adapt to changes in the industrial landscape. According to Keynesian economists, the high inflation of the 1970s was primarily the result of a series of external shocks, such as the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, which drove up the price of oil and other commodities. The Keynesian perspective also highlights the failure of policymakers to adapt to changes in the structure of the economy, such as the decline of traditional manufacturing industries and the rise of service-oriented industries. These changes led to a decline in unionization rates and a weakening of labor's bargaining power, making it more difficult to control inflation through wage policies.
The Monetarist perspective, on the other hand, places greater emphasis on the role of monetary policy in the breakdown of the Phillips Curve. According to Monetarists, the high inflation of the 1970s was caused primarily by excessive growth of the money supply. They argue that policymakers had become too focused on reducing unemployment, and had allowed the money supply to grow at an unsustainable rate in order to finance government spending and to encourage borrowing and investment. This led to too much money chasing too few goods, driving up prices and contributing to the breakdown of the Phillips Curve relationship.
Finally, the Neo-Classical perspective suggests that the breakdown of the Phillips Curve was the result of the failure of agents in the economy, such as workers and firms, to accurately anticipate inflation and make rational decisions. Neo-Classical economists argue that prior to the 1970s, policymakers were able to manipulate the Phillips Curve relationship because agents in the economy had not adapted to the idea that inflation could be managed through government policy. However, as these agents became more sophisticated and began to anticipate the effects of government policy, the relationship between inflation and unemployment shifted, making it more difficult for policymakers to control either.
In addition to these schools of thought, a number of other factors have been suggested as contributing to the breakdown of the Phillips Curve. For example, some economists argue that changes in the structure of the global economy, particularly the rise of low-cost manufacturing in developing countries, put downward pressure on prices and made it more difficult to control inflation. Similarly, some argue that changes in expectations, such as the belief that inflation was here to stay, made it more difficult to control prices.
Overall, it seems clear that a combination of different factors contributed to the breakdown of the Phillips Curve relationship in the 1970s. Moving forward, it is likely that these factors will continue to shape the way in which the relationship between inflation and unemployment is understood. For example, the rise of gig work and the gig economy has driven down traditional employment levels, leaving more people with unstable incomes and less negotiating power. At the same time, rising automation and changing consumer behaviors have driven down prices in many sectors, making it more difficult to control inflation. 
Despite the complexity of these factors, some economists argue that the Phillips Curve remains a relevant concept in contemporary economic policy. Though its predictive power may have weakened, some argue that policymakers can still draw on its insights to make better decisions about monetary and fiscal policy. For example, a careful analysis of the relationships between inflation, unemployment, and other factors such as wage growth, productivity, and government spending can help policymakers make more informed decisions about when to adjust interest rates, how much to spend on stimulus measures, and how to promote job creation. Furthermore, by paying careful attention to expectations, globalization, and other factors that have contributed to the breakdown of the Phillips Curve, policymakers can more accurately predict how changes in the economy will affect inflation and unemployment levels in the future. 
Ultimately, the Phillips Curve may no longer be the go-to tool it once was for understanding the relationship between inflation and unemployment, but it remains one of the most important concepts in macroeconomic theory. By carefully considering the factors that contributed to its breakdown in the 1970s, and by continuing to refine our understanding of how the global economy works, we can continue to draw on its insights to make better decisions about how to manage inflation and unemployment in the years to come.
