Dogs are one of the most loved and popular domestic animals. Though they are often referred to as man's best friend, they have a diverse lifestyle, including their diet. There have been several debates regarding whether dogs are carnivorous, omnivorous or omnivorous carnivores. The concept of canine diet classification remains unclear, which explains why this remains a heated debate amongst many dog lovers. In this essay, we will explore some characteristics of dogs that support the idea that they may be classified as either a carnivore, omnivore, or an omnivorous carnivore. We will also go ahead to analyze how their diet relates to these classifications and provide evidence in support of each classification.
One classification that dogs can be categorized into is carnivorous. Carnivores are known to feed on other animals meat primarily. There are several arguments for and against the idea of classifying dogs as carnivores. Adherents of this classification will point out the physical characteristics of dogs as evidence supporting their perception of dogs. For example, the digestive system of dogs is proof of them being carnivores. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), the canine digestive system is shorter than that of omnivores, and the esophagus lies above the stomach in a specific manner that allows for the efficient movement of swallowed food into the stomach (ASPCA 1). This digestive system's design is essential for digesting raw meat proteins, making it easier for food to enter the stomach. Additionally, studies have shown that dogs can consume small amounts of carbohydrates, and they can self-regulate their diets depending on nutritional needs (Stewart, Guisbond, and Cummings 312).
The argument in opposition to the classification of dogs as carnivorous centers around the availability of different food types in their environment. While dogs may have a digestive system designed to digest meat efficiently, it is important to note that they exist in diversified environments. Thus, their diet is not solely meat-based. Wildcats like the lion, tigers, and cheetahs who are carnivorous typically hunt and consume their prey, and as such, can be classified as carnivorous due to their exclusive reliance on meat. However, dogs, while able to digest and utilize meat proteins efficiently, have a more diversified diet. For this reason, some researchers propose that dogs can best be classified as an omnivorous carnivore.
An omnivorous carnivore is a term used to classify animals that exhibit the biological and physiological characteristics to digest meat and vegetation. It is believed that dogs have adapted over time to eat a variety of foods ranging from meat to plant matter. There are various reasons why dogs may consume plant matter, including the scarcity of protein and the availability of a more enriched dietary mix. In a review of the literature on the subject of dog classification, Benjamin L. Hart et al., reveal that "some dogs can consume up to 30% carbohydrates in their diets" (Hart et al. 6). This adaptation is because of their divergence from their ancestral wolves, where dogs lived on a grain-free diet and only consumed meat.
Furthermore, dogs' ability to digest plant-based diets is evident in their evolution over time. The DNA evidence can be traced back to the divergence of the wolves and canine's lineages. While wolves are strictly carnivorous, dogs have been shown to have undergone numerous genetic changes, allowing them to digest plant-based diets efficiently (Axelsson et al. 1134). The development of the regulatory elements in nuclear DNA is responsible for dogs' omnivorous nature. This adaptation has enabled dogs to feed on both meat and vegetation.
Finally, there is the classification of dogs as omnivores. As an omnivore, a dog's dietary capability is not only suitable for consuming raw meats or vegetables, as they also benefit from the mixture of both meat and plant matter. Omnivore animals have teeth that can pierce and shred meat, and they also possess molars with which they can grind plant matter. Notably, dogs also have these physical characteristics, making them well-suited to consume and digest both meat and vegetable matter. They have also undergone changes in their digestive enzymes to enable them to digest grains and other plant-based foods types efficiently (Pence 560).
In conclusion, the classification of dogs diet has been a point of controversy amongst canine lovers. It is not entirely clear whether dogs are carnivorous, omnivorous, or an omnivorous carnivore. However, physical characteristics such as digestive system, teeth structure, and DNA evidence support the classification of dogs into two main groups which are carnivorous and omnivores. Adherents of the carnivore classification point out that the canine digestive system is shorter, and the esophagus lies above the stomach, which is crucial for digesting raw meat proteins. On the other hand, omnivore supporters believe that dogs possess the biological and physiological attributes necessary to digest both meat and vegetation, and some studies reveal that dogs can consume up to 30% carbohydrates in their diet. Finally, there are others who believe that dogs are best classified as omnivorous carnivores. Regardless of the classification, what remains constant is that, over time, evolutionary changes have enabled dogs to adapt and survive across diversified environments, allowing for different diets. This adaptation mechanism has helped dogs remain one of the most loved and popular animals worldwide.
