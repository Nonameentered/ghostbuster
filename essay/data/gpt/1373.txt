The Anglo-Saxon period of England was an era of significant social and cultural developments, spanning from the fifth century until the Norman Conquest of 1066 AD. One of the key ways of investigating ancient cultures is by looking at the various burial practices and rituals they adopted. Burial rites and practices reveal a lot about the values, rituals, and beliefs of a particular society. As such, early Anglo-Saxon burial rites provide an opportunity to study this ancient society and learn about their worldview, social structure, and cultural practices. This essay aims to explore what we can learn about early Anglo-Saxon society from their burial rites.
It is important to note that burial rites have a strong link to religion. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the religious beliefs of the early Anglo-Saxons to comprehend the significance of their burial practices. The religious beliefs of the early Anglo-Saxons were polytheistic, and their gods or goddesses embodied the different aspects of nature, seasons, crops, and fertility. These gods were believed to control different realms of life, including war, love, wisdom, and the underworld, among others. The Anglo-Saxons believed in an afterlife that was a continuation of the present life, and thus, they buried their dead with items they believed would be useful in the afterlife. These beliefs heavily influenced their burial practices.
The earliest Anglo-Saxon burials were simple and showed a preference for cremation. These early burials consisted of urns filled with the ashes of the deceased, accompanied by basic grave goods such as spears, shields, and brooches. This funerary practice was followed mainly by the pagan Anglo-Saxons who arrived in England around 450 AD. The simplicity of these burials indicates the early Anglo-Saxons lived in small scattered communities, and the ranks within society were yet to form. The belief in cremation among these people shows their belief in the cycle of life and death since cremation releases the soul from the body and enables its rebirth. It also suggests that the early Anglo-Saxons were practical in their approach, seeking a more efficient method of disposing of the dead.
Over time, the Anglo-Saxons started adopting inhumation in addition to cremation, which also indicates a shift towards a more settled lifestyle. The inhumation burials were highly intricate and mainly consisted of burial mounds and inhumation cemeteries with a range of grave goods. These grave goods included weapons, household objects, jewelry, and food, which, according to their beliefs, would sustain the deceased in the afterlife. These burials were accompanied by rituals, including sacrificing animals to appease the gods and prepare the deceased for their journey into the afterlife.
The type and number of grave goods found in early Anglo-Saxon burials varied based on social status. For example, the aristocrats and wealthier individuals were buried with more elaborate grave goods, such as gold and silver jewelry, swords, and helmets, compared to the commoners. The elaborate burials indicate that there was a social hierarchy among the early Anglo-Saxons. The position and orientation of graves also suggested that the Anglo-Saxons believed that the dead had a specific place in the afterlife based on their social status. The wealthy and rich were typically buried at higher ground, and they faced east which was considered the direction of sunrise and life. In contrast, the poor and low-status individuals were buried at lower ground and were not buried with as many grave goods. 
Another indication of a social hierarchy among the Anglo-Saxons was the practice of ship burials. Ship burials were reserved for members of the royal family, elite warriors, and wealthy individuals who owned ships. These burials were elaborate, with the deceased placed in a ship with their possessions, slaves, and sometimes even horses. These ship burials showcased the elite status of the deceased and the idea that only those with high status could be buried in such a way.
Aside from the social hierarchy, early Anglo-Saxon burial rites also reveal their attitude towards gender and age. The burial practices were heavily gender-biased, with different grave goods given to men and women. Men were typically buried with weapons, while women were buried with domestic items such as spindle whorls and bone needles. The burial goods associated with women also suggest that they were responsible for textile production and ensuring the survival of the household.
The age of the deceased also played a critical role in the burial rites. Early Anglo-Saxon children were often buried with toys and items that were considered appropriate for their age. This suggests that the Anglo-Saxons valued children and considered them important members of society. The burial of children in cemeteries with adults also indicates that the early Anglo-Saxons did not segregate the dead based on age.
In conclusion, early Anglo-Saxon burial rites reveal a lot about their society, including their social structure, gender roles, and age values. The simplicity of the early burials shows that the society at this time was small and without a hierarchical structure and only later developed into a more complex, hierarchical society. The inhumation burials with their elaborate grave goods indicate the existence of a social hierarchy, with the wealthy and elite at the top and the poor and lower status individuals at the bottom. The gender-bias in the burials also reveals the assigned gender roles in Anglo-Saxon society, with men associated with warfare and women with domestic duties. Furthermore, the inclusion of toys and items for children highlights their importance in early Anglo-Saxon society. Overall, the study of early Anglo-Saxon burial rites provides an insight into this ancient civilization, helping us to understand their beliefs, values, and rituals.
