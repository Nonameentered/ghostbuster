Political power is one of the most discussed and debated topics in social sciences. It is a concept that has been analyzed from different perspectives throughout history. Scholars and theorists like Stoker and Marsh have argued that political power is best understood as a complex system of relations that exist between various actors and institutions. This system is influenced by a range of factors, including public opinion, institutional structures, and individual leadership. The nature of political power is further shaped by various theories of pluralism and elitism, which have different assumptions about the distribution and exercise of power. However, these theories are not without criticism, and the concept of non-decision making put forward by Bachrach and Baratz has presented a challenge to the traditional understanding of political power and decision-making processes.
According to Stoker, political power is best understood as a complex and dynamic process, rather than a fixed position held by a particular group or individual. He argues that power is not solely vested in political institutions, but is distributed throughout society in various ways (Stoker, 1996). This reflects the pluralist perspective, which assumes that power is diffused among different groups and interests. Marsh similarly emphasizes the distributed nature of power and suggests that it is based on the capacity to achieve desired outcomes, rather than the ability to control the behavior of others (Marsh, 1998).
The theories of pluralism and elitism have played a crucial role in shaping different conceptions of political power. Pluralism assumes that power is distributed widely among various actors, institutions, groups, and individuals in a democratic society (Dahl, 1961). It suggests that no single group or individual can monopolize power, but that power is constantly contested and negotiated among competing interests. This perspective is supported by empirical observations of political behavior, which suggest that decision-making involves a range of actors with different preferences.
In contrast, elitism assumes that power is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy and powerful groups, individuals or institutions. According to Mosca, Pareto, and Michels, power rests in the hands of the elite and that democratic systems are merely mechanisms for legitimizing their power (Mosca, 1939; Pareto, 1935; Michels, 1962). Elitists argue that democracy is a facade that conceals the exercise of power by certain privileged groups or individuals. 
These opposing viewpoints have been central to debates in political theory and inform various syntheses of political power. For example, the neo-pluralist perspective undermines the view that only a few groups dominate power in a democracy. It argues that power is dispersed among multiple actors and that no single group has exclusive control (Dahl, 1970; Schattschneider, 1960). As a result, the study of power must focus on the interaction of different actors, rather than focusing only on the dominant groups.
However, Dahl’s pluralistic conception has been subjected to criticism. Critics argue that such an understanding of politics is too simplistic and ignores the fact that some groups have more power than others. Bachrach and Baratz, for example, put forward the concept of “non-decision-making” to critique Dahl's pluralistic model (Bachrach and Baratz, 1962). Non-decision-making refers to the exclusion of certain issues or decisions from the political agenda, which results from the elite's ability to prevent them from receiving attention or consideration. Bachrach and Baratz argue that this process of non-decision-making is not captured by traditional models of politics and undermines democratic ideals.
The concept of non-decision-making highlights an area of political control that traditional theories of political power may not account for. Non-decision-making is the slow and subtle method of maintaining power by limiting policy options. It involves the ability of some groups to prevent issues from being discussed, prevent them from receiving attention, and, ultimately, to prevent them from becoming a political reality. In this sense, non-decision-making is more about the limitations on what can be or cannot be done than the decision-making process itself. 
Moreover, the concept of non-decision-making points out the importance of issues that are not discussed, rather than the issues that are discussed. The absence of some important issues may leave the people with the illusion that the political system works well, even though it may neglect important concerns. Bachrach and Baratz argue that the power to limit political discussion and decision-making may not be visible, but ultimately shapes the political agenda and limits the scope of democratic decision-making.
In an attempt to refine Dahl's model, Bachrach and Baratz suggest that power should not only be understood in terms of decision-making but should also focus on the agenda-setting process. Therefore, the ability of certain groups or individuals to prevent issues from being discussed or to restrict access to the political process is a legitimate way of exercising power. However, such behaviors do not necessarily imply that the entire political process is under their control and suggests that non-decision-making should be understood as a form of power contestation that occurs alongside decision-making. 
In conclusion, the nature of political power is complex and multi-dimensional. The concept of political power should be reconsidered from multiple perspectives, including pluralism and elitism, which present somewhat contrasting viewpoints. The traditional pluralistic understanding of democratic power and the concept of non-decision-making proposed by Bachrach and Baratz, shed light on the importance of the entire political process, including the contestation of power, exclusion of issues from the political agenda, as well as decision-making. The criticisms of Dahl's pluralistic model and the subsequent development of non-decision-making as a concept demonstrate the ongoing evolution of the meanings and uses of traditional models of political power.
