Legal parentage and parental responsibility are fundamental concepts in family law that define the rights and obligations of parents towards their children. Legal parentage refers to the status of a person as a legal parent, which can be acquired in several ways such as biological parenthood, adoption, and surrogacy. Parental responsibility, on the other hand, encompasses the duties and responsibilities of a parent towards their child, including providing them with financial, emotional, and physical support.
The concept of legal parentage and parental responsibility is coherent with modern family life as it acknowledges the changing nature of families. With the increasing prevalence of alternative family structures such as single-parent households, same-sex couples, and blended families, it is essential to recognize the importance of parental responsibility in ensuring the well-being of children. 
An individual can acquire parental responsibility through adoption or birth, and in some cases, by virtue of their relationship with the child, such as a step-parent or grandparent. The recognition of these different ways of acquiring parental responsibility ensures that children are protected and provided for by those who have a genuine commitment to their welfare.
In conclusion, legal parentage and parental responsibility play a crucial role in family law, and their coherence with modern family life ensures that children are protected and provided for irrespective of their family structure.
