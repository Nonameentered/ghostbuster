Plato's proposal of an ideal state in his work "The Republic" has been a subject of much debate and discussion in political philosophy. One of the main criticisms of this proposed state is that it is elitist in nature. This essay seeks to explore this claim and analyze the selection process and attributes of the Philosopher Kings and the Guardian Class, as well as the eugenic breeding program to determine whether or not this model state aligns with the standard definition of elitism.
First, it is important to define what is meant by the term "elitism." Elitism refers to the belief that certain individuals or groups are inherently superior to others and therefore have a greater claim to power and authority. It also entails the exclusion of those who are deemed inferior or unworthy of participation in the decision-making process and governance. With this definition in mind, we can examine whether Plato's proposed state is elitist.
In "The Republic," Plato proposes a hierarchical society consisting of three classes: the ruling class of Philosopher Kings, the auxiliaries or Guardian Class, and the common people. The Philosopher Kings are selected based on their innate qualities, such as wisdom, intelligence, and moral virtue, which they acquire through philosophical education and training. The Guardian Class, on the other hand, is selected based on their physical prowess and courage, as they are responsible for defending the state from external threats and maintaining social order.
In terms of attributes, Plato believes that the Philosopher Kings possess unique qualities that make them the most qualified to rule. He argues that they have a higher level of understanding and knowledge, as they have received a comprehensive education in philosophy, mathematics, and science. They are also virtuous and just, as they have developed a deep understanding of the nature of morality and ethics through their philosophical studies.
Plato's argument for why the Philosopher Kings should rule comes from a belief that only those with a true understanding of justice and the good life can provide proper direction to a society. As Plato argued in his other works, the majority of people get caught up in their daily lives and individual desires, failing to see the bigger picture of what is truly important for society as a whole. From this viewpoint, the philosopher king would be able to make decisions based on a holistic perspective and act in the best interest of society as a whole.
Plato argues that the selection of the Philosopher Kings should be based solely on their merit and qualifications, and not on their background or status. Anyone who possesses the necessary qualities can become a Philosopher King, regardless of their social class or economic background. This, in essence, goes against the idea of elitism, where only certain individuals or groups are deemed worthy of power.
However, the selection process for the Guardian Class paints a different picture. The Guardian Class is selected based on their physical strength and ability to serve in the military. This is a clear example of elitism, as not everyone can meet the physical requirements necessary to be a member of the Guardian Class. This selection process implies that certain physical characteristics are more desirable than others, which goes against the idea of equal opportunity.
Furthermore, Plato proposes a strict eugenic breeding program designed to produce the most physically and mentally superior offspring in the state. This breeding program involves the careful selection of potential parents based on their qualities and characteristics. This program directly contradicts the idea of equal opportunity, as not everyone has the same genetic makeup or physical attributes. This program suggests that only those who meet the specific criteria are worthy of reproducing, which fits the definition of elitism.
In conclusion, while Plato's proposed state may not be elitist in its selection of the Philosopher Kings, the selection process and attributes for the Guardian Class, as well as the eugenic breeding program, suggest elitism. It is important to consider the implications and consequences of such an elitist system before making a judgment on whether Plato's proposed state is desirable or not. Nevertheless, it is clear that Plato did not subscribe to an egalitarian vision of society but rather believed that only those who possessed specific qualities were deemed capable of governing effectively.
