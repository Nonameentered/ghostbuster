Learning a new language can be a challenging task for many students. It requires dedication, time, and effort to develop several language skills. Nonetheless, the benefits of fluently speaking a second or third language are countless. In recent years, the demand for multilingual individuals has increased in the global market, making proficiency in multiple languages a valuable asset. Among the language skills, the author believes that speaking will be the most important for students to learn in the next 20 years.
Being proficient in speaking a second language allows individuals to communicate effectively and build relationships with people from different backgrounds. The author considers this skill to be far more important than reading or writing because situations where individuals need to express their ideas or thoughts orally are more frequent than instances where they need to write or read in a second language. For instance, job interviews, meetings, and social interactions all require individuals to communicate orally to express their ideas and build connections.
The author argues that in the next 20 years, speaking will be the most important because of the ongoing advancements in technology and communications. The world has become more globalized, and individuals no longer need to be in the same geographical location to work or communicate with each other. With tools like video conferencing and messaging apps, remote work or collaborations have become more common. Speaking a second language will allow individuals to communicate effectively with people from different parts of the world and benefit from the opportunities that globalization provides.
Teaching listening, on the other hand, is a more challenging task. The author identifies several obstacles that teachers face when teaching listening. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in assessing listening skills objectively. Teachers’ evaluations of their students' listening abilities can be subjective, raising questions about the credibility and accuracy of the assessment.
Another obstacle to teaching listening is ensuring that students are physically and intellectually engaged in the listening activity. Students can easily lose focus and become disinterested in the lesson if they find it too challenging or not engaging.
The author has had some personal experiences with listening as a language skill. Growing up, the author learned English as a second language. While the author’s reading and writing skills were excellent, listening proved to be more of a challenge. The author struggled to understand the language when spoken by native speakers due to differences in intonation and pitch.
The author overcame this challenge by consistently practicing listening through various media such as music, movies, and TV shows in English. The author believes that exposure to the language is the key to developing listening skills. Listening to a language regularly and in different contexts improves comprehension and acclimatizes the ear to diverse intonations and accents.
Reflecting on the author's Microteaching experience, the author found the experience to be both challenging and enlightening. The Microteaching lesson focused on developing students' listening skills by using a short audio clip. The author faced some challenges in engaging the students, and some were not initially interested in the lesson. Nonetheless, the author employed some strategies like repetition and visual aids to improve engagement and help students focus on developing their listening skills effectively.
The experience taught the author the importance of preparing adequately for lessons, creating an engaging and conducive learning environment, and using different teaching strategies to improve students' understanding and engagement. The author also learned that understanding students' strengths and weaknesses in language learning is critical to successful teaching.
In conclusion, speaking is the most important language skill for students to learn in the next 20 years. With globalization and the growing demand for multilingual individuals, communication and interpersonal skills have become more valuable. While listening is a vital skill, it poses some challenges when teaching, and students may find it harder to develop than speaking skills. Nevertheless, with proper practice and exposure to the language, students can develop excellent listening skills. The author’s Microteaching experience was a captivating learning opportunity that underscored the importance of preparation, engagement, and the proper implementation of teaching strategies in improving students' listening abilities.
