The poems "Her First Week" and "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" are two poems that showcase varied perspectives through the use of different techniques such as pronouns, lexis, and grammatical structure. These poems offer unique insights that merit exploration regarding how language is used to shape thematic variations and perspectives. The purpose of this essay is to compare and contrast these two poems and analyze how these aspects contribute to each poem's different perspectives and themes.
Pronouns are a critical aspect of poetry that help the reader to identify the speaker and the one being spoken to or about. In "Her First Week," Karina Borowicz's poem, the pronouns used, create a sense of intimacy that invites the reader to join in the speaker's life experience. The poem follows the life of a new mother, who is relishing the early moments with her newborn child. The speaker keeps using the first-person singular pronoun "I" to offer a sense of the mother's inner thoughts and emotions. For instance, the opening lines state, "I placed her on the center / of the bed because she wouldn't stop crying and so / I could change my shirt." From this point, the speaker uses "she" to refer to her daughter, who's the center of the poem. 
On the other hand, in "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument," Anne Stevenson's poem, the pronouns used create a sense of distance and objectivity that gives room for the reader to interpret the poem in their way. The poem is about observing things around the speaker and the world at large. The speaker creates a sense of distance through the use of the third-person pronoun "it" to refer to objects they are observing. Moreover, the speaker rarely uses first-person singular pronouns, "I," or first-person plural pronoun, "we.". However, some instances of the first-person plural "we" have been used, in lines such as "we gasp" and "If we could think like light, we'd break all boundaries." 
In terms of lexis, the choice of words used by Borowicz in "Her First Week" is simple, with a focus on everyday words that resonate with the reader. As such, the poem uses words that evoke a mother's love for her child and the simple joys of motherhood. The simplicity of the lexis in the poem reflects the focused life the speaker is currently experiencing. The language choice provides an insight into the mother's thoughts and feelings.
On the other hand, Stevenson in "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" uses a complex vocabulary that challenges the reader's interpretation of the poem. For instance, lines such as "we're blind unless / we are looking through something" reflects the complexity of the language used. The use of metaphors helps in evoking these complex ideas.
Furthermore, the grammatical structure in both poems is different. In "Her First Week," the structure is simple, with short lines, some of which are onomatopoeic to create a sense of atmosphere and mood. The poem is divided into seven unequal sections, each section representing a new day in the first week of the baby's life. For instance, the opening lines of day four, "Four days and nights of nursing and sweating / sleep and waking and nursing / and finally, a long crying jag that could not seem to break" represent a sense of routine structured by clear line breaks in the poem.
The structural organization of "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" is more complicated, with a variation of long and short lines that contribute to a sense of rhythm that reflects the idea of music. The poem does not have stanzas but is divided into several segments that all differ in tone, formatting, and vocabulary. The form of the poem reflects the speaker's attempt to demonstrate the beauty and complexity of the world.
The choice of language and structure in both poems serves to communicate the poets' unique perspectives on the world. In "Her First Week," the focus is on the joys of motherhood as a new mother bonds with her newborn child. The poem is a celebration of life, and the simple language, and innocuous structure, allow the reader to become a part of that celebration, experiencing the joy and awe of new parenthood.
On the other hand, "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" reflects Stevenson's perspective on the complexity and beauty of the world, challenging the reader's perception of the world through its use of metaphors and complex vocabulary. The structure of the poem is meant to reflect the musicality of the world, with the poem inviting the reader to observe and appreciate the beauty of the world as the speaker observes it.
In conclusion, these two poems offer unique perspectives on the world through their respective use of pronouns, lexis, and grammatical structure. Borowicz's "Her First Week," traces the beauty of the first week of a newborn baby's life, the intimacy of motherhood, and the simplicity of joy. On the other hand, Stevenson's "The Spirit is too Blunt an Instrument" exposes the complexities of the world, inviting the reader to contemplate the beauty of the universe. Through close examination of each element of both poems, one can see that Borowicz's use of personal pronouns, simple lexis, and structure, and Stevenson's use of complex lexis, structural complexity, and metaphors, functions to shape the themes and overall message of each poem.
