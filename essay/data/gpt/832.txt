Colorectal cancer, also known as bowel cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the colon or rectum. It is the third most common type of cancer globally, with over 1.4 million cases and 700,000 deaths every year. The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing, particularly in more developed countries, where a sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in red and processed meat are more prevalent. In this essay, I will discuss the risk factors for developing colorectal cancer, how it can be detected early, how it is treated, and the factors that should be considered when deciding on a treatment option. Additionally, I will talk about the issues that need to be addressed to increase engagement in screening programs and reduce the stigma around stoma bags.
The risk factors for developing colorectal cancer are numerous and varied. Age is a significant factor, as 90% of cases occur in people over 50. Family history, particularly a first-degree relative with the disease, increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer by two to three times. Inherited genetic conditions such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can also increase the risk. A diet high in red and processed meat, low in fiber, fruit and vegetables, and high in fat may also increase the risk. Obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption are also associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Detection of colorectal cancer in its early stages is important as early detection results in a better prognosis and a higher chance of survival. Screening for colorectal cancer can involve several methods, including fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. The FOBT test detects blood in the stool, which can indicate the presence of cancer. Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy involve inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the rectum or colon to examine the area. Colonoscopy is a more invasive procedure than sigmoidoscopy; however, it allows for the removal of precancerous polyps. The American Cancer Society recommends that people at an average risk of colorectal cancer start screening at age 45, while those at a higher risk start screening earlier.
The treatment of colorectal cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and the patient's personal preference. The main treatment options for colorectal cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery involves the removal of the cancerous tumour and surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often used in combination with surgery to target any remaining cancer cells.
When deciding on a treatment option, factors such as the patient's age, the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and the patient's personal preference should be considered. For example, older patients may not tolerate aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and they may prefer less invasive treatment options such as surgery. Also, if the cancer is in the early stages, surgery alone may be an effective treatment option without the need for chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
One issue that needs to be addressed to increase engagement in screening programs is the lack of public awareness about the importance of early detection. Many people are unaware of the recommended age to start screening, and some may avoid screening due to fear or discomfort. Increasing public education and awareness campaigns about the importance of screening could help to encourage more people to participate in screening programs.
Another issue that needs to be addressed is the stigma around stoma bags. A stoma bag is a small bag attached to the skin on the abdomen to collect waste from the intestines. It is sometimes necessary for people who have had surgery for colorectal cancer or other diseases affecting the intestines. However, many people feel embarrassed about their stoma bag and may avoid social situations or activities. Increasing awareness and education about stoma bags and reducing the stigma could help people feel more comfortable and confident in their daily lives.
In conclusion, colorectal cancer is a common type of cancer that can be detected early through screening. There are several risk factors for developing colorectal cancer, including age, family history, diet, and lifestyle. Treatment options depend on several factors, including the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health, and treatment decisions should be made with the patient's preferences in mind. Increasing awareness and education about the importance of screening and reducing the stigma around stoma bags are important steps in reducing the incidence and impact of colorectal cancer.
