Oscar Wilde, known for his wit, satire, and flamboyant lifestyle, is considered one of the most significant literary figures of the late 19th century. His works, including The Importance of Being Earnest, A Picture of Dorian Gray, and The Ballad of Reading Gaol, are known for their sharp social commentary and biting humor.
Wildeâ€™s philosophy of trivializing the serious in his literature is rooted in his belief in the importance of aesthetics and pleasure in life. He believed that art should not serve a moral or didactic purpose but should exist solely to bring pleasure to the viewer or reader. In his view, seriousness and morality were often obstacles to aesthetic pleasure and should be avoided or trivialized in the arts.
This philosophy is evident in his writing. For example, The Importance of Being Earnest, one of his most famous plays, is a satire of society and its social conventions, particularly regarding marriage and class. The play pokes fun at the Victorian belief in the sanctity of marriage and the importance of appearing respectable in society. Throughout the play, characters use deception and trickery to get what they want, and the plot becomes increasingly absurd. By trivializing the serious topic of marriage, Wilde is able to make a commentary on society's values and highlight the ridiculousness of its conventions.
Similarly, A Picture of Dorian Gray has been described as a critique of Victorian morality. The novel tells the story of a young man, Dorian Gray, who becomes obsessed with his own beauty and youth after having his portrait painted. As he engages in increasingly immoral behavior, his portrait ages and becomes grotesque, while he remains young and beautiful. The novel is a commentary on the hypocrisy of Victorian society, which publicly valued morality and virtue but privately indulged in vice and debauchery. By trivializing the seriousness of morality and using a supernatural element, Wilde is able to make a bold statement on the societal norms of his time.
Wilde's philosophy of trivializing the serious is also evident in his poetry. The Ballad of Reading Gaol, written after Wilde was imprisoned for homosexuality, is a poem about the brutal treatment of prisoners in jail. However, instead of focusing on the horror of the situation, Wilde takes a more detached and ironic approach. The poem is written in a ballad form, which is traditionally associated with light and humorous topics. The use of the ballad form makes the poem seem less serious, despite its content. Through this poetic form, Wilde is able to comment on the inhumane treatment of prisoners while maintaining his belief in the importance of aesthetics and pleasure in art.
Overall, Wilde's philosophy of trivializing the serious in his literature has had a significant impact on his works. By using irony, satire, and detachment, he is able to make a statement on serious societal issues while maintaining his belief in the importance of aesthetic pleasure. His works continue to be read and admired for their wit, humor, and social commentary and remain relevant today.
