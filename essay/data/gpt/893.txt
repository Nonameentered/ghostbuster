Introduction
In the field of healthcare, ethical dilemmas are unavoidable due to the nature of the profession. These dilemmas may arise from various sources, including conflicts of interest, patient autonomy, and medical uncertainty. This essay discusses an ethical dilemma encountered in practice, analyzing it in relation to philosophical and professional ethics. The essay highlights the best resolution, counter-arguments, and how the learning experience will influence future practice, with a focus on the ethical principle of respecting patient autonomy.
The Ethical Dilemma
The ethical dilemma encountered in practice is a conflict of interest between a patient's autonomy and the need to protect the patient from harm. The dilemma involves Mrs. Wilson, a 70-year-old lady with a long-standing history of hypertension, who was hospitalized for persistent chest pain. The attending physician recommended performing an angiogram to diagnose her condition and offered two options, to perform the angiogram or not to do so.
Mrs. Wilson, a devout Jehovah's Witness, refused the procedure as it would involve the use of blood products. The medical team was concerned that Mrs. Wilson's condition could worsen without the procedure, and she could possibly die. The medical team was unsure whether to respect the patient's autonomy and honor her refusal or override her decision to perform the procedure to save her life.
Philosophical and Professional Ethics
The philosophical and professional principles of ethics relevant to this dilemma are the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. The principle of autonomy affirms that patients have the right to make their healthcare decisions, even if those decisions may result in adverse outcomes. The principle of beneficence mandates healthcare providers to act in the best interest of the patient, promoting their well-being, and avoiding harm. The principle of non-maleficence requires healthcare providers to do no harm to their patients. The principle of justice requires that healthcare providers make decisions based on impartiality, fairness, and equality.
In this dilemma, the principle of patient autonomy conflicts with the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. The medical team has a duty to save Mrs. Wilson's life, but Mrs. Wilson has the right to refuse the procedure based on her religious beliefs.
Resolution
The best resolution in this scenario is to respect Mrs. Wilson's autonomy and honor her refusal. The medical team can offer alternative treatment options that do not involve the use of blood products, such as non-invasive cardiac imaging and medication management.
Counter-Arguments
The counterargument to this resolution is that healthcare providers have a duty to protect the patient from harm and ensure their well-being. The medical team is responsible for providing the best possible care and achieving the best possible outcomes. Performing the angiogram is the best option to diagnose and treat Mrs. Wilson's condition effectively. 
However, compromising the patient's autonomy can have significant implications for the ethical principles of healthcare. Overriding Mrs. Wilson's refusal could lead to distrust between the patient and the medical team, breach of confidentiality, and negatively impact the therapeutic relationship. It is crucial that the medical team balances the ethical principles involved in the decision-making process.
Reflection 
The experience has underscored the importance of respecting patient autonomy and upholding ethical principles in healthcare. The reflection highlights the need to understand the patient's values, beliefs, and preferences and recognizing that healthcare decisions should be mutual and based on shared decision-making. 
The ethical principle of respecting patient autonomy requires that healthcare providers facilitate the decision-making process by providing accurate and adequate information, acknowledging and respecting the patient's preferences, values, and beliefs, and involving the patient in the decision-making process.
Conclusion 
In conclusion, upholding ethical principles in healthcare is paramount to providing safe, effective, and high-quality patient care. The ethical dilemma encountered in practice involving Mrs. Wilson highlights the importance of respecting patient autonomy, promoting shared decision-making, and balancing the ethical principles involved in decision-making processes. The best resolution is to respect Mrs. Wilson's refusal and offer alternative treatment options that align with her values and preferences, while ensuring that her safety and well-being are not compromised. Maintaining ethical and professional standards in healthcare is crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence of patients and promoting a positive therapeutic relationship.
