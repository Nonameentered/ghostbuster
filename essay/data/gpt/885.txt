The Empire Glass Company has been in the business of manufacturing glass products for almost a century and is known for its high-quality products and exceptional customer service. The company has been using a budgetary control system to manage its finances and achieve its corporate goals. This system has several strengths and weaknesses, and some improvements can be made to ensure cost reduction, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction.
Budgetary control system is a tool that helps management to allocate company resources efficiently. The system involves preparing budgets, monitoring progress against budgets, taking corrective actions, and evaluating performance. The Empire Glass Company uses budgetary control to set standards, measure performance, and take corrective action where necessary. This system is quite useful in creating a corporate direction because it helps management to plan and budget for the future, and ensure that the company objectives are met.
The strengths of the budgetary control system used by the Empire Glass Company include the ability to set goals and direction, efficient allocation of resources, identification of problems, and the ability to take corrective action. Budgets help management to set goals and objectives for the Glass Product Division, which align with the overall objectives of the company. Once budgets are set, resources can be allocated efficiently, and any deviations from budgets can be identified, and corrective actions taken. The weaknesses of this system, however, include inflexibility and rigidity, inadequate involvement of lower-level employees, and difficulty in adapting to unforeseen situations.
To improve planning and budgeting procedures, the Glass Product Division can adopt a participative budgeting approach that involves lower-level employees in the budget preparation process. This will help create a sense of ownership among employees and improve the accuracy of the budget. In addition, a more flexible budget can be adopted, which allows for adjustments to be made in response to unforeseen situations or changes in market conditions.
Through the adoption of a reward structure that is aligned with the company's objectives of cost reduction and continuous improvement, the Glass Product Division can encourage employees to contribute positively towards achieving these objectives. Accountability structures should also be established to ensure that employees are held responsible for meeting their budget targets.
The mutual dependency concept can be implemented to ensure that customer satisfaction is prioritized. The company can establish relationships with suppliers to ensure continuity in supply and manage costs. Besides, the balance scorecard framework can be adopted, which considers more than just financial performance. The framework balances financial performance, customer satisfaction, internal process improvement, and growth and learning to achieve a well-rounded performance analysis of the Glass Product Division as well as the overall company.
The Glass Product Division is not fully represented by the management group. Employee perspectives can be analyzed to gain a better understanding of the division's operations. Structured feedback mechanisms, such as employee surveys, can be used to gather employee insights and address any issues of concern. Regular departmental reviews can also be conducted to ensure that the division's objectives are being met and progress is being made towards achieving the company's objectives.
In conclusion, the budgetary control system is a useful tool for the Empire Glass Company in creating a corporate direction. Though it has some weaknesses, improvements to the planning and budgeting procedures, accountability structures, reward structure and the adoption of frameworks will ensure cost reduction, continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction. Efforts should also be made to better understand the insights of employees in the Glass Product Division to ensure comprehensive performance analysis.
