In today's world, communication is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of human life. Every day, people tend to rely heavily on news sources to acquire relevant information about diverse fields, including sports. Match reports of the English national football team's games are some of the most sought-after news sources for sports enthusiasts. However, the use of adjectives in such reports varies depending on the news source. In this essay, I will explore how the use of adjectives differs between broadsheet newspapers and online news sites in match reports of the English national football team's games, and what this suggests about their target audiences and the purpose of reporting.
In broadsheet newspapers, the use of adjectives in match reports of the English national football team's games tends to be subtle compared to online news sites. Unlike online news sites, most broadsheet newspapers target a wide audience, ranging from those who are highly literate and intellectually curious to individuals with limited education background. Therefore, the use of adjectives tends to be diverse, and the language used is formal, without a lot of bias to any particular team. Suppose the English national football team has won a game. In that case, the use of adjectives in broadsheet newspapers tends to be factual, highlighting how many goals the team scored, the team's effort and its success. The reporting in broadsheet newspapers tends to be focused solely on the game's outcomes rather than the personal experiences of the players or any controversy surrounding the match.
On the other hand, online news sites tend to use more biased and opinionated adjectives, compared to broadsheet newspapers. This is mostly because online news sites are easily accessible, and the majority of the audience tends to be younger people who tend to use the internet more frequently. These sites tend to be more conversational, and the language used is not as formal compared to broadsheet newspapers. Most people reading articles on online news sites are usually more interested in getting an opinion or personal experience, rather than just plain facts. As such, the use of adjectives on these sites tends to be more opinionated and influenced by the author's personal experience compared to broadsheet newspapers.
Furthermore, online news sites tend to use more emotional adjectives compared to broadsheet newspapers. Emotional adjectives such as "amazing," "mind-blowing," and "unbelievable" are commonly used to describe the performance of the English national football team. These emotional adjectives tend to add an element of excitement to the report, making it more entertaining to read. Moreover, online news sites tend to add commentary on the game, highlighting the team's strengths and weaknesses in comparison to the opposing team. For instance, suppose the English national football team drew or lost to an opposing team. In that case, online news sites are likely to provide an explanation of why the team did not win, highlighting tactical and players' mistakes, if any.
The difference in the use of adjectives between broadsheet newspapers and online news sites indicates their target audiences and the purpose of reporting. Broadsheet newspapers report on the match's outcome and tend to appeal to a broader audience, including those who are highly literate and intellectually curious. These newspapers strive to maintain a neutral and objective stance in their reporting, presenting the facts as accurately as possible. However, online news sites are highly biased towards the English national football team's success, and the use of adjectives is emotional and opinionated. The target audience for online news sites tends to be younger people who are more interested in getting an opinion or personal experience of the match rather than just plain facts.
In conclusion, the use of adjectives in match reports of the English national football team's games varies depending on the type of news source. While broadsheet newspapers tend to keep the use of adjectives subtle, online news sites tend to use more emotional and opinionated adjectives. This difference indicates their target audiences and the purpose of reporting. Online news sites are more biased towards the English national football team's success and tend to appeal to a younger audience interested in personal experiences and opinions. In contrast, broadsheet newspapers maintain a neutral and objective stance, reporting facts and appealing to a broader audience. These differences in the use of adjectives emphasize the importance of selecting diverse news sources to acquire accurate and impartial information.
