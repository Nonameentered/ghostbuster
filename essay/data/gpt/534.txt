The doctrine of intention to create legal relations is a fundamental principle in contract law. It is the principle that states that parties to a contract must have the intention to create legal relations for the contract to be legally binding. In contract law, a contract is only valid if it meets certain requirements, of which the intention to create legal relations is one. In this essay, we will examine the doctrine of intention to create legal relations in contract law and how courts use hidden policy considerations to determine the intent to create a valid contract. We will explore both the support and criticism of this approach, and provide our own analysis.
The doctrine of intention to create legal relations is based on the premise that contracts are legally binding agreements between parties. For a contract to be valid, the contracting parties must have the intention to create legal relations. This means that the parties must have intended that the agreement they entered into should be legally binding and enforceable. The intention to create legal relations is presumed in commercial and business agreements, but it is not presumed in social and domestic agreements unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.
The doctrine of intention to create legal relations is used by courts to determine whether a contract has been formed. In determining the intention of the parties to create legal relations, the court will look at the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract. This includes the nature of the relationship between the parties, the context in which the contract was formed, and any other relevant factors. Courts will also look at the language used in the contract, and the conduct of the parties both before and after the contract was formed.
However, courts do not rely solely on the doctrine of intention to create legal relations in determining whether a contract has been formed. Courts also use hidden policy considerations to determine the intent of the parties. Hidden policy considerations are policy considerations that are not explicitly stated in the contract, but are implied by the court based on the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract. Hidden policy considerations allow the court to consider other factors that may have influenced the intent of the parties.
One of the key criticisms of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations is that it can be subjective. Different judges may interpret the intent of the parties differently based on their personal views and opinions. This can lead to inconsistent outcomes in contract law cases, which can be frustrating for businesses and individuals who rely on the law to provide certainty and predictability. Another criticism is that the doctrine of intention to create legal relations can be arbitrary. The court may rely on hidden policy considerations that are not directly related to the intent of the parties, which can lead to outcomes that are not fair or just.
Supporters of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations argue that it is necessary to ensure that contracts are legally binding and enforceable. Without the requirement of intent, there would be no way to distinguish between agreements that are legally binding and those that are not. This could lead to chaos and uncertainty in commercial and business relationships.
Proponents of the use of hidden policy considerations argue that it is necessary to ensure that contracts are fair and just. Hidden policy considerations allow courts to consider factors that may have influenced the intent of the parties, and to ensure that the outcome of the case is in line with public policy objectives. This can lead to outcomes that are more equitable, and that protect vulnerable parties from exploitation.
Our analysis of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations in contract law is that it is a necessary and fundamental principle. Contracts are important legal instruments that are used to govern relationships between parties, and it is essential that they are legally binding and enforceable. The doctrine of intention to create legal relations ensures that only contracts that meet certain requirements are valid, which provides certainty and predictability in commercial and business relationships.
However, we do have some concerns about the use of hidden policy considerations by courts to determine the intent of the parties. While we acknowledge that there may be situations where hidden policy considerations are necessary to ensure that contracts are fair and just, we also believe that there is a risk that they may be abused by the court. This could lead to arbitrary outcomes that are not based on the intent of the parties, which would undermine the fundamental principle of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations.
In conclusion, the doctrine of intention to create legal relations is a fundamental principle in contract law that is used to determine whether a contract is legally binding and enforceable. While the use of hidden policy considerations by courts to determine the intent of the parties may be necessary in some situations, there is also a risk that it may be used arbitrarily. As such, we believe that it is essential that courts are careful and considered in their use of hidden policy considerations, to ensure that the outcomes of contract law cases are fair and just.
