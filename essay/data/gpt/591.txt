Induction has long been debated as a controversial and divisive principle in scientific inquiry. Where some scientists believe it is a necessary tool for separating true statements about the world from those that are false, others view the process as neither valid nor reliable. Both sides have presented strong arguments to support their respective positions. The purpose of this essay is to explore the legitimacy of induction as an acceptable scientific principle for separating true statements about the world from those that are false in empirical science. 
Induction is the process of generalizing observations based on repeated experiences or patterns. The foundation of the process relies on the idea that observed patterns likely exist in the larger world, and that this confirmation of patterns can be used to generate new predictions about occurrences in the future. As such, induction can help researchers to make inferences and predictions based on observed patterns, without requiring complete and exact knowledge of every element in the situation. 
Opponents argue that induction is inherently flawed because it creates logical problems with scientific reasoning, known as the "problem of induction." This problem arises from the fact that no number of observations can logically guarantee the truth of a hypothesis. In other words, an observation can provide evidence to support a hypothesis, but there is always a chance for error, since the hypothesis cannot be directly observed. 
Moreover, opponents of induction argue that it is too subjective, and that every person's interpretation of data will differ. They argue that scientists heavily rely on their intuition, bias and experiences, all of which introduce subjectivity. Induction, thus, operates like a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading researchers to identify patterns that are more likely to agree with their intended results. Hence, the results lose validity and are not generalized. 
On the other hand, supporters of induction recognise the same problems as opponents. However, instead of believing that induction is a flaw of scientific inquiry, they argue that the concept is an unavoidable part of generating scientific knowledge and predictions. By using induction, scientists can still identify recurring patterns from their observations, leading them to believe that a certain hypothesis is true with a certain degree of probability. Scientists can never be absolutely sure, but induction can provide a more comprehensive and less fallible understanding of the world. 
Furthermore, supporters of induction believe that induction can still be used in natural sciences to produce accurate results. For instance, in physics, the theory of gravity establishes laws on how objects behave in space, which are based on the observed patterns of objects' behaviour. These laws are not absolute yet they are relied upon to make predictions that can be tested by empirical experiments. As a result, induction is crucial to scientific inquiry since through it, they can infer scientific conclusions from what occurs in repetitive patterns.
Thus, induction can be viewed as both legitimate and necessary, to some but not all extent, in scientific inquiry to yield answers to questions about the world. Opponents argue its subjective nature while supporters defend its paradoxical nature. Although induction does not give complete certainty about the truth of a hypothesis, scientists can use it to generate hypotheses and predictions that can be tested through repeated experiments. Therefore, having a balance between induction and deduction can lead to a more robust scientific method as they both complement each other, providing reliable results that can support scientific theory.
