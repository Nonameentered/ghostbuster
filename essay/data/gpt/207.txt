The theft of mobile phones is a common crime in the modern era of technology. The low level of security of these devices makes them an easy target for thieves, particularly in public transport where they can blend in with the crowd. Felicity and Amy's attempted theft of mobile phones on a train raises several legal implications, including their potential liability in relation to theft, conspiracy, and attempted theft.
Under the Criminal Law Act 1967, theft is defined as "dishonestly taking property belonging to another person with the intention of permanently depriving them of it." The essential elements that need to be present for a theft offense to be made out are the taking, dishonesty, belonging to another, and the intention of permanently depriving the owner.
Felicity and Amy's actions on the train clearly fulfill all the elements of theft. They intended to take mobile phones that belonged to other passengers on the train, and they did so without their consent. Felicity and Amy were acting dishonestly, as they knew that they did not have the right to take these phones. Their intention was to keep the phones permanently, thus depriving the rightful owners of them.
However, despite fulfilling all the essential elements of theft, Felicity and Amy were unable to complete their crime due to police intervention. This raises the question of whether they can be held liable for attempted theft.
The Criminal Attempts Act 1981 provides that a person is guilty of an attempt to commit an offense if they intend to commit an offense and take steps toward its commission, but the offense does not occur for reasons outside their control. In Felicity and Amy's case, it can be argued that they attempted to steal mobile phones on the train, but their plan was thwarted by police intervention.
The act of attempting to steal is an offense in itself, and attempters can be held liable for their actions, even if they fail to complete the crime. Therefore, Felicity and Amy can be held liable for attempted theft, even though they did not manage to steal the phones.
A further legal implication of Felicity and Amy's attempted theft is conspiracy. The Law of Property Act 1925 provides that two or more people can be found guilty of an offense if they agree to commit the offense and take steps toward its commission.
Felicity and Amy's actions on the train can be seen as a form of conspiracy, as they agreed to steal mobile phones and took steps toward its commission. They planned their actions in advance, discussed their plan, and were acting together to achieve their goal.
Conspiracy can lead to a higher sentence than the underlying offense, as it is seen as a more significant threat to society. Felicity and Amy can, therefore, be held liable for conspiracy, in addition to attempted theft.
However, their potential liability does not end here. Felicity's actions towards Delia could be considered malice, which could fulfill the legal requirements for unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter.
Unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter requires three essential elements to be present. Firstly, there should be a significant unlawful act, such as theft. Secondly, this act should be a significant cause of the victim's death, even if there are other contributing factors. Finally, the act should be dangerous and likely to cause serious harm to others.
In Felicity's case, her actions towards Delia were undoubtedly unlawful. She assaulted her by pushing her into the door and causing her to fall. This act was a significant cause of Delia's death, as the fall caused her to suffer a head injury that led to her death.
Finally, Felicity's act was dangerous and could have resulted in serious harm to other passengers on the train. Her actions endangered the safety of others and put them at risk of injury.
Therefore, Felicity can be held liable for the unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter of Delia.
Lastly, the law of attempts has been a topic of debate, particularly concerning the culpability of attempters who fail due to police intervention or choose to abandon their crime.
The Criminal Attempts Act 1981 provides that the act of attempting to commit an offense is an offense in itself. However, some have argued that attempters who fail due to police intervention or choose to abandon their crime should not be held liable for their actions.
The argument is that attempters who fail due to police intervention or choose to abandon their crime have not caused any harm, and they should not be punished for their actions. Furthermore, holding them liable could have a chilling effect on legitimate activities, as people may be deterred from engaging in actions that could be seen as criminal, even if they have no intention of committing a crime.
However, others have argued that it is necessary to hold attempters liable for their actions, even if they fail to complete the crime. The reasoning is that attempting to commit an offense is an offense in itself, and it is essential to deter people from engaging in such behavior.
Moreover, attempters who fail due to police intervention or choose to abandon their crime have still taken the first steps towards committing the offense. They have demonstrated their intent to break the law and should, therefore, be held accountable for their actions.
In conclusion, Felicity and Amy's attempted theft of mobile phones on a train raises several legal implications, including their potential liability in relation to theft, conspiracy, and attempted theft. Felicity's actions towards Delia could be considered malice and fulfill the legal requirements for unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. The law of attempts has been a topic of debate, but it is necessary to hold attempters liable for their actions, even if they fail due to police intervention or choose to abandon their crime. The law of theft, conspiracy, and attempts are critical to ensuring that society remains safe and that those who break the law are held accountable for their actions.
