Dietary reference values (DRV) are a set of recommendations for the intake of macronutrients and micronutrients to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In the UK, these values are set by the Department of Health and are based on various factors such as age, sex, and physical activity levels. The DRV for macronutrients in the UK are set at 50% for carbohydrates, 35% for fat, and 15% for protein. For micronutrients, the DRV includes recommended daily intakes of vitamins and minerals. However, a recent study has shown that the dietary intake of male and female students in the UK does not meet these recommended DRV.
The study found that male students struggle to meet the recommended intake for protein, while female students struggle to meet the recommended intake for iron. Protein is a crucial macronutrient for building and repairing muscle tissues. It also plays an important role in maintaining a healthy metabolism and immune system. Iron, on the other hand, is an essential mineral that is required for the formation of red blood cells and transporting oxygen throughout the body. Insufficient intake of these nutrients can lead to severe health risks.
Excess intake of certain macronutrients and micronutrients can also lead to various health problems. For instance, excessive intake of fat can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and stroke. Excessive intake of sugar can lead to type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. Similarly, excessive intake of certain vitamins and minerals can lead to toxicities and health risks. For instance, excessive intake of vitamin A can cause liver damage, while excessive intake of iron can lead to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
To improve their dietary intake, male students must consume more protein-rich foods such as chicken, fish, eggs, and lean red meat. They can also try to incorporate protein supplements into their diet, such as whey protein powder. Female students, on the other hand, can improve their iron intake by consuming more iron-rich foods such as dark leafy greens, beans, and lentils. They can also try to eat more vitamin-C rich foods like citrus fruits, which will help with iron absorption.
There are some potential errors and limitations to consider when examining dietary intake using retrospective surveys like the FFQ. For instance, these surveys rely on self-reported data, which can be subject to biases. Participants may under or over-report their food intake, leading to inaccurate estimates of nutrient intake. Additionally, the FFQ only assesses dietary intake over a specific period, which may not accurately reflect the participant's long-term dietary habits. As such, it is important to complement dietary intake surveys with other forms of measurements, such as biomarkers, to validate the findings.
In conclusion, the dietary reference values of the UK are essential in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, studies have shown that male and female students in the UK do not meet these recommendations, particularly regarding protein and iron intake, respectively. Excess intake of certain macronutrients and micronutrients can also lead to severe health problems. To improve their dietary intake, male students must consume more protein-rich foods, while female students must consume more iron-rich foods. However, there are potential errors and limitations that must be considered when examining dietary intake using retrospective surveys like the FFQ. As such, it is important to validate the findings with other forms of measurement.
