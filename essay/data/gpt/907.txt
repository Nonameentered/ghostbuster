As a young adult in search of professional experience, I found myself fortunate enough to secure a job at Cowley Manor Hotel, a luxurious establishment nestled in the heart of the Cotswold countryside. Working at Cowley Manor Hotel has not only allowed me to hone my skills in the hospitality industry but also helped me grow as a person. Through my appraisals and reflective journaling, I have identified some strengths and weaknesses within myself while learning important lessons about leadership and conflict resolution.
My role at Cowley Manor Hotel was that of a trainee in the reception department. One of my strengths identified through my appraisals and reflective journaling was my willingness to learn from my colleagues. From day one, my colleagues embraced me, showing eagerness to involve me in tasks and share their knowledge with me. Cowley Manor Hotel is a thriving establishment that always highlights its team, making it a pleasure to work alongside team members who would take their time to explain what I needed to do and answer my questions. My willingness to be taught contributed to my growth during my time at Cowley Manor Hotel. My determination and work ethic also proved to be strengths, as I was always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that the guests were satisfactorily attended to.
A weakness identified through my appraisals was my fear of making mistakes. I have always struggled with anxious tendencies, and my job at Cowley Manor Hotel highlighted this. Though I was confident in my skills, I found myself worried about making mistakes that could negatively impact the establishment and, by extension, my job. This often led to second-guessing myself and feeling an immense sense of pressure, which, at times, made the job stressful. I also found it difficult to assert myself, especially when dealing with irate guests or difficult colleagues. Speaking up for myself was something I struggled with, and it often left me feeling unfulfilled since I found myself compromising too much in situations that warranted assertiveness.
One lesson I have learned about leadership is that it is not only about directing and leading others but also about listening and giving people the chance to lead when necessary. During my time at Cowley Manor Hotel, I interacted with a wide range of management personnel, all of whom had different styles of leadership. Though they all had different approaches, one thing I noticed across the board was that they all led by example. They understood that it was important to be part of the team, not just stand above it. Another valuable lesson was that conflict resolution is crucial in the hospitality industry. From my experience, guests can be unreasonable, and it is important to have a diplomatic approach to handling issues that arise. I observed my colleagues handling even the most challenging guests with grace and poise and learned that it is important to remain calm and polite, even in the midst of an agitated guest.
Moving forward, I intend to build on my strengths while working to improve my weaknesses. In future jobs, I hope to expand my industry knowledge by being more involved in the different departments of a hotel establishment. I have learned that it is important to have knowledge of the workings of various departments since it helps one to serve guests better and make informed decisions as an employee. I will also work to improve my assertiveness, especially when dealing with challenging situations. I believe that with time, practice, and mentorship, I can overcome this weakness and become an effective communicator.
Ensuring that I am honing my interpersonal skills is also important. Cowley Manor Hotel allowed me to interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds, and the experience was enriching. It helped me understand cultural differences and the need to be sensitive to them in everyday interactions at work and beyond. In future jobs, I will embrace diversity and use it to learn and grow.
In conclusion, working at Cowley Manor Hotel was a transformative experience. It allowed me to grow both professionally and personally while equipping me with skills that I can use beyond the hospitality industry. I identified strengths such as my work ethic and my willingness to learn, while identifying weaknesses such as my assertiveness issues and anxiety. Through my experience, I learned important lessons about leadership and conflict resolution, and I intend to build on these while ensuring that I am improving my shortcomings to become a well-rounded individual. Cowley Manor Hotel gave me a solid foundation on which to grow, and I am certain that the experience I gained there will serve me well in future professional endeavors.
