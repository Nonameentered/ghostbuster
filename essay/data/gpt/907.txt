The aim of this report is to present a simulation model of a car travelling over a pothole using MATLAB and SIMULINK. The model will be used to analyse the effects of the pothole on the car’s suspension system and to evaluate its performance during the passage over the pothole. The car model being considered includes the suspension system, which is crucial for providing a smooth and stable ride for passengers.
The system modelled and simulated in this report is a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) car suspension system. This model consists of a sprung mass and an unsprung mass, interconnected with a spring and damper arrangement. The spring represents the deformation of the tyre and suspension components, while the damper represents the resistance to motion of the suspension system due to the damping action of the shock absorbers.
The simulation model developed in MATLAB and SIMULINK uses numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the 2-DOF system. The simulation considers the impact of the pothole on the car suspension system and evaluates the car’s performance during the passage over the pothole. The analysis of the simulation results provides valuable insights into the dynamic behaviour of the car under different road conditions.
The report studies the behaviour of the car as it travels over a pothole by analysing the response of the suspension system to the impact. The specific aspects of the car model that are being considered include the displacement of the car body, the acceleration of the car, and the forces acting on the suspension components. These parameters are essential for understanding the performance of the car’s suspension system during the passage over the pothole.
The displacement of the car body is a key parameter that reflects the smoothness of the ride and the stability of the car. The simulation model calculates the displacement of the car body using the position of the sprung mass. The displacement of the car body increases as the pothole depth and width increase, indicating a rougher and less stable ride. On the other hand, a well-designed suspension system can reduce the displacement of the car body, leading to a smoother and more stable ride.
The acceleration of the car is another crucial parameter that affects the comfort and safety of the passengers. The simulation model calculates the acceleration of the car using the motion of the sprung mass. The acceleration of the car increases as the pothole depth and width increase, leading to a jarring and uncomfortable ride. A good suspension system should be able to reduce the acceleration of the car, providing a comfortable and safe ride for passengers.
The forces acting on the suspension components are also important parameters that can affect the durability and reliability of the suspension system. The simulation model calculates the forces acting on the spring and damper components of the suspension system using the equations of motion. The forces increase as the pothole depth and width increase, leading to higher stresses and strains on the suspension components. A well-designed suspension system should be able to withstand these forces, ensuring its durability and reliability.
In conclusion, this report presents a simulation model of a car travelling over a pothole using MATLAB and SIMULINK. The model evaluates the impact of the pothole on the car’s suspension system and analyses its performance during the passage over the pothole. The analysis of the simulation results provides valuable insights into the dynamic behaviour of the car’s suspension system under different road conditions. The specific aspects of the car model that are considered in this report include the displacement of the car body, the acceleration of the car, and the forces acting on the suspension components. These parameters are essential for understanding the performance of the car’s suspension system during the passage over the pothole. By developing a simulation model that can evaluate the effects of potholes on the suspension system, car manufacturers and designers can develop new strategies to improve the performance, comfort, and safety of cars.
