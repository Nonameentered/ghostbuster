The concepts of positive and negative liberty have been subject to debate and criticism since they were first proposed by 20th-century political philosophers. The dichotomy between these two concepts has been questioned due to the complexities of human freedom and the limitations of these two frameworks. Gerald MacCallum's view of a triadic relationship challenges the idea of a simple dichotomy between the two concepts by introducing a third form of liberty. This essay will examine the differences between positive and negative liberty and the criticisms they have faced. It will also look at MacCallum's view of a triadic relationship and how it contributes to the debate.
Negative liberty is the absence of external restrictions on an individual's freedom of choice and action. It is the freedom from interference from others or external institutions. Negative liberty emphasizes the importance of non-interference and non-coercion in individual liberty. Those who advocate for negative liberty believe that the government should limit its intervention in the lives of its citizens, allowing them to live their lives as they see fit. Negative liberty is often associated with the liberal tradition, with liberal philosophers like John Locke and John Stuart Mill advocating for this type of freedom.
On the other hand, positive liberty emphasizes an individual's capacity to act to fulfill their life goals. It is the freedom to pursue one's own interests while being provided with the necessary tools to achieve them. Positive liberty requires external institutions, such as the government, to provide individuals with the resources needed to achieve their goals. Those who advocate for positive liberty believe that the government should play an active role in ensuring equal opportunities and providing resources to satisfy basic needs like health care, education, and housing. Positive liberty is often associated with socialist and welfare state traditions.
The differences between positive and negative liberty have been criticized for their limitations. Critics of negative liberty claim that it is insufficient at protecting individuals from oppression by other individuals. They argue that negative liberty does nothing to address structural inequalities that restrict individuals' freedom. Without aid, many individuals cannot fully exercise their freedom, as they lack resources. In contrast, critics of positive liberty argue that it goes too far in requiring the government to ensure a particular living standard for their citizens, and that this leads to a violation of individual rights.
One respondent to the debate over negative versus positive liberty is Gerald MacCallum. According to MacCallum, a third concept, known as triadic liberty, resonates with the complexity of human freedom better. He suggests that the distinction between positive and negative freedom is oversimplified and the idea of introducing triadic liberty covers the shortcomings of the dichotomy. According to MacCallum, triadic liberty is defined as an individual's freedom to make decisions and act upon them by generating opportunities for the individual while ensuring an empathetic understanding of the individual's situation. 
MacCallum argued that the concept of liberty holds implications of more than just the individual. It is contextual and social, with triadic liberty being an idea recognizing the social reality behind its existence. Advocates of positive liberty emphasized the use of the state and other social resources to distribute societal resources equitably, while advocates of negative liberty emphasized the importance of private ownership and decreased state intervention, leading to the notion that individuals must be left alone to make decisions of their own accord. 
MacCallum's triadic approach would require us to reject the traditional view of negative and positive liberty, instead considering the matter from a three-dimensional perspective. The triadic view acknowledges the presence of others and the social context in which an individual lives.
MacCallum further argues that negative liberty is superficial and limited since it emphasizes non-interference rather than autonomy. Negative liberty is only possible in the absence of external interference, but an individual's actual liberty depends on their capacity to act and the opportunities available to them. Therefore, negative liberty does not guarantee real liberty, since even if there is no interference, an individual's potential for autonomous action is still underdeveloped. 
Positive liberty, on the other hand, is criticized by MacCallum for being too demanding and potentially oppressive. Under this view, social resources are distributed based on what is best for the individual, which often leads to a hierarchy of power in which someone is authorized to enact control over others. MacCallum argues that positive liberty's focus on the distribution of resources in pursuit of freedom, often creating confusion, and is not very clear on the relationship between the person and society.
MacCallum's triadic liberty fills the gap left by the deficiencies inherent to negative and positive liberty. By combining autonomy with the understanding of the social context, it recognizes that individual liberty is not just about the absence of interference but also relies on the opportunities, support systems, and resources available to act on one's decisions. According to MacCallum, the concept is broad enough to encapsulate both negative and positive liberty, making it a flexible and respectable approach to individual freedom.
In conclusion, the concepts of positive and negative liberty continue to be subject to debate and criticism. While negative liberty emphasizes non-interference and non-coercion in individual liberty, positive liberty requires external institutions to provide individuals with the resources needed to achieve their goals. MacCallum's triadic liberty view challenges the dichotomy between positive and negative liberty by introducing a third conception of liberty that considers the social context of human freedom. Triadic liberty acknowledges both autonomy and the support systems and resources necessary to enable people's autonomous choices and actions. MacCallum's idea of triangulation provides a more accurate and balanced approach to individual liberty by recognizing the social context in which individuals live.
