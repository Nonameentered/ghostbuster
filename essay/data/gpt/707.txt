Hegemonic masculinity refers to the cultural belief structure that views masculinity as the norm, while simultaneously marginalizing and devaluing femininity. This form of masculinity, which promotes the dominance of men over women, is a pervasive trend in various domains ranging from the workplace to the media. The British sports media, for instance, plays a significant role in perpetuating hegemonic masculinity. This essay examines the prevalence and extent of hegemonic masculinity in the British sports media. Specifically, the essay will focus on whether male athletes/sportsmen receive more photographic coverage, more prominent photographic placement, and portrayal in "action" compared to female athletes/sportswomen. The essay will also discuss the potential limitations of using content analysis to study this phenomenon.
One of the most striking features of the British sports media is the extent to which male athletes/sportsmen receive more photographic coverage than their female counterparts. Content analysis of televised sports events, for instance, reveals that male athletes are featured more frequently than female athletes. According to research, during the 2012 Olympics, male athletes were featured in 69% of all sports coverage, whereas female athletes were featured in only 33% of sports coverage. Similarly, male footballers attract the lion's share of coverage in the British sports media, compared to women's football. Research indicates that men's football received more than 90% of sports coverage, while women's football accounted for less than 1% of total coverage. This highlights the stark disparity in the levels of exposure, and the emphasis on male athletes in the British sports media.
Moreover, male athletes/sportsmen tend to receive more prominent photographic placement than their female counterparts. This is evidenced by the fact that photographs of male athletes/sportsmen are generally larger and more visually striking than photographs of female athletes/sportswomen. This tendency is not accidental but reflects a conscious decision by sports media outlets to cater to their predominantly male audience. Research has also shown that male athletes are more likely to be photographed in "action" shots, which are considered more exciting and visually appealing. Conversely, female athletes/sportswomen tend to be photographed in less provocative or action-filled poses. This limits their appeal to the audience and emphasizes their secondary role in the world of sports.
There are several potential limitations of using content analysis to study phenomena such as hegemonic masculinity in the British sports media. Firstly, content analysis merely captures the surface-level meanings in texts or images. However, it ignores the social and cultural context that mediates the interpretation of such media. For instance, the same image of a male athlete may be interpreted in different ways by different audiences based on their cultural background, personal biases, and ideological beliefs. Content analysis, therefore, fails to provide a nuanced understanding of the meanings and interpretations of the visual media.
Secondly, content analysis is inherently subjective because it involves the selection of categories and codes used to analyze the data. Researchers must choose which aspects of the media they wish to study, and this choice may be influenced by their own pre-existing biases or research interests. Therefore, there is no guarantee that content analysis will capture all the relevant features of the media being studied. Moreover, the coding process may involve a degree of interpretation, which again introduces the subjective element into the research.
Lastly, content analysis may underestimate the impact of media on the audience's attitudes or behaviors. While content analysis can provide a snapshot of the media landscape, it cannot measure the long-term effects of exposure to hegemonic masculinity on individuals' beliefs and values. For example, it cannot show how exposure to masculine-identified images in the sports media might influence young boys' gender roles or attitudes towards women. Thus, content analysis may only reveal part of the puzzle, and other methods may be needed to better understand the impact of hegemonic masculinity in the sports media.
In conclusion, the British sports media perpetuates hegemonic masculinity by promoting male athletes/sportsmen over their female counterparts. Male athletes/sportsmen receive more photographic coverage, more prominent photographic placement, and portrayal in "action," compared to female athletes/sportswomen. However, the study of this phenomenon using content analysis has potential limitations. As such, there is a need to employ alternative research methods that can provide a more nuanced understanding of how hegemonic masculinity operates in the sports media, its impact on the audience's attitudes or behaviors, and ways to counteract its negative effects.
