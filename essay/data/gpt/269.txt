Statutory construction involves the interpretation of legal texts to determine the meaning of laws, to apply them correctly and consistently, and to resolve disputes. Under common law, courts rely on various sources of law, including legal precedent, legal reasoning, and legislative history, to construe statutes. Parliamentary material, such as Hansard, is one such source that courts use to elucidate the legislative intent behind statutory provisions. However, the use of parliamentary material as an aid to statutory interpretation raises complex issues of legal, practical, and political nature, as well as financial implications, which need to be considered carefully.
One of the key advantages of using parliamentary material in statutory construction is that it can provide important context to understanding the purpose and scope of legislation. For instance, Hansard debates can help to clarify ambiguities or conflicts in statutory wording, establish the social and political background that led to the enactment of a law, and show how different interpretations were discussed or rejected during the process of lawmaking. This can be particularly useful in cases where statutory language is unclear, imprecise, or outdated, and where it is necessary to determine the underlying motives or objectives of the legislators. 
In the leading case of Pepper v Hart, the House of Lords acknowledged the value of using Hansard as an aid to interpretation, but also set certain limits on when and how it should be used. The court held that Hansard could be admitted as evidence of the meaning of ambiguous language, but only if the statutory words were susceptible of such an interpretation, if the statements by the Minister or other speakers were clear and unambiguous, and if the use of Hansard would not produce absurd or anomalous results. This decision was hailed as a landmark in the evolution of legal methodology, as it clarified the extent to which parliamentary material could be used to supplement or override the literal or plain meaning of a statute.
However, the use of parliamentary material also has several disadvantages and potential drawbacks that need to be taken into account. For instance, relying on Hansard debates can lead to a greater degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in the interpretation of statutes, as different judges may have different views on which statements to use or how much weight to give them. In addition, using Hansard may require considerable time and resources to conduct research, gather evidence, and evaluate the credibility and relevance of individual statements, which can slow down the process of legal decision-making and increase litigation costs. 
Another disadvantage of using parliamentary material is that it may undermine the traditional role of separation of powers and erode the legitimacy of the legislative process. Parliamentarians may feel that their debates are being scrutinized by unelected judges, who may not fully understand the nuances of political or policy debates, and who may impose their own preferences or values on the interpretation of the law. Furthermore, the use of Hansard may also be seen as a way of bypassing the normal channels of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability, whereby citizens and interest groups can lobby their MPs to change or oppose proposed legislation. 
Moreover, the impact of using parliamentary material on statutory construction may vary depending on the political context and the degree of transparency and accountability of the legislative process. In some cases, parliamentary debates may provide a clear and unequivocal record of the intended meaning of the law, and therefore be a valuable aid to interpretation. However, in other cases, Hansard debates may be distorted by political bias, party loyalty, or procedural irregularities, which may make it difficult to discern the true intent of the legislators. This can be further complicated by the fact that the meaning of a statute may change over time as social, economic, and technological conditions evolve, which may make it harder to reconcile the original legislative intent with contemporary realities. 
Despite these limitations, the benefits of using parliamentary material in statutory construction may still outweigh objections, and may be particularly useful in certain contexts. For instance, where there is a clear gap or inconsistency in the statutory text, or where the parliamentary record sheds light on the social or cultural context in which the legislation was passed, Hansard may provide valuable insights into the legislative intent. In addition, in cases where other sources of law are inconclusive or in conflict, the use of Hansard can help to resolve interpretive tensions and provide a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of the law.
Furthermore, the use of parliamentary material may also have broader implications for the democratic legitimacy and accountability of the judiciary and the legislature. By incorporating the views and perspectives of all relevant parties, including parliamentarians, judges, litigants, and the public, statutory construction can enhance the transparency, fairness, and credibility of the legal system, and promote the rule of law. Moreover, by requiring courts to engage in a more rigorous and evidence-based approach to statutory construction, the use of Hansard may encourage legislators to draft clearer, more precise, and more responsive laws in the future, thus reducing the likelihood of ambiguities or disputes.
In conclusion, the use of parliamentary material as an aid to statutory construction is a complex and contentious issue that raises important practical, political, and financial implications for the legal system. While Hansard can provide valuable insights into the legislative intent behind statutory provisions, its use needs to be subject to certain limits and criteria, to ensure that it does not cause confusion, inconsistency, or bias. Ultimately, the decision of whether to use parliamentary material in statutory construction will depend on the specific circumstances of each case, and will require courts to balance the benefits and drawbacks of such a strategy against the requirements of legal coherence, constitutional legitimacy, and democratic accountability, as well as the needs of justice and fairness.
