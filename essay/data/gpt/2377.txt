The Mediterranean islands have been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, with different forms of human habitation evolving over time. The earliest form of inhabitation generally involves visitation, where humans would visit the islands seasonally to extract resources. However, the next stage involves occupation, where humans would settle on the islands permanently and develop a society. The last stage of human habitation involves colonisation, where a foreign power moves in and establishes control over the island.
Colonisation in the Mediterranean islands can be seen as three distinct phases: the first wave of colonisation by the Phoenicians, the second wave by the Greeks, and the third wave by the Romans. While these waves of colonisation followed a similar pattern, each was unique in its own right in the way it was executed and the outcome that resulted.
The first colonisers of the Mediterranean islands were the Phoenicians, who established colonies on the coast of Cyprus and Sardinia around the 9th century BCE. Their colonisation process was gradual, with merchants and traders initially visiting these islands before establishing more permanent settlements. The Phoenicians predominantly sought to control trade routes in the region, which led to the establishment of named colonies in Cyprus, such as Kition, which was a leading centre for copper production.
The Greeks followed the Phoenicians in terms of colonising the Mediterranean islands from the late 8th century BCE onwards. Their colonisation process involved the founding of polis, or city-states, which would serve as centres for trade, agriculture, and political power. One of the notable examples of Greek colonisation was the establishment of the city-state of Cyrene in present-day Libya. The city-state quickly became a major trading hub, with its location offering easy access to the Mediterranean markets.
The final wave of colonisation was driven by the Roman Empire, which saw the expansion of the empire’s territorial domains. The Roman colonisation was characterised by aggressive military expeditions that sought to subdue the local populations by force. Their approach to colonisation was less gradual, and instead relied on the force of arms to bring the local populations into the Roman fold. The island of Malta, which was strategically located at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, fell to the Roman Empire in 218 BCE, and the Romans invested heavily in the island’s infrastructure.
In the context of Cyprus, the first settlers are believed to have originated from the ancient Near East, with evidence of habitation dating back to the Neolithic period (c. 8200-4300 BCE). The earliest forms of habitation on Cyprus involved small-scale foraging and agriculture, with later inhabitants becoming more focused on trade. The Phoenicians were the first to establish commercial settlements on Cyprus, with the city of Kition serving as a prime hub for copper trade.
The Greeks also played a significant role in the colonisation of Cyprus, with the Hellenistic period (c. 323-30 BCE) seeing a significant influx of Greek culture onto the island. The Greeks established several city-states on Cyprus, including Salamis, which grew to become the most significant in the region. The city-state of Paphos was also established, which became famous for its Aphrodite cult.
The island of Cyprus was ultimately incorporated into the Roman Empire in 58 BCE, with the Romans ruling the island for nearly 600 years. The Roman period saw Cyprus’ cities expand rapidly, with the construction of new roads, aqueducts, and public buildings. However, the Roman Empire also faced significant resistance from the local populations, leading to revolts and uprisings that were harshly suppressed.
Overall, the process of colonisation in the Mediterranean islands varied significantly depending on the colonisers and the period involved. While Phoenician and Greek colonisation relied on trade and cultural exchange, Roman colonisation was characterised by force and domination. The different waves of colonisation have left an indelible mark on the Mediterranean islands, with the island of Cyprus serving as a prime example of how colonisation has shaped human history in the region.
