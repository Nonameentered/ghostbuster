The Spartans were one of the most intriguing societies of the ancient world. The values that they abided by and the way they lived their lives have fascinated people for centuries. However, when it comes to historical accounts of the Spartans, one must be careful about the sources one relies on. The Spartans themselves did not leave behind much of a written record, and most of what we know about the Spartans comes from accounts written by outsiders. This essay will assess the objectivity of historical accounts of Spartans focusing on Agesilaos, analyzing and comparing the works of two important writers of the ancient world, Xenophon and Plutarch.
Agesilaos was one of the most famous Spartan kings, who ruled from 398 BC till 360 BC. He was known for his bravery and military tactics and took Sparta to great heights. Both Xenophon and Plutarch wrote about Agesilaos, and their works give us two very different perspectives on the Spartan king.
Xenophon was a soldier and writer who lived in the 4th century BC. He was an Athenian by birth, but he fought for the Spartans in the Peloponnesian War and later became an important advisor to Agesilaos. Xenophon wrote extensively about the Spartans, and his most famous work, the Anabasis, is a fascinating account of his experiences as a member of a Greek mercenary army that fought its way back to safety after being stranded in Persia. In addition to this work, Xenophon also wrote the Hellenica, a history of Greece from the end of the Peloponnesian War to the Battle of Mantineia in 362 BC.
Xenophon's account of Agesilaos in the Hellenica is generally positive. He portrays Agesilaos as a strong and wise leader who was respected by his people and held the respect of his enemies as well. According to Xenophon, Agesilaos was not only a great warrior but also a skilled politician who was able to maintain the integrity of Sparta and fend off threats from neighboring city-states. Xenophon particularly admires Agesilaos for his ability to make do with very little food, water, and sleep, which he attributes to his strong character. Xenophon's portrayal of Agesilaos is not only positive but also suggests a high degree of objectivity. Xenophon's background as an Athenian, combined with his admiration for Agesilaos, make his account of the Spartan king even more credible, as it suggests that he was not biased towards Sparta.
On the other hand, Plutarch's portrayal of Agesilaos is much more critical. Plutarch was a Greek biographer and historian who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. He wrote extensively on the Greeks and Romans and is considered one of the most important writers of the ancient world. Plutarch's account of Agesilaos can be found in his book, the Parallel Lives, in which he compares the lives of famous Greeks and Romans.
Plutarch's portrayal of Agesilaos is significantly different than Xenophon's. He portrays Agesilaos as a man who was obsessed with power and glory and who lacked the humility and wisdom of a true leader. According to Plutarch, Agesilaos was not only a soldier but also a politician who was always looking for ways to expand the power of Sparta. Plutarch criticizes Agesilaos for his arrogance and his lack of empathy and suggests that he was not a leader who was interested in the well-being of his people. In contrast to Xenophon, Plutarch's view on Agesilaos is much more subjective and seems to be influenced by his own biases and beliefs.
This raises the question of how objective one can be when writing about historical figures. Xenophon, as an Athenian, had a certain set of values and beliefs, and he may have been biased towards the Spartans, but his admiration for Agesilaos is based on his observation of the Spartan king's leadership qualities. Plutarch, on the other hand, is writing several centuries later and has a different set of values and beliefs than Xenophon. Plutarch is much more skeptical of the Spartans, and his portrayal of Agesilaos seems to be colored by his perception of Spartan society as a whole.
Despite the differences in their accounts, both Xenophon and Plutarch provide valuable insights into the life and times of Agesilaos and the Spartans. Xenophon's account gives us a glimpse into the mindset of an Athenian who fought alongside the Spartans and admired their way of life. His account is particularly valuable because it is based on his personal experience of Spartan society. Plutarch's account, on the other hand, gives us a more critical view of the Spartans and their leadership. Plutarch's view is important because it presents a more nuanced perspective, highlighting the flaws and limitations of Spartan society.
In conclusion, the objectivity of historical accounts of Spartans, or any historical figure for that matter, is a topic of much debate. When it comes to Agesilaos, Xenophon and Plutarch provide two very different perspectives on the Spartan king. While Xenophon's account is generally positive and suggests a high degree of objectivity, Plutarch's account is much more critical and reveals his own biases. Nonetheless, both writers have contributed significantly to our understanding of the Spartans and their way of life, and their accounts of Agesilaos remain valuable sources for historians and students of the ancient world.
