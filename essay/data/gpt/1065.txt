Environmental archaeology specializes in the study of past human societies’ relationship with the environment. It explores how humans adapted to their changing environment and how these adaptations impacted their societies and local ecology. Environmental archaeology covers the relationship between humans and the environment, climate change, resource usage, and how humans affected their landscapes. The environmental record provides an essential perspective for understanding human adaption to nature and the use of natural resources for survival and development. Environmental archaeology is a crucial field of study since environmental factors play a critical role in human societies’ formation, evolution and collapse. 
The two categories of environmental study include on-site and off-site analyses. On-site analysis gathers information directly from the archaeological sites. It primarily focuses on materials such as bones (zooarchaeology), plants (archaeobotany), and soils (pedology). Archaeobotanists analyze plant remains to determine what the people of the past used for food, ritual purposes, or building structures. 
Zooarchaeology studies animal remains and the relationship that existed between humans and animals at a particular time and place. Furthermore, pedologists can analyze soils to understand how humans practiced agriculture in the area and how the environment changed over time.
Off-site analyses collect information from the area surrounding the archaeological site. It helps to provide a detailed understanding of the environment where the archaeological site is situated. Off-site analyses include various methods, including soil analysis, pollen analysis (palynology), and geomorphology.
Soil analysis provides valuable information such as the movement of soils, soil types and age, and erosion. Palynology determines the history and changes in plant life, vegetation, climate, and human activities. Scientists use pollen studies to understand past environments and how they changed over time. The use of pollen studies can serve as evidence of the local climate, vegetation, ecological reserves, and settlement patterns. Geomorphology studies help scientists understand the landscape, its history, age, and soil composition. Archaeologists use these methods to investigate human landscapes and their transformation over time.
Environmental archaeologists study how the coastline was formed and how it has changed over time because, around 70% of the Earth’s population lives near coasts. Rising sea levels and changes in weather patterns pose a significant threat to coastal settlements. The environmental record contains essential clues that allow us to understand past environments and how they have changed. Sediment monitoring and studies of water-levels and sediment accretion can reveal historical changes in nutrient cycles and ecological energy flow in coastal systems. An example of a study that uses environmental archaeology to understand the changing coastline is the case of Doggerland. Doggerland was a land mass located between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe that was submerged over 8000 years ago due to rising sea levels. 
Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have enormous implications for human societies, including water resources, food production, disease patterns, transportation networks, and many more. Understanding these changes is critical to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. For example, a study on the Chesapeake Bay in North America used environmental archaeology to understand the impact of pre-Columbian human societies on their environment. The study found that populations that practiced sustainable agriculture and hunting techniques left little impact on the environment. The study provides insight into how using sustainable farming techniques can help in mitigating the impact of climate change.
Global warming is a modern-day concern. Environmental archaeology can help us investigate past climate change events, providing critical information on how drier or wetter conditions will affect different landscapes, livestock, and crops. By understanding past climate events, we can predict and prepare for future changes. For example, environmental archaeologists used a study on the Little Ice Age (LIA) to understand how past societies adapted to changing environments. The study discovered how human societies adapted to the harsh conditions and managed natural resources such as water, woods, and food. The study is relevant to global warming because past societies can provide examples of sustainable living and may contribute to overcoming the impact of global warming on human societies.
Environmental archaeologists face the challenge of preservation of artifacts and sites. Various factors can influence the preservation of archaeological materials, including climate, soil type, and pH levels. Additionally, the preservation techniques influence the duration and durability of artifacts. Organic materials such as wood, leaves, and crops are susceptible to decay in wet or dry conditions. Exposure to sunlight, wind, and rain can deteriorate these materials, leading to their destruction. Human activity can also contribute to the deterioration of sites and materials. Building and construction activities, erosion, the development of infrastructure, and climate change can all impact the integrity of the archaeological heritage. 
In conclusion, environmental archaeology is a critical field of study that contributes to our understanding of the relationship between humans and their environment. Environmental archaeologists study the changing coastline, past climates, and environment in order to gain insight into how human societies evolved and survived. On-site and off-site analyses are important methods used in environmental archaeology in order to understand the environment and human impact on it. Environmental archaeology must also consider preservation techniques to ensure the longevity of archaeological materials. By studying past societies, we can gain insight into how to adapt and prepare to mitigate the effects of global warming in the future.
