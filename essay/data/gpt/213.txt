In today's world, there is an undeniable correlation between economic growth and life expectancy. GNI per capita, which stands for Gross National Income per capita, is considered an important indicator of economic development and is also a reflection of the standards of living in a country. Life expectancy, on the other hand, is a measure of the average duration of human life. With the increase in resources, technology, and healthcare, life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the years. This essay aims to explore the relationship between GNI per capita and life expectancy, examining the case of upper middle income and Central Asia and Europe countries.
Firstly, it is essential to understand the factors that influence life expectancy. While genetics does play a role in the longevity of life, environmental conditions, social status, and access to healthcare have the most significant impact. A higher GNI per capita means that a country has a better standard of living. In turn, this implies that there are improved housing conditions, access to clean water and sanitation (a higher percentage of the population with access to safe drinking water), better nutrition (lower incidence of malnutrition), and access to quality healthcare services (lower infant mortality rate, higher immunization coverage, and better health education among the population). These factors are essential in improving human health and, therefore, contribute to an increased life expectancy.
Upper-middle-income countries can provide an interesting case study in this regard. Such countries, according to the World Bank classification , have a GNI per capita range of $4,046 to $12,535. The 2021 World Development Indicators report by the World Bank indicates that the GNI per capita in these countries ranges from $4,270 to $11,180 with an average life expectancy of 72.5 years. One distinct aspect of upper-middle-income countries is that they are transitioning from low-income to high-income status and are characterized by rapid economic growth. For instance, a country like China has made significant strides in economic development over the years, with its GNI per capita increasing from $649 in 1991 to $10,311 in 2020. According to the United Nations, life expectancy in China has improved significantly over the past two decades, from 71 in 2000 to 77 in 2020, indicating a positive relationship between GNI per capita and life expectancy.
Another example is South Africa, which has a GNI per capita of $5,961. Despite its economic wealth, South Africa has a lower life expectancy of 64 years. In contrast, Thailand, which has a similar GNI per capita, has a higher life expectancy of 77 years. So, even if a country has a relatively high GNI per capita, it could still have a lower life expectancy due to other factors that contribute to the overall health of the population. In South Africa's case, HIV/AIDS and high levels of crime, violence, and non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension are the primary causes of death. Similarly, Thailand's remarkable success in improving life expectancy is due to its impressive healthcare system and access to universal health coverage, which has contributed to higher immunization coverage and lower infant mortality rates among the population.
One of the contributing factors to higher life expectancy in upper-middle-income countries is their ability to invest in healthcare infrastructure. With increased wealth, these countries can afford to provide better training for doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff, as well as improving access to medical facilities, hospitals, and diagnostic centers. Another important factor is the increased ability to fund public health programs. Initiatives that focus on health promotion and disease prevention, including vaccination programs, maternal and child health care, and sanitation, play a crucial role in improving health outcomes in these countries. Lastly, as these countries' economies grow, there is an increase in job opportunities and disposable income, which leads to better lifestyle choices, including better diets and more accessible recreational activities.
Now let us consider the case of Central Asia and Europe countries. While they vary in terms of economic development, these countries share a similar geographic location and historical background. According to the World Bank, the GNI per capita in these countries ranges from $446 to $82,300, with an average life expectancy of 75.8 years. One distinct aspect of this region is the significant disparities within it. For instance, countries like Belarus, Estonia, and Kazakhstan have higher GNIs per capita (above $10,000) than countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan (below $2,000). However, these disparities do not necessarily translate into differences in life expectancy. Belarus has a life expectancy of 73 years, while Estonia has 78 years and Kazakhstan has 73 years. In contrast, Uzbekistan has a life expectancy of 72 years, Tajikistan 71 years, and Kyrgyzstan 70 years.
However, it is essential to note that even among countries with similar GnI per capita, there could be variations in life expectancy. For example, Hungary and Croatia have comparable GNI per capita, but Hungary has a life expectancy of 75 years, while Croatia has 78 years. Similarly, Montenegro has a GNI per capita of $9,125, and yet its life expectancy is 76. These differences in life expectancy are due to social determinants of health, including lifestyle factors and access to healthcare. For example, higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diets contribute to the shorter life expectancy in Hungary than in Croatia.
To conclude, it is evident that there is a positive relationship between GNI per capita and life expectancy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this relationship is not absolute. Additional factors, including social determinants of health and lifestyle factors, intervene to determine life expectancy. Though upper-middle-income and Central Asia and Europe countries have seen significant growth over the years, disparities remain, and efforts should be made to bridge the gap. Developing policies that target access to healthcare, education, clean water, and sanitation will go a long way in improving health outcomes. Ultimately, it is necessary to remember that wealth is not a guarantee of good health, and policymakers should be vigilant in considering both economic growth and social determinants of health to improve life expectancy in their countries.
