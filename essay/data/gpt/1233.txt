Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world, businesses strive to maximise their revenue while reducing overhead expenses as much as possible. One crucial area of cost expenditure is the consumption of water in businesses, which can prove to be prohibitively expensive and often inflated due to the over-dispensation by employees.
SCS Ltd, a company with a strong focus on environmental sustainability, has innovated a new piece of technology that greatly reduces the wastage of water in commercial settings - the LiquiSaver system. This essay aims to provide an overview of what exactly the LiquiSaver system is, its usefulness in businesses with large staff numbers, SCS Ltd.’s development process for the system and its future expansion plans. Additionally, this essay will address the potential risks SCS Ltd. faces upon starting up and how they intend to mitigate these risks.
The LiquiSaver System: Definition and Benefits
The LiquiSaver system is a device specifically designed for businesses that want to conserve water and even cut their monthly water expenses. The product has been designed and developed by SCS Ltd, a Green-Tech organisation that specialises in offering businesses the latest environmentally-friendly products that also provide economic incentives. The system operates with infrared sensors, ensuring that water is released only when a hand is present in close proximity, thereby reducing excessive dispensation.
A vital benefit of the LiquiSaver system is its ability to save water and cut expenses. This system has been shown to save up to 90% of water and reduce dispensation by staff by a significant amount. Therefore, it is perfect for organisations with a substantial number of employees where people are constantly moving in and out of restrooms, kitchens and other areas requiring water.
The LiquiSaver system is also a low-hassle device, requiring very little maintenance. Thanks to its state-of-the-art sensors, it is programmed to automatically control the dispensation of water, thereby reducing chances of equipment malfunctioning. Additionally, the system is manufactured to be easily installed with the necessary components.
 
Development Process of SCS Ltd. and Plans for Future Expansion
SCS Ltd., a UK-based company, was founded by two young entrepreneurs with a passion for environmental sustainability. The company prides itself on creating innovative eco-friendly products, and it was no surprise when they convened to brainstorm on the development of an effective water conservation approach. After engaging a lot of research and development, the LiquiSaver system was born. 
To ensure the product meets its desired standards, the LiquiSaver underwent rigorous testing both in-house and with external professionals. As a result, SCS Ltd. has received positive feedback from people who used the system during the testing phase.
As to how they plan to expand their operations, SCS Ltd. is currently looking at increasing the number of retail stores that sell the LiquiSaver system and providing sales support to resellers through advertising and training. Additionally, the company is exploring the possibility of collaborating with large corporations around the globe to conduct pilot testing of the LiquiSaver.
Potential Risks SCS Ltd. May Face Upon Start-Up and Risk Mitigation Strategies 
SCS Ltd., as with all start-ups, is faced with the potential of several risks. Although SCS Ltd has extensive experience in the area of sustainability and economic feasibility, the risk of under-capitalisation is ever-present. Like any ambitious organisation looking to scale, SCS Ltd could quickly get over-enthusiastic and underestimate the full potential cost of expansion. The cost of expansion could outweigh revenue generated, eventually leading to a struggle to maintain profitability.
Another risk is the ever-present threat of competition and competitors who might aim to replicate the LiquiSaver system. Although the LiquiSaver is currently patented, it only provides protection for a limited time. To stay a step ahead of the competition, SCS Ltd. must continue to innovate and develop new products, build, and maintain strong relationships with its customers and partners, and invest in research and development.
Lastly, the company needs to be cognisant of potential economic downturns that could impact the company's revenue. In such circumstances, people would likely be less willing to purchase and install an eco-friendly product that aims to save money, thereby reducing demand.
To mitigate these risks, SCS Ltd. undertakes extensive planning to create a realistic budget and revenue model. They aim to take a measured approach to expansion to ensure that the cost does not exceed revenue generated. Additionally, the company has a comprehensive long-term strategy that aims to tap into new markets, creating innovative ideas that would better serve its customers and provide additional revenue streams. 
Concerning the threat of competition, the company has ensured that the LiquiSaver system is protected by obtaining a patent that prevents other entities from copying. Lastly, the company seeks to diversify its product line, thus mitigating the risk of economic downturns as they continue building on the LiquiSaver brand.
Conclusion
The LiquiSaver system is a cutting-edge, affordable device that saves 90% of water, reduces dispensation by staff, and it's low-maintenance for enterprises with a considerable number of employees. SCS Ltd., the green-tech company that developed the system, is focused on improving environmental sustainability while delivering economic incentives to establishments. The development of the LiquiSaver system was an extensive process that included rigorous testing to guarantee the product's quality and effectiveness.
The company aims to continue to improve the sustainability of a wide range of industries by making environmentally-friendly alternatives easily affordable and accessible. However, SCS Ltd. faces several risks during the start-up phase of the LiquiSaver system, including undercapitalisation, competing products, and economic instability. The company's mitigation strategies, such as developing a realistic budget and revenue model, obtaining a patent, and developing a diversified product line, aim to ensure the company's sustainability and longevity in the ever-changing global environment.
