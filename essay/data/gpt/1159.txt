The practical experiment conducted on trypsin extracted from defatted soybean meal aimed to determine the effect of heating and protein inhibitors on trypsin inhibition activity. The purpose of the experiment was to understand the mechanism of trypsin inhibition by protein inhibitors and how heat affects its activity.
The results obtained suggest that heating caused a decrease in trypsin inhibition activity. This could be because heat denatures the protein inhibitor, making it ineffective at inhibiting trypsin. The presence of protein inhibitors, such as Bowman-Birk inhibitor and Kunitz inhibitor in the sample, was found to reduce trypsin inhibition activity. This is because these inhibitors bound to trypsin, preventing it from carrying out its normal function.
Understanding the mechanisms of trypsin inhibition is important as it has implications for various fields of study, including food science and medicine. The information obtained from this experiment can help in the development of treatments for diseases such as pancreatitis, where trypsin activity needs to be regulated. In conclusion, this practical experiment was insightful in shedding light on the influence of heating and protein inhibitors on trypsin activity inhibition, providing important information for researchers to build on.
