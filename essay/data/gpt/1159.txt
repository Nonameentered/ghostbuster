Introduction:
Offending patterns between boys and girls have been a topic of interest for many years among criminologists, psychologists, sociologists, and other researchers. Boys and girls have different offending patterns which have been noted in the societal fabric. Boys are more engaged in criminal activities than girls. This essay aims to investigate the differences in offending patterns between boys and girls, which are attributed to their socialization, personality traits, and environmental factors. The essay will explore the reasons for these differences to have a better understanding of the criminal aspect of society.
Socialization:
Socialization plays a pivotal role in molding a person's life as it teaches them socially acceptable behavior. Boys and girls experience a different socialization process, which impacts their behavior. Boys are commonly socialized to be aggressive and assertive, compared to girls who are taught to be more submissive and gentle. Boys are typically encouraged to assert themselves, and to dominate others, with traits like competitiveness, toughness, and physical strength. Girls generally have been socialized to be more nurturing and expressing emotional intelligence, which is opposite to boys.
As a result, socialization influences the behavioral patterns of boys and girls. Boys are more likely to be involved in criminal activities like violence, theft, and substance abuse than girls, due to their greater propensity for aggression. Aggressive boys who have not learned to control their anger use violence as an outlet, often being impulsive and uncontrolled while girls who share similar traits respond differently. Similarly, girls are more likely to be involved in crimes like prostitution and crime of public order, which are often considered less violent or dangerous compared to crimes committed by boys.
Personality Traits:
Another important factor that accounts for the differences in offending patterns between boys and girls are their personality traits. Boys and girls exhibit different personality traits and that influence their involvement in criminal activities. Generally, boys are more extroverted and impulsive, while girls tend to be more conscientious, empathetic, and neurotic. Boys have a higher need for immediate gratification, thrill-seeking, and high-risk behavior. They are also more prone to engage in peer pressure in order to fit in.
On the other hand, girls tend to be more attached to their families and are more cautious about their behavior. Girls typically prepare themselves for life's trajectory, preparing themselves for career building and planning prerequisites, whereas boys usually lack such long term plans. Their immediate gratification tendency often results in shorter term goals and objectives.
Environmental Factors:
The environment in which boys and girls grow up in has a significant effect on their behavior. For instance, boys who grow up in an impoverished area are more likely to be involved in gang-related activities, violence, and substance abuse. The adverse living conditions often cause boys to have a tough childhood which may lead to a breakdown of discipline, leading to an increased likelihood of criminal behavior. The poor environment may cause a sense of hopelessness, making them feel that crime is their only way out.
Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to be influenced by social and family factors compared to boys. Growing up in a stable home environment generally leads to less criminal behavior later in life. Girls who have strong family structures, supportive parental relationships, and limited exposure to illicit activities, are less likely to be involved in criminal activities. Girls who grow up in more impoverished surroundings, unfortunately, may be more vulnerable to negative peers' influences and may be exposed to neglect, physical and sexual abuse, which can lead to delinquency.
Conclusion:
It is evident that there are apparent differences in offending patterns between boys and girls due to their socialization, personality traits, and environmental factors. Boys and girls respond differently to socialization processes, which leads to differing behavior patterns like aggression and submissiveness. The distinct personality traits of boys and girls have a role to play in their engagement with criminal activities. Boys are more impulsive and open to peer pressure while girls are more conscientious and attached to their families.
Finally, environmental factors such as poverty and the lack of adequate care at home play a significant role in a person's behavior. The mechanisms of socialization, personality traits, and environmental factors work in concert in influencing the behavior of boys and girls, just as nature and nurture largely shape oneâ€™s character. It is important to understand these other aspects while dealing with juveniles to provide a workable, sustainable solution that doesn't handle them as merely criminals but instead, human beings who are still growing and developing.
