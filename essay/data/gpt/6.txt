When discussing feminism, the Western world is usually the focus of the discussion. However, Japan too has had a significant feminist movement over the years, even if it has been less visible to outsiders. The development of feminism in Japan was influenced by a variety of factors, some unique to Japan and some shared with Western countries. In this essay, I will examine the social and political factors that contributed to the development of feminism in Japan and compare them with those in Western nations, particularly the US and the UK.
One of the unique factors that contributed to the development of feminism in Japan was Confucianism. Confucianism, an ancient philosophical and ethical system that emphasizes filial piety, loyalty, and respect for hierarchy, has had a significant influence on Japanese culture and society for centuries. Confucian values have often been used to justify the subordination of women in Japan, as women were expected to be obedient to their fathers, husbands, and sons. However, feminists in Japan have also used Confucianism to demand greater rights for women. For example, they have pointed out that Confucian values emphasize the importance of education, which should apply to women as well as men.
Another factor that contributed to the development of feminism in Japan was nationalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan underwent a period of rapid modernization and industrialization in order to catch up with the Western powers. As part of this process, there was a push to create a strong, unified national identity. However, women were often excluded from this nationalist discourse, as they were seen as primarily domestic beings who had no place in the public sphere. Feminists in Japan challenged this exclusion, arguing that women too had a role to play in the nation's development.
Education was another factor that contributed to the development of feminism in Japan. In the Meiji period (1868-1912), the government made education compulsory for both boys and girls, thus providing girls with greater access to education. However, this did not necessarily translate into greater opportunities for women in the workforce or in other areas of public life. Feminists in Japan argued for greater access to education for women and for the recognition of women's intellectual and cultural contributions.
Political awareness was also important in the development of feminism in Japan. The establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1889 gave Japanese people some degree of political participation, even if it was limited. Women were excluded from voting and holding political office, but feminists in Japan agitated for the extension of political rights to women. In the aftermath of World War II, Japan adopted a new constitution that guaranteed equal rights for all citizens, regardless of gender. This sparked a new wave of feminist activism in Japan, as women demanded the full realization of their rights and opportunities under the law.
The changing workforce was yet another factor that contributed to the development of feminism in Japan. As Japan became more industrialized and developed a post-war economy, women entered the workforce in greater numbers. However, they were often relegated to low-paying, dead-end jobs, and faced discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Feminists in Japan called for greater opportunities for women in the workforce, as well as for workplace policies that would provide greater support for working mothers.
One key difference between the development of feminism in Japan and in Western nations was the role of religion. In the US and the UK, Christianity played a significant role in the development of feminist thought and activism, particularly in the suffrage movement. However, in Japan, Buddhism and Shintoism have been the dominant religions, and they have had a more ambiguous relationship to feminism. While Buddhist and Shinto values can be used to justify equality and social justice, they can also be used to justify patriarchal values and hierarchies.
Another key difference between Japan and Western nations was the focus on family. In Japan, the family has traditionally been seen as the basic unit of society, and there has been a strong emphasis on familial duties and obligations. Feminists in Japan have often emphasized the importance of the family as a site of feminist struggle, calling for changes to laws and social norms that would support women in their roles as wives and mothers.
In conclusion, the development of feminism in Japan was influenced by a variety of social and political factors, some unique to Japan and some shared with Western nations. Confucian ideologies, nationalism, education, political awareness, and the changing workforce all played a role in shaping the feminist movement in Japan. However, there were also significant differences between Japan and the US and the UK, particularly in the roles of religion and the family. Today, the feminist movement in Japan continues to face challenges, but it remains an important force for social change and progress.
