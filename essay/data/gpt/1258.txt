Laboratory exercises utilizing Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board have a singular aim, namely to provide students with hands-on experience in designing and implementing digital circuits. The exercises expose students to the process of designing a circuit using VHDL, the verification of the design by simulation, its implementation on a FPGA board, and finally, the verification of its behavior through functional testing. The laboratory exercises involving Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board were critical in my understanding of FPGA design, and in this essay, I will recount my experience working through the exercises.
Xilinx ISE is a software application that allows for the design and simulation of digital circuits. Spartan-3 FPGA board is a physical hardware device that realises and executes the digital circuits. The combination of these elements allows for a comprehensive understanding of the design process for digital circuits. The laboratory exercises explored various digital circuits using VHDL, which were then simulated on Xilinx ISE to verify their behavior. Finally, the circuits were loaded onto the Spartan-3 FPGA board, where their behavior was verified through functional tests.
The laboratory exercises began with the most basic of digital circuits, ANDGATE. This exercise was intended to familiarize us with VHDL and its core components, including entities, architecture, and process. VHDL, which stands for VHSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit) Hardware Description Language, is a language used for the description and documentation of digital circuits, which make up electronic systems. In implementing the ANDGATE, we used the ISE design manager, VHDL editor, and simulation tool to simulate the gate's behavior.
The next exercise involved the design of a 4-bit counter. The 4-bit counter is an essential electronic component used in various applications, for example, data storage, encryption, and calculator display among others. The 4-bit counter circuit was created using VHDL, which was then simulated using Xilinx ISE. The design was then loaded onto the Spartan-3 FPGA board, and simulations performed to validate its performance.
The Dflipflop is a digital circuit used to store a single bit of data. We used Xilinx ISE to simulate the behavior of the Dflipflop implemented using VHDL. The simulation verified the functionalities, including storage and retrieval of a bit of data. The circuit was then implemented on the Spartan-3 FPGA board, where functional tests were carried out to ensure its proper functioning.
The final exercise involved the creation of a seven-segment display counter count 0-9. The seven-segment display counter is a digital circuit that counts from 0-9, displaying the output on a seven-segment display. VHDL was used to design the circuit in Xilinx ISE, which was then simulated to confirm its behavior. The simulated circuit was then loaded onto the Spartan-3 FPGA board, where functional tests were carried out to validate its operation. 
Simulation results differ from the results obtained when the programs were loaded onto the board. The simulations display how the circuit is intended to operate, while functional tests of the board indicate how the circuit performs in the real world. In some instances, behavior of the circuit may be as expected during simulation, but when loaded onto the board, environmental factors, such as electromagnetic interference, may impact the circuit's behavior. For example, in one instance, we ran simulations which indicated that the seven-segment display count 0-9 functioned optimally. However, when we loaded the circuit onto the Spartan-3 FPGA board and carried out functional tests, the circuit displayed some inaccuracies in digit display. 
In conclusion, the laboratory exercises involving Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board were instrumental in my understanding of FPGA design. It is evident that the combination of software and hardware elements allows for a comprehensive understanding of the design process for digital circuits. Working through the tutorial instructions for ANDGATE, 4-bit counter, Dflipflop, and seven-segment display count 0-9 challenged, but ultimately honed my skills in designing and implementing digital circuits. While simulation results may differ from the results obtained when the programs were loaded onto the board, the functional testing validated behavior and provided hands-on learning experience. By having the opportunity to work with Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board, I have developed the expertise and confidence needed to design and implement digital circuits in a real-world setting.
