The determination of species diversity has always been an important aspect of ecological analysis since understanding the variety of life within an ecosystem helps in identifying the health and sustainability of an ecosystem. The Rennes field centre in Brittany is an ideal place for studying the diversity of species because of its unique and diverse habitat types. Four different habitats were selected, and various methods were used to collect and calculate the species diversity of each habitat.
The four habitats chosen for study were a grassland, a deciduous forest, a coniferous forest, and a pond. These habitats were selected based on their contrasting biodiversity and the presence of different abiotic and biotic factors, which play a significant role in determining species composition and diversity. The grassland was the least diverse habitat, while the pond was the most diverse habitat.
To determine the species diversity of each habitat, various methods were employed. The most common method used to collect the data was visual inspection, where researchers made direct observations of each habitat to identify and record the different species present. In addition, the researchers set up pitfall traps to capture and identify invertebrates, such as spiders and flying insects. The researchers also used sweep netting to capture insects that were flying or crawling in the grassland and forest habitats.
The results of the study indicated that the pond ecosystem had the highest species diversity, with a total of 43 different species. The grassland had the least number of species, with only 10 species identified. The deciduous forest had 27 species, while the coniferous forest had 17 species. These results suggest that the presence of water in the pond habitat creates favorable conditions for species diversity, while the harsh and open conditions in the grassland habitat limit the diversity of species. 
Abiotic and biotic factors influenced the diversity of species in each habitat. Abiotic factors like temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture play a crucial role in determining the species composition of a habitat. For example, the pond habitat provides a moist environment, which creates favorable conditions for the growth and survival of a wide range of plant and animal species. Biotic factors such as the availability of food, predation, and competition for resources, also affect the species diversity of an ecosystem. For instance, the availability of food in the deciduous forest habitat offered varied niches for different species leading to increased diversity of species.
The most diverse site had a greater variety of invertebrates because the pond habitat provides a favorable environment for invertebrates like aquatic insects and crustaceans, which require water for their survival. The abundance of these invertebrates also attracts other species to the pond ecosystem, leading to increased diversity. On the other hand, the grassland habitat, which had the lowest species diversity, was limited in moisture, limiting the number of species that can survive in it. 
Factors affecting the distribution of organisms in different habitats include availability of food, predation, and competition for resources. For instance, the availability of prey and competition for resources can determine where insect predators such as spiders occur in a habitat. Therefore, understanding these factors is crucial for studying the diversity of species in an ecosystem.
In conclusion, the study conducted in the Rennes field centre in Brittany sought to determine the species diversity of four selected habitats using a variety of methods. The study revealed that abiotic and biotic factors play a crucial role in determining the diversity of species, and that understanding these factors is essential for studying habitable ecosystems. The study was eye-opening, revealing which environments had the most variety and which were not as diverse, and why. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of conservation for habitats that possess high species diversity as they suggest a healthy and balanced ecosystem.
