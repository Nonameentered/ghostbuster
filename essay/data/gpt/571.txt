The East End area of London is notorious for its history of poverty, crime, and gang activity. For decades, the working-class population of this district has been struggling to make a living while often facing exploitation and prejudice. At the same time, detectives, specifically those that work for the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), have been tasked with combating crime in the area. This essay will explore the role of entrepreneurship in the interrelationship between the working-class population and detectives operating within the East End area of London, and how this relationship reflects the culture of East Enders and the CID division.
To examine this topic, we will use the analysis set forth in "Doing the Business" by Hobbs. In his ethnographic study, Hobbs draws on interviews, case studies, and the analysis of other theorists to explore the relationship between entrepreneurship, crime, and the culture of the East End. In his research, he delves into the intricate workings of the East End, revealing a society that is not just living in poverty, but actively engaged in the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities to make ends meet.
Hobbs begins by describing the entrepreneurial attitudes of East Enders, focusing on the idea that the working-class population is accustomed to managing themselves and their own businesses. He notes that many of the individuals he interviewed had a strong sense of self-reliance, and that they were not afraid to seek out new opportunities, sometimes even resorting to illegal activities. This drive for entrepreneurial success often led to conflict with the police, who were seen as an obstacle to their success.
Hobbs then explores the relationship between entrepreneurship and criminality. He argues that entrepreneurship in the East End is often linked to illegal activities, such as drug dealing and smuggling. He sees this relationship as a symptom of a capitalist society that values profit over the well-being of its citizens, particularly those living in poverty. The working-class individuals in the East End, he argues, are forced to resort to crime to survive, despite the constant threat of arrest and imprisonment.
The relationship between entrepreneurship and crime is further complicated by the role of the police, specifically detectives working in the CID division. Hobbs suggests that the police are often portrayed in the media as neutral arbiters of justice, but in reality, they are part of a larger capitalist system that values profit over the needs of the working class. He notes that detectives in the CID are often seen as enemies by the working-class population, who view them as serving the interests of the wealthy and powerful.
Despite this perception, Hobbs also suggests that the relationship between the working-class population and detectives is not entirely antagonistic. He notes that many working-class individuals also see detectives as allies, recognizing that they too have a job to do and that they can sometimes help to resolve disputes. In this sense, the relationship between the working class and detectives is complex, with a mixture of both animosity and cooperation.
Overall, Hobbs' analysis suggests that the role of entrepreneurship in the interrelationship between the working class and detectives operating within the East End area of London is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, entrepreneurship is often linked to crime and illegal activities, while on the other hand, it can also be a means of survival for those living in poverty. Meanwhile, the police, including detectives in the CID, are viewed with suspicion by many working-class individuals, who see them as serving the interests of the wealthy rather than the needs of the community.
The relationship between the working class and detectives also reflects the broader cultural dynamics of the East End. Hobbs notes that East Enders have a long history of resistance to authority, dating back to the days of Jack the Ripper and the suffragette movement. This resistance often takes the form of entrepreneurial activity, with individuals seeking to create their own opportunities rather than relying on the government or other external entities for support. At the same time, this resistance can sometimes take the form of violent resistance, as seen in the gang activity that has plagued the area for decades.
The culture of the CID is also shaped by its history and its role in combating crime in the East End. Hobbs notes that the CID has a strong sense of professional identity, emphasizing the importance of impartiality and the need for detectives to remain neutral in their interactions with the community. However, he also suggests that this professionalism can sometimes lead to detachment from the community, making it difficult for detectives to understand the concerns and needs of the working-class population.
Overall, Hobbs' analysis reveals that the role of entrepreneurship in the interrelationship between the working class and detectives operating within the East End area of London is complex and multifaceted, reflecting broader cultural dynamics of the area. While entrepreneurship can sometimes lead to criminal activity, it is also a means of survival for those living in poverty. Similarly, while the police are often viewed with suspicion, they are also seen as potential allies by some working-class individuals. Ultimately, the relationship between these two groups is shaped by a long history of resistance to authority and a complex web of social and economic factors that make it difficult for all parties involved to find common ground.
