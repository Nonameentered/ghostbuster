The world of advertising has advanced and evolved over the years. The introduction of various technological advancements has brought new ways to advertise products, and one of the most popular and effective ways is through multimedia advertising. In this essay, I will analyse the multimodality of a television advert for Dr Pepper, focusing on the effects produced by different modes used throughout the advert.
The television advert for Dr Pepper is a 30-second-long commercial that is designed to promote the soft drink. The commercial begins with a shot of a charismatic man completing a backflip onto a table, holding a can of Dr Pepper in his hand. Throughout the commercial, the focus zooms out to showcase different scenes, such as a woman having a blast at a party, and a girl performing rock and roll dance on a sidewalk. The music in the commercial is upbeat, fast-paced and rhythmic.
The visual aspect of the advert is dynamic and exciting, with the editor switching between shots quickly. The use of bright and vivid colours creates a sense of energy and vibrancy, making the advert visually stimulating. This multimodal element provides viewers with a sense of excitement, hinting at a dynamic and unique product that is similar to the lifestyle reflected in the advert. The fast-paced music and upbeat tone are consistent with the visual message of the advertisement, amplifying the sense of energy and dynamism.
Additionally, the advertisement employs language and text to provide immediate support to the visual scene. A voice-over complements the visuals, giving an introduction to the product and its features. The voice-over in the advert is in an upbeat tone that matches the energy of the visuals and music. The voice-over adds a persuasive element that enhances the product's image and emphasises its unique qualities.
Another important multimodal aspect of the Dr Pepper advert is its use of humour. The commercial depicts a charismatic man performing a backflip, which adds an element of surprise and humour to the advert, making it more memorable to viewers. To enhance the witty tone, the advert features funny and exhilarating moments that are closely linked to the product. For example, a woman in the commercial suddenly flips to get a Dr Pepper from the fridge and drinks it gleefully, showing the ease and fun that comes with the product.
In addition to the use of humour, the advert uses celebrities to further enhance the product's image. The advert features an established celebrity in the backflip scene, bringing in name recognition and increasing the advert's appeal to a wider audience. The use of celebrities in advertising draws attention through their persona and importance, thus increasing the commercial's effectiveness.
Another important multimodal aspect of the Dr Pepper advert is its use of storytelling. The advert tells the story of experiencing life to the fullest by featuring people performing rock and roll dances on the sidewalks, a girl playing drums, a woman playing pool and partying. The vibrant and energetic style of the visuals and sounds convey a message of living a life free from limitation where drinking Dr Pepper is the catalyst, allowing the consumer to connect with the story and its message. Overall, the storytelling element amplifies the theme of “life lived to the fullest”, increasing the commercial's effectiveness in promoting the product.
In conclusion, the Dr Pepper advert employs various multimodal techniques to create a dynamic and memorable commercial. The use of vivid colours, upbeat music, humour, storytelling, celebrity endorsement, and voice-over establishes a persuasive, humorous, and relatable message that resonates with the target audience. The combination of these modes multiplies the effect, making it more memorable and reinforcing the product's appeal. The multimodality of the Dr Pepper advert is an excellent example of how to grab audiences' attention effectively and communicate a brand's message, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.
