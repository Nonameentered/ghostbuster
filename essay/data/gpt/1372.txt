Animals and the environment are not just resources for human purpose, but they form the intricate web of life that sustains us. Thus, it is no wonder individuals are calling for a more hospitable framework of natural-nonhuman rights that accommodates the well-being and survival of the ecosystem. However, there is a question of whether it is feasible to formulate this desired theory of natural-nonhuman rights within the existing Western structure. This essay examines this argument and the possibility to shift towards a preservationist model.
Firstly, the Western civilization structure is anthropocentric in that it is human-centered. It is institutionally ingrained, and it is reflected in the legal systems, ethics, and rationale of Western countries. In this regard, the Western framework is not open to the incorporation of the interests of nonhuman entities since they are tools to be used for human advancement. This anthropocentric viewpoint is one of the reasons the natural-nonhuman rights structures are challenging to establish.
Nonetheless, it is feasible to balance rationality with the fundamental value of living in harmony with nature, as it was established in the “weak anthropocentric” approach. The weak anthropocentric approach is a conservationist standpoint that emphasizes the necessity to maintain the ecosystem’s physical and chemical attributes, irrespective of the interests of nonhuman organisms. This stands at the other end of the spectrum from an ecocentric approach that places more important emphasis on the well-being of the ecosystem as a whole, independent of human interests. Thus, the proposed approach can bring together the interests of humans and nonhuman organisms.
Secondly, the language of rights makes communication easier. It keeps people accountable and can be implemented legally, which may not be the case with a general environmental rationale. In essence, natural-nonhuman rights mean that animals and the environment have an intrinsic value that exceeds their value to human beings. The rights are not just related to the protection of the creatures themselves, but also so that they can continue playing their role in the ecosystem.
In conclusion, this essay has explored whether it is feasible to formulate a theory of natural-nonhuman rights, how a preservationist model can be established, and which approach is suitable. Although the Western civilization structure is anthropocentric, the weak anthropocentric approach portrays the possibility of balancing rationality with the fundamental value of living in harmony with nature. Similarly, the language of rights is better when it comes to communicating with people. Natural-nonhuman rights are more than protecting animal and environmental rights, but they serve as the foundation for harmony.
