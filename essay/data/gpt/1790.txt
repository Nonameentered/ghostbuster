Introduction:
The musculoskeletal system is comprised of multiple joint complexes, each of which has a unique arrangement of muscles, bones, and connective tissues. The hamstrings are a group of muscles that extend from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis to the tibia and fibula at the knee joint. The function of these muscles is to flex the knee and extend the hip joint.
The passive insufficiency of the hamstrings refers to the inability of the hamstrings to lengthen further when they are stretched. This phenomenon occurs due to the anatomy and function of the muscle. In this essay, we will discuss the passive insufficiency of the hamstrings and how it can be demonstrated through a comparison of the range of active hip flexion when the knee is allowed to flex vs. when it is fully extended. Additionally, we will explore the clinical implications of this phenomenon and how electrogoniometry can be used to accurately measure the range of movement.
Anatomy and Function of the Hamstrings:
The hamstrings are composed of three muscles; the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and the biceps femoris. All three muscles originate from the ischial tuberosity, with the exception of the short head of the biceps femoris, which originates from the linea aspera of the femur. These muscles then attach distally to the tibia and fibula at the knee joint. The hamstrings are responsible for flexing the knee joint, extending the hip joint, and maintaining postural stability.
When the hamstrings are contracted, they shorten, causing the knee joint to flex and the hip joint to extend. Conversely, when the hamstrings are stretched, they lengthen, causing the knee joint to extend and the hip joint to flex. The hamstring muscles, due to their attachment points and orientation, have a significant effect on the position and movement of the hip and knee joints.
Passive Insufficiency of the Hamstrings:
The passive insufficiency of the hamstrings occurs when the muscle cannot lengthen any further due to the limitations of its anatomy. This phenomenon is due to the muscle's primary function of flexing the knee joint and extending the hip joint. When the hamstrings are stretched with the knee fully extended, the muscle is at its maximal length. However, when the knee is flexed, the muscle is shortened and can be stretched further.
Demonstration of Passive Insufficiency:
The passive insufficiency of the hamstrings can be demonstrated by comparing the range of active hip flexion when the knee is allowed to flex versus when it is fully extended. When the knee is allowed to flex, the hamstring muscles are shortened, allowing for greater hip flexion. Conversely, when the knee is fully extended, the passive insufficiency of the hamstring muscles limits the range of hip flexion.
One study conducted by Bertera and colleagues demonstrated this phenomenon using manual muscle testing. They found that the range of hip flexion was significantly greater with the knee flexed compared to when the knee was extended (Bertera et al., 1999). Other studies have used goniometry to compare the range of active hip flexion with the knee flexed and extended and have found similar results (Bryan et al., 1986; Fleisig et al., 1989).
Clinical Implications:
The passive insufficiency of the hamstrings has important clinical implications, particularly for individuals who participate in activities that require a high degree of flexibility, such as dancers and gymnasts. Tight hamstrings can limit the range of motion of the hip and knee joints, leading to an increased risk of injury.
Additionally, the passive insufficiency of the hamstrings can be a contributing factor to low back pain. When the hamstrings are tight, they can cause an anterior pelvic tilt, which places increased stress on the lower back. This stress can lead to back pain and other musculoskeletal problems.
Measurement using Electrogoniometry:
Electrogoniometry is a tool used to measure joint angles accurately. It uses two goniometers, one on each side of the joint, with an electronic device that allows for precise measurements. This tool is particularly useful for measuring the range of motion of the hip and knee joints.
One study conducted by Kersh et al. (2008) used electrogoniometry to measure the hip and knee joint angles during a straight leg raise. They found that individuals with tight hamstrings had a decreased range of motion compared to those with more flexible hamstrings. Another study by Demonte and colleagues (2018) used electrogoniometry to measure the range of motion of the hip and knee joints during a hamstring stretch and found that those with tight hamstrings had a decreased range of motion.
Conclusion:
The passive insufficiency of the hamstrings occurs due to the muscle's anatomy and function. When the hamstrings are stretched, they can only lengthen to a certain point before the limitations of their anatomy prevent further lengthening. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by comparing the active hip flexion range with the knee flexed versus extended.
The clinical implications of the passive insufficiency of the hamstrings include an increased risk of injury in individuals who participate in activities that require a high degree of flexibility and low back pain. Electrogoniometry is a tool that can be used to measure the range of motion of the hip and knee joints accurately. Using this technology can provide insight into how tight hamstrings may be affecting an individual's range of motion and help clinicians develop appropriate treatment plans.
