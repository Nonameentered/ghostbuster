The literature of the late 19th century in America was a period of intense cultural change. The United States had undergone a series of rapid industrial and social revolutions that transformed the country from a rural, agrarian nation into one that was becoming increasingly urban and diverse. The literature of this period reflected these changes and challenged traditional American values of individualism and upward social mobility. A great example of this is Frank Norris’ novel McTeague, published in 1899.
McTeague can be read as a commentary on the excesses of the new industrial economy and the decline of traditional American values. The story takes place in San Francisco in the late 19th century, and centers on the life of a dentist named McTeague. McTeague is a product of his environment, having grown up in a rural mining town in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He is uneducated and rough around the edges, but he is also honest and hard-working. However, as he moves into the city, he loses his connection to his traditional values and is caught up in a cycle of greed, excess, and violence.
One of the traditional American values that McTeague challenges is the idea of individualism. McTeague is a character who is defined by his surroundings, and who is unable to free himself from the influence of those around him. He is a product of his environment, and he is incapable of escaping the fate that has been assigned to him. McTeague’s story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of being trapped in a cycle of poverty and violence, and the consequences of allowing external forces to control one’s destiny.
Another traditional American value that McTeague challenges is upward social mobility. McTeague is a character who aspires to move up the social ladder through his profession as a dentist. However, his aspirations are ultimately thwarted by his own human nature and the forces of society. McTeague’s story is a commentary on the corrupting influence of materialism and the inability of individuals to escape the economic systems that trap them in poverty.
McTeague is an example of a literary genre known as naturalism, which emerged in the late 19th century and sought to challenge traditional American values and the romanticism that had dominated American literature up until that point. Naturalist writers such as Norris believed that literature should be a reflection of reality, and that it should be unflinching in its depiction of the harsh realities of life. This was a departure from the romanticism of earlier American literature, which had emphasized individualism, imagination, and the potential for human greatness.
McTeague is a prime example of naturalism, as it presents a bleak and unromantic picture of American life in the late 19th century. The story is filled with characters who are trapped in a cycle of poverty and desperation, and who struggle to break free from the social and economic forces that control their lives. McTeague’s descent into violence and greed reflects the darker side of human nature, and highlights the dangers of allowing external forces to dictate one’s fate.
The character of McTeague also serves as a metaphor for the decline of traditional American values. McTeague starts out as a hard-working, honest man, but as he becomes more enmeshed in the economic and social systems around him, he loses sight of his traditional values and becomes consumed by a desire for material wealth and status. McTeague’s story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of abandoning the values that have defined America since its inception.
In conclusion, American literature of the late 19th century challenged traditional American values of individualism and upward social mobility. Naturalist writers such as Frank Norris sought to present a more accurate and unflinching picture of American life, one that reflected the harsh realities of industrialization and the decline of traditional values. McTeague is a prime example of this genre, presenting a bleak and unromantic picture of American life in the late 19th century. The story challenges traditional American values of individualism and upward social mobility by presenting a character who is trapped in a cycle of poverty and violence and who is unable to escape the forces that control his life. Overall, McTeague is a powerful commentary on the state of America in the late 19th century, and a reminder of the importance of staying true to our traditional values even in the face of rapid social and economic change.
