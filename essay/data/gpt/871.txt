Introduction
Eugenics is the study of improving the human race through selective breeding. It was a widely popular concept, as well as a social and political movement in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Eugenics had become an established field in the scientific community in the United States until its decline in the late 1920s and 1930s. However, its influence on Germany's eugenics movement cannot be overlooked.
The German eugenics movement was initiated by hailing the superiority of the Aryan race with the goal of eliminating unwanted and defective people from society. The German eugenics movement not only drew inspiration from the American eugenics movement but was also highly influenced by it. Hitler and the Nazi regime adopted the idea of eugenics as a tool for implementing their ideological objectives. Eugenics became the cornerstone of Nazi philosophy and played a significant role in shaping the policies that targeted social groups perceived to be genetically inferior. This essay will explore the extent to which developments in the American eugenics movement influenced the shape of German and later Nazi racial hygiene.
The American Eugenics Movement
The eugenics movement in the United States began in the late 19th century. The movement sought to address social problems, including poverty and criminal behavior, by eliminating those who were deemed to be genetically unfit. Eugenicists believed that certain traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were inherited and that these traits could be manipulated through selective breeding. Eugenicists used statistical methods to create family trees tracing the inheritance of desirable and undesirable traits, advocating for the improvement of the human race by limiting the reproduction of "unfit" individuals.
Eugenics was supported by academics, politicians and prominent figures such as Alexander Graham Bell, who claimed that "the only way to avoid race suicide is to promote racial breeding and good motherhood." Eugenics was promoted by well-respected academic institutions, such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Eugenics gained popularity in the United States, and by the 1920s, numerous institutions adopted eugenic policies, such as compulsory sterilizations for individuals deemed unfit or institutionalized. Eugenicists in the United States claimed that they were advancing a movement that was rooted in science and the betterment of humanity.
Factors Driving the German Eugenics Movement
The German eugenics movement began in the late 19th century. It was heavily influenced by political, social, and intellectual factors. Nationalism and the German notion of Volksgemeinschaft, or "people's community," were central to the eugenics movement. The idea that the Germans were a superior race with a duty to improve the human race and the belief that racial purity was needed to strengthen the nation fueled the eugenics movement.
Germany was also grappling with social and economic problems during the early 20th century, including poverty, unemployment, and a demographic crisis caused by a declining birth rate. These issues were seen by eugenicists as evidence that the German race was degenerating. Efforts aimed at resolving societal problems intersected with the focus on racial hygiene, leading eugenicists to seek ways of eliminating hereditary traits associated with social problems.
The German eugenics movement was not merely an intellectual exercise but also a political and social movement. Eugenics became an official policy in the country with the enactment of the 1933 Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring. The law allowed the sterilization of individuals with incurable mental or physical illnesses or disabilities.
In addition to policymakers, eugenic ideas took root among the majority of Germans. A poll conducted in 1931 revealed that 57% of Germans believed that the government should control the breeding of physically and mentally deficient people.
The Impact of the American Eugenics Movement on Germany
The American eugenics movement had a significant impact on the German eugenics movement. American eugenicists would attend conferences and lectures in Germany, and German eugenicists would reciprocate. In 1911, the American eugenicist Charles Goethe visited Germany, where he gave a lecture series that highlighted the advanced state of the American eugenics movement.
Following his visit, Goethe established the Eugenics Society of Northern Germany, which helped promote eugenic ideas throughout the country. The society was instrumental in the establishment of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, which was the leading German center for racial research. The institute was established in 1927 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which was also instrumental in funding the American eugenics movement.
German eugenicists highly admired and revered American eugenicists, and prominent American eugenicists, such as Harry H. Laughlin, became involved in German eugenics research initiatives. Laughlin, one of the architects of the American eugenics movement, was invited to Germany in the summer of 1926 to share his experience in eugenics. Laughlin, through his research on people of German birth in the United States, presented evidence of their alleged genetic degeneration.
Laughlin worked to establish a working relationship between German and American eugenicists. He helped organize the first International Eugenics Congress in Berlin in 1927, which had 1,000 attendees, including prominent American eugenicists. The congress was held under the patronage of the German government, and its objective was to promote international collaboration in eugenics. The American eugenicists who attended the congress promoted the idea of eugenics and shared their experiences in advancing eugenic practices in the United States.
German eugenicists also drew inspiration from American eugenics publications. Laughlin's book "The Eugenic Sterilization Laws" was widely circulated to German lawmakers, health officials and academics who were encouraged by these sterilization laws enacted in the United States. Laughlin's book proposed template legislation for the control of defective people and served as a model for the German sterilization laws that came later.
Social Darwinism and Eugenics in Nazi Germany
The Nazi regime promoted a totalitarian state, which was facilitated by the existing eugenic movement. In the early 1930s, the Nazi Party began to incorporate eugenics into its political ideology as a tool for furthering its political agenda. Eugenics became a linchpin in Nazi philosophy, and the party used eugenics as a justification for their racial policies.
German eugenicists embraced the view of Social Darwinism, which sought to apply Darwin's theory of evolution to human society. Social Darwinists believed that the human race evolved through a process of natural selection, and that the strong survived, while the weak perished. Supporters of eugenics believed that this process should be facilitated and that the weak should be eliminated to make way for the strong.
The Nazis, under Hitler's leadership, institutionalized eugenic ideas by enacting the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring, which allowed for forced sterilizations of people who were deemed unfit. This law was the first step towards Nazi Germany's genocidal policies towards social groups perceived as genetically inferior.
The Nazi regime implemented a range of policies, including involuntary sterilizations and mass killings of people who were deemed to be "unfit". These targeted social groups included people with physical or mental disabilities, homosexuals, Jews, gypsies, and people from other racial groups. The Nazi regime targeted people who were considered "life unworthy of life" and implemented policies aimed at eliminating these people from society.
Conclusion
The influence of the American eugenics movement on the German and Nazi eugenics movements was significant. The early German eugenics movement drew inspiration from the American eugenics movement, which was widely respected and held up as a model of scientific progress. German eugenicists saw the American eugenics movement as a means of improving the "racial purity" of the German people and used American publications and scholarship to inform their pursuit of eugenics.
It is crucial to note that the German and Nazi eugenics movements took American eugenics ideas to the extreme. The German eugenics movement was aimed at creating a superior Aryan race, while the American eugenics movement sought to improve society by selectively breeding desirable traits.
While the American eugenics movement was eclipsed by World War II, the German and Nazi eugenics movements continued to influence policy and political thinking throughout the world. The American eugenics movement was a poignant example of the dangers of using scientific research to legitimize political and social agendas. The lessons learned with the rise of the Nazi regime offer a warning to all nations for the need for diversity and a common humanism as the core of any social and political movement. Eugenics, though seemingly guided by science, was more of a misguided social experiment, and an excellent example of how bad ideas, driven by irrational fears, can lead to extreme consequences.
