David Hume, an 18th-century Scottish philosopher, has made significant contributions to the philosophy of causation and its relationship to miracles. Among his most notable works is his Treatise on Human Nature, where he articulates two distinctive definitions of cause. These definitions highlight the dualist nature of Hume's understanding of cause and effect relationships. In this essay, we will explicate Hume's two definitions of cause, their differences, his view on miracles and causation, and whether he believes in a physical or psychological component.
Hume defines cause in two ways. His first definition is primarily based on observation and empirical evidence. According to him, when we observe two events that occur in a sequence, we infer that the first event is the cause of the second. This is referred to as Hume's constant conjunction account of causation. For example, heating water on the stove causes the water to boil. This is because every time we heat water, it boils, and when we don't heat it, it doesn't boil. Therefore, Hume's definition of cause here is fundamentally tied to the laws of nature.
Hume's second definition of causation, commonly referred to as the necessary connection account, refers to the manner in which the cause produces the effect. According to Hume, when two events exhibit a constant conjunction, we cannot immediately infer that the first event causes the second. Instead, he asserts that our minds create an expectation that the second event will follow the first event. This expectation, in turn, creates a psychological habit that we expect the connection to remain constant. For example, a magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat does not cause the rabbit to appear; rather, our minds have a preconceived notion that the rabbit should appear, hence our excitement when the magician performs this trick.
These two definitions of cause differ. Hume's constant conjunction account of causation merely focuses on the empirical observation of the event while the necessary connection account is based on the nature of the event. The former definition focuses on the events' temporal and spatial sequence, while the latter definition involves a subjective mental process. Hence, the issue of cause and effect for Hume involves both objective and subjective elements.
Hume's view on miraculous events is heavily dependent on his theory of causation. In his work, he argued that miracles are events that are inconsistent with the laws of nature. Given that Hume's first definition of causation is based on the laws of nature, he maintains that miracles belong to a class of events that are not caused. This is because if these events were caused by something, then it would be consistent with the laws of nature, and therefore not miraculous. In other words, causation in Hume's sense is determined by the laws of nature. Since miracles are inconsistent with the laws of nature, they cannot be attributed to any natural or causal explanation.
Hume believes that causation involves a subjective mental process that forms habits of expectation. He argues that our beliefs about causation are not grounded in necessary connections between events but instead are formed by repeated and habitual experiences. Therefore, Hume's view on causation is purely psychological, and there is no physical element. In his work, he claims that we cannot observe necessary causal connections between events but only a constant conjunction of events. This means that there is no reason for believing in a necessary connection between events other than the formation of habitual expectations.
The dualistic nature of Hume's two definitions of cause is evident in how they relate to each other. While Hume's first definition relies on the laws of nature that govern all natural phenomena, his second definition is premised on a subjective psychological process. This duality, according to Hume, results in a distinction between two types of events that make up our experience, that is, natural and non-natural events. Natural events are those that follow the laws of nature, while non-natural events are those that do not, and hence are not part of our normal experience. For Hume, miraculous events fall under the category of non-natural events and, therefore, cannot be explained in terms of cause and effect relationship.
In conclusion, Hume's two definitions of cause highlight the importance of empirical observation and subjective mental processes to our understanding and experience of cause and effect relationships. The constant conjunction definition is based on empirical observation and the laws of nature that govern natural phenomena, while the necessary connection definition emphasizes the subjective mental process involved in forming habitual expectations. Hume's view on miracles also underscores this dualistic nature of cause and effect relationships. Hume argues that causation is purely psychological, and there is no physical element, and that miraculous events cannot be explained in terms of cause and effect relationships because they are inconsistent with the laws of nature. Hence, both Hume's view of causality and miracles offer valuable insights into the nature of causation and how it relates to our experience of the world.
