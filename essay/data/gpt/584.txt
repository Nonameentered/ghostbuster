Student debt has become a major issue that plagues millions of people worldwide, who are struggling to repay the loans they took out to finance their education. Apart from the financial burden, research has proven that student debt has a significant impact on mental health. There are various schools of thought on this matter, with some arguing that the relationship between student debt and mental health is weak or non-existent, while others contend that its effects are profound.
Firstly, studies indicate that student debt is associated with anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. Recent research has shown that student debt exacerbates psychological distress symptoms, primarily among low-income students and those who struggle to balance school and work. The looming fear of overwhelming debt impairs concentration, disrupts sleep patterns, and creates negative coping mechanisms that can exacerbate anxiety, depression, and stress. Students struggling with debt face enormous pressure to meet loan payments, jeopardizing their overall satisfaction and well-being.
A study by the American Psychological Association confirms the link between student debt and mental health challenges. The study found that 87% of college students experience stress due to financial concerns, and more than half of them believe that their academic performance is impacted. Financial concerns, including worrying about paying monthly bills, takes a toll on mental well-being that runs counter to the goal of higher education as a transformative, empowering experience. The negative effects of student debt on mental health are significant and severe.
Secondly, government policies are compounding the problem by making it more challenging for students to access financial aid or loan forgiveness programs. For instance, the Trump administration eliminated a program that enabled students who incurred debt while attending universities with a record of fraudulent or misleading practices to have their debts forgiven. The Department of Education also introduced new regulations that made it challenging for students to access loan forgiveness programs, even if their schools could not deliver appropriate education. Similarly, governments across the globe have implemented austerity measures that result in fewer resources for student welfare and mental health services. 
Fortunately, several steps can be taken to address this problem. For instance, governments should pursue policies that prioritize affordable education by subsidizing tuition fees and providing better financial aid packages. States could also invest more resources into counseling and mental health services to address the negative impacts of student debt, including identifying early warning signs and providing effective support to those affected. Educational institutions should ensure that students have access to adequate resources, information, and support, including a range of financial literacy programs, debt counseling, and other forms of assistance. These steps can go a long way in mitigating the mental health challenges associated with student debt.
In conclusion, there is a clear link between student debt and mental health, making this a crucial social issue that demands attention from policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders. The current debt situation is a significant source of anxiety and depression, reducing the economic and social well-being that should accompany college education. Restoring the faith of people in the system and reducing student debt will require a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes affordable tuition, better financial aid packages, increased resources for counseling and mental health services, and loan forgiveness programs. The impact of student debt is too substantial to ignore, and more interventions are required to ensure that higher education remains a source of empowerment and confidence.
