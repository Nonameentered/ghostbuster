In criminal justice, one of the most harmful errors that could happen is a false confession. A false confession occurs when an individual confesses to a crime they did not commit. The main factors causing these confessions include police coercion, manipulation, or threatening tactics during an interrogation session. In the United Kingdom, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) provisions aim to reduce the risk of false confessions and ensure that interrogation processes are fair. This essay discusses the effectiveness of PACE provisions in dealing with the causes of false confessions and their impact in eliminating the problem.
Introduced in 1984, PACE regulations brought significant changes to the way police carry out their investigative duties. These regulations govern various aspects of police detention, interrogation, and custody. PACE provisions apply to anyone that comes into contact with the police, including witnesses, victims, and suspects. One of the primary objectives of PACE is to ensure that police conduct their investigations in an ethical and lawful way. This legislation aims to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency in the criminal justice process, particularly during interrogations.
One of the leading reasons for a false confession is police coercion tactics during an interrogation. Police coercion constitutes the use of force or psychological tactics that force an individual to confess falsely. In cases where an individual is innocent, they may feel overwhelmed or manipulated by the situations, ultimately leading to a confession to what they did not do. PACE tackles this issue through its Code C provision, which describes the conduct of police during an interrogation. Code C stipulates that the police must not use inappropriate pressure when interviewing a suspect. The provision also stipulates that police must not make any threat concerning the charges, consequences of an interview, or any other form of inducement. 
Along with Code C, PACE introduced the "tape-record and time limit" rule. This rule requires the police to tape-record interviews with detained individuals and provide copies upon request. Taping interviews ensures a transparent process, creates unbiased evidence, and reduces risk for false confessions. Additionally, the time limit rule prevents excessive questioning that may result in coercion or prejudice against the suspect. By cutting down on intimidation tactics, PACE ensures that everyone has a more equal chance during interrogations, ultimately reducing the risks of a false confession.
PACE also addresses the issue of expert testimony and witness identification to reduce the risk of the wrongful prosecution of an individual. Under PACE Code D provisions, expert testimony in court proceedings must be independent and without influence from either party. This regulation goes a long way in ensuring that expert witnesses remain unbiased and that their testimony is based on objective evidence. PACE Code D regulates witness identification which creates a reliable method of identifying suspects. It requires that all identification evidence must be in a form that can evaluate the accuracy of the identification. The process of identification must involve an independent person without prior knowledge of a suspect's identity. By regulating expert evidence and witness identification, PACE helps to eliminate wrongful convictions that could come about due to errors, even if unintentional.
Despite these provisions, some argue that PACE's provisions fail to address fundamental issues that cause false confessions. For example, the act does not prohibit the police from using lies or deceit as a means of gathering evidence from suspects. Additionally, PACE does not require the attendance of legal representation at police interviews. Some argue that the right to an attorney should be absolute in criminal cases, as interrogations are complex to navigate without a lawyer present. These gaps in PACE provisions could lead to some level of coercion or pressure on individuals to confess.
Another critique of PACE provisions is their applicability in real-world circumstances. Some police officers may neglect to adhere to PACE's guidelines. Although interviews should stick to the regulation guidelines, many factors could make it difficult for police officers to follow them. For example, it is often challenging to decide whether or not a suspect is willing to be interviewed without the presence of an attorney. In cases where a suspect refuses to answer questions, some police officers may feel the pressure to take more extreme measures or use other detaining techniques to force compliance.
In conclusion, police officers' interrogation practices often lead to false confessions, which can harm individual lives and lead to wrongful convictions. The PACE provisions aim to counteract this problem by regulating essential aspects of interrogation and evidence gathering, limiting the police's use of coercion, and ensuring a fair process for all involved parties. Although the effectiveness of PACE in combating false confessions is not foolproof, the provisions certainly have considerable benefits in improving the fairness of police investigations. The PACE regulations provide a foundation for progress in creating a system that is fair to all members of society. In the criminal justice system, fairness and justice must be prioritized over expediency. Effective regulation and oversight of police conduct will decrease the consequences of false confessions and the likelihood of future wrongful convictions.
