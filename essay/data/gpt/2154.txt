Mythology has been a vital source of inspiration in storytelling since the beginning of human civilization. It roots back to ancient cultures where myths were told orally, passed down from generation to generation. As time passed, so did the medium through which these myths were told. Today, mythology in cinema has become a global phenomenon that has captivated audiences and helped filmmakers to express their creativity in ways that go beyond the limits of reality.
The human craving for storytelling is rooted in our desire to understand life and the world around us. Mythology in cinema offers an avenue through which viewers can experience a world beyond their own while creating connections and finding meaning in their own experiences. It allows people to gain insight into other cultures, as well as to explore the depths of human nature and emotions.
Mythology has a unique appeal in cinema due to its ability to tap into everyone's innate curiosity about the unknown and the supernatural. Further, the allure of mythology is strengthened by its ability to offer powerful archetypes that have played a significant role in human culture for centuries. These archetypes provide filmmakers with a rich set of characters, themes, and symbols to use in their stories, allowing them to develop powerful narratives that resonate with viewers.
Moreover, myths are stories that carry deep meaning and have endured through the ages because of their universal appeal. Myths deal with fundamental truths about human nature, the world, and the universe, expressed in a way that captures the imagination and stirs the soul. Depicting these myths in cinema is, therefore, a way of paying homage to traditions, culture, and history by preserving exciting tales of gods and heroes that have stood the test of time.
Over time, the depiction of mythology in cinema has undergone significant transformation. Classical films, such as The Ten Commandments (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), relied heavily on grandiose dialogue and lavish costumes to create a sense of awe and majesty in the viewer. The use of practical effects such as matte paintings and miniatures added to the grandeur of these historical and mythological epics.
As cinema moved into the modern era, filmmakers transitioned from practical effects to digital effects, making it easier to create a sense of the otherworldly in the viewer's mind. The use of special effects allowed filmmakers to create more realistic and detailed environments, creatures, and characters that fit better with a cinematic universe than with the stage-like environments of earlier films.
The rise of superheroes movies brought with it a new lens through which mythology is depicted in cinema. The blockbuster, Avengers: Endgame (2019), generated over $2.79 billion worldwide and culminated over a decade of storytelling that was rooted in comic book mythology. By adapting complex narratives, introducing multidimensional characters, and offering deeper reflections on human nature, superhero films have become modern myths that have captured the public’s imagination worldwide.
Moreover, the depiction of mythological characters has increasingly shifted to portray them as complex, multidimensional characters with struggles, strengths, and flaws. For instance, in Marvel's Thor series, the titular character is portrayed as arrogant and selfish, but grows into a more selfless hero, sacrificing personal desires to save others. This character development gives viewers a chance not only to enjoy thrilling adventures but also to connect with the characters on a deeper level, empathizing with their struggles and celebrating their triumphs.
Another unique aspect of the evolution of mythology in modern cinema is the embracing of global mythology, instead of relying solely on Greek and Roman mythology. Movies like Disney’s Moana (2016) and Marvel’s Black Panther (2018) have given rise to global myths and folklore by adapting them to a cinematic universe. By celebrating these diverse cultures, filmmakers help further the view of mythology as an instrument for cultural exchange and promoting empathy.
In conclusion, the appeal of mythology in cinema is multifaceted; it taps into our fascination with the supernatural while allowing us to explore fundamental truths about life, the world, and the universe. Over time, the depiction of myths in cinema has evolved from using grandiose dialogue and lavish costumes in classical films to relying heavily on digital effects and complex narratives in contemporary film-making. The modern depiction of mythological characters is more multidimensional, highlighting their struggles, strengths, and flaws. Finally, there is a newfound appreciation of global myths and folklore on cinema, helping to promote empathy and cultural exchange.
