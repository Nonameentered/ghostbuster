Blackpool Pleasure Beach is a quintessential seaside amusement park in the UK. From its humble beginnings in 1896, the park has garnered a cult-like following among locals and tourists alike, with its array of eccentric and thrilling rides, live entertainment, and beachfront location. While the park is typically viewed as a traditional tourist attraction, it also serves as a form of radical street performance that connects to the idea of the carnival as a critique of the status quo. In this essay, we will explore the significance of Blackpool Pleasure Beach as a form of radical street performance as well as its connections to the idea of carnival as a critique of the status quo. We will also examine the role of the public and employees in creating a carnivalesque atmosphere, the transformation of official space into playground, and the idea of fantasy as a means of creating a different kind of reality.
Before exploring the significance of Blackpool Pleasure Beach as a form of radical street performance, it is important to define what street performance is. Street performance refers to various forms of artistic expression, such as music, dance, mime, and acrobatics, that take place in public spaces and are designed to engage with and entertain audiences. Street performances were historically associated with marginalized groups, including beggars, vagrants, and gypsies, and were often considered low-brow or vulgar. However, over time, street performance has evolved into a respected and well-regarded art form, with many performers using it as a means of challenging the status quo and expressing political and social viewpoints.
Blackpool Pleasure Beach is a form of radical street performance due to its ability to subvert the traditional perceptions of amusement parks as bland and predictable. The park's carnivalesque atmosphere is created by a combination of factors, including its flamboyant rides, quirky architecture, and bright colours. The majority of rides at the park have an element of danger associated with them, such as the Big One, which is considered one of the tallest and fastest roller coasters in Europe, or the Valhalla water ride, which features a range of sensory experiences, from fog and fire effects to rapid drops and rapids. These rides are not for the faint of heart, creating an atmosphere of excitement and adrenaline.
The park's architectural style also contributes to its carnivalesque atmosphere. The park's main entrance is designed like a giant circus tent, complete with towering flags and life-sized elephants. The park also features a giant replica of the Eiffel Tower, a castle, and several other flamboyant structures that are reminiscent of a medieval fairground. The use of bright colours also adds to the carnivalesque atmosphere, with the park being lit up at night by a range of neon lights and colours.
The role of the public and employees in creating a carnivalesque atmosphere is also significant. The idea of the carnival as a critique of the status quo is rooted in the idea of social inversion, where social norms and hierarchies are temporarily suspended. At Blackpool Pleasure Beach, this social inversion is demonstrated by the behaviour of both visitors and employees. Visitors to the park are encouraged to 'let their hair down', forget their worries and have a great time. This creates a sense of liberation among visitors, with many people engaging in behaviours that they would not normally engage in, such as screaming on rides, dancing in public, or wearing flashy and eccentric clothing.
Furthermore, employees also play a significant role in creating a carnivalesque atmosphere at the park. Employees are encouraged to be as bubbly, energetic and eccentric as possible, with many of them dressing up in colourful costumes. This creates a sense of playfulness and freedom that is reminiscent of the carnival. The park's employees also engage in playful pranks and games with visitors, creating a sense of camaraderie and equality between the employees and visitors.
The transformation of official space into playground is another important aspect of Blackpool Pleasure Beach's carnivalesque atmosphere. The idea of the carnival as a critique of the status quo is rooted in the idea of temporary liberation from the constraints of everyday life. Blackpool Pleasure Beach achieves this by transforming an official space, designed for the purpose of delivering entertainment, into a playground. The park's rides and attractions, which are designed to excite and thrill visitors, create a sense of playfulness and freedom that is not usually found in official spaces. The park's loud music, bright colours, and general atmosphere of fun and laughter make it a place where visitors can let their guard down and simply enjoy themselves.
The idea of fantasy as a means of creating a different kind of reality is also significant at Blackpool Pleasure Beach. The park's rides, attractions, and overall atmosphere create a sense of escapism, where visitors can forget about their problems and immerse themselves in a different world. This is similar to the idea of the carnival as a critique of the status quo, where the carnival is a place where people can temporarily forget about the rules and institutions of society and immerse themselves in a world of their own creation. The role of fantasy in creating a different kind of reality is demonstrated by the park's most popular attraction, the ghost train. The ghost train is an indoor ride that takes visitors through a series of dark corridors and rooms, featuring a range of ghostly effects that are designed to scare and thrill visitors. The ride creates a sense of fear, mystery, and suspense, creating a fantasy world that is thrilling and exciting.
In conclusion, Blackpool Pleasure Beach is a form of radical street performance that connects to the idea of the carnival as a critique of the status quo. The park's carnivalesque atmosphere is created by a combination of factors, including its flamboyant rides, quirky architecture, and bright colours. The role of the public and employees in creating a carnivalesque atmosphere is also significant, as is the transformation of official space into playground and the idea of fantasy as a means of creating a different kind of reality. Overall, Blackpool Pleasure Beach is not just a place to ride roller coasters and eat candy floss. It is a place that challenges the status quo, creates a sense of freedom and escapism, and offers visitors a taste of the carnivalesque.
