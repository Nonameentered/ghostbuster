Ascorbate, also known as Vitamin C, has been shown to have varying effects on the survival time in days for different types of cancer. To display this data, stem and leaf plots can be used. 
A stem and leaf plot is a graphical display of data where the values are split into a stem (the leading digit or digits) and leaf (the trailing digit) to show the distribution of the data. For example, if we have the value 457, the stem would be 45 and the leaf would be 7. The stem and leaf plot would show each stem with its corresponding leaf values grouped horizontally. 
To show the effect of ascorbate on survival time for different types of cancer, we can create multiple stem and leaf plots for each cancer type. For instance, we can create a stem and leaf plot for lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. The key will be provided to show which stem represents which type of cancer. 
Furthermore, a positive correlation can be shown by the equation: y = mx + b, where y represents the survival time and x represents the amount of ascorbate given to patients. If the value of m is positive, then as x increases, y also increases, indicating a positive correlation between the two variables. 
Overall, using stem and leaf plots and understanding the equation for positive correlation can help display and interpret the data on the effect of ascorbate on the survival time in days for different types of cancer.
