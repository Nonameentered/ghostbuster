Brian Friel's play 'Translations' is set in the small town of Ballybeg in County Donegal, Ireland, in 1833, during the period of English colonization. The play depicts the impact of language on Irish culture and society, showing how language can be a tool of empowerment, but also a means of exploitation and suppression. Friel challenges traditional notions of language and cultural stagnation in Ballybeg through his portrayal of the transformative power of language and his critique of the English colonial system.
At the core of 'Translations' is the idea that language is a crucial aspect of cultural identity. The play primarily deals with the English attempt to impose their language and culture on the Irish population, with the English military setting up a school in Ballybeg to teach the Irish children English. Friel presents a world in which language is more than just a means of communication, but an essential part of social identity and cultural heritage. The Irish characters in the play speak Gaelic, which is presented as a valuable and integral part of their identity. This is evident in the characters' resistance to the imposition of English on them in the form of the school. The characters fear that the loss of their language will lead to the erosion of their culture and identity.
Friel conveys this idea through the characters of Hugh and Manus, who represent the older generation of Irish people. They resist English culture and language, believing it to be a threat to the Irish way of life. Hugh is a former schoolmaster who views the English school as a means of cultural imperialism. He criticizes the school for teaching English and not Gaelic. He says, "You come here speaking of years and generations, but to us it doesn't matter whether we pass on what we know in English or Irish." Hugh's resistance to English language and culture is tied to his resistance to English colonialism.
Manus, Hugh's son, is the quintessential Irish young man, who values his Irish identity above all else. He is a translator who is caught between the English and Irish cultures. Manus is conflicted because he believes that learning English will allow him to communicate with the English officials and better understand their motives, but he also fears the loss of his Irish identity. Manus says, "What wrong have we done? That the English should drive us to the woods with our own language?"
Through the characters of Hugh and Manus, Friel shows how language and cultural identity are intertwined, and how the loss of language leads to the loss of cultural identity.
Friel also presents the potential for language to empower and transform individuals and communities. The character of Sarah, a deaf girl, is a testament to this idea. In the play, Sarah is portrayed as a person who has been cut off from society because of the inability to communicate effectively with others. She is the only character who is fluent in both Gaelic and English, which allows her to act as a mediator between the two cultures. Sarah's ability to translate for the English officials and Irish locals brings her into the center of the play's action, and gives her a sense of purpose. Through Sarah, Friel shows that language can be a powerful tool of empowerment.
Furthermore, Friel challenges traditional notions of language and cultural stagnation in Ballybeg by portraying the transformative power of language. Friel critiques the notion that cultures can be static and unchanged. He shows that cultures are constantly evolving and transforming, even in the face of colonialism and imperialism. The play presents a world where cultures and languages intersect, and where translation is necessary to achieve understanding and communication.
Friel is also critical of the English colonial system's impact on Irish culture and society. The English officials in the play are portrayed as callous and dismissive of the Irish population's cultural heritage. The officials' attitude is epitomized by Captain Lancey, who is in charge of the English military operation in Ballybeg. Lancey represents the forces of English imperialism, and his attitude towards the Irish is one of superiority and disdain. He remarks, "You have to be taught to act like a civilized being. We are the civilizers." Friel critiques Lancey's attitude as a form of structural violence, where the English are attempting to erase Irish culture, and impose their own culture on Ireland.
In conclusion, Brian Friel's play 'Translations' depicts the impact of language on Irish culture and society. Friel challenges traditional notions of language and cultural stagnation in Ballybeg by portraying the transformative power of language, and his critique of the English colonial system. Through his portrayal of the transformative power of language and his critique of English imperialism, Friel shows that cultures and languages are not static, and have the potential to empower and transform individuals and communities. Friel's 'Translations' is a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving language and cultural heritage, and a testament to the fact that cultures are constantly evolving and adapting to change.
