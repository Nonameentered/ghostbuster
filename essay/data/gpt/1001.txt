The use of personal pronouns in inaugural speeches by American Presidents has been a subject of study for linguists and political scholars alike. Personal pronouns are one of the key elements of language that convey the speaker's identity, position, and stance. The pronoun "I" is particularly important as it indicates the speaker's authority, agency, and responsibility. Different theories have been proposed to explain the patterns and changes in Presidents' use of personal pronouns over time, and the emergence of corpus linguistics has provided new insights into these language choices.
Historically, American Presidents have used personal pronouns in their inaugural speeches in diverse ways, reflecting their rhetorical style, political agenda, and ideology. For instance, Presidents like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson tended to use plural pronouns such as "we" and "our" to emphasize the collective identity and shared responsibility of the newly formed nation. Washington's first inaugural speech in 1789 used both singular and plural pronouns, suggesting a balance between his individual vision and his commitment to the common good: "I shall ... endeavor to prove worthy of the confidence you have reposed in me ... Let us ... unite with one heart and one mind."
In contrast, some of the more recent Presidents have used personal pronouns in a more self-referential or assertive manner. For example, President John F. Kennedy's inaugural speech in 1961 used the pronoun "I" more than any other President had done before him, indicating his personal commitment and leadership: "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty." Similarly, President Ronald Reagan's inaugural speeches in 1981 and 1985 used the pronoun "we" sparingly and relied more on assertive and inclusive pronouns such as "I" and "you" to convey his vision and appeal to the American people: "We are a people who believe that every individual has the right to be free, to dream, to create, and to build ... You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time."
The changes in Presidents' use of personal pronouns over time can be explained by different theoretical perspectives, depending on the context and purpose of the speech. One theory is the strategic rhetoric theory, which posits that Presidents use personal pronouns to achieve specific goals, such as projecting their personality, creating a sense of connection with the audience, or asserting their legitimacy as a leader. Another theory is the social identity theory, which suggests that Presidents use personal pronouns to express and reinforce their status as a member of a group, whether that be the American people, the political establishment, or a particular party or ideology. A third theory is the linguistic style theory, which argues that Presidents' use of personal pronouns reflects their personality traits and cognitive patterns, such as their openness, dominance, or narcissism.
The emergence of corpus linguistics, which is the study of large collections of texts using computational tools, has provided new insights into the patterns and functions of personal pronouns in Presidents' speeches. Corpus linguistics allows researchers to analyze the frequencies, collocations, and distributions of words and phrases in a large dataset, and to detect the subtle variations and changes in language use over time. For example, a corpus analysis of the presidential inaugural speeches from 1789 to 2017 shows that the use of first-person pronouns, especially "I", has increased over time, while the use of collective pronouns, such as "we" and "our", has declined. This trend reflects the shift towards more individualistic and personalized rhetoric in American politics, as well as the growing role of the President as a public figure and celebrity.
The findings from corpus linguistics provide important insights into the impact of Presidents' language choices on the perception of solidarity and leadership among the American people. One study shows that the use of "I" pronouns in the inaugural speeches is correlated with higher ratings of the President's charisma and confidence, but also with lower ratings of warmth and empathy, which are associated with the use of collective pronouns and inclusive language. Another study shows that the use of "we" pronouns is associated with higher ratings of the President's credibility and trustworthiness, as well as with higher levels of social cohesion and national identity among the audience. The choice of personal pronouns thus has a significant impact on the effectiveness and legitimacy of the President's communication and leadership.
In conclusion, the use of personal pronouns in inaugural speeches by American Presidents has evolved over time, reflecting the changing political, social, and cultural contexts of American society. Theoretical perspectives such as strategic rhetoric, social identity, and linguistic style can explain the patterns and functions of personal pronouns as key elements of language use. The emergence of corpus linguistics provides new insights into the impact of Presidents' language choices on the perception of leadership and solidarity among the American people. The use of personal pronouns thus remains a crucial aspect of Presidential communication and rhetoric, shaping the public image and legacy of the American Presidency for generations to come.
