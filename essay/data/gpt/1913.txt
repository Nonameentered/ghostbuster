The Cycladic islands of the Aegean Sea played an essential role in the emergence of Neolithic societies in the eastern Mediterranean. These societies developed distinctive material cultures and models of interaction that reveal important aspects of their social and economic organization, beliefs, and practices. Island archaeology has contributed significantly to our understanding of the Neolithic period in the Aegean, but it also faces specific challenges related to the nature of its material record, the diversity of its communities, and the complexity of their relationships. This essay will explore the nature of Neolithic societies on the Cycladic islands, and the ways in which the active role of material culture, models of interaction, and ethnography implicate the viability of island archaeology.
The Neolithic period in the Aegean (ca. 7000-3000 BCE) was characterized by significant changes in human behavior and the environment. These changes led to the emergence of sedentary communities that relied on agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing for their subsistence. In the Cycladic islands, several distinctive cultures emerged, such as the Early Cycladic (ca. 3200-2700 BCE) and the Middle Cycladic (ca. 2700-2000 BCE), which developed distinct material cultures and social structures. These cultures are characterized by the production of elaborated marble figurines, vessels, and tools, as well as the use of communal tombs and fortified settlements.
One of the most notable features of the Cycladic Neolithic material culture is its production of elaborated marble figurines that represent human figures, animals, and other motifs. These figurines are considered to be some of the finest examples of prehistoric art in the world and reveal the importance of symbolism, religion, and social hierarchy in Cycladic societies. Scholars have suggested that these figurines were used for a variety of purposes, such as votive offerings, burial goods, and markers of social status. Moreover, the production of marble objects suggests that Cycladic societies had access to valuable natural resources and specialized technologies.
In addition to their material culture, Cycladic Neolithic societies developed models of interaction that shaped their social organization and their relationship with their environment and other communities. Communal tombs, for example, are one of the most common features of Cycladic Neolithic societies and reveal their collective approach to death and funerary practices. These tombs, which range from simple pits to elaborate underground chambers, were used for multiple burials and often included grave goods such as pottery, figurines, and jewelry. Communal tombs suggest that Cycladic societies had a collective approach to death and that they placed a significant emphasis on social memory and community identity.
Another notable feature of Cycladic Neolithic societies is their fortified settlements, which reflect their efforts to protect themselves from external threats and control their resources. These settlements, which range from small hilltop fortifications to larger towns, often include multiple walls, towers, and gates. The organization of space within these settlements also reveals their social hierarchy, with some areas reserved for public activities, such as storage and production, and others for private dwellings and elite residences. Fortified settlements highlight the importance of territoriality, competition, and cooperation in Cycladic societies and suggest that they had a complex relationship with their environment and other communities.
Island archaeology presents specific challenges and opportunities for the study of Neolithic societies in the Cycladic islands. On the one hand, the insularity of these communities and their limited access to natural resources create a specific material record that differs from their mainland counterparts. On the other hand, the diversity of Cycladic societies and their interactions with other communities underscores the need for comparative and interdisciplinary approaches to island archaeology. Ethnographic studies of contemporary island societies and the ecological and climatic changes that occurred during the Neolithic also inform our understanding of the social complexity and resilience of these communities.
In conclusion, the Neolithic societies of the Cycladic islands developed distinctive material cultures and models of interaction that reveal important aspects of their social and economic organization, beliefs, and practices. The production of elaborated marble figurines, the use of communal tombs, and the construction of fortified settlements highlight the importance of symbolism, collective identity, and territoriality in Cycladic societies. Island archaeology presents specific challenges related to the nature of its material record, the diversity of its communities, and the complexity of their relationships. Yet, it also offers specific opportunities for the study of the social complexity and resilience of Neolithic communities in the Aegean.
