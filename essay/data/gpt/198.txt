The development of a country is a multifaceted concept, which is affected by various economic, social, and political factors. One of the key indicators of development is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total output of goods and services produced by a country in a given period. However, the military expenditure as a percentage of GDP is also considered an important factor in the development of a country. It is believed that excessive military spending can have a negative impact on the economy and hinder development. 
To investigate the relationship between GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 50 random countries in the year 2002, the World Development Indicators (WDI) were used, and statistical features of Excel were employed to analyze the data. The WDI is a comprehensive database that provides socio-economic data for different countries worldwide, making it an excellent tool to study various aspects of development. 
The study used two key indicators of development, GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, to examine the economic performance of 50 countries in the year 2002. The sample included a mix of developing and developed countries, encompassing different regions of the world. 
The findings of the study revealed that the average GDP of the 50 countries in the sample was $1.5 trillion, with the United States having the highest GDP of $10.4 trillion and Burkina Faso having the lowest GDP of $4.8 billion. The average military expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.44%, with Saudi Arabia having the highest military expenditure of 10.28% and Costa Rica having the lowest military budget of 0.51%. 
Using the statistical features of Excel, the study computed the correlation coefficient between GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The correlation coefficient is a measure of association between two variables, which ranges from -1 to +1. A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables. 
The analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient between GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP was -0.072. This indicates a weak negative correlation between the two variables, suggesting that countries with higher military expenditure as a percentage of GDP tend to have lower GDP. However, this correlation is weak, and the relationship between GDP and military expenditure cannot be considered significant. 
The study also examined the relationship between GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP for different regions of the world. The results showed that the regions with the strongest negative correlation between GDP and military expenditure were sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with correlation coefficients of -0.35 and -0.23, respectively. On the other hand, Latin America and the Caribbean had a weak positive correlation of 0.12, indicating that countries in this region had higher military budgets relative to their GDP. 
One of the limitations of this study is that the data used is from only one year, 2002. To get a better understanding of the relationship between GDP and military expenditure, it is important to analyze the data over a longer period. It is also important to consider other indicators of development, such as health, education, and poverty levels, to get a more comprehensive understanding of development in a country. 
In conclusion, this study examined the relationship between GDP and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 50 random countries in the year 2002. The analysis using statistical features of Excel and the World Development Indicators revealed a weak negative correlation between the two variables. The study also found that sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia had the strongest negative correlation between GDP and military expenditure, while Latin America and the Caribbean had a weak positive correlation. Despite the limitations of the study, these findings provide valuable insights into the role of military expenditure in development.
