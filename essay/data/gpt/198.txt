Mathematics is a vast subject that encompasses many different areas of study, including algebra, geometry, and analysis. One of the central topics in algebra is field theory, which is concerned with the properties of algebraic structures known as fields. In this essay, we will explore the relationship between field extensions, irreducible polynomials, and minimum polynomials. We will also examine the role played by the Eisenstein irreducibility criterion in determining the irreducibility of polynomials, and how Theorem 2.17 helps in understanding the properties of constructible points.
Field extensions are an important concept in algebraic field theory. Essentially, they represent an extension of a given field by adjoining one or more elements to it. For example, consider the field of real numbers, denoted by ℜ. We can extend this field by adjoining a new element, 𝑖, such that 𝑖² = -1. The resulting extended field is denoted as ℂ, the field of complex numbers. We can represent this extension as ℂ= ℜ(𝑖), where ℜ(𝑖) denotes the real numbers adjoined with 𝑖.
In general, a field extension is denoted as 𝐾(𝑎), where 𝐾 is the original field and 𝑎 is the element being adjoined. If we can write an element 𝑏 in the form 𝑏 = 𝑘₀ + 𝑘₁𝑎 + ⋯ + 𝑘ₙ−₁𝑎ⁿ⁻¹ for some integers n and 𝑘ᵢ ∈ 𝐾, then we say that 𝑏 belongs to the extension 𝐾(𝑎). We call the degree of the extension [𝐾(𝑎):𝐾] the number of elements needed to generate 𝐾(𝑎) over K.
Irreducible polynomials play a crucial role in understanding field extensions. A polynomial over a field 𝐾 is said to be irreducible over 𝐾 if it cannot be expressed as the product of two non-constant polynomials in 𝐾[x]. In other words, a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into two smaller polynomials within the same field.
Suppose 𝐹 is a field extension of 𝐾, and let 𝑝(𝑥) be a polynomial in 𝐾[x]. If 𝑝(𝑥) is irreducible over 𝐾, then it is also irreducible over 𝐹. This result follows from the fact that every element of 𝐹 is a root of some polynomial in 𝐾[x], and that the degree of 𝑝(𝑥) is preserved under field extensions. Thus, if 𝑝(𝑥) could be factored in 𝐹[x], then it would also factor over 𝐾[x], contradicting the assumption that 𝑝(𝑥) is irreducible over 𝐾.
The minimum polynomial of an element 𝑎 in a field extension 𝐾(𝑎) is defined as the monic polynomial of smallest degree in 𝐾[x] which has 𝑎 as a root. The minimum polynomial of an element 𝑎 is unique, and it is irreducible over 𝐾. Moreover, every element of 𝐾(𝑎) can be expressed as a polynomial in 𝑎 with coefficients in 𝐾, and the degree of such a polynomial is at most n-1, where 𝑛 is the degree of the minimum polynomial of 𝑎. This is why we call the minimum polynomial, n, the degree of the extension field 𝐾(𝑎) over K.
The Eisenstein irreducibility criterion is a powerful tool for determining whether a polynomial is irreducible or not. According to the Eisenstein criterion, a polynomial 𝑓(𝑥) ∈ ℤ[𝑥] is irreducible over ℚ if there exists a prime number 𝑝 such that:
1. 𝑝 divides all the coefficients of 𝑓(𝑥) except the leading coefficient.
2. 𝑝² does not divide the constant term of 𝑓(𝑥).
To see why this is true, note that if 𝑓(𝑥) factors in ℚ[x], then it must also factor in ℤ[x]. Furthermore, if 𝑓(𝑥) factors into two non-constant polynomials, then the leading coefficients of both factors must be units in ℤ (i.e., either 1 or -1). Therefore, each coefficient of 𝑓(𝑥) is divisible by 𝑝 except the leading coefficient, which is a unit. Hence, 𝑝 divides all coefficients of the factors except their leading coefficients, and 𝑝² divides the constant term. This contradicts the Eisenstein hypothesis, which implies that 𝑝 does not divide the constant term.
Theorem 2.17 is a crucial result in understanding the properties of constructible points. It states that a real number 𝑎 is constructible if and only if there exists a tower 𝑄 = 𝐾₀ ⊆ 𝐾₁ ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ 𝐾ₙ = 𝑞, where each 𝐾ᵢ is an extension of the previous field in the tower and has degree at most 2 over the previous field. Moreover, for each i, either √𝑏 ᵢ or −√𝑏ᵢ ∈ 𝐾ᵢ for some 𝑏ᵢ ∈ 𝐾ᵢ−₁.
To understand how this relates to irreducible polynomials and field extensions, let us examine the case of a constructible regular 𝑛-gon, where 𝑛 is a power of 2. We know that the constructible points are generated by successive extensions of the field ℚ by square roots. It follows that the constructible regular 𝑛-gon is constructible if and only if there is a chain of fields ℚ = 𝐾₀ ⊆ 𝐾₁ ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ 𝐾ᵣ, where 𝐾ᵢ has degree 2 over 𝐾ᵢ−₁, and 𝑎 ∈ 𝐾ᵣ is a root of a polynomial over ℚ of degree 2ⁿ. Therefore, the minimum polynomial of 𝑎 over ℚ has degree 2ⁿ.
In conclusion, the relationship between field extensions, irreducible polynomials, and minimum polynomials is fundamental in algebraic field theory. Field extensions represent the extension of a given field by adjoining one or more elements to it. Irreducible polynomials are those that cannot be expressed as the product of two non-constant polynomials in the same field. The minimum polynomial of an element 𝑎 in a field extension 𝐾(𝑎) is defined as the monic polynomial of smallest degree that has 𝑎 as a root, which is unique and irreducible over 𝐾. The Eisenstein irreducibility criterion is a powerful tool that helps determine whether a polynomial is irreducible or not. Finally, Theorem 2.17 is a critical result in understanding the properties of constructible points and their connection to field extensions.
