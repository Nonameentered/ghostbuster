Food poisoning can be defined as the presence of harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemicals in the food. It can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases, dehydration, kidney failure, and even death. Unfortunately, food poisoning cases have been on the rise globally over the past few years. Various reasons can be attributed to the increase in food poisoning cases. In this essay, I will explore some of the reasons that have led to an increase in food poisoning cases, the three main food safety hazards, laws, and regulations that food businesses should follow to ensure food safety, and how people can be made aware of food safety.
The increase in food poisoning cases over the past 20 years can be attributed to various factors, including globalization, changes in eating habits, and poor food handling practices. The globalization of the food industry has enabled food to be transported faster and more efficiently across borders worldwide. However, it has also led to the increased likelihood of contamination during transportation, processing, and storage. Changes in eating habits have also contributed to the rise in food poisoning cases. Society today places a higher value on convenience and fast food, which requires quick and easy preparation. Unfortunately, this has led to a decrease in hygiene, which can lead to food poisoning. Lastly, poor food handling practices have contributed to the increase in food poisoning cases. This includes poor storage techniques, incorrect cooking temperatures, and an overall lack of hygiene in the kitchen, all of which can lead to the growth and spread of harmful microorganisms.
There are three main food safety hazards that can lead to food poisoning - biological, chemical, and physical. Biological hazards are caused by the presence of harmful microorganisms in food, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These microorganisms can survive in food that is not cooked properly or when hygiene is not maintained during food preparation. Chemical hazards are caused by the presence of toxins or chemicals in food, such as pesticides, cleaning products, and heavy metals. These can occur during the production, processing, and storage of food. Physical hazards are caused by the presence of foreign objects in food, such as broken glass, metal shavings, and plastic. These can occur during processing, packaging, and storage of food. 
Preventing food poisoning requires a combination of measures implemented by the food industry and individuals. To prevent biological hazards, it is essential to follow proper food handling and storage practices. This includes washing hands and surfaces regularly, separating raw and cooked food, cooking food thoroughly, and properly storing food to prevent cross-contamination. Chemical hazards can be prevented by properly labeling and storing chemicals, using them in a controlled environment with protective gear, and ensuring that food is not stored near chemicals. Physical hazards can be prevented by proper packaging, storage, and handling of food. It is crucial to hold food in containers that are not susceptible to breakage or damage, and to inspect the containers before preparing or serving food.
Despite various measures, some people are not as aware of food safety as they should be. In some developing countries, a lack of education and poor sanitation facilities can lead to an increase in food poisoning cases. Furthermore, people in developed countries may think that food poisoning is uncommon, as the media only covers major outbreaks or incidents. This can lead to less regard for food safety. Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. It is vital to raise awareness of the dangers of food poisoning, the measures necessary to prevent it, and the role individuals can play in ensuring food safety. This can be achieved through education programs, media campaigns, and training for those who work in the food industry to ensure that they follow food safety regulations. Furthermore, food manufacturers and retailers should also be responsible for providing consumers with clear information on the foods that they are consuming.
Laws and regulations are essential in ensuring that food safety is maintained across all levels of the food industry. Various laws and regulations that food businesses must follow to ensure food safety include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOPs), Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These regulations help to ensure that food is produced safely, food handlers are trained, and food is tested for harmful pathogens. Compliance with these regulations is monitored by government agents, who inspect food establishments to ensure that they are following the rules.
In conclusion, food poisoning cases have been on the rise globally over the past few years. This can be attributed to various factors, including globalization, changes in eating habits, and poor food handling practices. The three main food safety hazards - biological, chemical, and physical - can lead to food poisoning. Preventing food poisoning requires a combination of measures implemented by the food industry and individuals. Despite various measures, some people are not as aware of food safety as they should be, and addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. Lastly, laws and regulations are essential in ensuring that food safety is maintained across all levels of the food industry.
