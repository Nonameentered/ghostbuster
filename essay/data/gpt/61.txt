The legal system relies on the jury system to provide fair and impartial decisions. The practice of jury decision making can be complex, with many factors affecting the outcome. The storyboard model is a commonly used tool to help understand the decision-making process of juries in a structured manner. It is a framework that divides the decision-making process into three parts: story construction, story assessment, and story selection. This essay will explore the storyboard model of jury decision making, how it impacts the deliberation process, and if it is an effective way to analyze jury decisions.
The story construction phase of the storyboard model is the initial stage of the decision-making process. In this phase, the jury considers the evidence presented in the trial to construct a story that explains the sequence of events. They work to piece together the evidence presented to them, interpret the meaning of the events, and construct a narrative. In this phase, jurors rely on the information that has been presented to them, such as witness testimony, physical evidence, and exhibits. They may also draw on their past experiences, knowledge, and beliefs to help construct the story.
The story assessment phase is the second part of the storyboard model of jury decision making. In this phase, the jury evaluates the story constructed in the first phase. They analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence presented, consider the reliability of witnesses, and weigh the credibility of different accounts. They may also consider the possibility of different interpretations of the evidence. This stage involves critical thinking and reflection on the first stage of construction. Jurors may have to consider different perspectives on the evidence presented to them to determine the most plausible account of events.
The final phase of the storyboard model is story selection. After the story has been constructed and assessed, jurors use their experience and knowledge to determine the most probable outcome. It is the final step in determining the verdict. In this phase, the jury analyzes the evidence and decides which of the competing accounts is most compelling. The jury will consider different elements of evidence, weigh the credibility of witnesses, and assess the evidence from the story assessment phase to make a final determination. They will also consider the legal principles presented to them, such as the burden of proof and the elements of a crime.
The storyboard model of jury decision making is an effective tool to analyze the decision-making process of a jury. It provides a clear and structured way to understand how juries come to their conclusions. However, the model is not without limitations. The storyboard model assumes that jurors follow a logical, systematic approach to decision making. In practice, jurors may not always follow this approach due to cognitive limits, biases, or group dynamics. Jurors may be influenced by their own experiences and beliefs, which may lead to irrational or inconsistent decision making. Additionally, the storyboard model does not take into account external factors that may affect the decision-making process, such as societal pressures, media coverage, or public opinion.
One of the key impacts of the storyboard model of jury decision making is on the deliberation process. The storyboard model emphasizes the importance of deliberation, which is the process by which jurors reach a decision. Deliberation is a formal process in which jurors discuss the evidence presented, share their views, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments. It is designed to promote an exchange of ideas and viewpoints, which can help to identify errors or gaps in reasoning and ensure a fair and impartial decision. The storyboard model helps to structure the deliberation process by providing a framework for analysis and discussion.
The storyboard model also has implications for legal professionals, such as judges and lawyers. They may use the model to understand how juries reach their decisions and to improve the presentation of evidence in a trial. The model can help legal professionals to anticipate how jurors may react to different pieces of evidence and to tailor their arguments accordingly. It can also help legal professionals to identify gaps in their case and to present evidence in a more effective manner.
In conclusion, the storyboard model of jury decision making is an effective tool to analyze the decision-making process of juries. It provides a clear and structured way to understand how juries come to their conclusions, and how the deliberation process impacts the decision-making process. However, the model is not without limitations, as it assumes that jurors follow a logical, systematic approach to decision making. Additionally, the model does not take into account external factors that may affect the decision-making process. Despite these limitations, the storyboard model remains an important tool for legal professionals to understand how juries reach their decisions and to improve their presentation of evidence.
