Local governance in the UK refers to the structures and processes through which local government services are provided to citizens. It involves a range of actors, from elected officials to public, private, and voluntary organizations, working together to deliver services and improve quality of life in local communities. This essay will examine the current system of local governance in the UK, recent changes, the influence of higher levels of government, relationships between public, private, and voluntary agencies, and some of the main challenges facing local governance today.
The current system of local governance in the UK consists of a two-tiered system that includes county and district councils. County councils are responsible for delivering services across larger geographic areas, such as education, social services, and highways. District councils provide services at a more local level, such as waste management, planning, and housing services. In addition to these councils, there are also unitary authorities and metropolitan boroughs, responsible for providing a range of services across larger areas.
Recent changes to the system of local governance in the UK include the introduction of directly elected mayors, increased devolution of powers to local authorities, and the creation of combined authorities. Directly elected mayors have been introduced in certain areas of the country, with the aim of increasing local accountability, increasing the visibility of local government, and speeding up decision-making processes. The devolution of powers to local authorities aims to increase local decision-making, enabling local politicians to have more control over local services such as transport, housing, health and social care, and education. Combined authorities are collaborations between local authorities in order to pool resources and deliver services more efficiently.
Local government in the UK is influenced and controlled by higher levels of government such as the EU and international legislation. EU legislation affects local government in areas such as environmental protection, consumer protection, and procurement. International legislation has also affected the responsibilities of local government, particularly around issues such as climate change, terrorism, and human rights. English legislation has had a significant impact on local government as well. Examples of this include the Localism Act 2011 which introduced a range of measures giving communities increased powers and responsibilities; the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 which established the framework for devolving powers from central government to local government; and the Local Government Finance Act 2012 which introduced a new funding system for local government.
The relationship between local government and other public, private, and voluntary agencies has evolved over time. The role of local government has shifted from providing services to delivering services, working in partnership with other organizations, and enabling communities to take more responsibility for their own needs. The private sector has increasingly played a role in local government, through public-private partnerships and outsourcing of public services. The voluntary sector has also become more important, delivering services such as healthcare, education, and social care.
One of the main challenges facing local governance in the UK today is the issue of funding. Local authorities have experienced significant reductions in funding from central government, which have impacted their ability to provide services. According to a report from the National Audit Office (2018), local government funding has decreased by 49.1% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2017-18. This has led to cuts in services such as libraries, parks, and youth services. Another challenge is the issue of accountability. With increasing devolution of powers to local authorities, the need for greater transparency and accountability has become essential. Lastly, the issue of population growth and demographic changes has also had implications for local governance, particularly with regards to the provision of housing and infrastructure.
In conclusion, the current system of local governance in the UK is a two-tiered system consisting of county and district councils. Recent changes to the system include the introduction of directly elected mayors, increased devolution of powers to local authorities, and the creation of combined authorities. Local government in the UK is controlled and influenced by higher levels of government, international legislation, and national legislation. The relationship between local government and other public, private, and voluntary agencies has evolved over time. Some of the main challenges facing local governance in the UK today include the issue of funding, accountability, and demographic changes.
