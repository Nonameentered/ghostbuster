Ethnomethodology is an approach to sociology that challenges traditional methods of understanding social norms and interactions. This approach seeks to reveal the ways in which people create and maintain social order through their interactions and communication. Ethnomethodology emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against traditional sociological approaches, which were seen as insufficient in their ability to explain the complexity of social behavior. Ethnomethodologists argue that traditional sociological approaches fail to capture the ways in which people constantly negotiate and renegotiate social norms through their interactions and that an examination of these processes is necessary to truly understand social life.
One of the key features of ethnomethodology is its focus on the ways in which people use language and communication to create and maintain social order. Ethnomethodologists argue that people engage in a constant process of interpreting and interpreting the meaning of social cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, in order to make sense of social situations. They believe that this process is essential to understanding how social norms are created and maintained.
To illustrate this process, D. Lawrence Wieder’s case study of “the code” explores the semi-formal normative body maintained by residents in a rehabilitative facility for narcotic-addict felons on parole. This study focuses on the ways in which the residents negotiate and maintain their own set of norms and rules within the facility, despite the presence of formal rules and regulations set by the institution. The code is a set of social norms and rules that govern the behavior of the residents within the facility, and it is created and maintained through the residents’ interactions and communication with each other.
Wieder’s study reveals that the negotiation of social norms in social interaction is a highly complex process. The residents of the facility must constantly interpret and reinterpret the meaning of social cues, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, in order to navigate their interactions with each other and avoid conflict. They must also negotiate the meaning of their interactions in order to maintain their own sense of social order within the facility. This process is highly dynamic and can change rapidly in response to new social situations or changes in the environment.
One of the strengths of the ethnomethodological approach is its ability to reveal the complexity of social interaction and the ways in which social norms are constantly being negotiated and renegotiated. By focusing on the communication and interpretation processes that underlie social order, ethnomethodologists are able to provide a rich and nuanced view of social life that traditional sociological approaches fail to capture.
However, there are also limitations to this approach. Ethnomethodologists often focus on the micro-level processes of social interaction, which can make it difficult to see the broader social forces that influence behavior and shape social norms. Additionally, the emphasis on communication and interpretation processes can make it difficult to measure or quantify social phenomena, which can limit the applicability of this approach in some areas of research.
Another key insight of ethnomethodology is its focus on power and the ways in which power influences the negotiation of social norms. Power is a key factor in the creation and maintenance of social order, and the negotiation of social norms is often influenced by the distribution of power within a social group or institution.
The case study of “the code” reveals the ways in which power dynamics influence the negotiation of social norms within the facility. The residents of the facility are largely marginalized individuals who have been incarcerated for drug-related offenses, and they often lack the social power to challenge the formal rules and regulations set by the institution. However, they are able to exert some degree of power by creating and maintaining their own set of norms and rules through their interactions with each other. This allows them to create a sense of social order and control within the facility, despite the institutional power that exists outside of their social group.
Overall, the ethnomethodological approach provides a valuable perspective on social norms and interactions, and the case study of “the code” offers insights into the complexity of this process. By focusing on the communication and interpretation processes that underlie social order, ethnomethodologists are able to provide a nuanced view of social life that traditional sociological approaches fail to capture. However, this approach also has limitations, and researchers must be careful to balance their focus on micro-level processes with an understanding of the broader social forces that shape social behavior. Additionally, the role of power in the negotiation of social norms must be carefully considered, as it can have a significant impact on the creation and maintenance of social order.
