Delinquency among girls remains a contentious issue, with debates surrounding the criminalization of female offending and the gendered labelling of deviant behavior. Despite the growing recognition of female delinquency, female offenders receive different treatment than male counterparts. This essay will explore the debates surrounding delinquency among girls and how gendered labelling affects accusations and subsequent punishment by the justice system. It will also evaluate the different styles and attitudes of parenting that affect delinquency, the use of different terms of reference for boys and girls and the double standards implemented by the justice system.
The issue of delinquency among girls is often overlooked or treated differently than male delinquency due to social norms and gender stereotypes. These stereotypes often result in gendered labelling, which refers to the process of categorizing deviant behavior differently based on gender. Female offending is often labelled using terms such as 'tomboy', 'slut', 'bad girl' or 'troubled'. In contrast, male offending is referred to as 'troublemaker', 'delinquent', and 'juvenile offender'. Such labels serve to reinforce gender roles and stereotypes, encourage sexist attitudes and perpetuate the concept that female delinquency is an abnormal and violating behavior.
Parenting styles, specifically, the authoritarian parenting style, have been identified as a contributing factor to delinquency among girls. Authoritarian parenting is characterized by inflexible rules, harsh punishments, and lack of warmth, emotional support, and communication. Girls who grow up in such households may be more likely to engage in deviant behavior as a way of seeking attention and gaining autonomy from their parents. However, studies suggest that the opposite of authoritarian parenting, permissive parenting, which is characterized by lack of discipline, may have a similar impact on girls, leading them to engage in risky behaviors.
Another contributing factor to the onset of delinquency among girls is peer influence. Girls are exposed to various forms of peer pressure, including academic pressure, social pressure, and sexual pressure. As a result, the desire to fit in or be accepted by peers compels girls to engage in risky behaviors. Girls who experience peer pressure may be more vulnerable to committing crimes such as drug abuse, theft, and violence.
Furthermore, societal attitudes towards women and female offenders have contributed to the double standards implemented by the justice system. Female offenders are often perceived as being more sympathetic than their male counterparts due to gender-based stereotypes. The media often glamorizes female criminals, portraying them as loveable bad girls or misunderstood victims. This attitude has affected court sentencing and has led to reduced punishment for women.
Moreover, the justice system has implemented double standards that differentiate between male and female offenders. The erroneous belief that women do not commit crimes as frequently as men leads to lenient sentences and a lack of justice for female victims. For example, in the United States, female offenders are more likely to receive shorter sentences than males for the same crimes. This is partly due to stereotypes about women as caretakers and responsible for the care of children and households. As a result, girls who engage in deviant behavior do not receive the harsh and punitive treatments given to boys.
Research has shown that female offenders are more likely to suffer from mental health issues and substance abuse than their male counterparts. Girls get involved in crime in part due to prior experiences with sexual abuse and trafficking or poverty and deprivation, and gender disparities due to unequal access to resources. Without equal access to education, housing, healthcare, and mental health resources, girls who engage in deviant behavior may not have the support necessary to break out of the cycle.
It is pertinent to address gendered labelling, parental style and peer pressure and the double standards implemented by the justice system to understand the delinquency crises among girls adequately. Programs that assist female offenders with mental health treatment, education, and job training can, therefore, be seen as a way of reducing recidivism and promoting self-sufficiency.
In conclusion, the debates surrounding delinquency among girls, and how gendered labelling affects accusations and subsequent punishment by the justice system are complex and multifaceted. The various styles and attitudes of parenting that affect delinquency, the use of different terms of reference for boys and girls and the double standards implemented by the justice system, continue to have a detrimental effect on female offenders. Therefore, a holistic approach to the problem is necessary, incorporating mentoring programs, support groups, parental education, and community intervention initiatives to address the root causes of female delinquency. Ultimately, society needs to rethink its preconceived notions of gender and the ways in which it treats female delinquency.
