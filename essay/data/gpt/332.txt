Intergroup relations and prejudice have been a significant issue in society for decades now, and it continues to create conflicts and societal tensions between different groups. These hostilities and conflicts often escalate into political violence such as terrorist acts and wars. Social psychologists have developed several theories and explanations to help us understand intergroup relations and prejudice. Some of these theories include the social identity theory, realistic conflict hypothesis, and social dominance theory. This essay will explore these theories, their contributions to our understanding of societal conflicts and hostility, and their usefulness in reducing terrorist acts and political violence.
Social Identity Theory
Social Identity theory, developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner in the 1970s, suggests that individuals categorize themselves into social groups based on their common traits, beliefs, and values. In-group members define themselves in opposition to out-group members, creating a sense of belonging and identity. The theory suggests that people strive to maintain a positive social identity, leading to in-group favoritism and prejudice against out-groups. This bias is often associated with implicit bias, stereotype, and discrimination.
The social identity theory suggests that intergroup conflicts and hostility are exacerbated when the psychological need of belonging and feeling significant are not fulfilled. This triggers an attempt to establish positive identity by reinforcing and strengthening one's in-group identification and disparaging the out-group. One example of the social identity theory in practice is the American national identity. Americans often define themselves in opposition to individuals from the Middle East, primarily Muslims. Over the years, the American media has reported stereotypically about Muslims, especially after the 9/11 terrorist attack, creating a lot of tension and hostility.
Realistic Conflict Theory
The Realistic Conflict Theory suggests that intergroup hostility arises when two or more groups compete for limited resources, including power, territory, and wealth. This competition leads to conflict as groups struggle to gain dominance or security, resulting in a situation of win-lose. As each group fights for their interests, this leads to the construction and reinforcement of negative stereotypes of the other group to justify their actions.
Realistic conflict theory explains the hostility and conflict between America and the Middle East as a result of a competition for resources, particularly oil. The Middle East, with the largest oil reserves globally, holds significant power and influence over the global oil market. Governments and corporations worldwide are actively bidding for access to this crucial commodity. The United States, one of the largest global consumers of oil, has had to engage in the politics and conflicts surrounding oil in the Middle East. The control of oil in the Middle East has led to religious, political, and economic battles, exacerbating cultural differentiation and conflicts.
Social Dominance Theory
According to the social dominance theory, societal inequality is a result of group-based social hierarchy or power structures. This hierarchy exists because members of dominant groups seek to maintain their hegemony and suppress subordinate groups through discrimination, ideologies, and policies. The theory suggests that these power structures maintain the domination of certain groups, leading to inequality, social conflicts, and hostility.
In the context of America and the Middle East, the social dominance theory explains the hostility as being due to Western hegemonic positions. The West holds economic, political, and military power, and they have used this power both before and after the 9/11 attacks to fuel conflicts and maintain control over the Middle East, leading to anti-Western sentiments. 
Religion and Intergroup Relations
Religion has been a significant factor in the relationship between America and the Middle East. Religious differences create divisions between groups, leading to prejudices and hostilities. Particularly, Islam and Christianity are the two largest religions in the world, and there have been several conflicts and wars between these religions' followers. Religion is often used as an excuse for war or acts of terror. 
The American media coverage of Muslims after the 9/11 attacks has fueled Islamophobia in America, while America's military actions in the Middle East have led to serious anti-Western sentiments in the muslim community. The differing religious beliefs in this conflict prevent individuals from having civil and healthy conversations
Proposed Solutions
The Contact Hypothesis is one solution that researchers have proposed as a means of reducing intergroup prejudice. The theory suggests that prejudice and hostility between groups can be reduced through meaningful interpersonal interactions, allowing for the recognition of similarities while promoting the establishment of mutual respect among group members. This theory suggests that interaction with individuals from other groups humanizes the other group and helps reduce prejudice. 
Another solution is Based on Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment, where superordinate goals that require cooperation between groups help reduce intergroup hostility. Superordinate goals refer to a goal that requires the group's cooperation, leading them to see themselves as part of a common group rather than as separate, hostile groups. 
Conclusion
Intergroup relations and prejudice have been a significant issue in society, leading to conflicts and political violence inAmerica and the Middle East. The social identity theory, realistic conflict theory, and social dominance theory provide us with a better understanding of the sources of intergroup conflict and hostility. Theories such as the contact hypothesis and the superordinate goals contribute to our understanding of how to reduce hostility and intergroup prejudice. However, the complexity and multilayered nature of conflicts and social tensions, like in America and the Middle East, means that these theories are not sufficient on their own and require multiple other tools for successful implementation. It is necessary to address the root causes of the conflict, particularly economic, political, and religious differences, for a more peaceful and harmonious society.
