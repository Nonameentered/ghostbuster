The Van't Hoff factor, denoted by i, is a unitless factor used to indicate the extent of dissociation of an electrolyte in solution. It expresses the number of ions or particles formed from each molecule of the electrolyte in solution. The Van't Hoff factor can be obtained by comparing the observed depression of the freezing point of the solution to the calculated depression of the freezing point considering the solute as a non-electrolyte.
In the case of acids, the Van't Hoff factor is related to the number of protons that can be released by each molecule of the acid in solution. The greater the number of protons, the higher the Van't Hoff factor. For instance, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid that dissociates completely in water, releasing one proton and forming one chloride ion for each molecule of acid. Therefore, the Van't Hoff factor for HCl is i=2, since two ions are formed per molecule of HCl in solution.
On the other hand, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid that dissociates partially in water, releasing one proton and forming one acetate ion for each molecule of acid. However, since the dissociation is incomplete, the concentration of undissociated CH3COOH in solution also contributes to the depression of the freezing point. Therefore, the Van't Hoff factor for acetic acid is lower than for strong acids, typically around i=1.5.
Finally, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong acid that can release two protons in solution, forming two sulfate ions for each molecule of acid. Therefore, the Van't Hoff factor for sulfuric acid is i=3, since three ions are formed per molecule of H2SO4 in solution.
Knowing the Van't Hoff factor, we can predict the degree of dissociation of the acid in solution from the depression of the freezing point of water. The depression of the freezing point is directly proportional to the concentration of solute particles in solution, following the equation ∆Tf=Kf i m, where ∆Tf is the depression of the freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant of water, m is the molality of the solution, and i is the Van't Hoff factor.
Therefore, if we compare the observed depression of the freezing point of water for a given concentration of acid in solution to the theoretical depression expected for a non-electrolyte, we can calculate i and from this estimate the degree of dissociation. For instance, if we prepare a 1 molar solution of HCl and measure a depression of the freezing point of 3.7 oC, we can calculate i=2 using the cryoscopic constant of water (Kf=1.86 oC/m) and the expected depression for a non-electrolyte with a molality of 1 m, which is 1.86 oC. Then, we can estimate that HCl has dissociated completely, since the expected theoretical depression for i=2 is 3.72 oC.
In conclusion, the Van't Hoff factor is a useful tool to estimate the degree of dissociation of acids in solution based on the depression of the freezing point of water. By comparing the observed depression of the freezing point to the expected depression for a non-electrolyte, we can estimate i and from this the number of particles or ions produced by each molecule of acid. This information is relevant for understanding the behavior of electrolytes in solution and for predicting their effects on physical properties such as freezing point depression.
