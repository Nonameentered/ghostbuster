The European Union (EU) is a complex political entity where decision-making often involves a multiplicity of actors at various levels of governance. Since its inception, grand theories of integration have been proposed to explain how the EU operates and how policy-making decisions are made at the supranational, national, and sub-national levels. The most common of these theories- federalism, functionalism, neo-functionalism, intergovernmentalism, and liberal intergovernmentalism- offer different perspectives on how and why the EU functions as it does. This essay will evaluate the usefulness of these grand theories in analysing EU policymaking.
Federalism, as a theory of integration, holds that sovereignty is shared between the central government and regional or constituent governments that retain their own powers. European federalism aims to create a federal union where powers are distributed between the EU institutions and the member states, each with its own powers. However, this theory has had limited relevance in the EU context, as it has failed to capture the complex and multi-level nature of the EU. While the EU institutions have some powers, member states remain in control of most policy areas. Moreover, their relationship, rather than strictly hierarchical or federal, is more complex and potentially conflictual, with both parties competing for authority.
Functionalism, on the other hand, places the emphasis on addressing specific problems that require cooperation and coordination between countries. Under this theory, states face functional pressures to cooperate to enhance their efficiency and authority based on a shared interest in improved outcomes or mutual gains. This approach has been influential in the early years of the EU's development, especially where member states had a common interest in addressing issues such as trade, environmental regulations, and economic policies. However, functionalist integration has progressively diminished and remains inadequate to address the myriad of divergent interests and personalities of actors involved in EU policy-making, especially as institutional and ideological pluralism remains an important indicator of how policies are formulated.
Neo-functionalism, a more contemporary version of functionalism, argues that integrated functional policies generate spillover effects that enhance the prospects for further policies to be integrated in related areas. According to this theory, areas of cooperation such as the Single Market, have led to the creation of new policy domains on a range of issues that have necessitated new levels of cooperation. For example, the creation of the European Parliament, the externalization of common policies like Schengen and the Maastricht Treaty, which established the EU as an institution with more powers, may be traced back to the development of new policies based in the Single Market. Such integration, however, may cause political tension and some level of democratic deficit given that such policies are made typically outside the reach of national electorates.
Intergovernmentalism, briefly discussed in passing above, argues that the EU is a system of inter-state cooperation between equal sovereign member states who work together to achieve shared goals. It is a theory that proposes that the states remain the core of the EU’s functioning. It is the view that the EU’s decision-making framework is a product of state preferences, and national interests are prioritized over shared or community interests. Joint decision-making requires the coordination of national-level resources and the identification of mutually acceptable compromises under a unanimous voting system. This theory suggests that the EU is constrained relatively and limited by domestic actors’ interests and not by a single centralized institution. Thus, the EU's nature is more about the effective management of trade-offs and the resolution of conflicts rather than a "grand scheme" or deliberate pursuit of common goals. 
Just like intergovernmentalism, liberal-intergovernmentalism sees the EU as a system of inter-state cooperation in which the states remain the primary players. However, it argues that states are the main drivers of EU policy- making, and the EU is there to serve their interests. According to this theory, the EU policy-making process is driven by power politics, and states collaborate when the benefits of the policy decisions outweigh the costs arguments often arising from alleged market externalities. The EU, therefore, provides a forum for states to negotiate and resolve conflicts within the context of geography, ideology, and other factors that influence decision-making. 
These theories, which are helpful in understanding EU policies and their development, nonetheless have their weaknesses, including their descriptive, explanatory, and empirical accuracy. Federalism, for example, fails to adequately explain EU political and institutional complexities, including the existence of sub-national actors. Meanwhile, functionalism oversimplifies the dynamics of supranational policymaking, assuming that actors operate with an optimistic outlook that the benefits of cooperation outweigh the costs. This inclination towards optimism, however, overlooks the distributional consequences of policies and how individual states contribute to decision-making. Neo-functionalism, with its assumption that functional integration generates spillover effects, disregards the reality of potential conflicts over policy domains that may militate against incumbent policies. 
Liberal intergovernmentalism and Intergovernmentalism both suffer from the weaknesses implicit in their insular worldview. They amplify states' power without taking into account other actors, both at the domestic and transnational levels, who also shape the EU's decision-making processes. They also obscure the role of the EU institutions in decision-making. Additionally, they assume that there are common interests among member states when, in reality, member states typically prioritize their interests over the community interest, or even the EU's collective goals.
In conclusion, the usefulness and relevance of grand theories in the EU's policymaking process are context-specific, with no single theory providing a complete explanation of the EU's dynamics. Theories like functionalism may be useful for understanding specific policy domains, while intergovernmentalism may be useful in explaining the EU's decision-making framework. In contrast, neo-functionalism may be useful for understanding the underlying dynamics behind the creation of the EU’s policy domains. There is still much more research to be done on the applicability of these grand theories in the EU's decision-making processes and future developments within the EU. However, academics and policymakers in particular can benefit from understanding the nuances and complexities involved in the EU's policymaking processes to ensure that their decisions align with the best interests of both the broader community and the individual member states.
