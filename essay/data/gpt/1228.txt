Augustus was not merely content with claiming the title of princeps after his triumph over Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Rather, he aimed to legitimize his seizure of power while maintaining his popularity and influence over both the lower classes and the aristocracy. One of the tactics that he utilized for this purpose was the use of imagery and mythology. Through this, he sought to portray himself as a divinely ordained leader who was destined to rule Rome. This essay will examine how Augustus used imagery and mythology to legitimize his power, how effective these tactics were in maintaining his popularity and influence, and how his use of propaganda changed throughout his rule. Additionally, it will highlight the weaknesses in his self-promotion.
Augustus wanted to emphasize his greatness and link it to the divine world. To do so, he used the symbolism of divine imagery to link himself with the gods. One of the first things he did upon coming into power was to establish his bona fides as a god. He declared himself to be the son of the god Apollo in 29 BCE, which helped him to present himself as a divine and legitimate ruler. This belief was further amplified by his myth-making campaign and the physical construction of monuments and art that portrayed him as a god and ruler. His famous statue of Primaporta serves as a perfect example of how Augustus used mythology and imagery. The statue portrays Augustus wearing divine attire, exhibiting the warriors pose known as Contrapposto, with his foot defeating and over-powering a snake, which was a symbol that represented the defeat of the Egyptians by Rome.
Augustus also used various symbols that had long-standing meaning in Roman mythology. For example, the olive branch, which symbolized peace, was commonly associated with the goddess Minerva, who was supposed to have presented an olive tree to the city of Athens. Augustus used this symbolism to promote himself as a peace-bringer through his governance. Additionally, the Capricorn, which was a zodiac sign for Augustus, had long been revered as a symbol of power and prosperity in Roman mythology. Augustus associated himself with the Capricorn to further his self-promotion.
By linking himself with Roman mythology and the gods, Augustus portrayed himself as a legitimate ruler and maintained the loyalty of his subjects. Moreover, Augustus was aware of the boons of creating a personality cult around himself. For instance, his use of the slogan "Pax Augusta" (Augustan peace), which was inscribed on multiple monuments and commemorated the end of the seven-decade-long civil war, paved the way for Augustus to promote his rule as a beacon of peace for the Roman world. Augustus's success in creating a personality cult around himself cemented his legitimacy and prestige, and his power and influence grew in the eyes of both the lower classes and the aristocracy.
The usage of propaganda tactics during the reign of Augustus evolved continually. Augustus aimed to maintain his seizable power base by directly making the lower classes ally with him and by circumventing the aristocracy's power and influence. During his earlier years in power, Augustus relied heavily on arts and architecture to promote his leadership style. This era was known as the Augustan Age of art, which eventually developed to become part of Augustus's propaganda campaigns. 
One of his famous propaganda campaigns was his series of poems, Aeneid, written by his trusted adviser, the poet Virgil. The poem portrayed Augustus as the fulfillment of the long-standing Roman prophecy, introducing a new era of peace and prosperity, and was instrumental in building his public image as a legitimate ruler. 
Furthermore, The Res Gestae Divi Augusti (The Deeds of the Divine Augustus) was another uniquely unambiguous propaganda campaign used by Augustus to legitimize his rule. The Augustus himself wrote the text, which outlined his accomplishments and acts of generosity towards the people while underlining his loyalty to the Roman Republic and its institutions. This piece of literature was designed to leave a long-lasting legacy, providing visible evidence of Augustus's achievements to future generations.
However, Augustus made some mistakes in his self-promotion that portrayed him as not being entirely in touch with the common end people. For instance, his overconsumption of luxury goods and lavish spending on statues and monuments highlighted the discrepancy between him and the people who were living in poverty. Additionally, Augustus's act of destroying the Roman Republic did not sit well with some members of the aristocracy. The direct conflict and violence led to Augustus's loss of some followers, thus hampering his plans to legitimize his power.
In conclusion, Augustus used imagery and mythology to legitimize his seizure of power and maintained his popularity and influence over both the lower classes and the aristocracy. His propaganda tactics evolved throughout his rule, and he made some mistakes; however, he was instrumental in creating a personality cult and a sense of empire around his leadership. Augustus was revered as one of the most influential Roman historical powerbrokers, and his legacy lives on to date.
