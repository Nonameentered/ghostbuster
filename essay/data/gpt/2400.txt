Introduction:
Rene Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician and scientist who lived in the 17th century. He is known as the father of modern philosophy because of his contributions to the development of epistemology and metaphysics. He is best known for his Meditations, which is a collection of six essays in which he aims to establish certain, indubitable knowledge. Descartes' aim in the Meditations was to provide a foundation for knowledge that could not be doubted. In this essay, I will discuss Descartes' approach and his arguments for doubt in our sensory experiences and cognitive abilities.
Descartes' Aim in the Meditations:
In the Meditations, Descartes aims to provide a foundation for knowledge that is certain and indubitable. He wants to find a way to distinguish between what is true and what is false. He argues that many people believe things that are not true, and that one way to avoid this is to doubt everything that is not certain. He wants to establish a method for finding truth that is based on reason and not on tradition or authority.
Descartes' approach to achieving certain, indubitable knowledge:
Descartes uses a method of doubt to achieve certain, indubitable knowledge. He considers everything he has learned from his senses and from authority figures, and he subjects these beliefs to doubt. He believes that if he can find something that he cannot doubt, then he can build a foundation of knowledge that is certain. Descartes uses several arguments to doubt our sensory experiences and cognitive abilities.
Arguing for Doubt in Sensory Experience:
Descartes argues that our sensory experiences are unreliable. He questions the reliability of our senses by arguing that we can be deceived by them. He points out that our senses can deceive us in several ways, for example, he claims that we might see an object as one thing when it is actually another thing. He argues that since we cannot always trust our senses, it is not safe to believe anything based on them. Therefore, we cannot trust what we see or hear.
Arguing for Doubt in Cognitive Abilities:
Descartes argues that our cognitive abilities are unreliable. He proposes that we can never be sure of our mental faculties such as memory, imagination, and intuition. He argues that we can never be certain that our memories are accurate, or that our imagination is not deceiving us. This casts doubt on our ability to reason, since it is based on our capacity for memory, imagination, and intuition.
Descartes' methods of doubt are based on his belief that if he can find something that he cannot doubt, then he can build a foundation of knowledge that is certain. He believes that the only thing that he cannot doubt is his own existence. He argues that even if he is being deceived by an evil demon, he must exist in order to be deceived.
After establishing his own existence, Descartes goes on to prove the existence of God. He believes that if God exists, then it follows that there must be certain, indubitable knowledge. Descartes argues that God is perfect, and therefore, would not deceive us. Therefore, the knowledge we gain by reason is certain, because it is given to us by God.
In conclusion, Descartes' aim in the Meditations was to provide a foundation for knowledge that is certain and indubitable. He achieves this by using a method of doubt that casts doubt on our sensory experiences and cognitive abilities. He argues that the only thing that cannot be doubted is his own existence, which leads him to establish the existence of God and, in turn, certain, indubitable knowledge. Descartes' approach to achieving certain, indubitable knowledge is still widely discussed and debated by philosophers today.
