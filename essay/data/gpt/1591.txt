Indigenous culture-based tourism has become increasingly popular in recent years, as travelers seek more authentic and meaningful experiences. However, the impacts of this type of tourism on society are complex and often controversial. On the one hand, indigenous tourism can provide economic benefits to communities and help preserve traditional cultures and practices. On the other hand, it can also fuel stereotypes and exoticize indigenous people, creating harmful power imbalances and cultural misunderstandings. In this essay, the impacts of indigenous culture-based tourism will be explored in-depth using the Maori in New Zealand as a case study, examining both positive and negative effects, and discussing ways in which negative impacts can be minimized and indigenous people can be more involved in tourism planning.
The Maori people of New Zealand have a rich history and culture that has been the focus of indigenous tourism for many years. For Maori tourism operators, sharing their culture with visitors is not just a business but a way to keep traditions alive and ensure they are passed down to future generations. The economic benefits of indigenous tourism can be significant, providing employment opportunities and supporting local businesses. For example, in New Zealand, tourism contributes approximately 6% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and supports around 230,000 jobs. Maori tourism specifically is estimated to be worth $1 billion to the New Zealand economy.
However, there are also negative impacts of indigenous tourism that cannot be ignored. One major issue is the exoticization and stereotyping of indigenous people that can occur when they are marketed as “authentic” and “primitive” for the sake of tourism. This can lead to a lack of respect for indigenous cultures and a reinforcement of harmful power dynamics. Additionally, there can be a tension between economic benefits and cultural preservation, as some argue that the commodification of traditional practices can lead to their degradation or exploitation. This tension can be particularly acute when tourists are not respectful of cultural norms, or when indigenous communities are not consulted or given agency in the planning and execution of tourism activities.
Recent studies have sought to better understand the impacts of indigenous culture-based tourism and how they might be addressed. One study conducted in New Zealand found that indigenous tourism can support cultural revitalization efforts, particularly in cases where traditional practices had been lost or marginalized due to colonization and assimilation. It also found that tourism can support indigenous communities in reclaiming their land, as tourism activities can often be concentrated in areas where indigenous people have retained ownership or rights. However, the study also highlighted the need for greater participation and control over the tourism industry by indigenous people, particularly in decision-making around tourism planning, marketing, and management.
Another study conducted in Canada found that the meaningful engagement of host indigenous communities in tourism planning is crucial to mitigating negative impacts and promoting positive outcomes. Specifically, the study recommended that indigenous people be involved in the creation of tourism products, marketing strategies, and pricing structures, as well as in the interpretation of cultural heritage sites. This ensures that tourism activities are aligned with the values and goals of host communities, and that profits from tourism are distributed fairly. It also helps to create a more authentic and respectful experience for visitors, as they are engaging with culture on the terms of the host community rather than through preconceived or manufactured notions of what is “exotic” or “authentic.”
However, involving indigenous people in tourism planning can often be challenging due to a variety of obstacles. One obstacle is a lack of financial resources or training necessary to compete with large, mainstream tourism businesses. In many cases, indigenous tourism operators are small-scale and function on a shoestring budget, making it difficult to compete with larger businesses with greater marketing and operational resources. Another obstacle is limited access to capital or loans to start or expand tourism operations, which can limit the ability of indigenous entrepreneurs to grow their businesses or invest in the necessary infrastructure to meet tourism demand. Additionally, there may be cultural barriers to engagement with tourism, as some indigenous people may view it as a threat to their traditional way of life or may be hesitant to commodify their culture for profit. Finally, there is often a lack of understanding and respect for indigenous cultural practices among mainstream tourism operators or government officials, which can lead to a lack of recognition or funding for indigenous-led tourism initiatives.
In conclusion, the impacts of indigenous culture-based tourism are complex and multifaceted, and require careful consideration and planning to ensure that negative effects are minimized and positive outcomes are maximized. This requires a shift in the power dynamics of the tourism industry, with indigenous people given greater agency and control over the planning and execution of tourism activities. Additionally, it requires a more inclusive and respectful approach to cultural heritage, with tourists encouraged to engage with cultures on their own terms rather than through preconceived notions of what is “authentic” or “exotic.” By working together to address these issues, the tourism industry can support indigenous communities in economic development while also preserving and celebrating their unique cultures and traditions.
