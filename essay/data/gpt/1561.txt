The concept of equity in healthcare is derived from the idea that everyone should have the same opportunities to access, use, and benefit from healthcare services regardless of their socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors. In other words, equity means that all individuals should be treated equally in terms of access to healthcare, quality of care, and health outcome.
The National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948 with the aim of providing healthcare services to everyone, free at the point of use. While the NHS has undoubtedly achieved remarkable success in improving the health of the nation, it has also faced many challenges, particularly in ensuring equitable access to healthcare services.
In this essay, we will explore the concept of equity in healthcare and its evolution throughout the history of the NHS. We will also discuss the variations and inequalities in healthcare, the government's role in ensuring equity in primary healthcare, and the treatment of disabled and chronically ill individuals. Finally, we will illustrate our points with examples from the Mental Health field.
Historical evolution of equity in healthcare
The concept of equity in healthcare has evolved throughout the history of the NHS. At the inception of the NHS, the focus was on providing healthcare services to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. This was a radical departure from the previous system, which was based on a fee-for-service model that excluded many people from accessing healthcare services.
In the early years of the NHS, there were significant inequalities in healthcare services, particularly between North and South England, with the North suffering from underinvestment. In response to these challenges, the government established the Black Report in 1980, which highlighted significant health inequalities between different social classes. The report advocated for a more comprehensive approach to public health, focusing on preventative measures to reduce health inequalities.
Since then, the concept of equity in healthcare has been further developed, with an increasing focus on reducing health inequalities in disadvantaged communities. The government has introduced several initiatives to improve access to healthcare services for disadvantaged groups, such as the Health Action Zones. Additionally, the government has increased funding for public health services and introduced relevant policies aimed at improving access to healthcare for minorities.
Variations and inequalities in healthcare
Despite the progress, inequalities in healthcare persist, with significant variations in healthcare access and outcomes determined by socio-economic status, ethnicity, and geographical location. For example, people from the most deprived communities in England are two to three times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke or die from cancer than those from the least deprived communities. Additionally, the life expectancy for people living in the most deprived areas of England is seven years less than for those living in the least deprived areas.
These inequalities are also present in the treatment of mental health patients. Studies have shown that individuals from ethnic minority groups are less likely to access mental health services despite experiencing higher levels of psychological distress. Moreover, compared to the general population, individuals with Learning Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorder are at a higher risk of developing mental health conditions but experience multiple barriers to accessing appropriate mental health treatment.
Role of the government in ensuring equity in primary healthcare
One of the primary roles of the government is to ensure equity in primary healthcare by providing universal access to primary healthcare services. In this context, primary care refers to the first point of contact for individuals seeking healthcare services, such as general practitioners and community pharmacies. The government has introduced several policies to improve access to primary care services for everyone, including the appointment of general practitioners, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.
Special attention has also been paid to patients with disabilities and chronic illnesses. The government has established several initiatives aimed at improving the quality of healthcare services provided to these patients. One such initiative is the Expert Patient Programme (EPP), which trains patients with long-term conditions to manage their illnesses and improve their quality of life.
Treatment of disabled and chronically ill individuals
The treatment of disabled and chronically ill individuals has been an area of significant concern and highlights the challenges facing healthcare in achieving equity. Disabled individuals often face discrimination and barriers in accessing healthcare services. The government has introduced several policies aimed at improving the treatment of disabled and chronically ill individuals, such as the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, which legally prohibits discrimination against disabled individuals in all areas of life, including healthcare.
The treatment of mental health patients with disabilities has also been an area of concern. Members of the deaf community, for instance, can face communication barriers that can prevent them from accessing appropriate mental health care, leading to inappropriate diagnoses and ineffective treatment. The government has made efforts to address these issues by promoting equal access to mental health services through initiatives such as the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme.
Examples from Mental health Field
The Mental Health services have been severely impacted by underfunding, leading to longer waiting times, fewer resources, and significant health inequalities. The government has made several efforts to address these challenges, such as introducing the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, which aims to improve access to mental health services and reduce waiting times.
One area of concern in mental health services is the treatment of individuals from minority communities. Members of ethnic minority groups are less likely to receive appropriate mental health services due to language barriers and cultural misunderstandings. For instance, members of the South Asian and Black communities often seek help from religious leaders or traditional healers, preventing them from accessing mental health services. The government has introduced several initiatives aimed at improving the cultural competency of mental health professionals, such as the Cultural Consultation Service.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the concept of equity in healthcare has evolved significantly throughout the history of the NHS, with a growing emphasis on reducing health inequalities and improve access to healthcare services for disadvantaged groups. Despite the progress, significant inequalities persist, particularly in disadvantaged communities, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities. The government's primary role in ensuring equity in primary healthcare should remain focused on improving access to healthcare services for everyone and reducing health inequalities in disadvantaged communities, such as members of the deaf community and those from ethnic minority groups. In the mental health field, the government should continue to strive to improve cultural competency among health professionals to enable them to provide appropriate mental health care.
