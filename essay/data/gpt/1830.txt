Anne Allison’s ethnography, “Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club,” provides a comprehensive study of Japanese society from the perspective of a Tokyo club. In this book, the author highlights various aspects of Japanese society, including family life, work and leisure, and gender roles. Through her research, Allison reveals how the Japanese culture has become a patriarchal system entrenched in the ideology of corporate capitalism. This essay will explore the various aspects of Japanese society presented by Anne Allison in her ethnography, “Nightwork.”
Family Life:
The traditional Japanese family structure is characterized by strict hierarchies and gender roles, which are imposed by patriarchal arrangements. In “Nightwork,” Allison discusses the division of labor in the family, highlighting how men have traditionally worked outside the home while women have been responsible for the household and child-rearing. Despite this, the family structure is evolving, and women are increasingly joining the workforce in Japan. However, this transformation has not always been smooth as working mothers frequently face social, economic, and psychological challenges that are often ignored. Allison brings up the social stigma that persists around women who choose to prioritize their careers over marriage and family, explaining how many young women are opting to work in the hostess club industry to avoid such stigmatization. However, this lifestyle comes with its challenges and costs, such as isolation from family and friends, sleep deprivation, and exposure to sexual harassment.
Work and Leisure:
In Japanese society, work is highly valued, and employees are expected to demonstrate devotion and loyalty to their employers. Allison explores the concept of corporate masculinity and how it is reflected in the hostess club industry, where male executives assert their dominance and assert their sexuality over the female staff. The hostess club industry is a place where businessmen come to relax, take their minds off work, and indulge in sexual fantasies. According to Allison's research, this industry is also one of the few spaces where men have the freedom to express emotion openly and behave outside of the constraints that come with the traditional work environment.
Gender Roles:
Gender roles in Japan are defined through the concept of honne and tatemae, where honne is an individual's true feelings and beliefs, and tatemae is the persona they portray publicly. In Japanese culture, women are often defined through their “feminine” qualities known as "nyūji" (homeliness, tenderness, and docility). However, in the hostess club industry, these roles change, and women are expected to play a role where they are massaging the egos of male customers regardless of emotional honesty or compatibility. Hostesses are required to provide an idealized fantasy of femininity that conforms to the male customer's expectations.
Allison’s ethnography highlights how gender roles can constrain people's lives. Women in Japan are not just confined to household chores but are also required to conform to societal expectations of femininity. Men, on the other hand, are required to prove their masculinity by rising up to their positions in the corporate world and acquiring wealth to support their families. Allison reveals how these expectations are narrowing opportunities for both men and women and hindering society's progress. Though some companies have made strides in this area by offering family-friendly work policies, Japan still lags in this regard compared to other developed countries.
In conclusion, through her research in the hostess club industry, Anne Allison highlights various aspects of Japanese society, including family life, work and leisure, and gender roles. Her ethnography shows how societal expectations limit the opportunities available to both men and women and how the corporate culture perpetuates patriarchal masculinity. Despite this, there is a growing movement for social change and gender equality in Japan. Anne Allison’s ethnography serves as a timely reminder of the need to continue pushing for change in a society that is still heavily influenced by traditional values.
