The Great Depression was undoubtedly one of the most significant economic tragedies of the 20th century. The catastrophic economic downturn affected people in the United States and worldwide, creating massive unemployment and poverty. The impact of the Great Depression on race relations in the U.S. was profound and, without a doubt, had a lasting impact that is still visible today. 
Before delving into the impact that the Great Depression had on race relations, it is worth noting that the entire country suffered through an economic catastrophe. When analyzing race relations during the Great Depression era, it is worth acknowledging that African Americans were already facing significant challenges regarding their economic status, political power, and social status. However, the Great Depression exacerbated these issues. 
The economic devastation caused by the Great Depression touched every aspect of African American life. The already high unemployment of African Americans worsened since they were usually the first to be fired and the last to be rehired. Long-standing discrimination against African Americans in the workforce intensified due to the high level of competition for jobs. This, coupled with the discriminatory hiring practices employed by many employers, meant that African Americans were, by and large, the last to be rehired and first to lose their jobs. 
Moreover, the cyclical nature of the U.S. economy affected many of the sectors where African Americans were "employed." That is, many African Americans did not have formal employment, and instead ran businesses that served the Black community. However, since these businesses were highly influenced by the status of the broader economy, they were severely affected during the Great Depression, which pushed many African Americans to extreme poverty. 
The economic downturn had a more significant impact on African Americans than other racial groups; this led to increased racial tensions. White Americans saw the disproportionate impact of the Great Depression on African Americans as proof of their race's inferiority. This, in turn, led to a questioning of why African Americans should have some of the rights that their white counterparts, who were not affected by the depression as severely, should have. As such, anti-Black sentiment increased as a result of the pervasive poverty that the Great Depression caused.
Moreover, the social safety net put in place during the New Deal era did not always include African Americans. Although the New Deal measures aimed to help those who needed it the most, they were not always implemented in a way that served African Americans. Specifically, many New Deal policies and programs, such as the National Recovery Administration, excluded African Americans. This led many African Americans to believe that these policies were for Whites only, and that they were not included or even welcome in the government's relief programs. 
Another significant aspect that increased tension was the mass migration of African Americans from the South to the North, referred to as the Great Migration. From 1915 to 1970, more than five million African Americans migrated to cities in the North, Midwest, and West in search of better economic opportunities and to escape the Jim Crow laws of the South. However, during the Great Depression, competition for jobs in cities skyrocketed, decreasing the number of jobs available to African Americans who had migrated to escape the poverty in the South. This left many African Americans without a stable source of income and increased competition with Whites, leading to ever-increasing xenophobia and racism.
The long-term impact of the Great Depression on race relations in the U.S. was significant and multifaceted. The pervasive anti-Black sentiment that emerged during the Great Depression persisted over time. As such, the Great Depression weakened the efforts of those who supported increased rights for Blacks. The depression also led to the decimation of the Civil Rights Movement, which had already been struggling since the 1920s, as Blacks struggled to find practical support and jobs that would help fuel the Movement. The economic insecurity experienced by African Americans was felt through the entire minority community, reducing enthusiasm and a willingness to take risks to fight for change.
Additionally, the economic downturn and the subsequent changes in the U.S. economy affected race relations in profound ways. The New Deal, which many considered a sign of progress, entailed vast social welfare programs that were not accessible to many African Americans due to their race. The federal government gave preference to White-owned businesses in program access and in funding, denying most African Americans the aid they needed to survive during this economically challenging time. As a result, this federal assistance imposed another blow to African Americans' economic security and increased racial tensions.
This period's impact on racial politics in America was profound and complex. Not only did the Great Depression exacerbate the existing economic and social disparities African Americans faced, but it also led to a resurgence of anti-Black sentiment. This sentiment would weaken the Civil Rights Movement by creating more significant hurdles that eventually led to the stunning reversals in the Civil Rights gains made during the Reconstruction period that followed. 
In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on race relations in the United States was severe and, without a doubt, profound. It exacerbated already existing issues, affected the progress of the Civil Rights Movement, and instigated long-standing feelings of anti-Black sentiments, which haunting the nation until today. Despite the significant challenges that the Great Depression created for African Americans, they have persevered, and the nation has made some progress since then. However, there is much work that still needs to be done to achieve equity, justice, and a collective future of equal opportunity for all Americans.
