The role of the Chancery Division, particularly in the regulation and creation of trusts law, has undergone significant changes from 1953 to 2003. The overarching themes within the context of trusts include judicial intervention, discretion, and awareness of extralegal consequences of decisions. These themes are closely related to tax avoidance in trusts law, with key cases reflecting changes in judicial attitudes towards these issues over the 50-year period.
In 1953, the Chancery Division's role in trusts law was centred on interpreting the traditional principles guiding the creation, administration, and enforcement of trusts. The traditional view that courts should not intervene in the management of trusts was still predominant, with judges often deferring to the trustees' discretion. However, this approach began to change in the 1960s due to the rising importance of equitable principles in trusts law.
One of the key cases that reflected this change was Re Schebsman, where the court held that trustees' discretion was not absolute, and it was always subject to the court's intervention if it was exercised unreasonably. This marked a shift towards greater judicial activism in trusts law. Over time, this focus on the court's discretion evolved and shifted to a greater emphasis on the importance of the trustee's duty of care and their decision-making process.
The Chancery Division's role in the regulation of trusts law also expanded over time, with the court taking on a more proactive function in ensuring that trusts were being administered in accordance with the beneficiaries' interests. This was reflected in key cases such as Re Hastings-Bass, which established that the trustee's decision could be challenged if it was made based on an incorrect understanding of the legal or tax effect of the decision. This decision recognised the need for a more purposive approach, which placed greater importance on the substance of the trustee's decision rather than its form.
Judicial intervention in trusts law, however, runs the risk of complicating the administration of trusts and imposing higher costs on trustees and beneficiaries. The courts are mindful of this and have often been careful to avoid imposing excessive levels of supervision on trustees. This was demonstrated in the 1970s case of Re Diplock, where the court held that the trustee's decision should only be interfered with where it was made in "bad faith, or was dishonest, or was based upon irrelevant considerations, or was one that no reasonable trustees could have made." This decision sought to strike a balance between ensuring that beneficiaries' interests were protected while not unduly burdening the trustees with excessive legal scrutiny.
The importance of being aware of the extralegal consequences of decisions in trusts law is also reflected in the Chancery Division's role, particularly when it comes to tax avoidance. Trusts are often used as a means of mitigating tax liabilities or passing down wealth to future generations. However, this has led to concerns that trusts can be used for tax avoidance purposes, which has prompted the courts to take a more critical view of the administration of trusts.
One of the key cases that reflected this change was the 1984 decision in WT Ramsay Ltd v IRC. The court ruled that transactions designed specifically to avoid tax liability should be ignored for tax purposes. This decision marked a turning point in tax avoidance in trusts law, with the court increasingly willing to disregard transactions that had no commercial purpose other than to mitigate tax liabilities.
Another key case that reflected this change was the 2003 decision in Barclays Bank v Revenue and Customs Commissioners. In this case, the court held that a trust structure designed to avoid tax was not effective, and the individuals involved were required to pay the full amount of tax liability. This decision highlighted the court's willingness to take a more sceptical approach to the use of trusts as a means of avoiding tax.
In conclusion, the Chancery Division's role in trusts law has undergone significant changes from 1953 to 2003, with an increasing emphasis on judicial intervention, discretion, and awareness of the extralegal consequences of decisions. These themes are closely related to tax avoidance in trusts law, with key cases reflecting changes in judicial attitudes towards these issues over the 50-year period. While these changes have often been incremental, they reflect a shift towards a more activist approach, which seeks to ensure that trusts are being administered in the best interests of beneficiaries while also being mindful of the potential for tax avoidance.
