Enzymes are biological catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions in living organisms. They are highly specific to their substrate and work best under certain conditions such as pH, temperature, and concentration. However, enzymes can be denatured by changes in their environment, rendering them inactive. Developing methods to immobilize enzymes increases their reusability and resistance to denaturation.
Immobilizing Enzymes
Immobilizing enzymes refers to the process of trapping activated enzymes in a matrix to create a stable, reusable enzyme system. Immobilized enzymes are stable and can be reused many times, making them more cost-effective than soluble enzymes. This immobilization is achieved by trapping the enzyme molecules within a matrix of a suitable material.
Alginate is a commonly used matrix for immobilizing enzymes as it is biocompatible, inexpensive, and readily available. It forms a gel-like structure upon crosslinking with divalent cations such as calcium ions. The gel matrix allows for diffusion of the substrate and products, while the enzyme remains stationary and active within the gel.
Other materials that can be used for immobilizing enzymes include polyacrylamide, chitosan, and agarose. Polyacrylamide is a synthetic hydrogel that forms a porous network that allows for efficient exchange of substrates and products. Chitosan is a natural polymer obtained from chitin and is biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Agarose is an agar-derived polymer that forms gel beads upon cooling.
Specific Activity of Immobilized Enzymes
The specific activity of an enzyme refers to the amount of product produced per unit of time by a specific amount of enzyme. Immobilized enzymes generally have a lower specific activity than native enzymes due to mass transfer limitations. The amount of enzyme that can be immobilized within a matrix is limited, resulting in a lower concentration of enzyme compared to native enzymes.
The number of assays can affect the specific activity of immobilized enzymes. Over time, the enzyme molecules may degrade, resulting in a decrease in specific activity. This effect can be minimized by maintaining the activity of the enzyme molecules through proper storage and handling of the immobilized enzymes.
Role of EDTA
EDTA is a chelating agent that can break the gel structure of immobilized enzymes. It works by binding to the calcium ions that crosslink the alginate gel, resulting in a loss of structure. EDTA disrupts the gel structure and frees the enzyme molecules.
Other chelating agents that have a similar effect on immobilized enzymes include citrate and ethylenediamine. They work by displacing the calcium ions from the gel matrix, leading to a loss of structure and release of the enzyme.
Restricting Enzyme Movement
Immobilizing enzymes restricts their movement, which can affect enzyme-substrate complex formation and the accuracy of the results. The diffusion of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme may be limited, resulting in a lower rate of reaction. This phenomenon is referred to as diffusional limitation and can be minimized by optimizing the size and porosity of the immobilization matrix.
To overcome the diffusional limitation, various strategies can be adopted, including increasing the surface area of the immobilized enzyme matrix, using a thinner layer of immobilization, and optimizing the size of the immobilization matrix. These strategies increase the accessibility of the substrate to the enzyme and enhance the rate of reaction.
Conclusion
Immobilizing enzymes is an effective method to increase their reusability and resistance to denaturation. Alginate is a commonly used matrix for immobilizing enzymes, but other materials such as polyacrylamide, chitosan, and agarose can also be used. Immobilized enzymes generally have a lower specific activity due to mass transfer limitations and can degrade over time with repeated assays. Chelating agents such as EDTA can break the gel structure of immobilized enzymes, and the restriction of enzyme movement through immobilization can affect enzyme-substrate complex formation and the accuracy of the results. By understanding these principles, researchers can develop more effective and efficient methods for immobilizing enzymes for various applications.
