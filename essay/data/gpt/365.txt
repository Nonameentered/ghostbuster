To work hard and commit oneself to a task or an organization can have various reasons. These reasons can sometimes be interpreted negatively resulting in a weakened will to work hard. Over time, there has been a significant change in the view of employees. Today, businesses are using different approaches to increase productivity and profit. One of the common approaches is the use of financial incentives and shareholding schemes. However, there are potential drawbacks to these approaches. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why people will work hard for something or someone, interpret these reasons negatively, and investigate the changes in the view of employees. We will also explore the approaches that businesses are taking today to increase productivity and profit, including financial incentives and shareholding schemes. Finally, we will investigate the potential drawbacks of these policies and ways for businesses to structure incentive schemes in a fair and effective way that meets employee needs.
Reasons why people work hard
There are various reasons why people will work hard for something or someone. These reasons can range from personal motives to social pressures. Personal motives, such as a desire to succeed or a sense of purpose, are strong drivers of hard work and commitment to a task or organization. A sense of purpose can be achieved when an individual believes that the task or organization they are working for aligns with their values and beliefs. Additionally, a desire to succeed can drive hard work, especially when an individual is motivated by rewards such as recognition, promotions, and salaries.
Another driving force behind hard work is social pressure. Societal norms and expectations can pressure individuals to work hard and commit themselves to a task or organization. For example, individuals can face social stigma for being labeled as lazy or unproductive. Additionally, peer pressure and the desire to fit in can drive people to work hard and achieve success.
Interpretations of these reasons
While these reasons can be positive driving forces, their interpretations can have a negative impact on employee motivation and productivity. For instance, while a sense of purpose can drive an individual to work hard, if their vision of the purpose is not aligned with the organization they work for, it can lead to demotivation and a lack of commitment. Similarly, if an individual is driven by rewards and incentives, they are likely to become demotivated if they feel that they are not being rewarded appropriately or if the rewards are not aligned with their expectations.
Peer pressure can also have negative impacts on employee motivation and productivity. For example, managers and colleagues may pressure employees to work longer hours or take on more tasks. If this pressure comes at the expense of an employee’s work-life balance, it can result in low employee morale, stress, and burnout. Additionally, employees who are constantly under pressure to perform may feel that they are being micromanaged, which can result in a lack of trust and motivation.
Changes in the view of employees
Over time, the view of employees has changed significantly. In earlier years, employees were viewed as cogs in a machine, which meant that businesses viewed their employees as replaceable parts of the production process. This view resulted in employees not receiving the recognition they deserved, a lack of employee engagement, and a high turnover rate. Today, businesses recognize the value of their employees and the impact they have on business success. This view has resulted in businesses investing in employee engagement, training, and development.
Approaches to increasing productivity and profit
There are many approaches that businesses are taking today to increase productivity and profit. One of the commonly used approaches is the use of financial incentives and shareholding schemes. Financial incentives are rewards given to employees in exchange for their contributions to a company. These incentives are based on performance, and they can come in the form of bonuses, stock options, and commission. Shareholding schemes are when employees are given the opportunity to buy company shares and become shareholders in the company.
Effective financial incentives and shareholding schemes
While financial incentives and shareholding schemes are effective ways of increasing productivity and profit, some potential drawbacks need to be considered. Financial incentives can be a motivating factor for some employees, but they can also result in a sense of entitlement and a lack of commitment to the company. Employees may feel that they are being underpaid if they do not receive the expected financial rewards. Additionally, financial incentives can create an unhealthy competition between employees, which may cause employees to focus more on personal gains than team success.
Shareholding schemes are also an effective way of increasing employee engagement and productivity. Giving employees the power to become shareholders aligns their interests with the company. It can also create a sense of ownership and responsibility, leading to increased productivity. However, shareholding schemes can also result in conflicts of interest if the interests of the company and the shareholders are not aligned. Additionally, if employees are not well informed about the risks and rewards of shareholding, the scheme may backfire, causing employees to devalue the scheme, and feel resentful.
Structure of incentive schemes
To ensure that incentive schemes are structured in a fair and effective manner that meets the needs of employees, businesses should consider setting clear goals and targets, providing regular feedback and communication channels, and ensuring that rewards are aligned with employees’ expectations and efforts. Businesses should also ensure that incentives are not based solely on individual success, and that they are aligned with teamwork and company growth. Finally, businesses should provide their employees with adequate training and development opportunities to help them progress in their careers, and increase their value to the company.
Conclusion
In conclusion, people work hard for various reasons, including personal and social pressures. These reasons can be a motivating factor or a source of demotivation, depending on their interpretation. Over time, there has been a change in the view of employees, with businesses recognizing the value of their employees. Businesses are using different approaches to increase productivity and profit, including financial incentives and shareholding schemes. However, these approaches have potential drawbacks that need to be considered. To ensure that incentives are structured in a fair and effective manner that meets employee needs, businesses should set clear goals and targets, provide regular feedback and communication channels, align rewards with employees’ expectations and efforts, and provide opportunities for training and development.
