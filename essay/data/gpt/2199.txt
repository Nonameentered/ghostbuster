Plant polyphenols are a diverse group of nutritional compounds present in various plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, tea, cocoa, and wine. They are known for their antioxidant activities, and can also exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and cardiovascular benefits. These health-promoting benefits have been attributed to their ability to scavenge free radicals and other reactive species, inhibit oxidative stress, and modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in cellular homeostasis.
The two major subclasses of plant polyphenols are flavonoids and non-flavonoids. The flavonoids, such as quercetin, catechins, and anthocyanins, are the most widely studied group of polyphenols. They are abundant in fruits, vegetables, and tea, and are responsible for their vibrant colors. The non-flavonoids, on the other hand, include phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid and gallic acid, and stilbenes, such as resveratrol, and are found in varying amounts in several plant foods. 
Polyphenols have been linked to a wide range of potential health benefits. For instance, the flavonoids have been found to decrease the risk of chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders. They have anti-oxidative properties, protect cells and act as a natural sunscreen. They improve glycemic index, and improve cognitive and immune functions. Research studies have also shown that polyphenols can protect the cardiovascular system by preventing oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, reduce platelet aggregation and improve endothelial function. These activities can lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease.
Polyphenols have a modest bioavailability, meaning that a considerable proportion of the ingested polyphenols are poorly absorbed in the gut and may undergo metabolism, resulting in low systemic concentration. The gastrointestinal metabolism of polyphenols constitutes several enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes that determine their bioavailability. Therefore, efforts have been made to improve the bioavailability and biological activity of polyphenols. The most popular and effective approach is to combine polyphenols with other naturally occurring components that enhance their bioavailability and activity. Factors that enhance bioavailability of polyphenols include stomach pH, microbiome status, food matrix, and co-consumption with other foods.
Incorporating polyphenols into foods has gained widespread interest as it has been observed that these natural compounds have potential to provide therapeutic benefits. One of the strategies includes fortification of food with polyphenols. However, the optimal dosage of polyphenols is still under debate, as it is important to consider the food matrix, as well as natural intake in order to ensure safety of the hitherto intoxicated compound. It should also be noted that many food products currently available on the market that claim to be high in polyphenols are often high in added sugars and preservatives. Therefore, it is important to approach polyphenol fortified products with caution and read product labelling carefully in order to be aware of potential added ingredients and sugars.
Some food products that are naturally high in polyphenols include berries like blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries, which are excellent sources of anthocyanins. Green tea and dark chocolate are also excellent sources of flavonoids and stilbenes. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, spices and grains can provide polyphenols in the diet as well. Additionally, incorporation of polyphenol-rich foods into conventional food products can increase nutrient content and promote large-scale consumption of polyphenols.
In conclusion, polyphenols offer many potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Their bioavailability is a limiting factor, but several strategies to circumvent this issue have been proposed. Food manufacturers can tap into the benefits of polyphenols, provided they ensure optimal dosages, consider natural intake, and avoid toxicity at high intake levels. Incorporating polyphenols into food products can increase the intake of these health-promoting compounds, as well as make them more accessible and appetizing. Thus, it is important to promote awareness of the benefits of polyphenol consumption and encourage the incorporation of polyphenol-rich foods into our diets.
