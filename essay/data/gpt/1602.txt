Routledge's marketing campaign for the Earth and Environmental Science journals aims to reinforce the position of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment (EMAS) and promote environmental management and sustainability. The marketing strategy seeks to cultivate the interest of a wide range of readers within the UK and Europe with a specific focus on specialists in the field of environmental science. In contemporary society, there is a high level of concern for the environmental impact of human activities, and EMAS's objective is to offer sustainable solutions to this problem.
The marketing campaign comprises of different tactics that promote the EMAS subject matter to reach the target audience effectively. The goal of the campaign is to attract and engage the attention of environmental practitioners, researchers, and policy-makers in the UK and Europe. The campaign is aimed to drive sales and encourage subscriptions of the EMAS journal and booster web content.
One of the significant initiatives of the campaign is to balance the traditional print publication with the shift towards electronic publications. The traditional print publication still attracts a large audience, particularly among scholars and academics. To reach a broader and contemporary audience, the marketing campaign employs electronic publishing in its strategy. By harnessing digital platforms and leveraging the wide array of social media channels, the campaign reaches out to young professionals, researchers, and policymakers. Digital publishing has made it possible for the campaign to disseminate valuable information to a broad audience in Europe and beyond.
The campaign uses diverse strategies to promote subscriptions and increase usage, including discounts and specialized offers, which provide subscribers with a chance to access the material at a lower cost. The campaign also provides free trials to EMAS products and services to potential subscribers, thereby encouraging them to try before subscribing. Another strategy is the creation of special events which present invaluable learning opportunities for individuals that are interested in knowing more about environmental science. These events help promote and bring EMAS to the public's attention in the UK and Europe.
To ensure that progress is made, the campaign employs a set of metrics that tracks the progress of the campaign and gets feedback from subscribers. The metrics used include tracking the number of subscribers, web traffic, downloads, and views and shares on social media. These metrics provide crucial feedback to inform the campaign on its effectiveness and areas where the marketing campaign needs to improve. The feedback collected from subscribers and interested individuals is another approach to appraise the campaign's success and failure. The feedback provided would be useful to restructure it to remain relevant and more effective.
Furthermore, the Routledge marketing team uses digital platforms, email marketing, and direct mails, among other means, to reach the target audience. The digital platform enables the campaign to take a segmented approach in targeting prospective subscribers with an interest in the EMAS subject matter. This targeted approach enhances the campaign's efficiency and will help the campaign achieve its goals. Additionally, the campaign distributes newsletters, updates and other direct mail marketing material towards potential subscribers to build relationships and partnerships.
Finally, the campaign provides incentives and rewards for loyal subscribers, such as exclusive discounts and access to new publications, to sustain their patronage. This strategy helps to build customer loyalty and translates to word of mouth recommendations, and thus, promoting the EMAS brand. Through the innovative use of data-driven metrics, content marketing, and targeted advertising, the campaign aims to enhance the experience of subscribers and build stronger customer relationships.
In conclusion, Routledge's marketing campaign for EMAS aims to promote environmental management, sustainability, and reinforce the environmental position in the field of environmental science. It employs diverse strategies that balance traditional print publishing with the shift towards electronic publication to optimize the objectivity for a broad audience in the UK and Europe. The metrics and feedback system used by the campaign drive its progress and enhance its efficiency. The campaign also integrates incentives and rewards for loyal subscribers to build long-lasting customer relationships, enhance customer satisfaction, and strengthen brand loyalty. By harnessing digital platforms, email marketing, and direct mail, the marketing campaign can target the desired audience and create valuable content for prospective subscribers. Ultimately, the marketing campaign helps to promote and disseminate impactful and relevant research to those that matter most - environmental practitioners, researchers, and policy-makers.
