Jane Austen’s novel ‘Emma’ and William Shakespeare’s play ‘The Winter’s Tale’ both explore themes of love, deception, and redemption. However, the two works differ in their approach to the passage of time. ‘Emma’ is set in the early 19th century and presents a linear narrative, while ‘The Winter’s Tale’ takes place in the distant past and employs a non-linear structure. This essay will explore how the difference in the function of time affects the themes and structures of the two works.
In ‘Emma’, time functions as a consistent and unfolding force. The story is set in the fictional English village of Highbury, where Emma Woodhouse lives with her father. The events of the novel take place over the course of about a year, from the summer of 1814 to the fall of 1815. The story begins with Emma cherishing her independence and meddling in the lives of her friends and acquaintances, often leading to disastrous consequences. However, as the year progresses, Emma grows more mature and self-aware, gradually learning to be less judgmental and controlling. The novel ends with her finding happiness with Mr. Knightley, her longtime friend and confidant.
In contrast, in ‘The Winter’s Tale’, time functions in a much more complex manner. The play is set in two distinct time periods: in the first three acts, which take place in Sicilia, the action takes place over the course of only a few days, while in the last two acts, which take place in Bohemia, the narrative jumps forward sixteen years. The leaps in time are jarring and unexpected, leaving the audience to piece together the events that have taken place in the intervening years. This structure reflects the play’s themes of misperception and deception, as characters are brought to the brink of tragedy by their own misunderstandings.
The non-linear structure of ‘The Winter’s Tale’ serves to heighten the play’s themes of jealousy and forgiveness. In the first half of the play, King Leontes of Sicilia becomes consumed with irrational jealousy over his wife Hermione’s supposed infidelity with his friend Polixenes. He ultimately orders the death of their newborn daughter and forces Hermione into hiding. In the second half of the play, the narrative skips forward sixteen years to show the redemption of the characters, as the daughter is reunited with her family and Hermione is revealed to be alive. The play’s non-linear structure allows the audience to experience this redemption as a surprising and emotionally impactful revelation.
The role of time in ‘Emma’ is linked to the novel’s themes of social status and the restrictions of gender roles. Emma is a wealthy, unmarried woman who is expected to marry well and conform to the ideals of her class. The linear structure of the novel mirrors the gradual evolution of Emma’s character as she begins to move beyond the confines of her class and gender. Through the passage of time, Emma learns to recognize her own flaws and to understand the perspectives of those around her. This self-awareness allows her to form a true romantic connection with Mr. Knightley, rather than viewing him as simply another eligible bachelor.
In ‘The Winter’s Tale’, time functions as both a destructive and a salvific force. Leontes’ jealousy and suspicion lead directly to the destruction of his family and the fracturing of his kingdom. However, the passage of time also provides the opportunity for redemption and reconciliation. The sixteen-year gap between the play’s two halves allows for the characters to change and grow, and for the audience to experience a sense of closure and resolution as the characters are ultimately reunited.
In conclusion, the functions of time in ‘Emma’ and ‘The Winter’s Tale’ shape the themes and structures of each work in distinct ways. In ‘Emma’, the linear structure allows the narrative to gradually reveal Emma’s growth and transformation, while in ‘The Winter’s Tale’, the non-linear structure creates a sense of disorientation and surprise, reflecting the play’s themes of misperception and redemption. The role of time in both works highlights the ways in which the passage of time can either destroy or redeem relationships and individuals.
