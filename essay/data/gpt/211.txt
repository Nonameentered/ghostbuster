Marriage has been traditionally viewed as a societal institution that offers stability and legitimacy to a relationship. It has been institutionalized in almost every society, culture, and religion in the world. Marriage not only sanctifies the union between two people but also carries legal implications. Marriage used to refer to a legal union between two people; however, now, with the changes, legal and demographic, that have occurred since 1979, we need to once again question the meaning and purpose of marriage.
Marriage has always come with certain legal rights and responsibilities. It ensures the property, inheritance, and social status of the couple and their children, along with granting tax benefits. However, in modern times, the social and economic landscape has changed dramatically, and many no longer view marriage as a necessary institution. Today, people often question whether marriage continues to serve any useful purpose, given the variety of legal remedies for unmarried couples.
One such legal remedy is the Common-Law Marriage, which de facto recognizes the relationship of unmarried couples. The legal recognition of ‘common-law marriages' was set into motion in the United States in the late 1800s. It recognized that people who lived together for an extended period of time and presented themselves as a married couple, were entitled to the same legal benefits as married couples. However, the legal recognition of ‘common-law marriages' was streamlined only in some US states, over the years. Moreover, in some cases, the legal recognition of common-law marriages is no longer in place.
Another legal remedy is domestic partnerships, which grant unmarried couples many of the same legal rights as married couples. It is important to note that domestic partnership comes with limitations related to its recognition across states and countries. Moreover, the laws related to domestic partnership are always in flux, as some US states have either repealed their domestic partnership regulations or made them restricted.
On the other hand, some argue that the legal institution of marriage continues to serve a purpose, despite the changes occurring in society. For many people, getting married still holds substantial symbolic and emotional value. Marriage symbolizes the commitment that two people have for each other, and it usually involves making vows to each other in the presence of loved ones. Moreover, the legal implications of marriage are unlike any other legal remedy that the law provides. The benefits of marriage include inheritance of property, tax benefits, and spousal support. In some cases, marriage also affects citizenship and the right to reside in a particular country.
The demographic changes that have occurred since 1979 have played a significant role in shaping the current marriage debate. Today, the number of marriages is declining while cohabitation is on the rise. Cohabitation refers to people who live together but do not have a legal recognition of their relationship. The decline in the number of marriages and the rise in cohabitation can be attributed to various reasons, including the availability of legal remedies for unmarried couples and the changing societal values around relationships.
Many people choose cohabitation due to the financial benefits it offers. They may find it more challenging to obtain a mortgage and buy a home or pay for significant life expenses, such as education. By living together, they can share these costs and live more comfortably. In addition, cohabitation provides people with the same benefits of marriage without the legal and religious implications of marriage.
In conclusion, with the legal and demographic changes that have occurred since 1979, marriage's utility is being debated. At one point in time, marriage was necessary for economic and social stability. However, with modern financial and legal remedies available, marriage has lost its significance for many people. Nevertheless, marriage still holds an emotional and symbolic value for many others. It is important to note that with the decline in the number of marriages and the rise of cohabitation, lawmakers need to ensure that the legal rights of unmarried couples are protected. By doing so, they can ensure that even unmarried couples have access to essential legal protections, from inheritance to health and retirement benefits. Hence, lawmakers and society need to determine whether marriage continues to serve a purpose, and if so, understand how it can provide appropriate choices to those who wish to receive its benefits, such as legal protection, tax benefits or citizenship, among others.
