Introduction
The European Union (EU) is a significant player in the global dairy market, being one of the world's largest dairy producers and exporters. The EU has, over the years, implemented various mechanisms to support dairy farmers, including export subsidies. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has long criticized these subsidies as they distort trade and create unfair competition. After years of negotiations, the EU has finally agreed to phase out its export subsidies. This essay will discuss how this elimination of export subsidies will impact European dairy policy, and how the WTO negotiations led to this decision.
Background
The EU has a long-standing dairy policy that aims to support dairy farmers and ensure stable milk supplies. The EU dairy market is regulated through a system of production quotas, price support, and market intervention measures. Dairy farmers are guaranteed a minimum price for their milk, and any surpluses are either stored or used for exports. The EU has been using export subsidies to support the dairy sector since the 1960s.
Export subsidies are payments made by governments to their producers to help reduce the costs of exporting their products. These subsidies artificially lower the price of exported goods, making them more competitive in global markets. However, the downside of these subsidies is that they distort market prices and create unfair competition. They also lead to overproduction, which can result in surpluses that are often dumped on the world market at below-market prices.
The WTO has been actively working to reduce and eliminate export subsidies globally. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), signed in 1994, committed WTO members to reducing subsidies, among other things. The AoA set a specific target of reducing export subsidies by 36% over six years for developed countries and 24% for developing countries. The EU was granted an exemption from the target under certain conditions, including that it would reduce its subsidies as much as possible and that it would negotiate with other countries to reduce their subsidies.
Impact of Eliminating Export Subsidies on European Dairy Policy
The elimination of export subsidies will have a significant impact on European dairy policy. The EU has been using export subsidies to support its dairy farmers and maintain a competitive edge in the global market. The elimination of these subsidies will mean that the EU will have to find alternative ways to support its dairy sector.
One of the most significant impacts of the elimination of export subsidies will be on milk prices. Export subsidies have artificially lowered the price of exported milk products, making them more competitive on the world market. Without these subsidies, European milk products will become more expensive, reducing their competitiveness in the global market. This will affect the demand for EU milk products, leading to lower export volumes.
The elimination of export subsidies will also lead to a reduction in milk production. With export subsidies, the EU has been overproducing milk to meet export demand. Without these subsidies, the EU will have to reduce milk production to match domestic demand. This will likely be achieved through reducing production quotas and/or reducing the price paid for milk.
The EU will have to find alternative ways to support its dairy sector, which may include increased direct payments, investment in research and development, and other measures to promote innovation and competitiveness. The EU may also need to consider measures to support dairy farmers during the transition period and to help them adapt to the new market conditions.
WTO Negotiations
The decision to eliminate export subsidies was reached at the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2015. The decision was the result of years of negotiation and pressure from WTO members, particularly developing countries who have been negatively affected by EU export subsidies.
The EU's decision to eliminate export subsidies was driven by several factors. Firstly, the EU's dairy sector had become more competitive, reducing the need for subsidies. Secondly, the EU was under pressure from other WTO members, particularly developing countries, to reduce subsidies. Finally, the EU recognized that subsidies were distorting trade and creating unfair competition.
The elimination of export subsidies was a significant milestone in the ongoing Doha Development Round negotiations. The Doha Round was launched in 2001 with the aim of reducing trade barriers and promoting development. The elimination of export subsidies was one of the key issues for developing countries in the Doha Round negotiations.
Conclusion
The elimination of export subsidies will have significant impacts on European dairy policy. The EU will have to find alternative ways to support its dairy sector, which may include increased direct payments, investment in research and development, and other measures to promote innovation and competitiveness. The EU will also need to consider measures to support dairy farmers during the transition period and to help them adapt to the new market conditions.
The decision to eliminate export subsidies was the result of years of negotiation and pressure from the WTO and other developing countries. The elimination of export subsidies was a significant milestone in the ongoing Doha Development Round negotiations, as it addressed one of the key issues for developing countries.
Overall, the elimination of export subsidies is a positive step towards reducing trade distortions and promoting fair competition in the global dairy market. While the transition period may be challenging for European dairy farmers, the long-term benefits of this decision will be felt for years to come.
