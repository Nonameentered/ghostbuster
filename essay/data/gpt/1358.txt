The UK has a rich culture and history of hunting with hounds dating back to the 16th century. However, in 2004, a ban was introduced on hunting with hounds. This ban has been the subject of much debate, with supporters of hunting with hounds arguing that it is a tradition and a way of life, while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary. In this essay, I will explore the justification behind the ban on hunting with hounds in the UK.
Hunting with hounds involves using a pack of dogs to chase and kill a wild animal such as a fox, hare, or deer. The dogs can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, and their keen sense of smell and hearing makes it difficult for the prey animal to escape. During the hunt, the prey animal is often pursued for miles, until it is exhausted and can no longer run. The hounds then close in on the prey animal, and it is either killed by the pack of dogs or shot by the hunter.
One of the primary justifications behind the ban on hunting with hounds is animal welfare. Many people believe that hunting with hounds is cruel and unnecessary, and causes unnecessary suffering to the prey animal. The chase itself can be extremely stressful for the prey animal, causing it to panic and run for its life. This can result in injuries such as broken bones or dehydration. Once the prey animal is caught by the pack of dogs, it is often ripped apart alive, causing prolonged agony and suffering. In addition, hunting with hounds can disrupt or destroy entire ecosystems, upsetting the natural balance of nature.
Opponents of hunting with hounds argue that there are more humane methods of controlling animal populations, such as culling, which involves shooting animals in a controlled environment. Culling can be done in a way that is quick and painless, minimizing the suffering of the animal.
Another justification behind the ban on hunting with hounds is public opinion. There has been a shift in society's attitudes towards hunting with hounds, with many people now viewing it as barbaric and outdated. This shift in public opinion has been reflected in the media, with many newspapers and television programs voicing their opposition to hunting with hounds. In addition, animal rights groups such as the RSPCA have campaigned for years to ban hunting with hounds, arguing that it is a cruel and outdated practice that has no place in modern society.
Supporters of hunting with hounds argue that it is an important part of rural culture and tradition, and that banning it would be an attack on their way of life. Hunting with hounds is seen as a social activity, bringing people together and promoting a sense of community. It is also argued that hunting with hounds is an effective method of controlling animal populations, and that banning it would lead to an increase in the number of pests such as foxes, hares, and deer.
However, opponents of hunting with hounds argue that the tradition and way of life argument is flawed. Just because something has been done for centuries does not mean that it is right or moral. Slavery, for example, was once a tradition in many parts of the world, but it was eventually abolished because it was deemed to be cruel and inhumane. In addition, the argument that hunting with hounds is necessary for controlling animal populations is also flawed, as there are more humane methods of achieving the same goal.
In conclusion, the ban on hunting with hounds in the UK is justified on several grounds. Firstly, hunting with hounds is cruel and causes unnecessary suffering to the prey animal. Secondly, there are more humane methods of controlling animal populations, such as culling. Thirdly, there has been a shift in public opinion towards hunting with hounds, with many people now viewing it as barbaric and outdated. Finally, the argument that hunting with hounds is a tradition and a way of life is flawed, as just because something has been done for centuries does not mean that it is right or moral. Overall, the ban on hunting with hounds is a positive step towards promoting animal welfare and a more humane approach to controlling animal populations.
