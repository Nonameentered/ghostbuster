Erving Goffman, one of the most influential sociologists of the twentieth century, is known for his groundbreaking work on the negotiation of the "self" during social interaction. His perspective on the self as a dynamic entity, constantly negotiated and constructed during social encounters, has influenced the field of sociology and psychology in significant ways. In this essay, I will discuss Goffman's perspective on the negotiation of the self and how he uses concepts like "performance," "audience," and "stagecraft" to explain his perspective. Additionally, I will compare and contrast Goffman's perspective with the symbolic interactionism tradition of the Chicago school.
According to Goffman, the "self" is not a fixed entity but is constructed and reconstructed through social interaction. Individuals constantly engage in acts of "impression management" in which they present themselves in a certain way to others. These acts of impression management, or "performances," are critical to the construction of the self and involve the use of various "stagecraft" techniques.
Goffman defines performance as a "social process in which the individual presents himself to others for their judgments and evaluation" (Goffman, 1959, p. 3). He argues that individuals are constantly performing in various social situations, whether it be in a job interview or at a social gathering. Through these performances, individuals project a particular image of themselves to others. Goffman suggests that performances involve both verbal and non-verbal communication, including body language and facial expressions. These performances are not merely an act, but they are an attempt by individuals to shape the way that others perceive them.
To explain the concept of performance, Goffman uses the metaphor of the stage. He suggests that social interaction is like a drama where individuals play different roles. According to Goffman, individuals are constantly aware of their audience and use various stagecraft techniques to present themselves in a particular way. He suggests that individuals are constantly rehearsing their performances, ensuring they are presenting themselves in the best way possible to others.
Goffman uses the term "audience" to describe the individuals or groups who observe and evaluate the performance of the individual. The audience is critical to the performance, as they provide feedback that the performer uses to adjust and refine their act. According to Goffman, the audience is not passive but plays an active role in shaping the performance.
Another key concept that Goffman uses to explain his perspective is "stagecraft." By stagecraft, Goffman means the various techniques individuals use to manage their performances in front of an audience. Examples of stagecraft include the manipulation of physical environment, such as setting and lighting, as well as the manipulation of verbal and nonverbal communication, including body language and vocal tone. Through these stagecraft techniques, individuals attempt to present themselves in the best possible light to their audience.
Goffman's perspective on the negotiation of the self during social interaction is one that focuses heavily on the role of the individual in shaping their identity through various performances. His emphasis on the use of stagecraft techniques to manage these performances is a significant contribution to the field of sociology and psychology. However, Goffman's perspective is not without criticism. One critique is that his perspective focuses too heavily on the individual, ignoring the role of structures and institutions in shaping social reality.
Another significant criticism of Goffman's perspective is that it is too focused on the micro-level of social interaction, with little attention to macrosocial structures. Some sociologists argue that Goffman's perspective is limited in its ability to explain how social structures and institutions shape the negotiation of the self. This critique is particularly relevant when comparing Goffman's perspective with the symbolic interactionism tradition of the Chicago school.
Symbolic interactionism, which emerged in the early 20th century, is a theory that emphasizes the role of language and communication in shaping social reality. Like Goffman, symbolic interactionists argue that the self is constructed and reconstructed through social interaction. However, symbolic interactionism differs from Goffman's perspective in that it emphasizes the role of symbols, or the meanings attached to language and communication, in shaping social reality. Consequently, symbolic interactionism is concerned with both micro and macro-level processes.
While both perspectives emphasize the role of social interaction in the construction of the self, symbolic interactionism provides a more comprehensive explanation of how structures and institutions shape this negotiation process. Symbolic interactionists argue that symbols are not arbitrary but are derived from the culture and social structures that individuals inhabit. Consequently, macrosocial structures play a critical role in shaping the negotiation of the self, as the meanings and symbols available to individuals are shaped by the institutions and cultures they inhabit.
In conclusion, Erving Goffman's perspective on the negotiation of the self during social interaction is grounded in the idea that the self is a dynamic entity constantly negotiated and constructed during social encounters. Through concepts like "performance," "audience," and "stagecraft," Goffman provides a framework for understanding how individuals present themselves in particular ways to others. Although Goffman's perspective has been subject to criticism for its limited attention to macrosocial structures, it remains a valuable contribution to the field of sociology and psychology. When compared to the symbolic interactionism tradition of the Chicago school, Goffman's perspective highlights the importance of understanding how individuals use language and communication to shape their social realities.
