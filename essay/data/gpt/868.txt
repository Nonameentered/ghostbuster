In his poem “They Flee from Me,” Sir Thomas Wyatt utilizes various poetic devices to express the themes of love, faith, commitment, and labor. Wyatt uses metaphors, imagery, personification, allusion, and rhyme scheme to create a cohesive and powerful message. The poem is set in the context of a failed love affair, and Wyatt seeks to depict the complexity of human emotion that accompanies such situations.
The opening line of the poem reads, “They flee from me that sometime did me seek,” which is a metaphorical representation of the fleeting nature of love. In the second stanza, Wyatt uses personification to convey the idea that love has the ability to control a person’s fate: “And bade me goe, but whither noo!”. This line emphasizes the difficult decision that one must face when ending a relationship, as it often involves a sense of directionless confusion.
Throughout the poem, Wyatt uses imagery to represent both the highs and lows of love. For example, “The hunt is up, the morn is bright, And merry love doth walk in the woods” represents the beginning of a relationship when love is carefree and happy. In contrast, the line “I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek, That now are wild and do not remember” underscores the idea that love can be uncontrollable and unpredictable.
Wyatt also employs allusion in his poem to illustrate the complexity of a person’s relationship with love. His reference to the fall of Julius Caesar is symbolic of the power dynamic that exists in relationships. In addition, the rhyme scheme of the poem also contributes to the powerful and captivating nature of the poem. The ABAB rhyme scheme creates a sense of rhythm, which adds to the flow of the poem and helps to emphasize the themes of love, faith, commitment, and labor.
In conclusion, “They Flee from Me” is a powerful poem that uses a variety of poetic devices to convey the complexities of love and relationships. Wyatt’s use of metaphor, imagery, personification, allusion, and rhyme scheme illustrate the closure the lover wishes to seek with the relationship. The poem highlights the emotional problems that people face in romantic affairs, particularly the themes of separation, vulnerability, and uncertainty.
