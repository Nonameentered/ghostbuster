Pseudo gout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, is a condition that causes sudden and extremely painful joint inflammation, often mimicking the symptoms of gout. Pseudo gout occurs due to the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within joint cartilage, leading to joint inflammation and damage. Despite its similarities to gout, the underlying causes of pseudo gout and gout are different. Gout develops as a result of high levels of uric acid, while pseudo gout arises from excess calcium pyrophosphate.
Diagnosis of pseudo gout involves a number of different exams and tests. Firstly, doctors will begin by talking to the patient about their symptoms. They will then carry out a physical examination to check for inflammation in the joints and surrounding areas. Doctors may also take a sample of the fluid from an affected joint and examine it under a microscope to check for the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals.
Additionally, imaging tests such as an X-ray or ultrasound can also be used to identify potential signs of pseudo gout, including the appearance of calcium deposits near the joint. Blood tests may also be ordered to confirm that the patient's blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone are within a normal range. Diagnosing pseudo gout requires a combination of these tests to ensure that it is not mistaken for another condition with similar symptoms.
The treatment of pseudo gout primarily involves relieving pain and reducing inflammation in the affected joint area. Over-the-counter pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine, a medication commonly used to treat gout, can help manage the pain and swelling. In more severe cases, doctors may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Cold compresses and rest can also help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.
In addition to pain relief, doctors may also recommend physical therapy or exercise to help strengthen joint muscles. Weight loss may also be recommended to reduce stress on joints affected by pseudo gout. For people with chronic pseudo gout, medication can be effective in preventing future flare-ups. These include medications like hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and azathioprine.
 In conclusion, pseudo gout is a painful and debilitating condition that requires proper diagnosis and treatment to manage effectively. Accurately distinguishing between pseudo gout and other conditions that cause joint pain and inflammation is key. Treatment can be effective in reducing pain and reducing the frequency of future attacks. With proper care and ongoing treatment, people with pseudo gout can manage their symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.
