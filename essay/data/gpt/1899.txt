In October 2005, 67 food and nutrition students at the University of Reading conducted a study on the nutrient intakes of Reading University students using a food frequency questionnaire. The aim of the study was to investigate the adequacy of the nutrient intakes of the students and to compare them to the Dietary Reference Values (DRV), Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNI), and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) set by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food (COMA) in 1991.
According to the food frequency questionnaire, the nutrient intakes of the Reading University students were found to be generally adequate. The results of the study showed that the students consumed an average of 90mg of Vitamin C per day, which is above the COMA recommendation of 40mg per day for adults. However, the intake of iron was found to be below the RNI, with male students consuming an average of 9.6mg per day and female students consuming an average of 7.5mg per day, compared to the RNI of 12mg and 14.8mg per day respectively.
The DRV, RNI, and RDA set by COMA provide guidance on the amount of nutrients that need to be consumed daily to ensure optimal health. The DRV is the amount of a nutrient that is needed to prevent deficiency, while the RNI is the amount that is needed to meet the needs of 97.5% of the population, and the RDA is the amount that is recommended for daily consumption by the general population. For Vitamin C, the DRV is 40mg, the RNI is 40mg, and the RDA is between 40-60mg per day for adults. For iron, the DRV is 8.7mg for men and 14.8mg for women, while the RNI is 12mg for men and 14.8mg for women.
The nutrient intakes of Reading University students were adequate for Vitamin C but deficient for iron. While the intake of Vitamin C was above the DRV, this does not necessarily mean that the students were consuming an excessive amount of the nutrient, as the RDA range for adults is between 40-60mg per day. The deficiency in iron intake is a concern, as iron is required for the formation of red blood cells and the transport of oxygen in the body.
The study also examined the salt intakes of the students and found that they exceeded the UK government's recommendation of no more than 6g per day. The average salt intake of the male students was 8.9g per day, while the average salt intake of the female students was 7.3g per day. Excessive salt intake can lead to high blood pressure and an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. The findings highlight the need for public health campaigns to raise awareness of the risks of high salt intake and to encourage individuals to reduce their salt consumption.
The results of the study could have been affected by a number of factors, including the weight and physical activity of the participants, as well as their honesty in reporting their diets. The nutrient requirements of individuals vary depending on their body weight, sex, age, and physical activity levels. The participants may have over or underestimated their intake of certain foods, which could have affected the accuracy of the results. The study also relied on self-reported data, which is subject to bias and may not always reflect the true dietary habits of the participants.
In conclusion, the study by 67 food and nutrition students at the University of Reading in October 2005 revealed that the nutrient intakes of Reading University students were generally adequate for Vitamin C but deficient for iron. The salt intakes of the students were found to exceed the UK government's recommendations, highlighting the need for public health campaigns to raise awareness of the risks of high salt intake. The results of the study were subject to potential biases, including the weight and physical activity of the participants, as well as their honesty in reporting their diets. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the nutrient intakes of young adults and the need for continued efforts to promote healthy eating habits.
