English Nature is a government agency that has been established to promote nature conservation and protect biodiversity in the UK. The role of this agency is to ensure protection and conservation of natural habitats, including flora and fauna and to preserve and improve natural resources. Besides, the agency is responsible for organizing nature walks, creating educational resources and promoting public engagement with the natural environment. 
One of the primary functions of English Nature is to provide the scientific expertise required to develop policies that promote conservation. This is done through research and monitoring, as well as engagement with the community of scientists and organizations working in the conservation field. More importantly, English Nature acts as an advisor to government bodies, providing information and guidance that will help them develop more effective conservation policies.
Rural Environmental Scientists can be essential in promoting nature conservation by working together with English Nature. There are several areas where Rural Environmental Scientists could be highly useful in promoting the work of English Nature. For example, scientists can carry out field research and surveys to report on the state of natural resources such as water and soil. Moreover, they can develop monitoring techniques, disease assessments, and environmental impact assessments, which can all provide useful data for English Nature's conservation efforts.
Rural Environmental Scientists can also work with local communities to identify local projects that can support nature conservation. For example, participating in biodiversity surveys, habitat creation and helping to implement conservation schemes in rural areas. The knowledge of Rural Environmental Scientists is also essential in policy development to help identify effective and feasible policies that can promote conservation.
In conclusion, English Nature plays a vital role in promoting nature conservation in the UK. The involvement of Rural Environmental Scientists is crucial in promoting the work of English Nature in achieving conservation goals. It's essential for scientists and English Nature to work together to promote nature conservation and protect the biodiversity of natural habitats. With the concerted efforts of these bodies, the UK can achieve sustainable and long-lasting conservation solutions.
