The mail order bride industry, specifically the commodity chain that involves Filipina women - Japanese, American, and Canadian men, is a complex system that has significant social and economic effects on gendered structures. At the heart of the industry are International Marriage Agencies that connect men from wealthy countries with women from developing countries who are willing to marry - often in exchange for a chance at a better life abroad.
The gendered structures of the mail order bride industry have a profound impact on individuals at every level. For women in developing countries, the industry can offer some opportunities for economic mobility and escape from poverty. However, the demand for women to enter into non-consensual marriages, combined with the exploitative practices of some agencies, can also lead to physical and emotional abuse, as well as trafficking and sexual exploitation.
At the same time, men in wealthy countries who participate in the industry are often seeking a subservient partner with whom they can maintain a power dynamic. This reinforces existing gender hierarchies and stereotypes, while also perpetuating discrimination against women. The State, too, plays a role in perpetuating these structures - by allowing the industry to operate without adequate regulation.
While the mail order bride industry creates a bridge of opportunity for some women, it also reinforces existing gendered structures of power and privilege. This is particularly evident in the experiences of Filipina women who, despite their education and skills, are often unable to secure employment in their own country. By seeking out relationships with men from wealthy countries, they are effectively commodifying themselves and reinforcing the notion that their only value lies in their ability to fulfil the wants and desires of men.
In conclusion, the mail order bride industry represents a complex and multifaceted system that is both underpinned by and reinforces existing gendered structures. The industry creates both bridges of opportunity and vises of exploitation, and it is essential that policymakers work to protect those who are most vulnerable. By regulating the industry, providing education and resources to women, and advocating for more equitable gender relations, we can begin to address the detrimental social and economic effects of this industry.
