The simulation of flow over a vehicle is a complex task that involves several steps in creating a geometry and mesh. The process is vital for studying the impact of airflow on vehicles such as how aerodynamics can be enhanced to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. The geometry and mesh creation for a simulation of flow over a vehicle requires defining the regions on which the simulation will be conducted, setting mesh spacing, and inflating layers. The problem is primarily solved using CFX-Pre and CFX-Post, which are software suites specially designed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.
The first step in creating a geometry and mesh for the simulation of flow over a vehicle is to define the regions. The vehicle model is usually imported to the software suite that will be used to conduct the simulation. The geometry is then dissected into various regions that are assigned to different boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are the specifications of the fluid’s behavior at the domain’s boundaries and are critical for conducting accurate simulations. The region defined could be the surface of the vehicle, where the vehicle texture is specified, the outside flow zones where the fluid needs to be modeled, or internal zones, where the air ducts, engine bay compartments, and other parts of the vehicle’s internals are modeled.
After defining the regions, the mesh spacing is set. The mesh is a fundamental component of CFD modeling as it discretizes the fluid flow equations. CFD equation solutions are based on the finite element method, which requires that the geometry be broken down into a finite number of elements. Therefore, the mesh spacing determines the number of elements and nodes required to accurately map the fluid flow inside the vehicle. The mesh size should be small enough to provide reasonable modeling accuracy but not too small as to be computationally expensive. In general, finer mesh spacing results in more accurate modeling but demands more computation time and memory. Determining the right mesh spacing is a balancing act between the required accuracy and available resources.
The next step in the process is the creation of inflated layers. Inflated layers or boundary layers models the low-speed fluid flow near the vehicle’s surface. These layers improve the accuracy of the solution and reduce the model’s sensitivity to mesh size. Inflated layers for the vehicle surface can be created using two methods: the first method involves using a prism mesh approach, and the second method is based on the boundary-layer mesh approach. The former method involves extruding the elements within a specified thickness to form the inflated layers. The boundary-layer approach, on the other hand, builds the inflated layer by a multi-element approach, with each element successively refining towards the geometry’s surface. Both of these methods create a layer of elements near the surface of the vehicle where turbulent flow predominates.
CFX-Pre is a user-friendly graphical interface in the ANSYS simulation suite used to create geometries and analyze simulations. CFX-Pre provides tools to import and modify the geometry, define regions and boundaries, specify material property data, and adjust mesh configurations. After the geometry and mesh have been set up, the CFX-Pre software creates the necessary boundary conditions, which include velocity, pressure, density, and turbulence. It assigns these conditions to each specified region to create a complete simulation file.
The simulation file created by CFX-Pre is then solved using CFX-Solver. The solver uses the finite element method to solve the fluid flow equations. The solver breaks down the fluid flow domain into a finite number of elements and nodes and determines the flow field by iteratively solving the differential equations governing fluid flow. The solver model includes turbulence, which is modeled using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The RANS equations provide a time-average representation of the flow phenomena.
After the simulation has been completed, the CFX-Post is used to analyze and visualize the results. The post-processing software provides tools for querying flow parameters, inspecting and modifying surface meshes, and creating plots and animations that show the fluid flow field over the vehicle. The software tool also provides tools for flow visualization, including vector and streamline plots, contour plots, and velocity field animations. CFX-Post also allows the user to extract measured variables used to assess the vehicle’s aerodynamic performance, including drag, lift, and drag coefficients. These variables are critical metrics for designing more aerodynamically efficient vehicles.
In conclusion, the simulation of flow over a vehicle is a complex task that requires several steps for creating geometry and mesh. The three primary steps involved are defining regions, setting mesh spacing, and producing inflated layers. Region definition is the process of dividing the vehicle geometry into specific areas and assigning boundary conditions and material properties. Mesh spacing is the process of determining the number of elements and nodes needed to discretize the fluid flow domain. Inflated layers are created to model the low-speed flow of fluid near the vehicle surface. CFX-Pre and CFX-Post are software suites that provide a user-friendly interface for creating geometries, setting mesh spacing, and analyzing simulations. CFX-Pre creates the simulation file, while CFX-Post analyzes and visualizes the simulation results. Therefore, creating geometry and mesh is a critical aspect of conducting simulations for studying the impact of aerodynamics on a vehicle’s performance.
