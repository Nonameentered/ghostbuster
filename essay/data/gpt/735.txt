The Renaissance period, spanning from the 14th to the 17th century, was marked by a significant intellectual movement that was characterized by immense developments in art, literature, philosophy, and science. The period was marked by significant changes in the way people viewed themselves, as individuals rather than mere cogs in society. With the growth of humanism, which placed a greater emphasis on individual potential and abilities, human beings came to be seen as capable of living virtuous, accomplished, and fulfilling lives.
The Renaissance was a period of tremendous social and cultural change as society underwent a transition from feudalism to capitalism. In the feudal era, individuals' status was determined by their place in society, but during the Renaissance, a new mindset emerged that focused on individuals' potential and abilities. The shift towards individualism and humanism had a profound impact on the way people viewed themselves which, in turn, influenced literature.
One of the critical ways the Renaissance period changed people's views regarding the self- was by placing an emphasis on self-reflection and understanding. Previously, people lived in a time where information and knowledge were primarily passed down from generation to generation, and there was little questioning of those that came before. However, during the Renaissance, writers, artists, and thinkers began to interrogate traditional beliefs and ideas and sought to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world.
The emergence of humanism placed a renewed emphasis on the importance of individual expression and creativity, which paved the way for the development of new literary forms. Humanist thinkers believed that knowledge could be applied for humanitarian purposes and embraced a newfound interest in classical literature. This inspired writers, such as Petrarch, to write in vernacular languages and emphasized the importance of literature as a tool of self-expression.
Petrarch's sonnets were among the earliest forms of Renaissance literature that reflected the period's growing interest in individualism and self-expression. In his sonnets, Petrarch writes about love, nature, and his struggles with self-reflection and understanding. Petrarch's sonnets were not only a means of self-expression, but they also provided readers with insight into the social and cultural changes taking place during the Renaissance period.
Another significant aspect of how the Renaissance altered people's views of the self and reflected through literature was the understanding of human nature. During the Renaissance, there was a renewed prominence on the study of human anatomy, which contributed to a greater understanding of the human body and psyche. These discoveries had a significant impact on literature, as writers attempted to understand human nature better and portray authentic characters in their works.
One of the pioneering authors of this new approach to literature was William Shakespeare. He innovated the idea of creating relatable characters that were richly developed beyond the role they played in the story. In his works, Shakespeare addressed issues such as love, moral responsibility, power, and social standing. The characters he created were human, and their motivations, struggles, and emotions resonated with audiences of the time. Through his plays, Shakespeare illustrated human nature and helped people to understand themselves better, reflecting the changes taking place in the way people viewed the self.
Another way literature of the Renaissance reflected changes in people's concepts of the self was through the development of the novel form. Novels allowed authors to create complex and introspective characters through extended narratives that were not bound by the restrictions of traditional literary forms. The novel allowed readers to explore the motivations and inner workings of characters, providing a deeper understanding of human nature.
One of the most significant Renaissance era novels was Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote." The novel provides readers with a realistic portrayal of a delusional man whose actions are driven by romanticism and self-imposed chivalry ideals. Through the character and his experiences, the novel explores themes of identity, self-delusion, and the dangers of living in one's self-deceptive bubble. The exploration of human nature, particularly in the context of the self, was a prevalent theme in Renaissance literature, highlighting how the period had changed people's views of themselves.
In conclusion, the Renaissance period had an immense impact on how people viewed themselves, emphasizing the importance of individualism, self-expression, and self-reflection. This growth of humanism and science provided the means for writers to innovate on traditional modes of literature and create new works that reflected the changing perceptions of the self. The development of new literary forms such as the novel, sonnet form, and modern theatre allowed authors to explore a range of human emotions and motivations which, in turn, expanded the understanding of individuals' concept of the self. Renaissance literature allowed readers to gain a deeper understanding of human nature and gained insight into the significant societal and cultural changes taking place, shaping the modern view of the self.
