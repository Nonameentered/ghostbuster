The proposed title for the third-year project (CS 310) is "Secure Online Transactions". This project will support features such as secure login, transaction validation, and payment gateway integration. The importance of secure online transactions in today's society cannot be understated. With the increasing trend towards e-commerce and digital payments, it is imperative that online transactions are safe and secure. There are several risks involved in credit card fraud including identity theft, unauthorized charges, and account takeover.
The project will be divided into different phases to ensure its success. The first phase will involve requirements gathering, analysis, and feasibility study. During this phase, the scope of the project will be defined, and the various stakeholders will be identified. The second phase will be the design phase, where the architecture and interface of the application will be finalized. The third phase will involve the implementation of the application where programming languages such as Java, HTML, and JavaScript will be used. The final phase will be the testing and deployment phase. During this stage, various testing parameters will be set up, and bugs and errors will be resolved before it is finally deployed.
The technological stack used to implement the application will be chosen based on the requirements of the project. Java is capable of providing a solid foundation for the project and provides several programming options such as Spring, Hibernate, and Struts. HTML and JavaScript will be used for the frontend, while the backend will be supported by a robust database system. In terms of security measures, several measures will be put in place to secure online transactions. A secure framework will be employed to ensure that data is secured in transit. Additionally, DB parameterization will be carried out to avoid SQL injection attacks. The project will also involve the integration of an API that will ensure secure transactions are carried out with the payment gateway.
The importance of secure online transactions is becoming increasingly evident with the rise in digital commerce. Cybersecurity breaches that lead to identity theft and other fraudulent activities can lead to significant losses for businesses affected. Additionally, consumers could lose their personal information, which could impact them negatively for years. As such, having secure transactions processes in place is integral to the success of any business.
Credit card fraud poses several risks to online transactions. One significant risk is identity theft. Hackers can carry out phishing attacks, malware, and other social engineering tactics to obtain users' credit card information. Unauthorized charges are another risk, where an attacker could use a stolen credit card to make purchases without the owner's consent. Account takeover is yet another serious risk that could lead to complete financial losses. As such, creating a secure online transaction process that guarantees customer safety and security is of utmost importance.
In conclusion, the proposed third-year project, "Secure Online Transactions," is a much-needed project that focuses on enhancing online security in today's society. The project will support several essential features such as secure login, transaction validation, and payment gateway integration. Implementing a robust technological stack, secure programming concepts, and integrating payment gateways will provide an added layer of security and reduce risks associated with credit card fraud. As such, the project will provide a valuable contribution to the community and can be scaled to businesses of any size.
