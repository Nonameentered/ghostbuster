Introduction
The human healthcare sector, particularly the nursing profession, is an essential part of providing health care services to patients who require intense care and treatment. Nurses play a crucial role in the life of patients on the wards through their interaction with patients, which offer a significant impact on the patients' outcomes. During my clinical experience, I had the opportunity to serve as a registered nurse in the ward, where I was responsible for caring for patients who required tonsillectomy as the primary treatment intervention. During the care process, the interaction that stood out was with a nine-year-old girl and her mother, who were admitted to the ward for tonsillectomy. This essay aims to describe and analyze my role in the interaction with the nine-year-old girl and her mother during tonsillectomy while reflecting on the experience and its impact.
Interaction with a Nine-Year-Old Girl and her Mother
Upon admission of the nine-year-old girl, my primary responsibility was to make her comfortable and at ease. As a nurse, I introduced myself and provided a brief overview of the care process. I had to establish a therapeutic relationship by being friendly, approachable, and empathetic, which was crucial in building trust and confidence between myself and the child. I introduced myself as the nurse and showed the child around the room and the medical equipment that would be used, such as the bed, monitoring devices, and even a toy to play with. The child was intrigued by the equipment, and I took advantage of this to provide adequate information about the medical equipment. The mother appeared to be worried about the medical intervention indicating that the child had never undergone surgery before, hence her anxiety levels were high.
As the nurse, I had to teach the child about the surgical procedure and answer the mother's and child's questions about the process. I reassured the mother that the care team was competent in handling such medical interventions. I used a child-friendly language to explain the procedure and the projected outcome. The child and mother appeared reassured by my explanation about the procedure, and I left the room to allow the mother to comfort her child.
Later on, I returned to the room for the child's preoperative evaluation. I performed the necessary procedures such as physical exams, obtained her vital signs, and checked the response of her reflexes. During the evaluations, I continued to talk to the child in comfortable language explaining each procedure and its purpose. I also informed the mother of what was happening, which helped her stay calm and assured her that I was doing my job.
During the surgical process, I played a crucial role in ensuring that both the child and mother were comfortable. I helped the child wear the surgical gown and took her for the surgery. Before the surgery began, I reassured the child, held her hand and provided an encouraging word. I made her comfortable by covering her with a warm blanket while monitoring her vital sign to ensure that she maintained stable health throughout the procedure.
After the surgery, I remained with the child during the postoperative phase. I monitored the child's vital signs to ensure that she was attaining stable health. The child appeared very hungry after the procedure, and I encouraged her to have some water and light snacks. The mother was grateful that the child had bravely undergone the surgery and that everything had gone well, and I took advantage of this moment to provide education on postoperative care and pain management.
What I learned and How I felt during the interaction
During the interaction with the nine-year-old girl and her mother, I learned that children undergoing surgery for the first time are often anxious and worried. I realized how vital it was to communicate clearly and understand their perspective. It was also important to answer all the questions that they had, using simple terms that they could understand. During this interaction, I had mixed feelings because although I had a clear plan and student goals, I felt anxious with unknown challenges. The child's reaction and ability to go through surgical intervention gave me great satisfaction.
Hypothesis about the Interaction
From this interaction, I hypothesized that the child's surgical intervention was successful much because I made the child and mother comfortable by providing a supportive environment. This was evident in the child's recovery phase, where she was comfortable, calm, and willing to comply with postoperative care management. It is therefore important that the nurse administering care to children provide comfort, reassurance, empathy, and an environment that fosters communication and trust-building.
Theoretical Analysis
Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggests that children's understanding of the world develops through their gradual advancement from basic knowledge to more complex concepts. Nurses can use this theory to foster communication by accessing children's basic knowledge before providing any informational or educational approach to nursing care. For instance, before the surgery, I accessed the child's knowledge of medical equipment and explained how these devices would be used.
The attachment theory postulates that children develop an attachment to their caregivers. Nurses can utilize this theory by providing a supportive and caring environment, accommodating the child's needs. By providing such care, children are unlikely to experience acute separation or anxiety disorders, leading to a smooth postoperative recovery. Throughout the interaction with the nine-year-old girl and her mother, I prioritized building a trusting relationship, which likely helped to promote a better experience for both the child and mother.
Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development postulates that individuals experience different psychological and social changes over several stages. Nurses can apply this theory in communication by fostering a therapeutic relationship with the children while providing healthcare interventions. During the interaction with the nine-year-old girl and her mother, I identified with Erikson's theory by developing an emotional bond with the child and her mother.
Implication for Future Practice
The interaction with the nine-year-old girl and her mother has taught me that children undergoing surgical intervention require a supportive and nurturing environment. As a future nurse, I have learned that children require a positive and therapeutic relationship that fosters mutual trust and understanding for optimal outcomes. I will continue to implement the knowledge I gained from this interaction in future practice, particularly in the management of children's postoperative care. I now have insights on providing psychological support to both children and their caregivers, and the importance of providing trauma-centered care for children to avoid acute separation and anxiety disorder. Overall, I learned that being a nurse involves more than just administering medical interventions. It involves building a meaningful relationship with the children and their caregivers, which is crucial for a successful nursing career.
Conclusion
This interaction with a nine-year-old girl and her mother gave me invaluable insights on providing nursing care for children undergoing surgical intervention. By fostering a therapeutic relationship that comprises communication, trust building, and empathy, I was able to foster a supportive and nurturing environment that facilitated successful surgery and posoperative outcome in the child. Applying different theories including the cognitive and attachment theory, nurses can create an environment that optimizes psychological support for children undergoing a medical procedure. As future nurses, it is imperative that we embrace this approach to provide an all-round quality care experience for children, which ultimately improves their recovery process.
