The use of literary devices such as metaphor, tense, parallelism, and graphological deviation play a crucial role in communicating the themes of a literary work effectively. In the poem "How we have walked, How we have journeyed," by Sonia Sanchez, these literary devices combine to convey strong emotions and powerful messages. Through the use of these devices, the poem creates an interesting interplay between the present, past, and future, and shows how history has shaped the present.
One of the most significant literary devices used in the poem is metaphor. Sanchez draws upon the metaphor of walking to describe the experience of African Americans and their journey through history. The metaphor of walking is used to show how African Americans have traversed through difficult terrain, yet they have persevered through the odds. Sanchez emphasizes that walking is not just physical, but it is also emotional and spiritual. This metaphor is critical in creating a deep emotional connection with the reader and gives a sense of understanding of the African American experience.
Sanchez also uses tense shifts in the poem to illustrate the relationship between the past and present. For instance, she frequently switches between the present and past tense to illustrate the ongoing impact of history on the present. In the present tense, Sanchez uses the pronoun "we" to show how African Americans are still struggling with issues such as racism and discrimination. However, in the past tense, she shows how African Americans have overcome countless hurdles and have faced numerous challenges in the past. By using tense shifts, Sanchez creates a feeling of unity with the reader, helping them to grasp the challenges and victories faced by African Americans throughout history.
The use of parallelism also plays a crucial role in the poem. Sanchez repeats the phrase "We were there," emphasizing how African Americans have played a significant role in American history. This parallelism creates a sense of pride and empowerment for the African American community. The repetition of the phrase is not only powerful, but it also serves as a reminder of the African American struggle for equality, justice, and freedom.
Finally, graphological deviation is another literary device used in the poem to highlight the importance of African American history. Through graphological deviation, the poet creates different layers of meaning that indicate the struggle and sacrifices of African Americans. For instance, Sanchez uses bold letters at the beginning of some of the stanzas to emphasize the essential elements of African American history. The use of capitalization and bold lettering stands out among the other lines of the poem, and it significantly elevates the importance of these phrases.
When compared to other poems such as "Pan Recipe" and "New World A-Comin," it is evident that all three works use similar literary devices to convey powerful themes. In "Pan Recipe," Kamau Brathwaite employs metaphors and graphological deviation to detail the importance of Pan music and its origins. Similarly, in "New World A-Comin," Langston Hughes uses metaphor and parallelism to describe the struggles of African Americans and their journey towards freedom and equality.
In conclusion, the use of literary devices such as metaphor, tense, parallelism, and graphological deviation enhances the poet's ability to communicate complex themes effectively. In "How we have walked, How we have journeyed," Sonia Sanchez uses these literary devices to great effect, conveying the struggles and triumphs of African American history. The poem's interplay between the present, past, and future highlights the ongoing impact of history on the present. When examined against other poems such as "Pan Recipe" and "New World A-Comin," it is clear that through the use of these literary devices, each work successfully communicates a strong message while capturing the essence of African American culture and history.
