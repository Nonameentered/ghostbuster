The relationship between Britain and America began to deteriorate in the eighteenth century due to various reasons. The colonial administration and restrictive trade policies of Britain towards the American colonies made the political relationship between the two countries strained. Britain's attempts to stifle America's growth resulted in a series of trade acts and economic regulations tilted in favour of Britain. These regulations became increasingly burdensome on the American colonies and eventually paved the way for the American Declaration of Independence in 1776. The events leading up to the Declaration of Independence, such as the Sugar Act and Stamp Act, contributed to the anti-British sentiment among the American people. The suspension of debt payments to British merchants added another dimension to the already complex relationship between the two countries.
Britain's main reason for deteriorating relations with America was economics. By the eighteenth century, the British Empire had grown significantly, and Britain was the world's leading colonial power. Economic exploitation of the American colonies by Britain was at the heart of the strained relationship. Britain intended to control trade with the colonies so that the colonies could only import goods from Britain and export to British ports. As a result, Britain's control over the colonial economy became increasingly burdensome for the American colonies. This resulted in the gradual erosion of their autonomy.
Britain attempted to stifle America's growth in many ways. One way was through the Navigation Acts of 1660, 1663, and 1673, which required all colonial goods to be transported on British ships and pass through British ports. Additionally, the acts stipulated that certain goods could only be sold in Britain, and American merchants were prohibited from selling goods to foreign markets. These policies inhibited the growth of America's manufacturing industry and made it dependent on British manufactured goods. Britain controlled all aspects of economic affairs in the colonies and used it to maintain its commercial supremacy.
The British Government passed several trade acts and economic regulations that highly favoured Britain leading up to the American Declaration of Independence. These regulations included the Molasses Act of 1733, which placed heavy taxes on the importation of molasses from non-British Caribbean sources, forcing the colonies to purchase from the British West Indies. The 1764 Sugar Act aimed at strengthening enforcement of tax collection on molasses. The Currency Act of 1764 forbade colonies from issuing their currencies, making them dependent on British currency. These regulations deprived the American colonies of their economic freedom, made them economically vulnerable, and ultimately contributed to their decision to break away from Britain.
The Sugar and Stamp Acts ticked off the American colonists, and the relationship between the two countries declined further. The Sugar Act of 1764 imposed a tax on sugar, wine, and other products imported to the American colonies. Many viewed this tax as unfair and protested against it. The Stamp Act of 1765 was another tax on the American colonies, this time on newspapers, legal papers, playing cards, and other printed materials. Protests and boycotts by the American people increased as they became increasingly frustrated by British interventions in their daily lives.
American colonists began to question if their rights were being respected and if they had any power of self-determination. They believed that they were being unfairly taxed without representation, as they had no representative in the British Parliament due to their colonial status. This created frustration and gradually fuelled anti-British sentiment amongst the American people.
The suspension of debt payments to British merchants also impacted the relationship between Britain and America. America's debt to Britain following the French and Indian War had to be paid back with interest, but America could not afford to pay back the debt due to the economic downturn. British merchants who had lent money to American colonists through commercial credit were negatively affected, which made them demand repayment. When colonists failed to pay back their debts, British merchants put pressure on the British Government to take action. This added another layer of tension to the already complex relationship between Britain and its American colonies.
In conclusion, the relationship between Britain and America began to deteriorate in the eighteenth century due to economic exploitation of the American colonies by Britain. Britain's attempts to stifle America's growth resulted in the British administration passing several trade acts and economic regulations tilted in favour of Britain, which severely burdened the American colonies. This led to a gradual erosion of their autonomy, which eventually created anti-British sentiment amongst the American people. The Sugar and Stamp Acts contributed to the anti-British sentiment, and the suspension of debt payments to British merchants added another dimension to the already complex relationship between the two countries. By the time of the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, the relationship had already deteriorated beyond repair, leading to one of the most significant events in world history.
