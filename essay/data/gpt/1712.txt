Introduction
Oxford, as the “city of dreaming spires,” is a mecca for readers. For a long time, it has been home to the oldest and most popular bookshops in the world. With innovative marketing strategies and fierce competition among retailers, the city’s main bookshops have transformed into a first choice for literature aficionados. This report will aim to compare and contrast their retail practices - their location, internal layouts, items sold, range of books, and general atmosphere - and provide insights into their target markets and customer attraction strategies.
Location
The four main bookshops in Oxford, Blackwell’s, Borders, Waterstone's, and WH Smith, are strategically located near the city center. Blackwell’s store lies opposite the Sheldonian Theatre, while Borders occupies a spot near the main shopping street, Cornmarket Street. Waterstone's is located on Broad Street, and WH Smith resides on Queen Street, which is famed for its traditional atmosphere. These locations are majorly convenient for tourists, students, and the locals. Moreover, these places are highly accessible by pedestrians, which means these shops receive a consistent footfall of potential customers.
Internal Layout
Borders’ inner design has been a hit with the locals and tourists. The store features large windows that brighten up the interior, which contributes to its welcoming ambiance. The ceiling is high and the walls are adorned with modern murals that give off an artsy vibe. The books are arranged into categories, and each section has ample signage to guide customers. The store has comfortable chairs and sofas strategically placed for which customers can take a break from book-browsing.
Similarly, Blackwell's provides customers with a modern layout. The store has recently undergone refurbishment, improving its visual appeal. The interior is spacious, with lots of natural light and plenty of books to browse. Both of these stores resonate with customers who want modern design and a relaxed atmosphere that helps browsing.
Waterstone's and WH Smith have a more traditional layout. Both these stores have an extensive collection of books, arranged in various sections, but with little artistic appeal to the interior. Waterstone's does, however, have a cafe that provides customers with a comfortable seating area, which is ideal for relaxing while browsing and buying books.
Items Sold
The bookshops primarily sell reading materials, such as books, magazines, and newspapers. However, they differ in the kind of additional items sold to complement their reading materials.
WH Smith mostly sells stationery items like pens, journals, and folders. They have a decent collection of CDs, DVDs, and games that complement their customers' reading interests. Borders, on the other hand, sells gadgets, such as electronic dictionaries, calculators, and laptops, and items like calendars, posters, and greeting cards.
Waterstone's and Blackwell’s mostly focus on selling books. Additionally, they feature a wide collection of academic books for students and researchers. These stores have also diversified their interests and accommodate literature-related figurines, apparel, tote-bags, and e-readers that bear their names, which provide revenue for the stores.
Range of Books
The range of books that bookshops sell depends on their target audience. For instance, Waterstone's and Blackwell’s are renowned for selling academic books, fiction, and non-fiction of various categories. Blackwell’s is famed for its extensive selection of rare, used, and antique books. They have a collection that caters to varied interests like art, architecture, health, politics, and religion.
Borders and WH Smith have broader audiences and don't appeal to specific academic interests. They mostly have a collection of popular and best-selling books, such as contemporary fiction, self-help, and biographies. However, Borders offers a range of titles in children's literature, cookbooks, and travel. WH Smith, in contrast, has a vast collection of children's books and regularly promotes books related to top TV shows and movies.
