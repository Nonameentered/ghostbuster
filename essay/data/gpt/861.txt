The professionalization of medicine refers to the movement to establish and regulate the medical profession as a distinct and credible field. Throughout history, the practice of medicine was not always a career path chosen by men only, as women were often healers and midwives who possessed extensive knowledge of medical practices. However, during the period of professionalization, the medical field became increasingly dominated by men and the exclusion of women, especially midwives, became noticeable. This essay will explore how the professionalization of medicine led to the exclusion of women in medicine, specifically in midwifery, and how the dominant ideology of the time played a part in this.
The professionalization of medicine, from the seventeenth century onwards, was associated with the establishment of medical schools, which introduced formal and standardized curricula. The goal was to create a specific group of professionals who could be licensed to practice medicine. This led to the development of a hierarchical system with academic physicians at the top hierarchy, followed by apothecaries, midwives, and other medical ancillaries. Academic physicians insisted that the training of medical practitioners should be formal and structured in the way that medical schools taught it, which eventually led to the exclusion of women from the field. Women were perceived as lacking the necessary intellectual abilities to follow structured training, which meant that their medical knowledge was often self-taught or through an apprenticeship under a specialist.
In contrast to most cultures, during the Enlightenment period, it was believed that women were intellectually inferior to men. Women were thought to lack the mental and rational capacity, and their primary role was deemed to be that of a homemaker and a caregiver. As a result, professions that required academic training were reserved for men only, and it was perceived that women were not capable of carrying out intellectual activities. Medical practitioners, researchers, and scholars believed that women's intelligence was limited, and therefore, they could not master medical science. The dominant ideology at the time impacted women's exclusion from higher education, including medical schools. Women were not allowed to study in universities for centuries. Higher education for women was not commonly accepted, and when it did occur, it was usually through informal education or apprenticeships.
Midwifery was predominantly a female profession, given that women felt more comfortable giving birth in the presence of other women. Midwives were often the only option for women, especially when medical attention was not available. Midwives had extensive knowledge of childbirth practices and could guide women through delivery. Despite this, the medical profession gradually assumed control of childbirth, which led to the exclusion of midwives, most of whom were women. Medical professionals regarded childbirth as a medical emergency, which required a professional physician's attention. Midwifery was subjugated to the medical profession, which believed that women were less qualified to provide medical care to patients of their gender. In addition, midwives could not produce the type of scientific explanations and justifications for their practice that met the medical profession's standards. As a result, midwifery was generally deemed inferior to the higher-level medical practices of men, which led to questions about the ability of midwives to provide the required level of care. 
The shifting stance of obstetrical practices in hospitals was also a factor in the exclusion of midwives. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, obstetrical procedures became increasingly medicalized, with the introduction of forceps, anesthesia, and other medical technologies. This paved the way for the formalisation of obstetrics as a discipline of medicine that played a part in the exclusion of midwives. As obstetrical practice became mainstream, midwives were considered inferior to medical physicians who were being trained as obstetricians. Despite possessing specialized knowledge of childbirth, midwives could not provide the justification or explanations for their practices in a way deemed satisfactory by medical professionals.
Professionalization of medicine also meant that the standard of healthcare received by women changed. Women, who had been accustomed to midwives and their practices, often provided without charge, had to pay a fee for obstetrical care. Obstetrical charges could be prohibitive, and women who could not pay were often refused treatment, even when complications arose. This led to dangerous practices among women who could not afford obstetrical care. The medical profession did not have the capacity to provide care to every woman who needed it. This was partly because the medical profession consisted of only a few doctors, and partly because of financial factors. The introduction of fees meant that midwives found it challenging to compete with the medical profession, which was growing and consolidating its power.
The exclusion of women from the medical field, especially midwives, based on subjective notions of intellectual ability, has had lasting effects. Women have been deprived of practicing a profession they have historically excelled in, and their access to healthcare has been negatively impacted. Midwives were often part of a supportive community, and the loss of that camaraderie was a blow to women. Womenâ€™s health has not always been easily accessible, and for many women, midwives offered a solution that was safe, affordable, and reliable. Professionalizing medicine resulted in the loss of midwives and free childbirth assistance for many women. Women were left medically stranded and forced to pay exorbitant costs or risk unsafe childbirth methods.
In conclusion, the professionalization of medicine led to the exclusion of women, particularly in the field of midwifery. The dominant ideology of the time, which perceived women as intellectually inferior, perpetuated the exclusion of women from medicine. The perception was that women who served as midwives lacked the necessary medical knowledge to provide technical care to patients. The professionalization of medicine encouraged medical professionals to neglect the important role women played in healthcare and childbirth. Women were forced to compete with men in medical schools, and those who managed to gain entry faced prejudice and obstacles barely tolerated by the profession. The loss of midwives, the cultural knowledge they possessed, and the healthcare access they provided to women continue to have ramifications for women's health.
