Introduction:
Nursing is a challenging profession that requires a high degree of accuracy and decision-making ability. Nurses are required to make critical decisions on a daily basis that can affect patient outcomes. To make the right decision, nurses must consider various factors, including patient preferences, values, and beliefs, as well as evidence-based practice. Evidence-based practice is a vital tool that allows nurses to utilize the latest research to make informed decisions that have been shown to improve patient outcomes. This essay will analyze the factors that nurses should consider when making decisions in patient care and how evidence-based practice can be used to support decision making. In addition, it will use Gibbs' reflective cycle to analyze a specific decision made in nursing practice and draw conclusions based on research and critical appraisal of literature related to the topic.
Factors that Nurses should Consider when Making Decisions in Patient Care:
1) Patient Preferences:
One of the most critical factors that nurses should consider when making decisions in patient care is patient preferences. Nurses must take into account the patient's beliefs, culture, and values when making any decisions that will affect their health. Patients should have the right to make informed decisions about their care, and nurses must respect the patient's wishes and choices. For example, if a patient refuses a specific medication or treatment, nurses must respect their decision and provide alternative care options.
2) Evidence-Based Practice:
Evidence-based practice is an essential tool that nurses can use to make informed decisions that have been shown to improve patient outcomes. Evidence-based practice involves the integration of the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values and preferences. It requires nurses to critically appraise research evidence and apply it to patient care. For example, if a patient has a wound, evidence-based practice would require nurses to assess the latest research on wound care and choose a treatment option that has been shown to improve wound healing.
3) Communication:
Effective communication is critical in all aspects of nursing care, including decision making. Nurses must communicate effectively with patients, families, and other healthcare professionals to ensure that the patient's needs are met. Communication involves active listening, the ability to articulate thoughts and ideas clearly, and the capacity to convey information effectively. Miscommunication can lead to misunderstandings, errors, and poor patient outcomes.
4) Ethical considerations:
Nurses must consider ethical considerations when making decisions in patient care. This involves respecting the patient's rights, including the right to autonomy and self-determination. Ethical principles, such as beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, should guide the decision-making process. For example, nurses should consider whether a particular treatment would provide the most benefits with the least harm to the patient.
5) Safety:
A nurse's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of their patients. Therefore, safety considerations should be at the forefront of the decision-making process. Nurses must consider the risk-benefit ratio of any intervention to determine whether it will provide maximum benefits to the patient while minimizing potential harms.
How Evidence-Based Practice can be used to Support Decision Making:
Evidence-based practice is an essential tool that nurses can use to support decision making in patient care. This requires nurses to critically appraise research evidence and integrate it with clinical expertise and patient preferences. Evidence-based practice has been shown to improve patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.
Research evidence can help nurses make informed decisions about the most effective treatment options for their patients. For example, if a patient has Type 2 diabetes, research evidence can help nurses determine the most effective lifestyle modifications, medications, and treatment plans to manage the condition. Moreover, evidence-based practice can help nurses determine the most appropriate diagnostic tests, procedures, and interventions for their patients, reducing the risk of unnecessary treatments and tests, which can be costly and lead to adverse events.
Using Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to Analyze a Specific Decision in Nursing Practice:
The Gibbs' Reflective Cycle is a useful tool that can be used to analyze a specific decision made in nursing practice. This reflective cycle involves six stages: Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, and Action Plan. Using this reflective cycle can help nurses identify areas of improvement and develop an action plan to improve their practice.
Description:
As a nurse working in a hospital, I noticed that a patient with a terminal illness was requesting that specific family members not be allowed to visit. The family members had a history of causing stress and anxiety for the patient, and the patient believed that their recovery would be damaged if the family members were allowed to visit.
Feelings:
I felt torn between fulfilling the patient's request, which could improve their health outcomes, and my ethical obligation to respect the family's right to visit. I was also concerned about the potential complications that could arise if I refused to allow certain family members to visit.
Evaluation:
I evaluated the situation by considering the patient's belief that the family's visit could jeopardize their recovery. I also considered the ethical principles of respect for autonomy and beneficence. I determined that the patient's request was reasonable and agreed to honor their wishes.
Analysis:
I analyzed the situation by considering the potential risks and benefits of allowing specific family members to visit. I also considered the communication strategies I could use to convey the patient's request to the family members.
Conclusion:
My decision to honor the patient's request was supported by the principles of autonomy and beneficence. It also demonstrated respect for the patient's wishes and preferences.
Action Plan:
In the future, I will proactively assess patients' preferences regarding their visitors and make their requests known to the reception and nursing staff to prevent complications and avoid misunderstandings.
Critical Appraisal of Literature Related to the Topic:
In conclusion, nurses should consider various factors when making decisions in patient care, such as patient preferences, evidence-based practice, communication, ethical considerations, and safety. Evidence-based practice is an essential tool that nurses can use to make informed decisions. By integrating the latest research evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences, nurses can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and avoid potential harms. Reflective practice is equally essential in analyzing our practice, promoting professional growth, and improving patient outcomes. Using Gibbs' reflective cycle can help nurses identify areas of improvement and develop an action plan to improve their practice.
