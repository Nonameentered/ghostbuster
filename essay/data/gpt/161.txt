The concept of ‘embeddedness’ is a key theme in Karl Polanyi’s seminal work ‘The Great Transformation’. According to Polanyi, embeddedness refers to the social and cultural context of economic behavior. In other words, economic activity is not isolated from the larger social structure but is instead embedded in it. This concept is crucial to Polanyi’s critique of the self-regulating market and is highly relevant in understanding the contemporary global economy. In this essay, I will explore the significance of embeddedness in Polanyi’s work and its relevance to the current state of the global economy.
In ‘The Great Transformation’, Polanyi’s main argument is that the self-regulating market is a utopian idea that cannot exist in reality. He argues that the market is embedded in society and is subject to regulation by political and social institutions. Polanyi maintains that markets cannot operate independently of other social institutions such as the state, law, and culture. This is because markets rely on institutions for their very existence. For instance, the state provides the legal framework that underpins the market system, while cultural norms and values shape the behavior of economic actors.
According to Polanyi, society and its institutions are not static entities but instead are in a constant state of change. He identifies two modes of economic organization that have existed throughout history - market societies and non-market societies. Market societies are characterized by the dominance of the self-regulating market, while non-market societies are based on reciprocity, redistribution, and householding. Polanyi argues that the rise of market societies in the 19th century led to a ‘great transformation’ in economic and social relations. This transformation was driven by the spread of the self-regulating market, which brought about significant changes in the way people lived and worked.
One of the key consequences of the rise of market societies was the commodification of labor, land, and money. Polanyi argues that the commodification of these elements was only made possible by removing them from their social context and turning them into marketable goods. This process created a new mode of social relations based on self-interest and the pursuit of profit. However, this new mode of social relations was not sustainable and would eventually lead to social and economic instability.
The concept of embeddedness is central to Polanyi’s critique of the self-regulating market. Polanyi argues that the self-regulating market is embedded in society and cannot operate independently of it. In other words, the market is not a natural phenomenon but is instead a social construct that relies on social and cultural institutions. Polanyi believes that the idea of the self-regulating market is a utopian ideal that cannot exist in reality. He argues that markets are subject to regulation by political and social institutions and that they require crucial social, legal, and cultural conditions to function.
Polanyi’s argument highlights the importance of the state in regulating economic activity. According to Polanyi, the state has a crucial role to play in shaping economic behavior. This is because the state provides the legal and regulatory framework that governs the market system. Furthermore, the state has the power to shape the behavior of economic actors by imposing taxes, subsidies, and other forms of regulation.
Polanyi’s analysis of embeddedness has significant implications for the contemporary global economy. The rise of neoliberalism in the late 20th century saw a renewed emphasis on the self-regulating market, with governments around the world adopting policies aimed at deregulating markets and promoting free trade. However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed the limitations of this approach, as financial markets proved to be highly unstable and required significant state intervention to prevent collapse.
The concept of embeddedness is particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of the contemporary global finance industry. The global finance industry is characterized by a complex web of institutions and actors that are embedded in a complex set of social and cultural relations. For instance, the behavior of bankers and investors is shaped by cultural norms and practices, while financial markets rely on legal and regulatory frameworks to operate.
One of the key features of the contemporary global finance industry is the emergence of the double-movement. The double-movement refers to the interplay between the forces of neoliberal globalization and the resistance to these forces. On the one hand, neoliberal globalization has led to the deregulation of financial markets and the growth of financial capitalism. On the other hand, there has been a growing movement of resistance to neoliberalism, with calls for greater state intervention in the economy and the regulation of financial markets.
The concept of embeddedness is highly relevant in understanding the double-movement in global finance. The resistance to neoliberalism can be seen as a response to the negative social and economic impact of the self-regulating market. As Polanyi argued, the market cannot operate independently of society and requires social and cultural conditions to function. The double-movement can be seen as an attempt to re-embed the market in society and to ensure that economic activity is governed by social, cultural, and political institutions.
In conclusion, embeddedness is a crucial concept in understanding the social and cultural context of economic behavior. Polanyi’s analysis of embeddedness highlights the importance of social and cultural institutions in shaping economic activity and challenges the idea of the self-regulating market. The concept of embeddedness is highly relevant in understanding the contemporary global economy and the challenges facing the financial system. The double-movement in global finance can be seen as an attempt to re-embed the market in society and to ensure that economic activity is governed by social, cultural, and political institutions. The concept of embeddedness provides a useful analytical framework for understanding the complex interplay between markets, states, and civil society in the global economy.
