Motherhood often appears as the ultimate manifestation of womanhood. Societies world over have long promoted motherhood as a woman's primary destiny, and her preparation for it has been central to her upbringing. Despite the sense of pride and fulfillment it gives women, motherhood has remained a source of subordination as well. Unquestionably, the concept of maternal instinct plays a significant role in perpetuating the societal pressure for women to become mothers. However, this essay argues that this instinct may not always be innate, and societal pressures to become a mother may lead to perpetuate negative stereotypes and subjugate women. In exploring the role of motherhood in providing a sense of identity, this essay will suggest alternative parenting roles and the assumptions that underlie them. Ultimately, this essay proposes that motherhood can be seen as a choice rather than a prescribed destiny for women.
The idea that every woman is destined for motherhood has long been reinforced by patriarchal societies. Women grow up being told that their primary responsibility is to bear children and nurture them. The cultural belief in maternal instincts as innate, natural, and unchanging, further institutionalizes this narrative. Implicitly, this belief suggests that only women have the skills and disposition for nurturing and therefore their primary role is motherhood. This belief represents an inherited cultural notion that forms the basis of the oppressive idea that women should be confined to traditional gender roles and thereby, denying them equal opportunities to their male counterparts.
However, raising the question of whether maternal instincts are actually innate and unchanging, reevaluates the societal pressure for women to become mothers. Studies have shown that maternal instincts are not innate, which contests the idea that women's primary destiny is motherhood. Contrary to popular belief, studies have revealed that maternal behavior is not automatic or universal and that it is shaped by one's environment, social circumstances, and cultural context. Some studies indicate that the emotional experience of 'loving one's baby' is not biologically driven but a learned response. Researchers found that nonhuman primates care for their young but not with the same intensity and duration that a human mother would. These findings imply that women's capacity for nurturing is certainly not hard-wired into their biology and that social and cultural influences play an integral role. Thus, societal pressure on women to conform to traditional gender roles, including motherhood, may not only be unnecessary but also oppressive.
Motherhood has historically given women a sense of purpose, status, identity, and a place in society. Bearing children and rearing them are considered women's highest achievements, and those who chose not to become mothers were often stigmatized. In fact, researchers have identified a ' motherhood penalty,' where women who enter motherhood face wage and employment discrimination. This stigma and societal expectation perpetuate negative stereotypes of those who do not conform to the traditional role of motherhood. The idea that motherhood is fundamental to femininity and that women are biologically disposed to mothering, enables this negative stigma. This makes women who do not follow the traditional role of motherhood, like those who enter into politics or corporate jobs, to confront greater discrimination than men. These negative stereotypes have been perpetuated from generation to generation, preventing women from pursuing professions or anything that is not motherhood.
Instead of perpetuating this status quo, it is essential to suggest alternative parenting roles based on more egalitarian assumptions. Recent studies have supported the idea of co-parenting and equally shared parenting, which challenges traditional gender roles and division of labor in families. Shared parenting as an alternative assumes that regardless of gender and biology, both parents are equally capable of nurturing their children and taking care of domestic responsibilities. This alternative approach to parenting believes that both men and women do not just have the capacity but also the responsibility to nurture their children. Thus, shared parenting not only reduces the burden of work and responsibility primarily on women but also creates an environment that fosters equality in all aspects of familial responsibilities.
Ultimately, motherhood cannot be viewed as a woman's primary destiny, but rather should be regarded as a choice. Depending on an individual's preferences and needs, motherhood may or may not be a fulfillment of their life's purpose. The contemporary world respects the choices of women and, through legislation, have given women the option not to have children. In this sense, motherhood can be seen as more of a privilege, rather than a societal expectation or burden. Those who want to become mothers would only do so based on their desires rather than societal expectations.
In conclusion, motherhood has long been viewed as a woman's principal destiny. However, recent research suggests that maternal instincts may not be innate and that women face oppressive societal pressures to conform to traditional gender roles. Motherhood may give women a sense of purpose, and status, but it can perpetuate negative stereotypes for those who do not conform. Alternative parenting roles, such as shared parenting, offer a more egalitarian approach to raising children. Viewing motherhood as a choice liberates women from oppressive gender roles and allows them to live fulfilling lives based on their personal choices. Ultimately, when the pressures of motherhood are lifted, women can be judged on their merits, not on their reproductive status.
