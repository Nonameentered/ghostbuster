The nineteenth century was a period that witnessed significant changes in American society, particularly regarding the role and expectations of women. One of the most dominant ideologies during the era was the Cult of True Womanhood, which emphasized the need for women to embody specific traits that included piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity. The concept of "passionlessness" was a product of this ideology. The term described women's supposed lack of sexual desire, and it was seen as a critical component of the idealized version of femininity. The debate on 'passionlessness' was complex and multifaceted, and it had a profound impact not only on the gendered lives of Americans but also on issues of race and slavery. 
The Cult of True Womanhood emerged in the early nineteenth century as a response to the changing social and economic landscape of the country. Industrialization and capitalism had transformed traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, and the Cult of True Womanhood was an attempt to restore order to a society perceived as increasingly chaotic. The four pillars of the ideology emphasized women's roles as caretakers of the home and family, as well as their religious and moral purity, and the need for them to be submissive and obedient to men. These ideals were reinforced by religious and secular organizations, including churches, women's groups, and popular literature. 
Within this framework, women's sexuality was perceived as a threat to the social order. Women who failed to suppress their sexual desires were seen as transgressing societal norms and risking the moral fabric of American society. As a result, 'passionlessness' was enshrined as a desirable quality for women, and sexual desire, particularly in marriage, was regarded as secondary to the preservation of social order. 
The 'passionlessness' debate was largely confined to the upper and middle classes since they had the resources and leisure time necessary to engage in cultural debates. However, its impact was felt across society as women of all classes faced similar expectations of sexual restraint and domesticity. The ideology of 'passionlessness' was linked to the Cult of True Womanhood and reinforced its central ideals. Women who possessed this quality were considered virtuous, while those who did not were viewed as morally inferior.
Religion had a significant role in shaping the debate on passionlessness. The Protestant Christian ideal of women as moral and religious exemplars reinforced the concept of 'passionlessness.' Female sexuality was seen as dangerous and transgressive, and women who expressed sexual desires were viewed as morally corrupt. The idea was that women should devote themselves to family and home while refraining from any carnal desires. 
The medical profession also played a role in the 'passionlessness' debate. The notion of female 'passionlessness' had its roots in ancient theories of female anatomy and physiology. Medical practitioners of the time genuinely believed that women were physically incapable of experiencing sexual desire or pleasure. This belief was perpetuated by popular medical literature, which was heavily influenced by the Victorian moral code and further reinforced the idea that women who experienced sexual desire were either morally corrupt or suffering from an illness such as hysteria. 
The debate on 'passionlessness' was also shaped by class. The ideal of the True Woman was reserved for white middle and upper-class women. Working-class women, who had to work outside the home to support their families, were often excluded from the idealized version of femininity. Their work outside their homes was deemed unladylike and exposed them to the corrupting influence of the outside world, which further reinforced bourgeois norms. However, class oppression did not mean that working-class women were seen as less sexual; in fact, they were sexualized as part of their labor. The notion of 'passionlessness' was viewed as a sign of class status and sophistication and further reinforced bourgeois norms of femininity.
The intersection of race and slavery with the 'passionlessness' debate was complex. Slave women were often subjected to sexual violence and forced to fulfill the sexual desires of their masters. This reality contrasts sharply with the middle-class ideal of 'passionlessness.' Slave women's experience challenges the notion that women are naturally incapable of sexual desire and shows how social and economic factors can affect women's sexuality. The Cult of True Womanhood and its ideal of 'passionlessness' reinforced both the social and economic structures that allowed for the exploitation of slave women. Their treatment made visible the immense privilege and power upper-class white women enjoyed in a system that was built on the systematic oppression of another group.
To some extent, the concept of 'passionlessness' was liberating for women. It offered an alternative to the previous centuries' sexually explicit sexual culture, which had given women limited control over their bodies. It also gave women with 'passionless' qualities greater independence and control, allowing them to manage their homes and families without the distractions of sexual desire. Women in this context were able to establish themselves as moral and religious examples and gain respect within their communities. 
However, the 'passionlessness' ideology was also repressive for women, particularly those who lacked agency or power. It perpetuated patriarchal norms and reinforced women's subservient role in society. It limited women's autonomy and agency, forcing them to conform to specific ideals of femininity, regardless of their individual desires or goals. 
In conclusion, the 'passionlessness' debate was a fraught and complex issue that affected American society profoundly during the nineteenth century. It was a product of the Cult of True Womanhood and reinforced its central ideals of purity, submissiveness, and domesticity. Religion, medicine, and class played important roles in shaping the debate. The 'passionlessness' ideology intersected with issues of race and slavery and showed how social and economic factors can affect women's sexuality. While the 'passionlessness' concept could be liberating for some women, it was repressive for most and limited women's autonomy and agency, forcing them to conform to narrow ideals of femininity.
