Introduction
The Realism theory in International Relations (IR) assumes that the international system is anarchic and each state acts to maximize its interests, often defined as security and power. Consequently, the theory perceives the international system as one characterized by conflict, violence, and insecurity. While Realism puts emphasis on the state as the central actor in international politics, it often overlooks the importance of non-state actors, such as individuals and communities, and their relationships within the global system. Moreover, Realism's androcentric nature elevates male perspectives, values, and interests over women's viewpoints, needs, and rights. This essay will explore how the androcentric nature of Realism in international relations contributes to human rights violations.
Androcentric Nature of Realism
Realism, as a theory in international relations, and its androcentric nature have far-reaching implications on power relations and gender balance in the international realm. Androcentrism is defined as the systematic bias and privileging of men's perspectives, values, and interests in social, economic, cultural, and political systems. Essentially, Realism, as a male-dominated theory, places male experiences, understandings, and objectives at the center of the analysis (Enloe, 2016).
The Realist theory promotes the notion that the international realm is dominated by powerful male actors who are engaged in a constant struggle to maintain, expand, or create power at the expense of others. The theory posits that the state is the primary actor in international politics, and its central objective is to maximize power and security through following the principle of self-help. This principle implies that states must rely on their capabilities and strength to survive, thereby leading to anarchy, aggressive behaviors towards other states, and ultimately, conflicts and wars.
Realism's emphasis on power and security is a reflection of men's understanding of their role and function in society. In most societies, masculinity is associated with dominance, power, and control over resources. Therefore, men, who subscribe to Realism, tend to view the international system in masculine terms and interpret security and power through their own experiences, interests, and values (Tickner, 2005).
Moreover, the concept of national interest, which forms an essential aspect of Realism, is often defined and pursued based on masculine values, such as protecting national sovereignty, defending territorial integrity, and maintaining the balance of power. These values are often reinforced by instances of power and violence, which further perpetuate the androcentric nature of the theory (Tickner, 2005).
Implications of Androcentric Realism on Human Rights
Realism's androcentric nature has several implications on human rights, particularly women's rights. Women's rights are often sidelined, minimized, or outright ignored in Realism's analysis of international politics. This is because Realism views women and gender issues as insignificant or as peripheral at best in the international realm (Enloe, 2016).
One implication of Realism's androcentric nature is the promotion of patriarchal narratives and practices that perpetuate gender inequality, gender-based violence, and the violation of women's rights. Realism's focus on power and control often leads to the justification of violent or coercive measures as legitimate means to achieve foreign policy objectives. This is often reflected in instances of war, occupation, and intervention, where women experience various forms of violence, such as sexual violence, trafficking, and exploitation.
For example, the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 resulted in the displacement of millions of Iraqi women and girls who have been subjected to various forms of violence, including rape, abduction, and forced marriages (Arango, 2003). Similarly, the case of sexual violence against women during the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) demonstrates how Realism's pursuit of national interest at the expense of gender rights can have devastating consequences for women. In the DRC, women have borne the brunt of the conflict, with an estimated 48 women suffering rape every hour (Hochschild, 2012).
The androcentric nature of Realism also promotes the sexism and gender bias that are often present in foreign policy, diplomacy, and international aid programs. Such programs have often been criticized for ignoring the needs and voices of women and marginalizing them in decision-making. For instance, the US foreign policy of "War on Terror," launched after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, focused primarily on military intervention and coalition-building, while downplaying the impact of the war on women and children. The policy resulted in the displacement of millions of women and children, who were left without adequate healthcare, education, and shelter (Tickner, 2005).
Similarly, the International Monetary Fund's austerity measures, often utilized as a tool of economic coercion aimed at developing countries, have negatively impacted women's rights. The measures have led to the reduction of government spending on public services, including education and healthcare, resulting in heightened gender inequality and the violation of women's rights (Enloe, 2016).
Lastly, Realism's promotion of power and dominance as the primary objective of states has resulted in an increase in military spending, often to the detriment of human rights. Military spending has frequently taken the form of arms sales to countries with poor human rights records, thereby fuelling conflicts and human rights abuses. For instance, the US, the UK, and France were top arms suppliers to Saudi Arabia, which has been leading a campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, resulting in more than a thousand civilian casualties, including women and children (Mouawad, 2019).
Conclusion
Realism's androcentric nature has far-reaching implications for human rights, particularly women's rights. The theory promotes a patriarchal narrative that privileges male experiences, values, and interests, consequently sidelining the experiences and needs of women in the international realm. The promotion of power and control at the expense of human rights has led to devastating consequences for women, including increased violence, marginalization, and the violation of their rights. Therefore, there is a need to recognize the androcentric nature of Realism and to adopt approaches that prioritize gender equality and the protection of human rights in international relations. This can be achieved through the incorporation of feminist theories and by ensuring that women's voices are central in decision-making processes.
