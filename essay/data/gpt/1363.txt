Virgilâ€™s epic poem, the Aeneid, is an enduring masterpiece of world literature. It has been praised for its beautiful language, its poetic imagery, and its portrayal of the heroic journey of Aeneas, a Trojan prince who founds the Roman empire. Undoubtedly, Virgil wrote the Aeneid to celebrate Rome's greatness and the rule of Emperor Augustus. The poem reflects a profound sense of national pride that the author felt towards Rome, and Virgil uses Aeneas as a lens through which he promotes Rome's history, culture, and values. In this essay, I will examine how Virgil's portrayal of Aeneas as a hero reflects the underlying purpose of the Aeneid, to promote the greatness of Rome and Emperor Augustus, and what characteristics of Roman heroism Aeneas displays throughout the poem.
Virgil wrote the Aeneid, a continuation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, to glorify Rome and the greatness of the emperor Augustus. The poem is filled with themes of patriotism, imperialism, divine providence, and heroism. Through Aeneas's journey, Virgil weaves a grand national narrative that traces the origin of Rome and its destiny as a great power. The poet portrays Aeneas as a hero who, backed by divine support, establishes a new homeland in Italy and founds the Roman race. In this way, Virgil creates a heroic model who embodies the virtues of Roman culture and whose deeds celebrate Rome and its rulers, particularly Augustus.
The most basic attribute of heroism in the Aeneid is bravery. Aeneas is the quintessential courageous hero, who willingly faces danger and death for his cause. He is the leader of the Trojan army, who engages in a fierce battle to defend his city against the Greeks. He takes part in the confrontations that take place, and his bravery and determination inspire his fellow soldiers to victory. However, when Troy falls, and Aeneas's wife and son are killed, he is forced to flee with a handful of his comrades. Aeneas's courage is not limited to his military feats. He exhibits a stoic bravery that endures through his many trials and tribulations, including storms, shipwrecks, and battles. Aeneas never loses his resolve in his quest to establish a new homeland and to fulfill his destiny as a Roman hero.
Another aspect of Aeneas's heroism lies in his piety and devotion to the gods. He is a man guided by divine providence, who is tasked with fulfilling the gods' will. Aeneas is a favored son of the goddess Venus, who helps and protects him throughout his journey. Venus intercedes on his behalf with the gods frequently, and her intervention is often instrumental in Aeneas's success. Her divine presence is a subtle reminder of the gods' providential role in Roman history. Aeneas's piety is also seen in his reverence for the dead, as he takes the time to honor and respect his fallen comrades and the Trojan refugees who have died during their journey. Aeneas's piety and respect for the gods and the dead reflect the importance of such virtues in Roman culture.
Furthermore, Aeneas's heroism is expressed through his sense of duty and responsibility to his people. As their leader, he carries the weight of their destiny on his shoulders. He is aware of his people's plight and is always looking out for their welfare. When his companions become mutinous or despairing, Aeneas inspires them with his vision of a new homeland. Aeneas is always conscious of his mission, and his unwavering resolve helps his people through the darkest times. He shoulders the weight of responsibility, not only for his people's well-being but also for their safety and survival.
In addition, Aeneas embodies the virtues of courage, piety, duty, and responsibility, which are the hallmarks of Roman heroism. His persona is a composite of Augustan ideals, ideals of selflessness, courage, honor, and duty to the state. In the Aeneid, Virgil was not only projecting Augustus's ideals, but also painting himself as a poet and philosopher who promoted Roman values and culture. Aeneas is the quintessential Augustan hero, who embodies the noblest qualities of Roman civilization. He bases his actions on the need to do what is best for his people and for Rome, even if it means sacrificing his own desires and goals.
Furthermore, Aeneas's character reflects an essential Roman ideal of self-restraint. He is always in control of his emotions, never succumbing to excess, even in moments of intense pain and grief. His stoicism and self-control represent the virtues of the sober, disciplined, and law-abiding citizen. Aeneas always acts with reason and prudence, never allowing his emotions to cloud his judgment. The poet portrays Aeneas as a man of great intelligence and emotional constancy, who is able to navigate the complexities of political and military strategy with remarkable astuteness.
Finally, Aeneas is the embodiment of the Roman national myth. Virgil used the Aeneid to retell the story of Rome's origins, its conquests, and its future destiny. Aeneas is pivotal in this narrative, as he is the heroic founder of Rome. Virgil's portrayal of Aeneas as a hero speaks to the poet's vision of a thriving Roman empire under the wise and benevolent rule of Augustus. The poet believed that Rome's greatness lay in its ability to harness the strength, courage, and piety of its heroes and citizens. Aeneas, as a model of Roman heroism, represents the aspirational ideal that Rome wanted to project to the world.
To conclude, Virgil's portrayal of Aeneas as a hero reflects the underlying purpose of the Aeneid, which was to promote the greatness of Rome and Emperor Augustus. Aeneas embodies the heroic virtues of Roman culture through his stoic bravery, piety, sense of duty, and self-restraint. Virgil uses Aeneas's story as a lens through which he portrays Rome's history, culture, and values. Aeneas is the quintessential Augustan hero, who embodies the noblest qualities of Roman civilization. By weaving the epic narrative of Aeneas's journey, Virgil creates an enduring work of literature that celebrates Rome's past, present, and future. The Aeneid remains a testament to Virgil's commitment to Roman values and his belief in the greatness of the Roman race.
