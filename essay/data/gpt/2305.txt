Oestrogen is a hormone that plays a critical role in the development, differentiation, and growth of various tissues and organs. The actions of oestrogen are mediated through two distinct intracellular receptors, namely, oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and oestrogen receptor beta (ERβ). These receptors are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and bind to specific oestrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby regulating their transcriptional activities.
The oestrogen receptor (ER) is a transcription factor that is activated upon binding to oestrogen, leading to the recruitment of co-activator proteins that facilitate the transcription of target genes. Upon binding to oestrogen, the ER undergoes a conformational change that results in the dissociation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which keep the receptor in a latent state in the absence of ligand. The ER then dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to EREs in the promoter regions of target genes.
The binding of the ER to EREs initiates a series of molecular events that lead to the recruitment of various co-activator proteins, which facilitate the transcription of target genes. Among these co-activator proteins, three major groups have been identified: p160/steroid receptor co-activators (SRCs), p300/CBP family members, and the mediator complex. These co-activators enhance the transcriptional activity of the ER by facilitating chromatin remodeling, recruitment of the RNA polymerase II complex, and interaction with the general transcriptional machinery.
SRCs, for example, function as bridging proteins between the ER and other co-activators, such as p300/CBP family members and the mediator complex. They contain three conserved regions: a N-terminal region that interacts with the receptor, a central region that interacts with other co-activators, and a C-terminal region that has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. SRCs also recruit other HATs, such as p300/CBP, which acetylate histones to promote chromatin remodeling and facilitate the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II complex. Additionally, SRCs promote the interaction between ER and a number of other transcription factors that work together to activate target genes.
Another important group of co-activator proteins are the p300/CBP family members. These co-regulators interact directly with the ER and SRCs, as well as other transcription factors and co-activators, to regulate chromatin structure, histone modification, and gene transcription. P300/CBP family members have HAT activity, and they acetylate histones to relax chromatin and facilitate the binding of the RNA polymerase II complex. They also recruit accessory proteins, such as SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes, to change the chromatin structure and promote transcription.
Mediator is a large multi-protein complex that acts as an adaptor between the transcriptional machinery and the regulatory proteins, such as the ER. Mediator interacts with the ER in a ligand-dependent manner, and it is involved in many aspects of transcriptional regulation, including chromatin remodeling, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and transcriptional elongation. Mediator has been shown to interact with SRCs and p300/CBP family members, suggesting that it plays a central role in coordinating the activities of these co-activators.
Overall, the activation of ER by oestrogen leads to the recruitment of various co-activator proteins that facilitate the transcription of target genes. SRCs, p300/CBP family members, and the mediator complex are key co-activators involved in this process. These co-activators interact with the ER, promote chromatin remodeling, and facilitate the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II complex to the promoter regions of target genes. The coordinated action of these co-activators is essential for the fine-tuning of oestrogen-dependent transcriptional responses, and their deregulation has been linked to a number of diseases, including breast cancer. As such, understanding the mechanisms of co-activator recruitment and function in oestrogen signaling is critical for the development of novel therapeutics for these diseases.
