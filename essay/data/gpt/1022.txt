Marketing orientation is crucial for businesses, as it focuses on meeting the needs of the customer rather than just producing a good or service. Understanding customer and organizational buying behavior play a pivotal role in demonstrating marketing orientation. By understanding the buying behaviour of customers and organizations, a company can create strategies to promote its products and services to increase sales and profits. 
Consumer buying behaviour refers to the decision-making process that individuals go through while purchasing a product for personal use. The process involves different stages, including problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post-purchase evaluation. 
The first stage of consumer buying behaviour is problem recognition, which is when the customer realizes a need for a product or service. It could be a need for a replacement or an additional product for personal use. The second stage is information search, where the customer looks for information about the product or service from different sources, such as friends, family, online reviews, or specific advertising campaigns. 
The third stage of consumer buying behaviour is evaluation of alternatives. Here, the customer assesses the available options to determine which one best satisfies their need based on criteria such as quality, price, and convenience. The fourth stage is the purchase decision, where the customer decides to buy the product or service. Finally, after the purchase, the customer evaluates their decision in terms of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 
Organizational buying behaviour, on the other hand, refers to the decision-making process used by organizations when buying goods and services. The organizational buying decision model has six stages: problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, implementation, and post-purchase evaluation.
The first stage of organizational buying behaviour is problem recognition, where an organization realizes that they have a need to purchase a product or service. The second stage is information search, where the organization evaluates potential suppliers by gathering information on the available options and considering different factors, including price, quality, and reputation. 
The third stage is evaluation of alternatives, where the organization selects and compares the best product or service from the available list based on their criteria. Once a vendor is selected, the fourth stage of purchase decision-making occurs when the organization negotiates a deal with the chosen vendor. 
The fifth stage is implementation, where the organization integrates the new product or service into its operations. The final stage is post-purchase evaluation, where the organization evaluates its decision in terms of satisfaction of the purchase, including factors such as the level of service from the vendor and the overall quality of the product or service.
Various factors influence both buying decision processes. For consumer buying behaviour, these include psychological, personal, social, and cultural factors. Psychological factors are internal influences that affect a customer’s decision-making, including motivation, perception, and learning. Personal factors relate to the customer's personal characteristics, including age, gender, and income. Social factors refer to the social group’s influence, including family, friends, and culture. Finally, cultural factors refer to cultural or societal influences, including cultural values, beliefs, and norms.
For organizational buying behaviour, the critical factors that influence decision-making include organizational culture, decision-making processes, procurement policies, and budget constraints. Organizational culture can affect a company’s decision-making process, including the willingness to take risks and the acceptability of particular approaches. Procurement policies and budget constraints play a pivotal role in determining the organization’s purchasing power and its ability to negotiate a deal with its chosen vendor.

It is designed to highlight the stages and factors that cause changes in buying behaviour, ultimately leading to a purchase decision. The Dibb/Simkin model emphasizes the importance of evaluating the factors that influence buying behaviour, such as internal and external influences.
Fujitsu is an example of a company that has shifted from a product-led approach to a client-led approach to better understand its customers. Fujitsu is a leading provider of technology-based services and solutions for different businesses, institutions, and organizations worldwide. The company focused on understanding its customers and their business needs, which allowed them to better identify any issues their customers experienced and provide tailored solutions.
The shift to a client-led approach involved implementing a customer relationship management system, which allowed Fujitsu to gather customer data more quickly and efficiently. This data could then be analyzed to create tailored strategies for particular customer segments. This approach led to an increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately boosting sales and profits for the company.
In conclusion, understanding customer and organizational buying behaviour plays a crucial role in demonstrating marketing orientation. By learning about the buying process, its stages, and influencing factors, a company can concentrate on meeting customer needs and build customer relationships. The Dibb/Simkin buying pro forma provides a framework for businesses to analyze the underlying factors and influences that affect purchasing decisions.
