Since the 1960s, postmodern literature has revolutionized traditional notions of self and identity, inviting readers to consider the ways in which our subjectivities are shaped by social and cultural discourse rather than innate essence. From the fragmentation of narrative structure to the subversion of genre conventions, postmodern literature often challenges readers to reject fixed notions of self and embrace the fluidity and multiplicity of identity. In this essay, we will examine how postmodern literature challenges traditional notions of self and identity, focusing on two texts: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid by Rudy Wurlitzer and The Crow Road by Iain Banks. Through an analysis of language, character, and narrative technique, we will explore the ways in which these texts illustrate the postmodern rejection of fixed identities and the concept of the self.
One of the defining characteristics of postmodern literature is the rejection of established norms of narrative structure as well as the linear and logical progression of time and place. Postmodern authors maintain that these traditional structures rely on a totalizing view of the world, one that assumes a stable and consistent subjectivity and perspective. In contrast, the postmodern project destabilizes and problematizes these narratives, exposing how they are not only constructed but also mobilized for social and political purposes. These writers challenge the settled narrative with creating self-identity that promotes western hegemonic culture as the only viable worldview. Instead, they create playful, deconstructive, fragmented, disjointed texts that reject the notion of a singular, coherent narrative or worldview.
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kidfollows the story of Pat Garrett, a former partner of Billy the Kid, as he attempts to track Billy down after he escapes from prison. The novel is a prime example of a postmodern literary classic that deconstructs traditional notions of character. This is illustrated through the way that the text approaches the figure of Billy the Kid. Rather than attempting to create a concrete and stable sense of Billy’s identity, Wurlitzer intentionally muddles the reader's perceptions, often introducing the character as different names and identities. He appears not as a person with a fixed identity but as a collection of different representations, all of which call into question the stability of the concept of selfhood. For example, Billy’s identity shifts throughout the novel as he is referred to by different names, such as Bill and Kid, and described in different ways, such as by his appearance and actions. This fragmentation of identity challenges readers to consider how the self is constructed and to question the stability and coherence of the self.
Another way that postmodern literature challenges traditional notions of self and identity is through the use of language. Postmodern writers often challenge the idea that language can adequately capture or represent our experiences or thoughts about the self. Instead, they expose the power and limitations of language to create meaning, emphasizing the plasticity and malleability of words as tools of meaning-making. This can be seen in The Crow Road which explores the limitations of language to express the totality of human experience. Banks utilizes a number of stylistic techniques in order to reveal the constraints of language. For example, he frequently uses metaphor and other figurative language to explain events and experiences that cannot be easily or accurately conveyed through literal language. Additionally, Banks deconstructs the power of language to control and constrain meaning through metafictional elements in which the author directly addresses the reader and disrupts the narrative flow. This allows Banks to demonstrate the limitations of language to provide a complete and objective view of the world.
In addition to language, postmodern literature also disrupts traditional notions of character by engaging with cultural stereotypes and expectations of identity. The use of caricature and archetypes is one way in which this is accomplished. By exaggerating the features and characteristics of characters, postmodern writers challenge readers to consider how our perceptions of the self are shaped by cultural tropes and categories. In Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, for example, the character of Billy the Kid is often depicted in a way that emphasizes stereotypes of the Wild West, such as being a gunslinger, outlaw, and renegade. Wurlitzer’s novel examines the performative nature of gender and cultural identity by drawing on the caricaturist elements of Billy’s character, giving him a larger-than-life persona that challenges our assumptions about identity. By creating a caricature that leans into established stereotypes, Wurlitzer is able to draw attention to the constructed aspect of Billy’s identity.
Another way in which postmodern literature challenges traditional notions of character is through the use of multiple, fragmented narratives and voices. Postmodern authors often seek to represent the diversity and complexity of experiences through a shift away from the unified narrative voice towards multiple perspectives. The Crow Road, for example, weaves together multiple narratives and timelines, shifting between characters and settings every few chapters. This fragmentation prevents the reader from identifying a single, stable perspective and instead presents a range of perspectives and experiences. This fragmentation of narrative voice serves to reveal the various ways in which the self is constructed and explored while exposing the limitations of singular narrative structures.
In conclusion, postmodern literature has profoundly challenged traditional notions of self and identity. Through the use of fragmented narratives, language play, and caricature, postmodern writers draw attention to the ways in which the self is constructed through social and cultural forces. The texts Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid by Rudy Wurlitzer and The Crow Road by Iain Banks reconfigure identity in ways that destabilize traditional norms while creating a more inclusive understanding of selfhood. As such, postmodern literature has enabled readers to see the ways in which our identities are constructed through language, culture, and social expectation, offering a new vision of the self.
