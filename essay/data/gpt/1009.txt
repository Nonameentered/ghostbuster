Ren√© Descartes was a French philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy. Descartes is famous for developing several philosophical arguments that have profoundly influenced the development of the Western philosophical tradition. One of the most famous arguments developed by Descartes is his version of the ontological argument, which seeks to provide a proof of the existence of God. However, this argument has been challenged by the objection that 'exist' is not a predicate. In this essay, I will examine Descartes' version of the ontological argument and how this objection challenges it. Furthermore, I will analyze the effectiveness of the statement "I exist" in sustaining the conviction that existence is a predicate, and explore alternative arguments that refute associations of predication with the concept of existence.
The ontological argument is a philosophical argument that seeks to provide a proof of the existence of God based solely on the concept of God. Descartes' version of the ontological argument is based on the idea that the concept of God is a necessary existence, and hence, God must exist. Descartes argues that since God is an infinite, perfect being, he must exist since existence is a necessary attribute of such a being.
Descartes presents his ontological argument in his "Meditations on First Philosophy." In "Meditation III," Descartes states that he has a clear and distinct idea of God as a perfect being and that this idea cannot be derived from sensory experience. Descartes argues that since he has this clear and distinct idea of God, God must exist in reality. Descartes says, "I have taken it as my first rule never to accept anything as true that I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgments than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt" (Descartes, Meditations III).
Descartes' argument can be summarized as follows:
1. I have a clear and distinct idea of God as a perfect being.
2. This clear and distinct idea of God cannot be derived from sensory experience.
3. Therefore, the idea of God must have come from God himself.
4. Since existence is a necessary attribute of a perfect being, God must exist.
The objection that 'exist' is not a predicate challenges this argument. The objection argues that existence is not a characteristic of an object, but rather it is a condition of an object's being. In other words, existence is not a property that an object has, but rather it is a condition that must be met in order for an object to be considered as an object. Thus, existence is not something that can be attributed to an object as a property.
This objection to Descartes' ontological argument has several implications. First, it challenges Descartes' assumption that existence is a property that can be attributed to an object. Second, it undermines the idea that the concept of God as a perfect being necessarily implies existence. Third, it suggests that the ontological argument is based on a mistaken assumption about the nature of existence.
Despite this objection, Descartes maintains that existence is a predicate. Descartes argues that the statement "I exist" is a self-evident truth that serves as the foundation for all knowledge. Descartes says, "I am certain that I am a thinking thing; but do I not therefore likewise know what is required for me to be certain about anything? ...I who am thinking am absolutely sure that I exist" (Descartes, Meditations II).
The statement "I exist" can be understood as meaning that existence is a property of the subject that makes the statement. According to Descartes, when we say "I exist," we are affirming that existence is a property that we possess. Descartes argues that this self-evident truth provides the foundation for all knowledge, and that it establishes existence as a predicate.
However, some philosophers have challenged the idea that existence is a predicate. One of the most famous objections to this idea was made by Immanuel Kant in his "Critique of Pure Reason." Kant argued that the concept of existence is not a predicate because it does not add anything to the concept of an object. Kant distinguished between analytic judgments, which are true by definition, and synthetic judgments, which add something to the concept of the subject. Kant argued that existence is not a predicate because it does not add anything to the concept of the subject, and therefore it is not a predicate.
Kant's objection to the idea of existence as a predicate challenges Descartes' version of the ontological argument. If existence is not a predicate, then it cannot be inferred from the concept of God. The concept of God may include all sorts of desirable characteristics, such as perfection, goodness, and power, but it does not necessarily imply existence. According to Kant, existence is not a predicate that can be added to the concept of God, but it is a condition that must be met in order for God to be considered as existing in reality.
Another alternative argument that refutes associations of predication with the concept of existence is the negation objection. This argument points out that the negation of a predicate leads to a contradiction when applied to the concept of existence. If existence were a predicate, then we should be able to negate it by saying "God does not exist." However, this leads to a contradiction because the concept of God includes the attribute of necessary existence. Therefore, if we negate the predicate of existence, we are denying an essential attribute of the subject. This leads to a contradiction, which suggests that existence is not a predicate.
In conclusion, Descartes' version of the ontological argument has been challenged by the objection that existence is not a predicate. This objection argues that existence is not a property that can be attributed to an object, but rather it is a condition that must be met in order for an object to be considered as existing. Despite this objection, Descartes maintains that existence is a predicate and that the statement "I exist" is a self-evident truth that establishes existence as a predicate. However, alternative arguments such as Kant's distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments and the negation objection suggest that existence is not a predicate that can be attributed to an object. These alternative arguments refute associations of predication with the concept of existence and challenge Descartes' version of the ontological argument.
