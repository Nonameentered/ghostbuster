Thomas Hobbes is widely regarded as one of the most influential political philosophers of all time, known for his theories on the nature of society, the role of government, and the concept of political obligation. Throughout his works, Hobbes articulates a justification for political obligation that is both powerful and controversial, providing an insight into his contextual origins, theoretical nature, and inherent flaws and limitations. In this essay, I will explore Hobbes' justifications for political obligation, examining these key aspects of his philosophy.
Hobbes' contextual origins
First and foremost, it is important to understand the context in which Hobbes developed his theory of political obligation. Hobbes lived in a time of great political upheaval, marked by the English Civil War and widespread social unrest. In the midst of this turmoil, Hobbes sought to provide a philosophical framework that could help to stabilize society and prevent further conflict. Thus, his theories on political obligation can be seen as a response to the chaotic environment of seventeenth-century England.
Hobbes' theoretical nature
Central to Hobbes' theory of political obligation is the concept of the social contract. According to Hobbes, individuals come together to form a society in order to escape the state of nature, which he describes as a condition of "war of all against all." This state, he argues, is characterized by constant conflict and hostility, with every individual fighting for their own survival. It is only by signing an implicit agreement - the social contract - that individuals can create a government, which has the power to maintain order and preserve the peace.
In exchange for its protection, Hobbes argues that citizens are obligated to obey the government and its laws. He suggests that this obligation arises from a rational calculation of one's self-interest, as it is in the best interest of all individuals to follow the laws established by the government. Furthermore, Hobbes argues that breaking the social contract is a violation of the mutual trust that is necessary for society to function, and thus is inherently immoral.
 Inherent flaws and limitations
Hobbes' theory of political obligation, while powerful, is not without several inherent flaws and limitations. First and foremost, Hobbes' depiction of the state of nature as a condition of constant warfare has been heavily criticized by scholars. Critics argue that Hobbes greatly exaggerates the state of nature, and that his claims do not accurately reflect the historical or anthropological evidence.
Secondly, Hobbes' social contract theory has been criticized for its abstract, individualistic conception of society. In reality, societies are complex and multifaceted, shaped by a variety of economic, social, and cultural factors. Critics argue that Hobbes' theory fails to account for these complexities of actual societies, and that it relies too heavily on the idea of individuals as rational agents.
Thirdly, some scholars have argued that Hobbes places too much emphasis on the obligation to obey the government, and not enough on the government's obligation to its citizens. In other words, Hobbes' theory is focused solely on maintaining order and preventing conflict, without giving enough attention to the need for justice and fairness within the government itself.
Lastly, Hobbes' justification for political obligation has been criticized for its lack of consideration for the importance of moral autonomy. Critics argue that Hobbes' theory places too great an emphasis on external social pressures, and not enough on the ability of individuals to make moral choices for themselves. From this perspective, Hobbes' theory is seen as overly constraining, as it restricts the moral autonomy of individuals in favor of promoting social stability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Hobbes' theory of political obligation provides a powerful and provocative framework for thinking about the relationship between individuals and the government. Although his theory has several inherent flaws and limitations, it nonetheless provides a useful starting point for thinking about the nature of society, the role of government, and the obligations of citizens. Ultimately, the value of Hobbes' theory lies not in its absolute truth, but rather in its ability to challenge us and spur further debate and discussion.
