The supply-side macroeconomic debate between Keynesians and monetarists revolves around the shapes of the aggregate supply (AS) curve. The AS curve represents the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real output supplied in the economy. Keynesians argue that the AS curve is horizontal in the short run, while monetarists contend that it is upward sloping. This debate is crucial because it informs policymakers' decisions regarding the use of fiscal and monetary policy to stabilize the economy.
Keynesians believe that the AS curve is horizontal in the short run due to nominal wage rigidity. They argue that wages are sticky and do not adjust in response to changes in the price level. As a result, when the price level increases, firms are incentivized to produce more output to meet the increased demand at the same cost, resulting in a horizontal AS curve. Keynesians also point out that in a recession, demand deficiencies are the main cause of economic downturns, and that supply-side policies are ineffective in addressing them. Therefore, they advocate for fiscal policy measures, such as government spending and tax cuts, to boost aggregate demand.
Monetarists, on the other hand, argue that the AS curve is upward sloping in the short run due to cost-push inflation. They argue that when the price level increases, firms face higher costs of production, including labor and materials, which lead to lower profits and reduced output. This creates a positive relationship between the price level and output, resulting in an upward sloping AS curve. Monetarists also contend that demand-side policies, such as fiscal stimulus, are ineffective in the long run because they only lead to inflation without boosting real output. Therefore, they advocate for monetary policy measures, such as controlling the money supply, to stabilize the economy.
Moderate thinkers, such as neo-Keynesians and new classical economists, have challenged the extreme Keynesian model of the horizontal AS curve. Neo-Keynesians acknowledge the role of nominal wage rigidity in the short run but argue that it is not the only factor determining the shape of the AS curve. They assert that the AS curve is upward sloping in the long run due to workers and firms adjusting their expectations and behavior in response to changing economic conditions. New classical economists challenge both the Keynesian and monetarist models, arguing that markets are efficient and that any attempt to manipulate them through fiscal or monetary policy will only lead to unintended consequences such as inflation or a decrease in economic growth.
The different viewpoints on the shape of the short run AS curves have significant implications for fiscal and monetary policy. If the AS curve is horizontal, then fiscal policy measures such as government spending and tax cuts are effective in boosting aggregate demand and reducing unemployment. However, if the AS curve is upward sloping, then demand-side policies lead to inflation while doing little to increase real output. In this case, monetary policy measures, such as controlling the money supply, are more effective in stabilizing the economy.
The implications of the AS curve shape are also important when it comes to inflation. If the AS curve is upward sloping, then cost-push inflation can occur, where an increase in costs causes an increase in prices. In this case, fiscal policy measures such as government spending can lead to inflation without boosting output. However, if the AS curve is horizontal, then inflation is likely to be demand-pull, where increased demand leads to higher prices. In this case, fiscal policy measures can boost output without necessarily causing inflation.
The different viewpoints on the shape of the AS curve also have implications for economic growth. If the AS curve is horizontal, then monetary policy measures may not be effective in stimulating real output in the long run. However, if the AS curve is upward sloping, then controlling the money supply can lead to increased investment, which can stimulate economic growth.
In conclusion, the supply-side macroeconomic debate between Keynesians and monetarists centers on the shapes of the AS curve and has significant implications for fiscal and monetary policy. While Keynesians believe that the AS curve is horizontal in the short run, monetarists contend that it is upward sloping. Moderate thinkers have challenged the extreme Keynesian model of the horizontal AS curve, acknowledging the role of nominal wage rigidity but also the importance of adjusting expectations and behavior in response to changing economic conditions. The different viewpoints on the shape of the short run AS curves have implications for inflation, economic growth, and the efficacy of different policy measures, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying assumptions and mechanisms of macroeconomic models.
