Throughout the novel "The Joy Luck Club" by Amy Tan, the portrayal of femininity is a prominent theme that is explored in various ways. The novel is a moving portrayal of the complex mother-daughter relationships between Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters. Through the stories of these women, Tan examines the cultural differences between Chinese and American ideas of femininity, and how these cultural differences affect the way women see themselves and their relationships with others. Additionally, the novel also explores the contrasting portrayal of masculinity to femininity, which demonstrates the different expectations and roles placed on men and women in the novel's society.
At the heart of the novel's portrayal of femininity is the idea of "face," a concept deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Face refers to the public image that a person presents to the world, and it is considered highly important in Chinese society as it is linked to a person's social status and reputation. The "face" concept is particularly emphasized in the portrayal of the older generation of Chinese women in the novel, who prioritize maintaining appearances over personal desires. This is evident in the story of An-mei's mother, who sacrifices herself to save face for her family and uphold the family's honor after her husband's death. An-mei's mother's obedience to her husband's family and sacrificing her own happiness for the sake of her family highlights the idea of face and femininity.
In contrast, the younger generation of American-born daughters, such as Jing-mei, place less importance on face and more importance on individualism and self-expression. This contrast between the older and younger generations highlights the differences in expectations for femininity in Chinese and American cultures. While the older generation emphasizes the importance of maintaining social status and conforming to traditional feminine roles, the younger generation seeks to break away from these roles and find their own identities.
Moreover, the novel's portrayal of femininity in the relationship between mother and daughter is complicated. Due to the significant cultural differences between the characters, the mothers often struggle to connect with their daughters, who they see as too independent and lacking in respect for traditional Chinese culture. For example, Lindo struggles to communicate with her daughter, Waverly, who was born and raised in America and has adopted a more Westernized attitude towards femininity. Lindo expects Waverly to follow traditional feminine roles and hold up the face of the family, while Waverly seeks to assert her individuality and make her own decisions.
In contrast to this portrayal of femininity, the novel's representation of masculinity is centered around the concept of power. Through the male characters in the novel, Tan explores the ways in which power is granted and maintained in Chinese culture. The men in the novel are often portrayed as narcissistic, selfish, and abusive, as seen in the stories of Ying-ying's husband and Lena's husband.
The expectations placed on men in the novel are different from those placed on women, as men are expected to exert power and assert their dominance in both the family and the workplace. The portrayal of masculine power is demonstrated in the story of Jing-mei's half-sisters, who are raised in China and trained to be chess prodigies. The girls' father, who is also their teacher, is portrayed as being strict and domineering, emphasizing the importance of winning and having power over others. This portrayal of the father highlights the expectation of masculine power and dominance in Chinese culture.
Contrasting the portrayal of masculinity to femininity, the novel emphasizes the different gender roles that exist in Chinese culture. The men are expected to take on more dominant roles, while women are expected to be submissive and deferential to men. This contrast further emphasizes the differences between Chinese and American cultures, where the expectations for gender roles differ vastly.
In conclusion, the portrayal of femininity, as well as masculinity, is central in the novel "The Joy Luck Club" by Amy Tan. Through exploring the complex relationship between mothers and daughters from different cultural backgrounds, the novel highlights the differences in expectations for femininity in Chinese and American cultures. This contrast is further emphasized through the portrayal of masculinity, which is centered around the concept of power and dominance. Tan's portrayal of both femininity and masculinity portrays the different challenges that individuals face within their cultural expectations, leading to conflicts within families and individuals. Through highlighting these differences, Tan demonstrates the importance of understanding and respecting different cultural expectations.
