Henri Bergson's concept of duration is a pivotal concept in his philosophy. It is the cornerstone of his critique of the traditional metaphysical and epistemological positions of his time. Duration refers to the persistence of the past, which overlaps with the present and embodies the potential for the future. For Bergson, duration lies beyond the limitations of reason and concepts, and he sees it as fundamentally intuitive.
Bergson's distinction between two multiplicities, heterogeneity, and homogeneity, is significant in understanding his concept of duration. Heterogeneity refers to the qualitative differences that exist between two things, while homogeneity refers to the quantitative differences that can exist between things of the same nature. Bergson considers that the homogenous multiplicity, which is the domain of science and mathematics, is fundamentally different from the heterogeneous multiplicity, which is the domain of intuition.
However, the distinction between the two multiplicities is problematic, and there are difficulties in defining the exact relationship between them. Bergson characterizes heterogeneity as the more fundamental of the two, and he suggests that homogeneity arises from heterogeneity. In his view, the homogenous multiplicity is an abstraction from the heterogeneous multiplicity. 
But, the problem arises when Bergson argues that ultimately, the heterogeneous multiplicity is the only reality. Some critics argue that in making this distinction between the two multiplicities, Bergson is suggesting that the homogenous multiplicity has no reality or value. Others are concerned that the separation between the two multiplicities can lead to an oversimplification of the world, where the interpenetration between different states of consciousness is ignored.
The interpenetration of states of consciousness is a central description of Bergson's concept of duration. A state of consciousness, according to Bergson, is not a static entity but an ever-changing entity rooted in duration. A state of consciousness is a dynamic progression that emanates from within the individual, much like a stream of consciousness.
However, the second multiplicity that encompasses the homogenous multiplicity can create issues when trying to understand the interpenetration of states of consciousness. Bergson contends that the homogenous multiplicity embodies a fundamental flaw as an abstraction from the heterogeneous multiplicity. Consequently, the homogenous multiplicity omits the interpenetration of states of consciousness as it seeks to reduce them to an objective measurement.
Thus, Bergson's concept of duration challenges us to question how we can accurately measure and understand the interpenetration of states of consciousness. The complexity of duration seems to indicate that we need an alternative way to apprehend the dynamic progression of consciousness, but our culturally ingrained inclination for the homogeneous multiplicity presents obstacles.
Bergson's understanding of intuition and spatialization also offers some insightful perspectives on Kant's concepts of space and time. Kant describes space and time as pure categories or forms of intuition that we impose on the world to enable experience. Bergson shifts this notion to understanding intuition as a form of creative evolution that is externalized in the world. In other words, the external world has an inner life that is akin to our inner realities.
Bergson contends that space and time do not have independent existence; instead, they result from the development of the organism's faculties. The growth of the human mind is accompanied by a tendency to spatialize experience, reducing it from the reality of duration to the abstract object of space. The organism's growing consciousness leads to expanding structures of knowledge that try to manage space and time. In this way, space and time are challenges that we create to face the wider reality of duration.
In conclusion, Bergson's concept of duration is a critical concept in his philosophy, and his distinction between two multiplicities, heterogeneity, and homogeneity, is a key element that relates to it. Bergson's perspective on the relationship between these two multiplicities raises important criticisms. However, Bergson's understanding of intuition and spatialization sheds light on Kant's concepts of space and time in an insightful way. The development of the organism may impose limits on our engagement with duration, but it also contributes to how we interact with space and time, and that space and time are surrogates for understanding the essence of the dynamic progression of consciousness.
