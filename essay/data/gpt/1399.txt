Introduction
Archaeology is a field that studies human society through the material remains of its past. It enables us to learn about the daily lives, economic activities, social organization, and cultural practices of the peoples who lived before us. Archaeological research on the countryside and medieval villages has been a subject of study since the 1960s. The study of rural settlements and their economies has provided insights into the material culture, social organization, and wider economic and political contexts of medieval Europe. This essay aims to explore how the study of medieval villages and the countryside in archaeology evolved between the 1960s and the 1990s. It focuses on the developments in the themes, theories, and methods used in the study of rural settlements and how these were influenced by social, political, and intellectual factors.
1960s- 1970s: Archeology of Settlements and Villages
In the 1960s, archaeological research on the rural settlements and villages of medieval Europe was primarily concerned with the identification and excavation of sites, and the recovery of artefacts. The study of medieval art was on the rise as it was a period where art flourished, and archaeological exploration revealed important evidence since these rural communities were mostly farm-based, having a few artisans and traders. The emphasis was on exploring the chronology, architecture, and artefacts recovered and using them to infer the rural economy the area practiced and its relationship to the wider economy.
A significant factor of the 1960s was the boom of student activism and the increased dialogue on social issues such as gender, race, and class. It was due to this social awareness of social markers that archaeological scholarship began looking at the ancient data with a different lens, one that was more sensitive to how social markers affected the dynamics of an economical system. The period theory reflects a standard function-based approach and a focus on settlement patterns as evidence for wider social and political organization. Typology was the essential analytical tool used in this period, and scholars concentrated on the identification of building types, from farmhouses to barns.
For instance, the settlement pattern approach prevailed in Britain's landscape history that saw different types of nucleated, dispersed, and linear estates and villages types. Additionally, agricultural landscapes became a focus of systematic survey programs that helped identify spatial structuring of agricultural landscapes. These surveys were significant since they enabled archaeologists to understand the location and distribution of individual farms, which helped them reconstruct rural economies in terms of land use and agricultural productivity.
Other contributions of the 1960s were the excavation of sites such as West Stow (Suffolk), which provided evidence of a rural site from the 5th-7th centuries AD. West Stow was identified as an Anglo-Saxon settlement and was excavated between 1965 and 1972. Excavations revealed features such as timber houses, fences, pits, and many artifacts like pottery and metalwork. The West Stow excavations demonstrated the potential of rural sites as a record of epochal change, offering insights into the lives and activities of rural populations.
The 1970s was characterized by consolidation and expansion of knowledge and focus on the development of theories. The aim was to consolidate the data generated in the 1960s and to develop theoretical frameworks that could explain the patterns observed in the data. The late 1970s was a period marked by a paradigm shift that saw the emergence of feminist theory. The effect of gender on the archaeological record began to take the foreground; this was significant in the archaeological context because it pushed scholars to think about who is responsible for certain activities, such as cereal farming, which is often portrayed as men's work in medieval history.
1980s and 1990s: The Archaeology of Medieval Landscapes and Rural Settlements
The 1980s and 1990s saw the development of new research questions in the study of rural settlements in addition to the study of periods theory were factors from the general shifts as part of the academic structure. The focus shifted from the study of individual sites to the study of landscapes and how they change over time. The influence of economic factors such as class, politics, patronage, and gender was also clearly evident in the shift in focus from the study of buildings and furniture to more significant issues like peasant resistance, and social relationships within the context of the peasants' economic relations.
Archaeologists developed new methods and techniques to study landscapes. Remote sensing techniques such as aerial photography, satellite imagery, and geophysical surveys grew in popularity, especially for detecting landscape features that may have been missed during the ground-based survey. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology was used to create high-resolution maps of rural landscapes, providing new data on land use, settlement patterns, and environmental change over time. Reconstructions of rural landscapes based on remote sensing data allowed researchers to understand the development of medieval settlement patterns.
New archaeological theories emerged in the 1980s, which emphasized social theory as a means to understand the social and economic structures of rural societies. Archaeologists started to examine the structure of rural societies through an understanding of concepts such as social class, patronage, and status. Theory and methodology from related disciplines such as anthropology, history, and sociology were incorporated into archaeological practice. For instance, Marxist theory was used to investigate how economic relationships between landowners and peasants affected the dynamics of rural economies.
The impact of identity also came into the forefront as scholars began to study how identity markers of gender and ethnicity configured into the social organization of the rural settlements. While on this, social organization came into play such that the social function of the rural settlements became central and hence the use of household archaeology contributed to the study of medieval villas and rural settlements.
Sources and limitations
The study of rural settlements and medieval villages in archaeology was at one point limited by the limited sources of material objects that mimicked mobility of shelter, household from hour to hour. This limited the amount of information archaeologists could obtain about the socio-economic and cultural practices of the rural population and prompted scholars to use other sources of information such as written records to complement archeological data
Conclusion
The study of rural settlements and medieval villages in archaeology is a rich area for research, providing insights into the daily lives, economic activities, social organization, and cultural practices of the peoples who lived before us. From the 1960s to the 1990s, the field has evolved significantly in terms of the themes, theories, and methods used to study rural settlements, and the factors that have influenced this change are many, including social, political, and intellectual factors. Moving forward, the challenge is to continue to develop new theories and methods that can provide further insights into the past and help us to understand how people lived, worked, and interacted in rural environments.
