Supramolecular hydrogels are a class of materials that have garnered significant interest in recent years, particularly in the field of drug delivery. These hydrogels are composed of monomers that are held together by non-covalent interactions, leading to a three-dimensional network that is responsive to changes in the environment. The ability to control drug release from these hydrogels makes them an attractive platform for drug delivery, and recent advancements in this field have expanded our understanding of the non-covalent interactions between monomers and how they respond to environmental changes.
Firstly, let us briefly discuss what is meant by supramolecular hydrogels. Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks that are capable of swelling when exposed to a solvent, typically water. Supramolecular hydrogels, as the name suggests, are composed of monomers that are held together by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking. These interactions are weaker than covalent bonds, but they can still give rise to highly organized structures. These monomers can be designed to have specific properties, such as responsiveness to changes in pH, temperature, or the presence of specific molecules. When incorporated into a hydrogel, these monomers can act as gatekeepers, controlling the release of drugs or other molecules from the hydrogel.
The significance of supramolecular hydrogels in drug delivery lies in their ability to control drug release in response to changes in the environment. Traditional drug delivery systems typically involve the use of coatings or matrices, which can sometimes limit the release of drugs to a certain extent. By contrast, supramolecular hydrogels can release drugs in a controlled manner, avoiding the issues associated with burst release. Moreover, these hydrogels can be designed to respond to specific stimuli, such as a change in pH or temperature, allowing for targeted drug delivery. This is especially important in cancer treatment, where the selective delivery of drugs to cancerous cells can minimize adverse effects on healthy tissue.
Recent advancements in this field have expanded our understanding of the non-covalent interactions between monomers and how they respond to environmental changes. One such advancement is the development of dual-responsive hydrogels, which can respond to changes in both pH and temperature. These hydrogels are composed of monomers that can form a network through hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. When exposed to a change in pH, the hydrogen bonds are disrupted, leading to a change in the hydrogel’s structure. Similarly, when exposed to a change in temperature, the π-π stacking interactions are disrupted, leading to a change in the hydrogel’s swelling behavior.
Another important advancement in this field is the development of injectable hydrogels. Injectables have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they can be easily administered and can conform to irregularly-shaped wounds. Injectable hydrogels are typically composed of a solidified network of polymers suspended in a solvent. Supramolecular hydrogels, due to their ability to form networks via non-covalent interactions, can also be formulated as injectable hydrogels. These hydrogels can be used to deliver drugs directly into wounds, avoiding the need for invasive surgical procedures.
In addition to their use in drug delivery, supramolecular hydrogels have also found applications in tissue engineering. Tissue engineers have been using hydrogels as scaffolds for tissue regeneration for some time. These scaffolds can provide a platform for cells to grow and proliferate, leading to the regeneration of damaged tissue. Suppose we apply supramolecular hydrogels for tissue engineering in this scenario. In that case, we can incorporate cells and other biological molecules into the hydrogel network, allowing for greater control over the regeneration process. Furthermore, these hydrogels can be designed to respond to changes in the environment, leading to more efficient tissue regeneration.
In conclusion, supramolecular hydrogels are a significant development in the field of drug delivery due to their ability to offer targeted and controlled release of drugs. Recent advancements in this field have expanded our understanding of how non-covalent interactions between monomers respond to environmental changes. The development of dual-responsive hydrogels and injectable hydrogels illustrates the versatility of supramolecular hydrogels in drug delivery. Besides drug delivery, hydrogels are also widely used for tissue regeneration, especially supramolecular hydrogels, that can be applied in a more precise manner in tissue engineering. Supramolecular hydrogels have opened up new possibilities in drug delivery and tissue engineering, and further developments in this field will only serve to enhance the efficacy of these materials.
