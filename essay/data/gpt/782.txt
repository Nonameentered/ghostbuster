Introduction
Truancy, defined as unexcused absence from school, is a persistent problem in many educational institutions globally. Research indicates that truancy can cause poor academic performance, behavioral issues, and criminal involvement. Therefore, schools must adopt various strategies to tackle truancy as early as possible. This essay will highlight and examine the different approaches used to combat truancy in schools, including parental prosecution and the deployment of Education Social Workers. Additionally, the methodology used to research the effectiveness of the interventions will be analyzed, and the impact of information generated by the research evaluated.
Approaches used to Tackle Truancy in Schools
Parental Prosecution
Parental prosecution is a legal approach to solving school truancy. It involves taking legal action against parents whose children regularly miss school without a valid reason. According to studies, parental prosecution of truant students' parents is an effective way to reduce truancy. A study by the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention found that students whose parents are prosecuted for their truancy attend school more often. In the 2013-2014 school year, the El Paso Independent School District reduced truancy by 98% after successfully prosecuting parents of truants. This approach is effective because it places the responsibility of ensuring that their children attend school on the parents, who will face consequences for their actions.
However, parental prosecution of truancy has some drawbacks. Directing the full extent of the law at the parents can have unintended consequences such as deterring parents from engaging with the school or exacerbating existing financial difficulties. Additionally, parents may lack the necessary resources to keep their children in school, making prosecution shortsighted.
Education Social Workers
Another approach to combat truancy in schools is the deployment of Education Social Workers (ESWs). ESWs are qualified professionals trained to support children who face obstacles to learning and attendance. Essentially, they work with schools to identify children who are not attending school and develop interventions to get them back on track. Research shows that ESWs have a significant impact on reducing truancy rates. For example, City Year, a nationally recognized program, suggests that ESWs are effective in providing social and emotional support that enables children to attend school. Furthermore, a study by the UK's Department of Education on the impact of ESWs on school attendance found that ESWs increased the attendance of secondary school pupils.
However, despite the benefits of deploying ESWs, there are some limitations to this approach. Resources are needed to fund the hiring and training of ESWs, and the scope of their work is limited to the schools. There is also no guarantee that the social support offered by ESWs will be as effective as anticipated.
Research Methodology
To measure the effectiveness of interventions aimed at combating truancy, researchers use three key methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods. Quantitative research often focuses on the frequency of truancy, factors that contribute to truancy, and student attendance. Qualitative research explores students' perspectives on why they are not attending school and other factors that contribute to truancy. Mixed-methods research combines the quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of truancy and the effectiveness of interventions. 
The Impact of the Information Generated by the Research
The information generated by research into effective interventions for truancy has proved useful in designing policies and programs aimed at reducing truancy. For example, research findings on the effectiveness of ESWs are used to justify the investment in hiring ESWs in the schools. Additionally, research into parental prosecution has led to the enactment of several laws that penalize parents for not sending their children to school.
Summary and Analysis of Literature Review
In a study conducted by the United States Department of Education, it was found that truancy rates were significantly reduced when schools engaged in collaborative learning, such as adopting team-teaching approaches or creating small group activities for students. Additionally, the study suggested that schools could adopt more individualized approaches by making curricula more relevant to student interests and needs. Although this approach is effective, it requires that teachers have the necessary resources and training to create programs tailored to each student's needs.
Another study conducted by the University of Minnesota found that involving parents in their child's education leads to an improved rate of attendance. This is achieved through having regular communication with parents, including discussions of the child's educational and behavioral goals. Notably, the study concluded that parental involvement could be the ideal solution when the parents have adequate resources to support their child's education.
An article in the Journal of Educational and Developmental Psychology argued that the combination of awareness about the negative repercussions of truancy, coupled with ongoing counseling by trained counselors or psychologists, can be highly effective in reducing truancy. Such an approach is effective when it is targeted to address underlying causes of truancy, such as mental health issues, learning difficulties, or family problems.
Conclusion
Truancy remains a persistent problem in schools globally, requiring interventions to keep students in school. This essay highlighted various approaches used to tackle truancy, including different interventions and prosecutions directed at parents of truant students. The research methodologies used to study truancy and the effectiveness of interventions were examined alongside the impact of the information generated by the research. This essay concludes that both parental prosecution and the deployment of ESWs have proved to be effective, with the most effective approaches involving a combination of these methods. However, truancy interventions must be tailored to individual cases, incorporating case-specific approaches such as counseling and creating programs tailored to each student's needs to optimize effectiveness.
