Introduction
The European Union (EU) is a unique political entity that has a complex policy process involving multiple actors at different levels of governance. The multi-level governance (MLG) approach is a theoretical framework that seeks to explain how policies are developed through a networked system that involves actors at different levels of governance. This essay seeks to explore how the MLG approach advances our understanding of the EU policy process and how theories can be developed within this framework.
The multi-level governance approach
The MLG approach emerged in the late 1990s as a response to the limitations of the traditional state-centric approach to governance. It acknowledges that governance is not only limited to formal government institutions but also involves non-state actors such as civil society organizations, interest groups, and businesses. The MLG approach recognizes that policy-making in the EU is not a top-down process but a complex network of interactions between actors at different levels of governance, from local to regional, national, and supranational levels.
The MLG approach seeks to explain how decisions are made in a complex network where power is dispersed horizontally and vertically. The horizontal dispersion of power means that multiple actors with different interests and preferences interact with each other to influence policy outcomes. The vertical dispersion of power means that actors operate at different levels of governance and that the outcomes of decisions made at one level have an impact on decisions made at other levels.
The EU policy process
The EU policy process is a complex network of interactions between actors at different levels of governance. The EU policy process consists of several stages, including agenda setting, policy formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. At each stage, multiple actors at different levels of governance interact with each other, and the outcomes of decisions made at one stage have an impact on decisions made at other stages.
The MLG approach provides a useful framework for understanding the EU policy process because it acknowledges the complexity of governance in the EU. The MLG approach recognizes that the EU policy process is not only influenced by formal institutions such as the European Commission, Council of the European Union, and European Parliament but also informal institutions such as interest groups, civil society organizations, and businesses. The MLG approach also recognizes that policies are not only developed at the supranational level but also at the national, regional, and local levels. Therefore, the MLG approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the EU policy process than the traditional state-centric approach.
The MLG approach also highlights the importance of coordination and collaboration between actors at different levels of governance. The EU policy process requires actors at different levels to work together to achieve policy goals. This requires coordination and collaboration between actors at different levels of governance, which can be challenging due to the diversity of interests and preferences. However, the MLG approach acknowledges that coordination and collaboration are necessary for effective policy-making in the EU.
The MLG approach also emphasizes the importance of accountability in the EU policy process. The accountability of actors at different levels of governance is essential for ensuring that policies are developed in the public interest. The MLG approach acknowledges that accountability is not only limited to formal institutions such as the European Court of Justice but also informal institutions such as interest groups and civil society organizations.
Theories developed within the MLG framework
The MLG framework provides a useful basis for developing theories that explain how policies are developed in the EU. The MLG framework allows for theories to be developed that consider the interactions between actors at different levels of governance, the diversity of interests and preferences, and the importance of coordination and collaboration.
One theory developed within the MLG framework is the Europeanization theory. The Europeanization theory seeks to explain how policies are developed in the EU by considering the interactions between actors at different levels of governance. The Europeanization theory acknowledges that policies are not developed in isolation at the supranational level but are also influenced by actors at the national, regional, and local levels. The Europeanization theory also recognizes that policies are not developed in a single policy area but are influenced by policies developed in other policy areas.
Another theory developed within the MLG framework is the advocacy coalition framework. The advocacy coalition framework seeks to explain how policies are developed in the EU by considering the diversity of interests and preferences. The advocacy coalition framework acknowledges that actors at different levels of governance have different beliefs and interests, but these beliefs and interests can be grouped into advocacy coalitions. The advocacy coalition framework recognizes that advocacy coalitions have different levels of influence in the policy process and that policies are developed through a process of negotiation and compromise between these coalitions.
A third theory developed within the MLG framework is the collaborative governance theory. The collaborative governance theory seeks to explain how policies are developed in the EU by considering the importance of coordination and collaboration. The collaborative governance theory acknowledges that policies are developed through a collaborative process involving actors at different levels of governance. The collaborative governance theory recognizes that coordination and collaboration are essential for effective policy-making in the EU.
Conclusion
The MLG approach provides a useful framework for understanding the EU policy process. The MLG approach acknowledges the complexity of governance in the EU and the importance of coordination and collaboration between actors at different levels of governance. The MLG approach also provides a basis for developing theories that explain how policies are developed in the EU. The Europeanization theory, advocacy coalition framework, and collaborative governance theory are examples of theories developed within the MLG framework. These theories provide valuable insights into how policies are developed in the EU and help policymakers and researchers to better understand how to navigate the complex policy process.
