Introduction
The atom is the smallest building block of matter, yet it is incredibly complex and diverse in its composition and behaviour. The study of the atom and its properties has been a fascinating and challenging field of research for over two millennia. Some of the greatest scientists who have contributed to our understanding of the atom include Democritus, Dalton, Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr. In this essay, we will focus on the postulates of Niels Bohr's model of the atom and how they differ from Rutherford's model.
Background
In 1911, Ernest Rutherford conducted an experiment where he bombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles. He expected the alpha particles to pass through the foil without deviating from their path since they were tiny and had negligible charge. However, to his surprise, some of the alpha particles were deflected at large angles, while others were even reflected back in the direction from which they originated. This experiment proved that the atom was comprised of a positively charged nucleus at the centre and negatively charged electrons occupying space around it.
Rutherford's model of the atom
Based on his findings from the gold foil experiment, Rutherford proposed a new atomic model in which the atom had a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus at its centre, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons that were held in place by electrostatic attraction. Rutherford's model of the atom had two significant limitations:
1. Electrons were treated in the same way as planets orbiting around the sun - they revolved around the nucleus in fixed orbits without any explanation as to why they didn't spiral into the nucleus due to electromagnetic attraction.
2. Rutherford's model of the atom didn't provide any explanation for the emission of radiation, which was known to occur in certain elements.
Bohr's model of the atom
In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a new atomic model that built on the work of Rutherford. Bohr's model of the atom had several postulates that helped to resolve some of the issues faced by Rutherford's model.
1. Electrons occupy fixed energy levels or shells
Bohr proposed that electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed orbits or shells that were determined by the quantum number n. The energy levels in these shells were quantized - meaning that they could only exist at certain specific values of energy. Electrons in the first shell, closest to the nucleus, had the lowest energy, and each successive shell was at a higher energy level. Electrons in the outermost shell, also known as the valence shell, had the highest energy level and held the most energy. This theory led to the conclusion that electrons could only emit or absorb energy in quantized, discrete amounts.
2. Electrons change energy states by absorbing or emitting radiation
Bohr suggested that when an atom absorbed energy, such as a photon of light, an electron in the atom could move from its lower energy level to a higher one. Similarly, when an electron in a higher energy state lost energy, such as by emitting a photon of light, it would move to a lower energy state. This theory explained the emission of radiation as well as the spectral lines observed in the emission and absorption spectra of elements.
3. The angular momentum of electrons is quantized
Bohr postulated that the angular momentum of electrons in an atom is quantized. The angular momentum of an atom is determined by the mass and speed of the electron, as well as the distance from the nucleus. This postulate led Bohr to consider that only certain electron orbits were allowed, and this was dependent on the quantized angular momentum values.
4. Energy is absorbed or emitted when electrons jump between orbits
Bohr suggested that when an electron moved from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy difference was emitted in the form of a photon (emission). Conversely, when an electron was promoted to a higher energy level, energy was absorbed (absorption). Each photon of light has a frequency ν that is directly proportional to the energy difference between the initial and final states. Ε = hν, where E is the energy difference, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the photon.
5. Electrons do not emit radiation when they are in a state of stable equilibrium
Bohr suggested that the electrons in atoms could only orbit the nucleus in some particular orbits, and since these orbits represented states of stable equilibrium for the electrons, there was no emission of radiation. This postulate also explained how electrons could maintain their orbits without crashing into the nucleus.
Comparison of Bohr's and Rutherford's models
The Bohr's atomic model differs from Rutherford's in several key respects.
1. The concept of shells and quantization of energy levels
Bohr introduced the concept of shells, which Rutherford had not previously considered. Bohr also posited that electrons could only exist on distinct energy levels, which are quantized, unlike in Rutherford's theory, where electrons were treated like planets revolving around the nucleus.
2. Bohr's model provided an explanation for the emission spectra.
Rutherford's model couldn't explain the characteristic spectra of emissions from different elements, an area where Bohr's model excelled.
3. Bohr's model made predictions that could be experimentally tested.
The Bohr's model predicted the existence of an entire new level of the atom, whereas Rutherford's model didn't account for this phenomenon.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Niels Bohr's model of the atom was a significant advancement in our understanding of the atom, building on Rutherford's earlier model. Bohr's model provided a more comprehensive explanation of the atom's behaviour and gave rise to the field of quantum mechanics. By proposing that the electrons in an atom could only exist in certain quantized energy levels, Bohr's model provided a framework to explain both the absorption and emission spectra and helped to redefine our understanding of atomic structure. However, despite its achievements, Bohr's model had limitations and couldn't account for the behaviour of heavier elements and their complex atomic structures.
