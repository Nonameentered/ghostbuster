Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of numerical simulation that is used to design and solve fluid flow problems. It is a computer-based analysis tool used to simulate fluid flows and comprehensively understand the complex phenomena associated with it. The application of CFD is prominent in determining the behavior of fluids in engineering systems, making it a valuable tool for design optimization, safety analysis, and performance prediction.
CFD is based on mathematical models that are employed to solve the differential equations that govern fluid motion. The model can be divided into three main parts. The first part deals with the fluid geometry, which covers the identification of the boundaries and dimension of the fluid flow area being studied. The second part of the CFD model involves the definition of fluid properties, including the density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the fluid. The third part of the model is the governing equations, which summarizes the movement of fluid. The governing equation typically used in CFD is the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion and change of momentum of a fluid.
The process of CFD involves several techniques to solve fluid flow problems. The first step in the CFD process is modeling, which is the representation of the fluid flow geometry as a computational mesh. The mesh is the discretization of a domain into finite cells or elements with specific properties, which makes the problem solvable by computer algorithms. The second step of the CFD process is setting up a numerical model for the fluid flow system, where mathematical equations are used to predict the behavior of the fluid. The third step is the simulation process, where the model is solved iteratively using numerical methods. The fourth and last step is the visual representation of results using post-processing tools.
CFD is used in several sectors of the industry, including the aerospace, chemical and petroleum, automotive, and power generation industries. For example, CFD is used to analyze the aerodynamics of aircraft and optimize their fuel efficiency. In the chemical and petroleum industry, CFD is used to optimize the design of the reactor systems, improve the efficiency of distillation towers, and enhance process safety. In the automotive industry, CFD is used to optimize the engine system, improve aerodynamics, and assess the performance of tires. In the power generation industry, CFD is used to optimize the design of thermal power plants and the performance of wind turbines.
There are three methods used for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in CFD. They include finite volume, finite element, and spectral methods. Finite volume method is the most frequently used method in CFD for industrial applications. It works by dividing the computational domain into a mesh of control volumes, and the integral form of the governing equations is utilized to get solutions for all the control volumes. The finite element method is a flexible technique that provides high-accuracy solutions with the use of appropriate geometry. The spectral method is the least commonly used method, but it is widely used for turbulent flows, especially modeling the Fourier transform and decomposition of the solution.
CFX is a computational fluid dynamics software developed by ANSYS, Inc. for simulating fluid flow, heat transfer, and other related phenomena. It is widely used in the industry for solving complex fluid flow problems that can arise in many engineering applications. The CFX process involves building a 3D model of the fluid flow system geometry and assigning properties to the boundary conditions and fluid. Then, a mesh is created that partitions space into a series of 3D rectangles or hexahedral elements. The numerical approach is selected for solving the governing equations in the finite element framework. The solver creates a series of equations that describe how the fluids flow through the mesh. The equations are then solved, and the results are visualized using post-processing tools.
In this tutorial, we will walk through the creation of a static mixer geometry and refining the mesh to increase accuracy and resolution using inflated boundary layers. A mixing system is a type of flow system that is created to mix a fluid or fluids to create a homogeneous mixture. The geometry of a mixer is critical in the design phase of a mixing system. In this example, we will create a static mixer to mix two fluids.
The first step is to create a 3D geometry model using a CAD software. In this case, we will create a simple geometry that consists of two rectangular pipes with a set of baffles inside. The purpose of the baffles is to create turbulence and promote mixing of the two fluids as they pass through.
After creating the geometry, we will import it into CFX and assign properties such as density, viscosity, and temperature. The next step is to create a mesh, which is critical in ensuring the accuracy of the simulation results. We will create a mesh that accurately captures the geometry of the mixer. The mesh will be made up of small cells that cover the entire mixing system.
The third step is to set up the boundary conditions. We will specify the flow rates of the two fluids and the velocity and pressure at the inlet and outlet boundaries. We will also define the boundary condition for the baffles.
After setting up the boundary conditions, we will solve the problem iteratively using the finite volume method. We will specify the solver and the solution control parameters such as the time step. We will then start the simulation and monitor the progress of the solution until it converges.
Finally, we will visualize the results using the post-processing tools available in CFX. We will look at velocity, pressure, and temperature distributions in the mixer. We will also assess the mixing efficiency by looking at the mixing quality index. If the results are not satisfactory, we will refine the mesh by using inflated boundary layers to increase the resolution of the fluid flow near the walls of the geometry.
In conclusion, CFD is a powerful tool used in the industry for solving fluid flow problems. The CFD process involves modeling, setting up a numerical model, simulation, and visualization. CFD has applications in several areas of the industry, including aerospace, automotive, chemical, and power generation. CFX is a widely used CFD software developed by ANSYS, Inc.
