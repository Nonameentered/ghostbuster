There are two commonly used methods for estimating total aerobic colony counts: the spread plate and pour plate methods. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and various factors affect the precision of colony counts.
The spread plate method involves spreading a known volume of the sample on the surface of a solid agar medium using a sterile loop, spreader, or glass rod. This method is simple, rapid, and requires fewer materials than the pour plate method. However, it may lead to errors due to uneven distribution of the sample, incomplete coverage of the agar surface, or overlapping colonies.
The pour plate method involves mixing a known volume of the sample with molten agar and then pouring the mixture into a petri dish. This method allows for dilution and isolation of colonies, which can improve accuracy and provide an estimation of viable cells per unit of volume. However, it can be time-consuming, and the heat from the molten agar may affect the viability of some microorganisms.
Factors that affect the precision of colony counts include the type and composition of the agar medium, temperature and time of incubation, the size and morphology of colonies, and the presence of contaminants or inhibitors.
Colony counts/g or colony forming units/g (CFU/g) is a better indication of colony counts than total viable counts/g because it represents the number of individual colonies or viable cells in a given weight of a sample, which can reflect the concentration and diversity of microorganisms more accurately.
To confirm that colonies on VRBGA (Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar) are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, biochemical tests such as the IMViC (Indole, Methyl Red, Voges-Proskauer, Citrate uptake) test and the Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) test can be performed. These tests help to differentiate between Enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria based on their metabolic characteristics.
