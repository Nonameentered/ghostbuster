Post-modern poetry is a literary movement that surfaced in the late 20th century. Unlike modernist poetry, which was characterized by a fragmented and experimental form, post-modern poetry focuses on the use of popular culture, irony, and pastiche. The New York School of poets was a group that emerged during this time, creating a new approach to poetry that blended American and European influences while experimenting artistically. This essay will analyze the impact of the New York School of poets on the decline of poetry, with a specific focus on Frank O'Hara's work and the language and personal nature of his poetry.
The New York School of poets emerged in the 1950s and included a group of poets, including O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and James Schuyler, who were studying and working in New York City. The poets' work reflected a desire to bridge the gap between American and European poets and celebrate popular culture. Their poetry blended high art and low art, using references to classical literature, contemporary art, and mass media.
One of the defining characteristics of the New York School's poetry was its focus on language. The poets believed that language itself had power and that poetry was an exploration of the endless possibilities of language. The language used in their poetry was often colloquial and referential, reflecting the everyday language used in New York City. Their use of jargon, slang, and pop culture references made their poetry immediately accessible and relatable to their audience. In this way, the New York School of poets brought poetry back to its roots of being an art form that is accessible to all.
The personal nature of the poetry created by the New York School of poets was a radical departure from the formalist poetry that had dominated the literary scene before. Their poetry often included personal anecdotes, reflections, and commentary on their daily lives. This made their work seem more like a conversation with the reader rather than a highbrow work of art. This personal nature of the poetry also made it more relatable to the reader, as they could see themselves reflected in the poets' lives.
Frank O'Hara was a key figure in the New York School of poets, and his work is a perfect example of the impact that the movement had on poetry. O'Hara was a prolific writer who was known for his spontaneous, almost conversational style, and his ability to bring together seemingly unrelated images and make them meaningful. His poetry was personal and often contained references to his love life, friends, and daily experiences.
One of O'Hara's most famous poems, "Lunch Poems," was written during his lunch break at the Museum of Modern Art. The poem reflects O'Hara's love of art, with references to works by Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, and Willem de Kooning. But it also contains personal references, such as his mention of his love for Billie Holiday and his desire to get a haircut. O'Hara's poems were filled with these seemingly mundane details that made them relatable and accessible to his readers.
The impact of the New York School of poets on poetry was significant. The movement moved away from the formalism and elitism of modernist poetry towards a more accessible and personal form of poetry. The poets focused on language and the everyday experiences of their lives, bringing poetry back to its roots as an art form that is accessible to all. O'Hara's work, in particular, exemplified this shift, with its personal nature and relatable content.
However, the New York School's influence was also a factor in the decline of poetry. The personal nature of their work led to a confessional poetry movement that was criticized for being too self-indulgent and lacking in artistry. The focus on language also led to a style of poetry that often prioritized cleverness over substance. These criticisms are still debated, but the impact of the New York School of poets on the world of poetry cannot be denied.
In conclusion, post-modern poetry emerged as a literary movement that focused on popular culture, irony, and pastiche. The New York School of poets was a key group in this movement, blending American and European influences while experimenting artistically. The personal nature of their work and the focus on language made their poetry accessible to a wider audience and revitalized poetry as an art form. Frank O'Hara's work exemplified this shift, with its relatable content and personal nature. However, the New York School's influence was not without criticism, with the movement being accused of contributing to the decline of poetry. Nevertheless, the impact of the New York School of poets on the world of poetry cannot be denied.
