John Locke is famously known for his theory of knowledge, which emphasized the role of the mind in shaping our perception of the world. One aspect of this theory is his distinction between primary and secondary qualities of objects, which has been the subject of much debate and interpretation among philosophers. In this essay, I will explore Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities, his argument for the dependence of secondary qualities on perception for their existence, and George Berkeley's critique of Locke's theory and his arguments towards idealism.
According to Locke, an object has two types of qualities: primary and secondary. Primary qualities are objective characteristics of an object that exist independently of our perception of them. These qualities include features such as size, shape, motion, and solidity, which can be measured and quantified. Locke argues that primary qualities are inherent in the object itself and do not depend on the observer’s perception of them.
On the other hand, secondary qualities are subjective characteristics of an object that depend on our perception of them. They include features such as color, taste, smell, and sound, which are not inherent in the object but are rather caused by the way that the object interacts with our senses. Locke contends that secondary qualities do not exist in the object itself but rather in the mind of the observer.
Locke argues that the secondary qualities of an object are dependent on perception for their existence. He claims that an object does not possess any inherent qualities that enable it to produce secondary qualities in the mind of the observer. Instead, secondary qualities are produced when the primary qualities of an object interact with the sense organs of the observer. For example, the color of a flower is not a property of the flower itself but is rather a product of the interaction between the light reflecting off the flower and the visual system of the observer.
Locke's argument for the dependence of secondary qualities on perception is rooted in his belief that our minds are passive receivers of sensory information. He maintains that the mind does not actively impose its own ideas or concepts onto the world but rather receives sensory information and compounds it into complex ideas. In this way, the mind is a blank slate, or tabula rasa, upon which sensory information is impressed.
George Berkeley strongly disagrees with Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Berkeley, a prominent Irish philosopher of the 18th century, argues that the separation of primary from secondary qualities is false, and he offers a critique of Locke's theory of perception. He argues that all qualities of an object, including its primary qualities, are dependent on perception for their existence. In doing so, Berkeley critiques Locke's epistemology and ontology and presents an alternative view of idealism.
Berkeley asserts that Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities is an artificial one. He claims that primary qualities are just as much dependent on perception as secondary qualities. He argues that the concept of solidity, for instance, is not an objective property of an object, as Locke has suggested, but rather a result of the way that our sense organs interact with the object.
Berkeley's idealism asserts that all realities are mental, and the physical world is an illusion. Each human mind is a completely independent object that perceives the world uniquely. Therefore, Berkeley argues that the world we experience is a collection of ideas and not a physical embodiment that interact with us with an objective manner. Thus, he believes that everything exists only as we perceive it exist, i.e., subjective idealism.
Berkeley’s argument is that there are no primary or secondary qualities in the world, but only qualities that exist because we perceive them. Every interaction with the world somehow creates a perception in our minds, and therefore everything can only exist in our perception. This presents an issue of idealism because Berkeley contends that the objects that we see are not physical but mental. Therefore, they do not exist in an external world, but only in our minds. Thus, the world is a product of human observation and perceptions. 
Berkeley’s argument is based on the idea that material objects do not exist outside of perception. Therefore, the existence of objects depends not on an external world, but rather on the perception of that world. In this sense, he is rejecting the notion of a physical world outside of human perception, and argues that each human being creates the world for themselves due to their own perception.
In conclusion, John Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities of objects is a significant contribution to epistemology and ontology. His argument that secondary qualities are dependent on perception for their existence remains a subject of debate among philosophers. However, Berkeley critiques Locke's theory, and he suggests that the separation between primary and secondary qualities is an artificial one. According to Berkeley, the world we experience is a collection of ideas and not a physical embodiment that interacts with us objectively. Therefore, the world is a product of human observation and perceptions. Ultimately, this debate about the nature of reality and perception has continued to be a central issue in Western philosophy and continues to be relevant today.
