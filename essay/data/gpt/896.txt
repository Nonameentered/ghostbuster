When designing the layout of our site, our primary concerns were ease of use and an intuitive navigation system. We wanted our interface to be accessible and straightforward, allowing users to find information quickly and effortlessly. To achieve this, we conducted user tests and analyzed common user behaviors on similar sites.
We addressed usability by simplifying our site design, using intuitive icons and clean typography. We also implemented a search bar for fast and easy access to information. Navigation was addressed by creating a clear and logical structure that made sense to our target audience. We also leveraged breadcrumb navigation and provided clear labeling for categories and sections.
The site provides information about our business and its various services and offerings. The information is linked to typical user behavior by categorizing information based on what our target audience would be searching for. This includes things like pricing, service specifications, and testimonials.
Debugging was done using a variety of techniques, including manual testing and automated tools. We identified and addressed issues as they arose, ensuring the site's smooth functioning and optimal user experience. The site was run through multiple tests to ensure it met the coursework specification. We were able to implement all the facilities identified in the requirements and the end product performed excellently.
While the site currently performs well, there are some limitations. Our site is not mobile-responsive, which limits its accessibility for users on the go. To improve this, we plan to create a mobile version of the site or implement responsive design. Additionally, we could improve site optimization to improve load speeds and user experience.
In conclusion, designing a website that is intuitive and easy to navigate requires attention to detail and a consideration of user behavior. By implementing user testing and feedback, we were able to deliver a site that meets the needs of our target audience. Ongoing optimization and improvements will continue to make the site an essential part of our business strategy.
