The gearbox is a device that plays a critical role in the smooth operation of machinery. Its primary function is to transmit power from the prime mover to the driven equipment efficiently. The design methodology used in this report aims at creating a powerful and reliable gearbox for various applications, which will be the focus of this essay. The primary application of the gearbox is to transmit the power from a gasoline engine to a generator, which would, in turn, produce electrical power. 
For this design project, several factors were taken into consideration, including the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of the design. The first consideration was to determine the power requirements for the gearbox's intended application. The motor's maximum power output, which was calculated to be 10 horsepower, formed the foundation of the design. The second aspect considered was the materials to be used for the gearbox's components, keeping in mind the structural integrity and durability of the device. 
The design process started with determining the gearbox's gear ratio. This involved identifying the required gear train's speed ratio and torque ratio to achieve the desired output speed and torque. The gear ratio was relatively easy to determine as it solely depends on the prime mover and the generator's speed requirements. After determining the gear ratio, the next step was to design the shafts and bearings. The shafts had to be of the proper size and length to withstand the loads transmitted through them. The bearings, on the other hand, had to be designed to support the shafts adequately but reduce frictional losses. 
To build the gearbox, two parallel shafts were used, each with two spur gears. We chose spur gears as they are relatively easy to manufacture and efficient in transmitting power over a short distance. Helical gears, for example, are quieter, but they are more expensive and less efficient due to a higher surface area of contact. The first shaft was connected to the motor through a pulley and a belt. The belt's width was selected based on the systems' power requirements to prevent slipping or wear. The second shaft carried the driven equipment. The design of the axle and output shafts depended on the torque and power specifications required to meet the desired objectives.
The gearbox was then drawn in Solidworks, an advanced computer-aided design software that can simulate various engineering applications. In Solidworks, the step-by-step process of designing a gearbox begins with the creation of the sketches. Once we had created all the sketches, the gearbox components were extruded to create the 3D models. Since the gearbox was to be assembled and disassembled, the models had to be designed in such a way that it would be easy to swap out parts without causing significant damage. 
One essential aspect of designing a gearbox that is often overlooked is lubrication. Since gears are constantly in motion, they generate heat and friction, which, in turn, require lubrication. In this design, oil was used as the primary lubricant. We ensured that the gearbox design would include multiple oil channels, which would ensure that the oil circulated through every part that needed it, resulting in less wear and less thermal stress on the materials.
In conclusion, the gearbox's design methodology presented in this report focuses on creating an efficient and powerful gearbox for various applications, specifically for transmitting power from a gasoline engine to a generator. The primary considerations during the design process included the power requirements for the gearbox's intended application, the materials to be used for the gearbox's components, the gear ratio, the design of shafts and bearings, the creation of 3D models in Solidworks, and the incorporation of lubrication systems. The successful execution of this design methodology resulted in the development of a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective gearbox.
