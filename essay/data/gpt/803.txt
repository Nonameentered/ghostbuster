Introduction
Flow of fluids through pipes is a common occurrence in many industrial and engineering applications. The flow rate of such fluids is usually affected by frictional forces that occur within the pipe. Engineering calculations have been used for a long time to estimate these frictional forces. However, it was determined that most of these calculations were inaccurate, and a new approach had to be adopted. The aim of this investigation was to calculate the Darcy friction factor for oil flow in a pipe, and to determine the results of the experiment and what conclusions could be drawn from them.
Darcy Friction Factor
Darcy friction factor refers to the factor used to calculate the difference in pressure between two points in a pipe due to the frictional forces observed along its length. It is an important parameter because it determines the energy required to move a fluid through a pipe. The Darcy friction factor is usually calculated using the Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless parameter used to determine the nature of the flow, either laminar or turbulent. Laminar flow is observed at low Reynolds numbers, and turbulent flow is observed at high Reynolds numbers.
Aims of the Investigation
The main aim of the investigation was to calculate the Darcy friction factor for oil flow in a pipe using experimental data. This was aimed at determining the accuracy of engineering calculations in estimating frictional losses in a pipe. The other aim was to verify the effect of the Reynolds number on the Darcy friction factor and how other parameters such as viscosity and pipe diameter affect this factor.
Experimental Setup
The experiment was carried out using a 0.5-inch pipe made of steel, and a variable frequency drive pump was used to pump oil through the pipe. The oil used was a common hydraulic oil with a viscosity of 40 cPs. The pipe was fitted with pressure gauges at different points along its length. These pressure gauges were used to measure the pressure drop across the pipe, which was used to calculate the Darcy friction factor.
Several tests were carried out using different flow rates, and the Reynolds number was computed for each of these tests. This was done by measuring the flow rate, the viscosity of the oil, and the pipe diameter. The Reynolds number was calculated using the following equation:
Re = (ρVD ) / µ,
where     Re = Reynolds number
            ρ = Density of the fluid
            V = Velocity
            D = Diameter of the pipe
            µ = Dynamic viscosity of the fluid
The flow rate was varied by adjusting the variable frequency drive pump. Pressure gauges were fixed at different points along the length of the pipe to measure the pressure drop due to friction.
Results
The experimental data obtained was used to calculate the Darcy friction factor for each of the tests carried out. The results were plotted on a graph to show the relationship between the Darcy friction factor and the Reynolds number. The graph showed that the Darcy friction factor decreased as the Reynolds number increased. This was in line with the expected behavior of fluid flow in pipes. The graph also showed that the Darcy friction factor was independent of the pipe diameter and viscosity of the fluid.
However, the results showed that the Darcy friction factor obtained experimentally was different from the values obtained using engineering calculations. The calculated values were always higher than the experimental values. This was attributed to the presence of roughness in the pipe walls and fittings being used, which was not factored into the engineering calculations.
Conclusion
The investigation aimed to calculate the Darcy friction factor for oil flow in a pipe and determine the accuracy of engineering calculations. The results obtained showed that the Darcy friction factor decreased with increasing Reynolds number, and was independent of the pipe diameter and viscosity of the fluid. However, the experimental values obtained were different from the values obtained using engineering calculations. This was attributed to the presence of roughness in the pipe walls and fittings that was not factored into the calculations.
It can be concluded that the Darcy friction factor is an important parameter that affects the movement of fluids through pipes. However, engineers need to take into account the effect of roughness in pipes and fittings when calculating the friction factor. This can be achieved by either using more accurate engineering calculations or by carrying out experimental tests. The results of this investigation can be used to improve fluid flow calculations in various engineering applications.
