Introduction 
Economic anthropology is an interdisciplinary field that studies the complex relationships between economies and societies. Pre-capitalist exchange mechanisms represent an important area of research within economic anthropology, because they reveal the different ways in which social groups allocate and distribute resources in the absence of market economies. The main approaches to studying pre-capitalist exchange mechanisms in economic anthropology are gift exchange, barter, and redistribution. These approaches have been used to analyze the material transactions of different societies, such as Aboriginal societies in New Guinea and northwest America. This essay will examine some of the criticisms of these approaches, and will discuss the significance of the relationship between alliance, which contains concepts of solidarity and hostility, and the political transaction of primitive valuable. 
Gift exchange 
Gift exchange is a social process in which goods and services are exchanged without the expectation of immediate or direct return. It is a common mechanism of pre-capitalist societies, and it is premised on the notion of reciprocity. According to Marcel Mauss, who developed the theory of gift exchange in his book The Gift (1954), gift-giving is a symbolic act that involves not only the transfer of goods but also the establishment of social relationships based on mutual obligations. In other words, gift exchange involves the creation of social ties between individuals or groups who are bound by the norm of reciprocity. 
One of the main criticisms of the gift exchange approach is that it tends to essentialize pre-capitalist societies as homogenous and unchanging. This criticism is based on the assumption that gift exchange is a universal phenomenon that exists in all pre-capitalist societies, regardless of their specific cultural and historical contexts. Moreover, some critics argue that the emphasis on reciprocity as a norm of social obligation ignores the power differentials and inequalities that exist within pre-capitalist societies. For example, in some societies, gift-giving may be used as a means of establishing dominance and social control, rather than as a mechanism of reciprocity (Bourdieu 1977). 
To illustrate the gift exchange approach, the case study of the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands, off the coast of New Guinea, is often cited. The Kula ring is a complex system of gift-giving that involves the exchange of shell valuables between partner groups in a circular fashion. The Kula ring is characterized by a strict set of rules and taboos that regulate the exchange of valuables, and that ensure the creation and maintenance of social ties between the groups involved. However, critics of the gift exchange approach argue that the Kula ring is exceptional rather than representative of pre-capitalist exchange mechanisms, and that it cannot be used to generalize about all pre-capitalist societies (Strathern 1988). 
Barter 
Barter is another pre-capitalist exchange mechanism that involves the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money. Unlike gift exchange, barter is premised on the idea of equivalence, in which goods are traded for other goods according to their perceived value. Barter is often associated with subsistence economies, where people rely on traditional agricultural and craft skills to produce goods for consumption and exchange. 
One of the main criticisms of the barter approach is that it assumes a higher level of economic rationality than is actually present in pre-capitalist societies. In other words, the idea that goods are traded according to their perceived value implies a certain level of market calculation that may not be present in pre-capitalist societies. Moreover, barter assumes a certain level of scarcity, where goods are only exchanged when they are scarce and when there is a need for them. However, some critics argue that in pre-capitalist societies, goods may be exchanged for other reasons, such as establishing social relationships, paying debts, or ritual purposes, rather than for their market value (Sahlins 1972). 
The case study of the potlatch ceremony among the Kwakwaka'wakw people of the Pacific Northwest is often cited as an example of the barter approach. The potlatch ceremony involves the exchange of goods and services between different families and clans, and it is often used as a means of establishing status and social prestige. The potlatch is characterized by a certain level of competition and rivalry, where the hosts aim to outdo one another in terms of the value and quantity of goods exchanged. However, critics of the barter approach argue that the potlatch cannot be reduced to a straightforward exchange of goods, as it involves complex social and cultural meanings that are not reducible to economic rationality (Graeber 2001). 
Redistribution 
Redistribution is a pre-capitalist exchange mechanism that involves the centralization of goods and services by a central authority, who then redistributes them to members of the society according to certain criteria. Redistribution is often associated with chiefdoms and other hierarchical societies, where the central authority has the power to regulate the economy and to allocate resources according to social and political hierarchies. 
One of the main criticisms of the redistribution approach is that it assumes a static and unchanging society, where power relations are fixed and unalterable. This criticism is based on the assumption that redistribution is a top-down process that reinforces existing power relations and inequalities, rather than challenging or dismantling them. Moreover, redistribution assumes a certain level of cultural homogeneity, where all members of the society share the same values and cultural meanings. However, some critics argue that in pre-capitalist societies, cultural heterogeneity is the norm rather than the exception, and that redistribution does not necessarily address the diversity of cultural practices and values (Ferguson 1990). 
To illustrate the redistribution approach, the case study of the moka ceremony among the Hagen people of the Western Highlands of New Guinea is often cited. The moka ceremony involves the exchange of pigs and other goods between different clans, and it is often used as a means of establishing alliances and social ties. The moka ceremony is characterized by a certain level of competition, where the clans aim to outdo one another in terms of the quantity and value of the goods exchanged. However, critics of the redistribution approach argue that the moka cannot be reduced to a simple process of centralized redistribution, as it involves complex social and cultural meanings that are embedded in the wider social and political context (Keane 1997). 
Alliance, Solidarity and Hostility 
The relationship between alliance and economic exchange is essential to understanding pre-capitalist economic transactions. Alliances serve as the basis of solidarity or hostility and can determine the types of goods being exchanged in pre-capitalist societies. The Hagen people of the Western Highlands in New Guinea used pigs as a form of exchange in their economic and social relationships. Wealth was critical in establishing oneâ€™s status in the society. Hagen people exchanged pigs to form alliances, with the exchange of pigs representing both solidarity (known as "moka") and hostility (known as "payback"). 
In Hagen society, it was a common practice to gift pigs to form alliances. The gift must be paid back with interest, and the payer becomes obligated to return the gift with interest as well. This cyclical process often escalates over time, leading to an increase in the number of pigs exchanged and the richness of the gifts being offered. These exchange cycles solidified ties between the parties involved, creating a mutually binding obligation. On the other hand, the exchange of pigs via "payback" reinforced hostility between parties, often due to conflicts or other disputes. 
In the Pacific Northwest society, the potlatch ceremony determined the transfer of wealth and social status among the Kwakwaka'wakw people. The potlatch ceremony was a way for individual clans to exchange gifts and establish alliances while asserting their social superiority. Each clan was expected to outdo the others in terms of the number of gifts that they gave and their value. This process created an evolving cycle, similar to the Hagen people's exchange of pigs. The clan giving more extravagant gifts than the recipient signifying the recipient's inferiority. This cycle created hostilities between clans that may have been present, furthering the rift between them. 
Conclusion 
Pre-capitalist exchange mechanisms provide an insight into the economic systems and societal relationships of traditional societies. Gift exchange, barter, and redistribution provide a framework to understand different practices of exchange based on reciprocity, equivalence, and centralization respectively. The criticisms surrounding these approaches highlight the difficulty in interpreting and generalizing exchange mechanisms into a singular approach. It is essential to understand that economic exchange in traditional societies is more complex and embedded in the wider social and cultural context. Additionally, the relationship between alliance and economic exchange is crucial to understanding pre-capitalist economic transactions. Through the case studies of the aboriginal societies in New Guinea and northwest America, it can be seen that the economic exchange of goods and services often reinforces the notion of solidarity or hostility. Consequently, the material transaction serves as a basis for understanding the social and political relationships within pre-capitalist societies.
