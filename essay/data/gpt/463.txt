John Locke is widely regarded as one of the most significant political philosophers of the Enlightenment period. His second treatise of government, published in 1690, aimed to justify the legitimacy of government and the natural rights of individuals. In chapter five of the second treatise, Locke discusses the origins of property and natural property rights. He advocates for the unlimited accumulation of property, a position that is deeply contradictory, given the limitations on natural property rights, the effects of scarcity of goods, and the assumptions of capitalist wage-labour relations in the state of nature, contradicting the very basis of his justification of private property.
Locke's justification of unlimited accumulation is rooted in his argument about the origins of property and natural property rights. According to Locke, individuals have the right to acquire property through the mixing of their labour with natural resources. He asserts that the value of any property is derived from the labour used to produce it and, consequently, those who put in the most effort should, therefore, have the most extensive property rights. Property, according to Locke, is not just an economic good but also acts as a moral asset since it represents the product of one’s labour and leaves them free to dispose of it as they choose. It allows people to use and enjoy what they have produced or obtained, without interference from others. Locke maintains that the main purpose of government is to protect private property, which, in turn, guarantees individual freedom.
However, Locke's assertion of natural property rights is rife with contradictions. Firstly, Locke uses the concept of labour to justify the acquisition of property yet he fails to consider the fact that the disparity in labour used by different individuals towards the acquisition of property is not the same. For instance, he assumes that those who have access to more resources or capital will exert more labour and, by extension, deserve more extensive property rights. This assumption, in reality, fails to account for the reality of limited opportunities and finite resources. Not everyone can access a lot of resources to acquire extensive property, no matter how much effort they put in. The acquisition of property in this sense becomes a natural lottery, where some individuals enjoy a greater probability of acquiring more property than others, based on their initial allocation or access to resources.
Furthermore, Locke's notion of natural property rights in chapter five is rife with contradictions because he fails to consider the role of scarcity in the acquisition of property. In a state of nature, where resources are scarce, the acquisition of property by one individual necessarily limits the ability of others to acquire the same property. Thus, the right to acquire property is inherently limited, to create equality, and prevent the hoarding of resources by a few individuals. Locke fails to recognize this limitation in his conception of natural property rights, leading to an inherent contradiction in his position defending unlimited accumulation.
Moreover, Locke’s theory of unlimited accumulation is deeply rooted in capitalist wage-labour relations, which is problematic for its implications in the state of nature. Locke conceives the state of nature as a society where individuals are free from external controls and can pursue their interests, leading to competition and innovation. However, the reality of societies without external controls is that they are prone to exploitation. Capitalists in modern times use wage-labour relations, which allow them to accumulate as much capital as possible, by paying minimum wages while demanding maximum work output from their workers to increase their profits. This system creates a form of domination in the work environment, leading to an unequal distribution of resources. In a state of nature, the absence of external controls would create the conditions that facilitated the accumulation of property by a few individuals, creating exploitation, inequality, dependence, and ultimately, a state of war.
So how does Locke reconcile these contradictions in his argument and justify unlimited accumulation despite the limits on natural property rights? One approach is by interpreting Locke’s argument as not advocating for the unlimited accumulation of property in the absolute sense, but rather, a relative sense. The argument is that the distribution of property in society should be directly determined by the market and merit. The accumulation of property in society is limited by the property market, where value is determined by the ‘consumer’ rather than the supplier. The market, in other words, limits the accumulation of property by those who do not produce what society values. Locke seems to suggest that the accumulation of property in society is determined by a social contract, and countless parties who come together to agree on the goods and services that should be produced, and who will own, innovate, produce and consume them.
Additionally, Locke argues that the only legitimate way that an individual can own property in a state of nature is when it does not detract from the ability of others to acquire and enjoy their property. He contends that the acquisition of property in the state of nature should be regulated by norms of equity and natural law. This approach implies an ecological approach to the acquisition of property, emphasizing the need to balance the rights of all individuals to access resources necessary for their survival. Locke's ecological argument underscores the need to respect property rights, limit its accumulation, and protect common property in the face of the growing demand for scarce resources.
In conclusion, Locke's justification of unlimited accumulation in chapter five of his second treatise of government is fraught with contradictions. The origin of property and natural property rights contradicts the implications of scarcity in property acquisition, capital-labour relations in the state of nature, and the natural limitations on acquisition of property by individuals. However, Locke tries to reconcile these contradictions in his argument by suggesting that the allocation of property should be directly determined by market forces and merit, not by ownership or possession. At the same time, the ecological argument underpins the need to regulate the acquisition of property using the norms of equity and natural law, limiting the accumulation of property and protecting the common property in a world with ever-growing demand for resources. Ultimately, Locke's arguments for the natural property rights and unlimited accumulation must be evaluated in context, recognizing the limitations of his approach to the allocation of resources.
