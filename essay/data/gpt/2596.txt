Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, developed the theory of Forms, also known as the theory of Ideas. The idea behind this theory is that physical objects are not reality. Instead, objects in this visible world are only poor copies of the Forms, which are real and exist in a non-physical realm. Plato believed that for humans to achieve true knowledge, they must detach themselves from this visible world and understand the Forms. This essay will explore Plato's theory of Forms, its origin, and the main arguments that defend its existence.
Plato was born in Athens in the year 428/427 BCE and died in 348/347 BCE. He was a student of Socrates, a philosopher who focused on ethical theories. Plato's philosophy goes beyond ethics, and his most significant contributions were in the field of metaphysics; he crafted the theory of Forms. The concept of Forms draws from the teachings of Pythagoras, a mathematician and philosopher, who believed in the importance of numbers and patterns. Plato claimed that the objective of his theory was to achieve a better comprehension of the world, focusing on the nature of reality and the essence of knowledge. He aimed to have a philosophical investigation that explores the non-physical world and its connection with the tangible world.
The theory of Forms argues that the visible world is temporary, material, and in a constant state of change. In contrast, the non-physical world of Forms is eternal, immaterial, and unchanging. The Forms are like archetypes or ideal patterns that exist in a timeless, abstract realm, unlike the changing and shifting reality in the material world. Plato believed that the Forms represent the true reality. For instance, a triangle has three sides, and its angles add up to 180 degrees. The shape of a triangle in the physical world may differ due to their size, color, and orientation, but the Form of the triangle remains the same. Forms exist independently and can exist even if there is nothing to represent them. The Forms are unique and share no properties with the worldly objects that portray them.
The concept of the Forms relates to the idea of knowledge, as Plato believed the detachment from the material world was necessary to acquire true knowledge. Plato articulated in his analogy of the cave that people are like prisoners in a cave and do not see reality accurately because they only witness shadows. They only understand reality by the shadows cast because it is the only thing they see. Similarly, people who focus on the material world are also ignorant, according to Plato. They do not have a comprehensive understanding of reality because they only see a shadow of what is essential. Examining the world of Forms allows people to see beyond their limited experience and attain a greater understanding of the world.
Furthermore, Plato divides the world into two realms, the world of the physical and the world of the Forms. Individuals can only have knowledge of the world of the Forms by undergoing reasoning and contemplation. In contrast, the mind is incapable of accessing knowledge in the physical or tangible world. Plato suggested that the mind has the ability to recognize the Forms, and that is how people achieve genuine knowledge. However, nothing in the sensible world can have substantial knowledge; instead they can only have incomplete information of the Form it is imitating. Forms are absolute, unchanging, and eternal, while the physical world is relative, changing, and temporary.
However, the existence of Forms as a physical entity can be difficult to grasp, and the concept of a non-physical realm can be challenging to understand. Plato acknowledges this and tries to explain his theory in several dialogues, particularly the Phaedo, Symposium, and Republic. In the Phaedo, Plato uses the theory of recollection to explain that humans have knowledge of Forms, which pass to our soul before birth. These souls are assumed to have existed in the world of Forms, thus why a person can recognize the Forms ones they have undergone a recollection process. In the Symposium, Plato presents the idea that love is a desire for the life of the Forms, representing the desire to rejoin the essence of the Forms. Lastly, in the Republic, Plato uses the concept of knowledge as an essential component of rulership, claiming that Forms can be grasped through mental perception.
One of the main arguments for the existence of Forms is the argument from knowledge, also known as the Meno problem. In the dialogue Meno, Plato attempts to determine if virtue can be taught. Socrates leads the discussion and starts by questioning whether people already know about virtue or not. Meno, who argues that it can be taught, tries to provide an example of what virtue is, yet Socrates critiques each of his arguments. Socrates then presents his theory that the soul has prior knowledge of Forms that is then recalled to one's conscious mind. Socrates believes that people already have the ‘knowledge’ of virtue within their soul, but they are not aware of it, and thus prompts them to recollect this knowledge. Socrates argues that since people can recognize characteristic features of virtues such as justice without needing a mere example, but rather recalling concepts from the Form of justice, not from a temporary, physical experience, therefore proving the existence of Forms.
The Meno problem shows that knowledge cannot be obtained from experience but through recollection, acknowledging the prior existence of Forms in the soul. Socrates maintains that people do not learn new knowledge per se; they only recall what they once recognized in a different realm, demonstrating the existence of the Forms.
Moreover, the argument of the theory of Forms is consistent with the mathematical sciences. Mathematical theories, consisting of forms, present infinite examples that neither exist in reality nor in our experience, but they have their world of continuous, unchanging entities from which we derive all our knowledge. Mathematical objects cannot exist in the physical world; yet they are discerned and expressed in human language. Thus the knowledge of mathematics can only be grasped through logical reasoning, rather than physical experience.
In conclusion, Plato’s Theory of Forms is a significant component of his comprehensive philosophy. Plato uses Forms to provide a framework for comprehending the nature of reality and acquiring true knowledge. He argues that the sensible world is further from reality, and the Forms produce what we see in the physical world, representing an ideal pattern or archetype that we must grasp in our mind. The existence of Forms is supported by the protagonist in the Meno problem and demonstrated by the mathematical sciences. Although the theory of Forms may be hard to grasp, Plato’s attempt to rationalize the physical world suggests that true knowledge can only be obtained through the identification and comprehension of Forms.
