New Religious Movements (NRMs) refer to religious groups that emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century and are characterized by their unorthodox beliefs and practices. NRMs gained much attention and controversy, especially in the western world, following their emergence in the 1970s. The controversies and criticisms surrounding these groups were in large part due to the media and anti-cult movements that constructed NRMs as violent and dangerous. This essay explores the controversies and criticisms surrounding NRMs in the latter half of the twentieth century and how they were constructed as violent and dangerous through the media and anti-cult movements.
The controversies surrounding NRMs stemmed primarily from their perceived unorthodox and unconventional beliefs and practices. Many NRMs, such as the Church of Scientology and the Unification Church (Moonies), had their origins in Asia and the United States and gained significant followings in other parts of the world. These groups' beliefs and practices were perceived as deviating from the norm, and as a result, attracted attention from both mainstream media and religious organizations who were skeptical of their practices.
One such example is the Church of Scientology, which was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. The Church's teachings and practices included auditing sessions that purported to help individuals overcome negative experiences and become more emotionally stable. However, this practice was viewed by some as a form of brainwashing, leading to accusations of cult-like behavior. Another example is the Unification Church, founded by Sun Myung Moon, which emphasized the need for a global family under one true God. The Church's practice of arranged marriages and aggressive recruitment tactics also drew criticism and accusations of brainwashing and manipulation.
NRMs also faced criticism due to their charismatic leaders, who were often perceived as authoritarian and controlling. Leaders often had absolute power and were responsible for guiding the group's members' religious and personal lives. This emphasis on the leader's authority led to accusations of cult-like behavior, where individuals were required to follow the leader's directives without question. Jim Jones, the leader of the Peoples Temple, is an example of such a leader. Jones commanded absolute authority over his followers, ultimately leading to the 1978 mass suicide of over 900 people.
Moreover, there were accusations of mental and physical abuse in some NRMs. Many NRMs emphasized the importance of personal transformation and inward reflection. Still, some of the practices and beliefs of these NRMs were alleged to have caused psychological harm to individuals. For example, Heaven's Gate, an NRM founded in the United States in the 1970s, emphasized the need to shed their earthly human form to ascend to a higher spiritual realm. It led to a mass suicide of the group in 1997, who believed they had to leave their bodies behind to reach a higher state of being.
The allegations of mental and physical abuse are at the center of many controversies surrounding NRMs, leading to calls from the media and the general public for action to be taken to protect individuals from these groups. This led to the emergence of anti-cult movements in the 1970s, whose primary aim was to raise public awareness of the dangers of NRMs and provide support for individuals who have left these groups.
The anti-cult movements were instrumental in constructing NRMs as violent and dangerous organizations through their engagement with the media. These movements actively sought the media's attention to raise the profile of NRMs as violent and dangerous groups. The media's role in constructing NRMs as violent and dangerous is evident in the way they portray them in the news. The sensationalization, hostile language, and images of armed police raiding NRM compounds all contributed to the public's perception of NRMs as dangerous organizations.
Anti-cult movements and media also employed hyperbole and scare tactics to create a sense of urgency and danger associated with NRMs. This was most evident in the 1970s, following the Jonestown massacre, where members of the Peoples Temple committed mass suicide upon Jonestown's siege. The media portrayed the event as the culmination of a larger violent and dangerous trend among NRMs. This fueled public fears and led to greater scrutiny of NRM activities.
Furthermore, the anti-cult movements and media cast NRMs as 'brainwashing' organizations, manipulating individuals and recruiting them as cult members. This view disregarded the individual agency of members, reducing them to passive followers without autonomy or free will. This classification of NRMs as dangerous and manipulative organizations paved the way for legal interventions in the form of deprogramming.
Deprogramming refers to the process by which individuals are removed from NRMs through interventions designed to challenge the group's control over them. Deprogramming was based on the assumption that individuals had been brainwashed and required an extensive intervention to help them regain control of their lives. However, critics of the method pointed out that the process was illegal, often involved coercion and psychological abuse, and did not necessarily help individuals make informed decisions about their religious affiliations.
In conclusion, NRMs were subject to controversies and criticisms due to their unorthodox beliefs and practices, accusations of cult-like behavior, and allegations of mental and physical abuse. The media and anti-cult movements constructed NRMs as violent and dangerous organizations, leading to the public perception of NRMs. The media's sensationalist coverage of violent incidents and the deployment of scare tactics and hyperbole contributed to the stereotype of dangerous and manipulative NRMs. The portrayal of NRMs as cults further reinforced their perceived dangerous tendencies and, in turn, paved the way for legal and non-legal interventions aimed at countering the perceived threat posed by NRMs.
