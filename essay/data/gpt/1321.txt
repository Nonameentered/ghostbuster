Iron is an essential micronutrient that is necessary for several metabolic processes in our body. However, excessive consumption of iron can lead to health complications, such as liver damage, diabetes, and heart disease. Therefore, it is important to determine the concentration of iron in drinks, especially in fortified ones, to ensure safe consumption levels.
Two common methods to determine the concentration of iron in drinks are the calibration plot method and the standard addition method. The calibration plot method involves preparing a series of solutions with known iron concentrations and plotting the absorbance of these solutions against their iron concentration. The sample's absorbance is then measured, and the iron concentration is determined by extrapolating from the calibration plot. In comparison, the standard addition method involves adding a known amount of iron to the sample and measuring the absorbance of the resulting solution. By comparing the absorbance of the original sample and the spiked sample, the concentration of iron in the original sample can be calculated.
Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The calibration plot method is relatively easy to perform and requires fewer reagents and preparation. However, it assumes that the sample and calibration solutions have the same matrix and composition, which may not always be the case. In contrast, the standard addition method can correct for matrix effects, but it requires more time and reagents.
Atomic absorption spectroscopy is a commonly used technique to measure the concentration of transition metals, including iron, in samples. In this method, the sample is atomized using a flame or plasma, and the absorbance of the metal atoms is measured at a specific wavelength. The fuel/oxidant system used and the temperature of the flame can affect the atomization efficiency and, subsequently, the absorbance readings. Therefore, careful optimization of these parameters is necessary to obtain reliable results.
To calculate the concentration of iron in a given sample of a beverage, we can use the formula: Concentration of iron = (Absorbance of sample - y-intercept) / slope, where the slope and y-intercept are obtained from the calibration plot. For instance, suppose a sample of a beverage gives an absorbance of 0.530, and the calibration plot has a slope of 0.0045 and a y-intercept of 0.012. In that case, the concentration of iron would be (0.530 - 0.012) / 0.0045 = 116.22 Âµg/mL. If we know the concentration of Ammonium ferric citrate in the drink, we can calculate the amount of iron contributed by this compound and deduct it from the total concentration to obtain the iron concentration from other sources.
In conclusion, determining the concentration of iron in drinks is crucial to ensure safe consumption levels. The calibration plot and standard addition methods can both be effective, but their suitability depends on the sample's matrix and composition. Atomic absorption spectroscopy is a commonly used analytical technique for measuring the concentration of transition metals, including iron, in samples. Finally, to perform accurate measurements, careful optimization of the fuel/oxidant system and temperature is necessary.
