Growth kinetics is the study of the patterns of change in bacterial populations over time in closed cultures. The study of growth kinetics in bacteria has played a vital role in the field of microbiology as it allows for the quantitative measurement of bacterial growth, which in turn can be used to study bacterial physiology, ecology, and pathogenesis. The study of bacterial growth kinetics in closed cultures is a fundamental approach to understand the nature of bacterial growth and is based on empirical and mathematical evidence. 
Bacterial growth in closed cultures follows different phases, depending on the growth conditions, nutritional requirements, and cellular metabolism. The different phases of bacterial growth commonly include lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, and death phase. During the lag phase, bacteria adapt themselves to the new environment by synthesizing various enzymes and adapting to the environmental conditions, but do not reproduce. The exponential phase is characterized by rapid population growth as the bacteria have adapted to the new environment. During the stationary phase, bacterial growth slows down as the nutrient sources become depleted. In the death phase, bacterial population decreases due to nutrient exhaustion and accumulation of toxic waste products.
The study of growth kinetics in a closed culture is a robust method to understand how bacterial populations react in a completely controlled environment. The most common laboratory technique for studying bacterial growth kinetics is through serial dilution-plating experiments. In this technique, a small volume of bacterial culture is diluted in a series of progressively higher dilutions, and each dilution is plated on agar media. The number of bacterial colonies present on the agar plates is then counted, and the results are used to estimate the population of individual microbial species, allowing the calculation of growth kinetics.
In a recent study by Jane et al. (2021), the growth kinetics of nine different species of bacteria in a mixed culture were investigated to determine their composition. The research involved culturing nine different bacterial species on nutrient agar plates, followed by harvesting bacterial colonies using a sterile loop and then, suspended in saline solution. The bacterial suspension was thoroughly mixed, and the optical density of the bacterial suspension was calculated at 600nm using spectrophotometry. The optical density was used as an indirect measure of bacterial cell density in the suspension, with higher values indicating higher cell densities.
The bacterial growth kinetics were monitored daily over a period of five days using the plate-count method. The plate-count method entailed serial dilution of the bacterial suspensions in saline solution, followed by plating the diluted suspensions on nutrient agar plates. The nutrient agar plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hours, and the number of colonies counted. Using the colony counts obtained from the plate-count method, the bacterial growth kinetics were graphed as a function of time.
The graph of the bacterial growth kinetics for each bacterial species demonstrated different growth patterns during the five-day study period. The growth curve was divided into three phases; lag phase, log phase, and stationary phase. The lag phase of bacterial growth in each species indicates an adaptation phase of bacterial cells to the environmental components of the media. It often appears flat or low, with almost negligible growth. This is followed by the log phase, which is characterized by exponential growth, and the stationary phase, which indicates a plateau in bacterial growth or no growth due to exhaustion of nutrients. 
The growth curves of the nine bacterial species in the mixed culture were compared to the growth curve of pure cultures of each of the species grown separately. Analysis of the bacterial growth kinetics revealed that the nine bacterial species interacted with each other in the mixed culture, leading to a shift in growth patterns, with some species experiencing an increase in lag phase, while others had shorter durations. The results from the growth kinetics study indicated that the bacterial species in the mixed culture were not found in equal proportions. Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the dominant species while Staphylococcus aureus were less common.
To identify individual bacterial species from the mixed culture, conventional microbiological methods were used. Identification was based on colony morphology, Gram staining, and biochemical tests. The mixed culture was streaked on nutrient agar plates, and colonies were allowed to grow for 24-48 hours at 37°C. The colonies were then isolated and subjected to Gram staining and biochemical tests such as oxidase test, catalase test, and motility test. The results from these tests enabled the identification of bacterial species in the mixed culture.
In conclusion, the study of bacterial growth kinetics is an essential tool for studying bacterial population dynamics, physiology, ecology, and pathogenesis. The process of studying bacterial growth in a closed culture involves monitoring and graphing the different phases of growth, which helps to identify the growth patterns of individual bacterial species in pure cultures and mixed cultures. The results of the study can be used to identify the bacterial composition of a mixed culture and monitor changes in bacterial populations over time. The use of conventional microbiological practices such as colony morphology, Gram staining, and biochemical tests enables the identification of individual bacterial species from a mixed culture. The study of bacterial growth kinetics and bacterial composition from mixed cultures is a valuable tool that helps to broaden our understanding of bacteria and opens avenues for discovering new antibiotics and therapies.
