Slavery was a crucial aspect of the Brazilian economy from the moment of its discovery in 1500 and persisted until its abolition in 1888. Brazil had the highest number of enslaved Africans transported to the Americas, with an estimated 4 million individuals sold into slavery in Brazil. Despite being one of the last countries to abolish slavery, Brazil's history of slavery is unique and complex. Various factors contributed to the continuation of slavery, including economic interests and societal attitudes, while attempts were made by the Brazilian colonial society, including the Catholic Church and master class, to mitigate the oppressive nature of slavery. However, the notion of mitigation must be approached with caution, as slavery was inherently (and by design) an oppressive institution.
One of the primary factors contributing to the persistence of slavery in Brazil was its status as a major economic institution. Brazil's economy relied heavily on the exportation of commodities such as sugar, tobacco, and coffee, all of which were cultivated through slave labor.
The Portuguese Crown did not invest in the colony, and the responsibility for development and maintenance was left to private individuals and companies. Consequently, large landowners set up slave-based plantations to produce sugarcane, coffee, and other products that fueled the empire's economy. The plantations required a constant influx of slaves to remain profitable, and many of the slaves were used to work in gold and copper mines or on commercial plantations.
Slavery was also supported by the slave trade, where slaves were bought from African nations and transported to Brazil. The port of Rio de Janeiro played a significant role as the center of the slave trade, and the government invested heavily in the port's infrastructure to ensure a steady and profitable influx of enslaved Africans into Brazil.
Moreover, slavery was empowered by a lack of effective government control in Brazil. Brazil remained under colonial rule for roughly 300 years, with the Portuguese Crown ruling the colony from afar and appointing viceroys to govern in their place. This resulted in little attention given to the enforcement of laws and regulations aimed at mitigating the severity of slavery. Therefore, Brazilian society was more lenient regarding slavery, and as a result, slave owners had more power in the tropical nation.
In addition to the economic factors, societal attitudes also played a role in the persistence of slavery in Brazil. Many Brazilian leaders believed that slavery was necessary for the country to maintain its economic competitiveness, as the nation's economy relied heavily on slave labor. A Brazilian landowner who relied on slave labor remarked: "What we want are people who work, and the blacks work. Without them, it would not be possible to cultivate the land, to trade, and to produce."
Furthermore, Brazilian slave society existed in a state of "racial democracy," which was premised on the belief that there was minimal racial discrimination in Brazil. Historian Gilberto Freyre coined the term "cultural syncretism," which suggests that Brazilian mestizos (people of mixed European and African ancestry) were considered to be part of a distinct culture that valued both African and European traditions. This cultural syncretism leads to the belief that Brazilians were a "racial democracy" that embraced the diversity of its population, including the role of blacks and mulattoes in the country.
These attitudes towards slavery in Brazil contrasted with those of Britain, which abolished slavery in 1833. British society at the time looked down upon slavery and saw the institution as morally repugnant. Educated individuals protested against the institution and established campaigns aimed at promoting abolition. This led to the abolition of slavery in other colonies, such as Saint Domingue (Haiti) in 1794 and Barbados in 1834. In Brazil, however, slavery persisted, underlining the striking differences between British and Brazilian societies and their attitudes to the institution.
The Catholic Church played a notable role in mitigating the harshness of slavery in Brazil. The Church attempted to exert its influence by instructing priests and bishops to promote the idea of humane treatment of slaves and attempting to convert slaves to Catholicism. José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, a prominent anti-slavery activist and a Catholic theologian, argued that slave owners' Christian duty was to treat their slaves humanely.
One other example of the Church's influence in mitigating slavery's horrors came in the form of manumission, where slaveowners voluntarily freed their slaves. Many slave owners chose to sell or manumit their slaves, and often at the end of their owner's life, slaves would inherit property and become free. Over centuries, many slave owners had married, had interracial relationships, and had children with slaves, further complicated slavery's tolerance in Brazilian society.
Slave owners also attempted to mitigate the harshness of slavery by giving their slaves some free time to socialize, celebrate, and honor their African cultural traditions. Moreover, slaves in Brazil were allowed to form their communities known as Quilombos.
Quilombos were groups of runaway slaves that established hidden communities in remote areas. Slaves who had escaped captivity sought to create new ways of life, farming, and raiding. Their communities were well-organized with some even incorporating into their social structures a form of delivery system to rescue other slaves and bring them to the Quilombo. In contrast, slaves in America struggled to replicate the Quilombos due to the restrictive geography, distance from the plantation and the immense punishment they would face if they were caught.
Although the Portuguese never granted the slaves legal freedom or equal rights, the creation of Quilombos and their influence on Brazilian society allowed for the preservation of African culture and identity, a significant enabler of emancipation.
The various factors contributing to the continuation of slavery in Brazil have led to a complex historiography and differing views on slavery. Historians acknowledge that the harshness of slavery in Brazil differed in severity from the horrors associated with plantation slavery in Haiti, Jamaica, or the United States. Some argue that Brazil's culture of "racial democracy" did hold some truth, as it prevented the dehumanization of the enslaved people by associating them with African traditions and culture.
However, this view of mitigation can create problematic images of slavery and its severity, granting legitimacy to a wicked institution. Acknowledgments of efforts to mitigate the harshness of slavery do not diminish the institution's brutality, and both the oppressors and the oppressed were products of a system that placed one group above the other. 
Moreover, the violence of slavery cannot be overlooked, as it prevented enslaved individuals from living authentically as they were continually subjected to physical violence and torture. Brazilian slaves were also subjected to rapacious sexual exploitation perpetrated by the plantation owners and the patriarchal Portuguese community under their rule.
For instance, historian Sergio Campos says that Brazilian slavery was "modern slavery,", while historian Angela Davis disputes the notion that slavery in Brazil was any less painful for slaves, positing that slaves were worked to death on shorter timescales, resulting in an equal number of dead slaves each year.
In conclusion, slavery persisted in Brazil until 1888 due to a combination of economic interests, societal attitudes, and a lack of effective government control. The Catholic Church and slave owners attempted to mitigate the harshness of slavery, but the institution's brutality cannot be overlooked. The severity of slavery in Brazil remains contentious among historians, with conflicting images being portrayed in their publications. Nonetheless, slavery was an inhuman institution that stripped human beings of their freedoms and dignity, leaving a deep scar on Brazil that can still be felt today.
