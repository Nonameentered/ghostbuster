Gender and its socially constructed nature have been contested concepts for centuries as they shape our perceptions of what it means to be male or female. These constructions are often enforced through cultural norms and societal expectations, and individuals who do not meet them risk marginalization. The views of two middle-class, young and white informants on gender and its socially constructed nature are insightful of the diverse perspectives surrounding the gender debate. The informantsâ€™ views challenge some traditional gender roles and expectations while conforming to others.
The first informant is a 24-year-old white male who works in a tech company in the city. He believes that gender is a socially constructed concept with little biological basis. He opines that gender is determined by society's perception of what masculinity and femininity entail, which is enforced through cultural norms and conventions that inform how individuals behave and present themselves. He asserts that gender is a fluid concept that is influenced by various factors such as individual self-identification, cultural context, and socialization. He argues that society enforces restrictive gender roles that limit individuals' expression of their gender identity and restricts their access to opportunities or challenges based on their gender.
The informant challenges traditional gender roles by asserting that individuals are not confined to these roles and can choose to behave and present themselves in whichever way they feel comfortable. He also believes that men and women have equal abilities and should not be limited by outdated gender norms and expectations.
On the other hand, the informant conforms to some traditional gender roles by asserting that men and women are different and should be treated differently. He believes that certain roles are better suited to men, such as physical labor or leadership positions, while women are better suited to nurturing roles such as parenting or care-giving. These views reveal some long-held bias, stereotypical and negative attitudes of traditional gender roles. However, the informant remains aware that societal gender biases are harmful and detrimental to individuals faced with a restrictive gender spectrum of being only male or female.
The second informant is a 27-year-old white female who works as a teacher in a local high school. She believes that gender is a socially constructed concept that is influenced by multiple factors, including biological sex, socio-cultural norms, personal experiences, and self-identification. She subscribes to the view that gender is not binary but exists on a spectrum with various expressions and interpretations.
The informant challenges traditional gender roles by advocating for gender equality and the breaking down of restrictive gender norms and conventions. She argues that individuals should not be limited by their gender identity and should have equal opportunities to pursue their passions and aspirations. She asserts that gender roles are often forced upon individuals, and those who do not conform to traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity often face stigmatization, negative judgment or prejudice.
The informant conforms to some traditional gender roles by stating that women are often still relegated to caregiver roles, seen as emotional and nurturing, and that men are not encouraged to show their emotions or vulnerability. But the informant remains aware that societal gender biases are harmful, stigmatising, and impact individuals in diverse ways. She believes that everyone should have the freedom to express their gender identity, and that social pressures to conform to traditional roles, expectations, and stereotypes should be reduced or eliminated.
The informants share a common perspective on the socially constructed nature of gender. They believe that gender roles and expectations are learned through socialisation, reinforced by societal norms and expectations, and can limit the individual expression of one's gender identity. Both informants recognise that traditional gender roles and expectations have long upheld prejudices and stereotypes that prevent some individuals from thriving, while also upholding the power imbalances that exist between men and women within our society.
Overall, the views of these two middle-class, young, and white informants on gender and its socially constructed nature challenge some traditional gender roles and expectations while conforming to others. Both use their experiences and insights to resist enforcing gender bias and prejudice and advocate for increased gender equality. They recognise that challenging gender roles and stereotypes is a complex matter that requires ongoing dialogue and action within society and that a shared effort to eradicate gender bias is necessary. As we move towards more progressive understandings of gender identities and diversity, it is important that we value and advocate for all gender expression, ensure that our societal institutions are inclusive and supportive of gender diversity, and create a culture that values individual contributions beyond their gender.
