The dramatic monologue, a form of poetry in which a speaker addresses a silent listener, has been utilized by Robert Browning to great effect in his exploration of human psychology and societal issues. One such issue that Browning tackles in his poems My Last Duchess and Porphyria's Lover is the treatment of women in Victorian society. Through his use of the dramatic monologue, Browning is able to provide a window into the minds of his male protagonists and reveal their attitudes towards women. These attitudes suggest a society that valued women primarily for their beauty and decorative value rather than their intellect or individuality.
In My Last Duchess, the speaker, a Duke, is talking to the envoy of the Count whose daughter he is negotiating to marry. As he shows the envoy a portrait of his late wife, the Duchess, he begins to recount his feelings towards her. The duke speaks in a very grandiose and self-important manner, suggesting a sense of entitlement and ownership over the Duchess. The Duke comments on the Duchess's behavior, "she smiled, no doubt, / Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without / Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands; / Then all smiles stopped together." The Duke is suggesting that he became jealous of the way in which the Duchess was receiving attention. He does not want her to be looked at by other men, which is a clear indication that he feels as though she is his possession. The Duke goes on to say, "I gave commands so that one smile would stop, and this has caused her to stop all smiles, which would suggest that he had no problem with her smiling, so why does he hold this against her? The Duke has a very clear idea of the way in which his wife should behave, and he has taken possession of her in such a way that she is not allowed to be herself.
Porphyria's Lover is similar to My Last Duchess in many ways. In this poem, the speaker is a lover who has been waiting all evening for his beloved Porphyria to visit him. When she finally arrives, she is drenched with rain, and the lover takes it upon himself to take care of her. However, as the poem progresses, the lover's action becomes increasingly violent. He strangles her with her own hair, and in the final lines of the poem, declares that "God has not said a word." The similar aspect of possession is evident in this poem as well. The lover is so consumed by his love for Porphyria that he feels that it is his right to take possession of her and make her his own. In this poem, Browning is suggesting that the way in which men viewed women in Victorian society was highly problematic. Women were not viewed as individuals, but rather as objects to be possessed and controlled by men.
Both of these poems are very effective in conveying the treatment of women in Victorian society. In both poems, the male speaker is in a position of power, and he is using that power to take possession of his female companion. The speakers in these poems are both very self-important and grandiose, and they believe that they are entitled to the obedience and acquiescence of the women in their lives. Through the use of the dramatic monologue, Browning is able to convey the patriarchal attitudes that were present in Victorian society. The speakers in these poems are representative of the way in which men viewed women during the Victorian era. They believed that women were possessions to be controlled by men, and this is evident in both poems.
In conclusion, Robert Browning's use of the dramatic monologue in his poems My Last Duchess and Porphyria's Lover is highly effective in conveying the treatment of women in Victorian society. Through the voices of his male speakers, Browning is able to reveal the patriarchal attitudes that were present in Victorian society and the way in which men viewed women as possessions to be controlled by them. These attitudes are highly problematic, and Browning's poems shed light on the challenges that women faced during this time. Ultimately, these poems serve as cautionary tales against the objectification and control of women, and they invite the reader to consider the role that power and gender play in our lives today.
