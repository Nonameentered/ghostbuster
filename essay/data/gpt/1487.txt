Accor is one of the leading hotel companies in the world, with over 4,800 hotels and 25 brands spread across 100 countries. In the past five years, Accor has managed to adapt and manipulate its environment effectively to achieve its business goals. This essay will explore how Accor has managed to do this and what its business strategy will look like going forward based on its critical success factors and space of possibilities.
Adaptation is a vital process for any business, especially in the highly competitive hospitality industry which is subject to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. In the past five years, Accor has demonstrated a high level of adaptation in its operations, marketing, and expansion plans. One of the primary ways Accor has adapted is by diversifying its portfolio through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. For instance, in 2016, Accor acquired Fairmont Raffles Hotels International (FRHI) and added three brands to its portfolio- Fairmont, Raffles, and Swiss√¥tel. This acquisition added over 160 properties in 35 countries to Accor's network, allowing the company to increase its global footprint and cater to a more diverse consumer base.
Another way Accor has adapted is by investing in technology to improve its guest experiences. For instance, in 2018, Accor invested in a digital platform to provide customers with access to its entire portfolio of hotels. This platform called AccorHotels.com acts as a one-stop-shop for customers to search, compare, and book rooms, as well as interact with the hotels directly. This investment not only improved the customer experience but also helped Accor to gain competitive advantage and increase its online presence.
Accor has also been able to manipulate its environment by creating unique branding strategies. One of the most notable examples of this is Accor's 'ALL - Accor Live Limitless' loyalty program which was launched in 2019. The program is designed to provide members with exclusive experiences and benefits across Accor's vast portfolio of hotels, restaurants, and bars. This program has helped Accor to differentiate itself from its competitors and increase customer loyalty.
Accor has also been able to manipulate its environment by taking a proactive approach to sustainability and social responsibility. In 2018, Accor launched its 'Planet 21 - Acting Here' initiative which aims to reduce the company's carbon footprint, enhance water conservation, and promote responsible tourism. Accor's commitment to sustainability has not only helped the company to meet its social responsibilities but also helped to improve customer loyalty and attract environmentally conscious travelers.
Going forward, Accor's business strategy will continue to focus on its critical success factors and space of possibilities. Accor's critical success factors include diversification, technology, unique branding, and sustainability. One of the primary areas of focus for Accor's future strategy is technology. The company plans to invest heavily in technology to enhance the guest experience and improve efficiency. Accor will also continue to expand its portfolio through acquisitions and strategic partnerships to cater to a more diverse customer base.
Another critical area of focus for Accor's future strategy is sustainability. The company aims to become a leader in sustainable tourism by reducing its carbon footprint and promoting responsible tourism. Accor plans to achieve this through the implementation of energy-saving techniques, renewable energy sources, and eco-friendly practices in its hotels.
Finally, Accor will continue to develop its unique branding strategy through its 'ALL - Accor Live Limitless' loyalty program and other initiatives. Accor plans to provide customers with a personalized experience at every stage of their journey by leveraging data to provide tailored recommendations and promotions.
In conclusion, Accor has demonstrated a high level of adaptation and manipulation of its environment in the past five years.
