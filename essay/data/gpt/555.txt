Manufacturing strategy is a critical aspect of business operations that encompasses the plans, actions and policies implemented by a company to improve its manufacturing capabilities and competitive position in the market. It involves a systematic analysis of the companyâ€™s manufacturing processes, resources and capabilities in relation to the demands of the market, with a view to identifying how the company can strategically position itself for success. In this essay, we will explore the concept of manufacturing strategy, its role as a competitive advantage for companies, how companies can address human and organizational factors when implementing a new manufacturing strategy, the problems that may arise during implementation, and the use of tools such as Force Field Diagram and supplement strategies such as selection, training and development.
Manufacturing strategy can be defined as a plan or set of actions that a company undertakes to achieve its manufacturing objectives. It involves the alignment of the company's manufacturing processes, systems, and resources with its overall business strategy and market demands. The manufacturing strategy aims to optimize production and reduce costs, improve product quality and innovation, increase production flexibility and responsiveness, and enhance the company's ability to compete in the market. 
A company can use manufacturing strategy as a competitive advantage in several ways. First, a well-defined manufacturing strategy can help a company to produce high-quality products at a lower cost. By optimizing its production process and reducing waste, the company can control its costs, increase efficiency, and improve profit margins. Second, a manufacturing strategy can help a company to respond quickly to changes in market demands. By improving its flexibility, the company can produce products that meet customer needs and preferences, giving it an edge over its competitors. Third, a manufacturing strategy can help a company to differentiate its products from those of its competitors. By focusing on innovation and quality, the company can produce unique products that appeal to customers. Finally, manufacturing strategy can help a company to build and maintain a positive reputation in the market. By producing high-quality products efficiently, the company can establish a reputation for reliability and customer satisfaction, which can help to attract and retain customers.
However, when implementing a new manufacturing strategy, companies must address human and organizational factors to ensure that the strategy is successful. The success of a manufacturing strategy depends not only on technical factors but also the ability of the company to adapt to new ways of working. Human factors such as employee attitudes, motivation, skills, and expertise can affect the success of the new manufacturing strategy. Organizational factors such as communication, leadership, and management practices can also have an impact on the success of the strategy. For example, if employees are resistant to change, there may be a need for management to provide training and development opportunities to help them adapt to the new ways of working.
One tool that can help address human and organizational factors is the Force Field Diagram. The Force Field Diagram is a tool used to understand the driving forces and restraining forces that can affect the success of a new strategy. The driving forces are the positive factors that propel the strategy forward, while the restraining forces are the negative factors that hinder its success. By analyzing these forces, management can identify the factors that need to be strengthened or weakened to ensure that the strategy is successful. For example, if resistance to change is a restraining force, management can identify the driving forces that can help them overcome this resistance. Some of the driving forces may include training and development opportunities, clear communication, and incentives for those who embrace the new strategy.
Another strategy that can help address human and organizational factors is selection and training and development. Selection involves the careful selection of employees who are best suited to work in the new manufacturing environment. This may involve selecting employees who have relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. Training and development help to equip employees with the knowledge and skills they need to adapt to the new processes and systems. This may involve providing training on new equipment, processes, and quality standards. By investing in training and development, the company can increase employee satisfaction, engagement, and motivation.
However, implementing a new manufacturing strategy can also be challenging, and several problems may arise during implementation. One of the primary challenges is resistance to change. Employees may be reluctant to embrace a new way of working, especially if they feel that their job security is at risk. This can lead to a decline in productivity, morale, and job satisfaction. Other challenges include lack of resources, inadequate training, and poor communication. To overcome these challenges, management must communicate the rationale for the new manufacturing strategy to employees and provide them with the necessary training and support they need to adapt to new processes and systems.
One example of a company that successfully implemented a new manufacturing strategy is Toyota. Toyota's manufacturing strategy is centered on the concept of Lean manufacturing, which involves minimizing waste and improving efficiency. One of the keys to Toyota's success was its focus on employee involvement. Toyota encouraged its employees to contribute ideas and participate in decision-making, which helped to foster a culture of continuous improvement. The company also invested in training and development for its employees to ensure that they had the necessary skills and expertise to work efficiently.
In conclusion, manufacturing strategy is a critical aspect of business operations that can be used as a competitive advantage in the market. A well-defined manufacturing strategy can help companies to reduce costs, improve product quality and innovation, increase production flexibility and responsiveness, and build a positive reputation in the market. However, to ensure that a new manufacturing strategy is successful, companies must address human and organizational factors, such as employee attitudes, motivation, skills, and expertise. Tools such as the Force Field Diagram can help to identify the driving forces and restraining forces that can affect the success of the strategy. Supplement strategies such as selection and training and development can equip employees with the knowledge and skills they need to adapt to the new ways of working. While there may be challenges during implementation, by investing in its people and processes, a company can successfully implement a new manufacturing strategy and gain a competitive advantage in the market.
