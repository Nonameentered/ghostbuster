Hunter-gatherer societies are among the earliest human communities that existed in prehistoric times. These societies relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering to secure their livelihood. The study of prehistoric hunter-gatherer subsistence has gained significant attention among archaeologists and scholars in recent years. One of the primary ways in which we can understand the subsistence patterns of these societies is through the analysis of osteological refuse hunting methods and site function. In this essay, we will examine the evidence for prehistoric subsistence, evaluate the importance of site function in identifying simple and complex societies, and finally, explore the role of animals in providing insight into hunting strategies and the season of occupation, using examples such as Star Carr, Ohalo II, and Lepenski Vir.
Prehistoric hunter-gatherers were skilled hunters and gatherers who relied on wild plants and animals for food. Archaeological evidence from various sites suggests that prehistoric hunter-gatherers relied on hunting and fishing more than on gathering for their subsistence needs. The discovery of animal remains at various sites is one of the primary ways in which we can understand the subsistence patterns of these societies. The analysis of animal remains provides information on the kinds of animals that were hunted and consumed, bones that were used for tools and weapons, and those that were discarded or unused.
Osteological refuse hunting methods are an essential part of this analysis. They involve the micro and macroscopic analysis of animal bones recovered from archaeological sites. The study of these bones can help identify species, age, sex, and size of the animals. It could also provide evidence for the hunting methods used by prehistoric societies, such as hunting traps, weapons like arrows, and spears. For instance, the discovery of large animal bones with clear cut marks on them suggests that the animals were hunted for their meat. Similarly, the presence of bird remains and fish bones at a site suggests that hunting and fishing played a critical role in prehistoric subsistence.
Site function is another critical factor to consider when studying prehistoric hunter-gatherer subsistence. The function of the site helps identify the complexity of the society that inhabited it. For instance, small, scattered campsites with simple shelters usually indicate simple societies of small groups of people, with low levels of social complexity. In contrast, complex societies have larger structures indicating organized spaces for living and working. 
Case studies such as Star Carr, Ohalo II, and Lepenski Vir demonstrate the importance of site function and refuse hunting methods. Star Carr, located in northern England, is a waterlogged site that dates back to approximately 10,000 years ago. The site contains evidence of a small campsite with huts near a lake. Analysis of the remains found at the site revealed a subsistence pattern based on hunting, fishing, and the use of water plants. The researchers also found arrangements of large antlers, suggesting their use to build structures or hunting traps.
Ohalo II is a semi-subterranean site in Israel, dating back to approximately 23,000 years ago. The site consists of several circular huts that contained evidence of a sedentary culture focused on plant and animal collection. Analysis of the animal bones found at the site suggests that hunting played a comparatively minor role in the subsistence of this society. However, the remains of a variety of animals suggest the existence of a diverse environment.
Lepenski Vir is a site located in Serbia and dates back to approximately 9,000 years ago. The site contains riverside huts and a substantial number of fish bones, suggesting that fishing played an essential role in the subsistence of this society. The remains of large mammals suggest hunting with nets, bows, and arrows.
Another method of understanding hunting strategies and the season of occupation is by studying the age and season of death of the animals. By studying animal remains, researchers can identify the season of death, which can reveal important insights into the life cycle of the animals and the availability of resources. For example, the presence of juvenile or newborn animals can indicate spring or summer hunting, while the presence of more adult animals could indicate hunting in the fall or winter. This data would provide valuable evidence of hunting season, which in turn provides an indication of when the society was most occupied and when resources were most abundant.
In conclusion, prehistoric hunter-gatherers were skilled hunters and gatherers who relied on hunting and fishing more than gathering from the natural environment for their subsistence needs. Osteological refuse hunting methods and site function were essential in the study of the subsistence of these societies. The evidence collected from the study of sites such as Star Carr, Ohalo II, and Lepenski Vir have revealed insights into the subsistence patterns of prehistoric societies. Additionally, the study of the age and season of death of animals has provided crucial evidence of hunting strategies and the season of occupation. These findings have contributed significantly to our understanding of the lifestyles and subsistence of prehistoric societies.
