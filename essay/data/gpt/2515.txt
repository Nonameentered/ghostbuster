The osteological collections recovered from Hulton Abbey provide evidence of various pathological conditions, including dental caries, osteoarthritis, and periostitis. These conditions can be identified through the analysis of skeletal remains, which show changes in bone structure and density. Age determination can be made through the examination of dental and skeletal development, while sex determination involves analysis of specific skeletal features such as the pelvis and skull morphology. Height estimation can be made by analyzing the length of long bones such as the femur and tibia, in relation to established height standards. Overall, the osteological collections from Hulton Abbey provide valuable insights into the lives and health of individuals who lived in the medieval period.
