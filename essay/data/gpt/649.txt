Cosmopolitanism is a philosophy that suggests that all humans belong to one shared community. The idea of cosmopolitanism challenges the nation-state system that separates people based on their geographic boundaries and their respective nationalities. According to cosmopolitanism, all humans share the same ethical values, and, as a result, every individual deserves equal protection of their rights, regardless of their geographical location. However, as globalisation has evolved, the debate on the possibility of cosmopolitanism, and whether it is feasible in a globalised world, has escalated. The concept of cosmopolitanism faces significant challenges, both from ethical dilemmas inherent in moral universalism and within the institutional dimensions of cosmopolitan democracy. This essay will discuss the main arguments for and against cosmopolitanism's feasibility in a globalised world. I will then examine how ethical dilemmas pose a challenge to the concept of cosmopolitanism, and finally, assess whether the focus on the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism neglects its ethical dimension, resulting in a need to rethink the concepts of political community and democracy.
One of the most persuasive arguments for cosmopolitanism's feasibility in a globalised world is the development in technology and the creation of mass communication channels. Globalisation has resulted in the ability to connect to each other from different parts of the world, enabling individuals to share their experiences, cultures, and beliefs. This connectivity has also resulted in a reduction of the geographical barriers that used to create distance and differences between countries. Technology is slowly infiltrating almost all parts of the world and is increasingly making their occupants more connected. For example, social media platforms and instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook have enabled individuals to connect with others globally, regardless of their geographical location, cultural or religious differences, economic status or nationality.
Moreover, the growth of globalisation has also resulted in a shift in how individuals view themselves. More individuals are identifying themselves as citizens of the world, or cosmopolitans, rather than national citizens. According to Weber (2015), the concept of national identity as a citizen of a country is eroding as people increasingly identify themselves with the global community rather than their nationalities. This pattern has resulted in the growth of global civil society with people around the world united around common goals. The emergence of the world as a singular place and a common home for all will make it possible for individuals to have a shared vision of what is right and morally just. Cosmopolitanism provides an opportunity to unite people globally to overcome the challenges that the world faces.
However, one significant argument against the feasibility of cosmopolitanism is that this philosophy cannot guarantee peace and prosperity. The complex and intricate relations understandings between nations and states cannot be simplified and reduced into a singular global community. This argument suggests that human notions of identity, traditions and cultural attachments cannot be reduced or discarded in favour of a universalist approach. Moreover, people are more likely to identify with their local communities, cultures, and traditions than they would with cosmopolitanism as a singular identity. The construction of cohesive communities is essential to ensure harmony and peace between different people, as it helps to articulate a shared intellectual vocabulary around which conflicting parties can agree (Habermas, 1998). Cosmopolitanism's focus on a universalistic approach may result in it being rejected or ignored since individuals may not relate to this concept.
Another argument against cosmopolitanism is that it is an elitist and exclusive philosophy reserved for a select group of people. Critics claim that cosmopolitanism is the philosophy of a select group of well-educated individuals who are self-appointed, at the expense of the masses who are historically and economically disadvantaged. According to Nussbaum (1997), any moral concept that is claimed to be universally applicable must accommodate and protect the values of all individuals, including historically disadvantaged people. Universalism, according to Nussbaum, should not lead to domination. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that cosmopolitanism does not become an elitist philosophy resulting in the domination of one group over another.
The ethical dilemmas inherent in moral universalism pose a challenge to the concept of cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism's approach places emphasis on shared values and moral standards shared among diverse cultures and societies. However, the universalist approach of cosmopolitanism faces challenges since it assumes that all societies have common moral values. The implication of this is that individuals' religious and cultural beliefs that are different from the universal morals may be disregarded. According to Inglehart and Baker (2000), moral diversity varies among countries and societies, rendering universalistic moral approaches ineffective. Therefore, this eliminates the possibility of universal standards of morality, hence significantly challenging the concept of cosmopolitanism.
Moreover, the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism renders it challenging to apply as the framework supports a form of global governance and democracy which is often difficult in practice. The existence of different cultural, social, economic, and demographic conditions worldwide across countries means that it is impossible to come up with a singular system of governance that fits all. As such, any attempt to impose or align the governance systems of states with cosmopolitanism would be resisted, resulting in significant tension and conflict. This is because the institutional dimensions of cosmopolitanism are crucially dependent on the willingness of nations-state holders to be accountable to global governance structures. Furthermore, the degree of political inclusivity required and the measures for which it must be secured cannot be prescriptive in cosmopolitanism since different states may have different degrees of political inclusivity.
Additionally, many people view democracy and cosmopolitanism as distinct, with democracies having their own inherent limitations in dealing with diversity and ensuring representation. Cosmopolitanism focuses on the ideal of equality and the common good of all individuals. However, democracy bears the reality of representation difficulties since it is founded on the idea of rights belonging to specific communities, like the nation-state. As such, this has necessitated the evolution of what is commonly referred to as cosmopolitan democracy. The concept of cosmopolitan democracy intermeshes the notion of cosmopolitanism and democracy, attempting to develop a system of democracy that can apply at the global level. Therefore, democracy, while extremely important in ensuring governance at local and international levels, faces significant challenges when translated to a global context.
Moreover, the institutional focus of cosmopolitanism neglects the need for ethical foundations upon which this philosophy is based. Rawls (1999) argues that individuals must have certain fundamental rights that must be recognised by the state and the global community. This represents an ethical foundation that must be rethought to ensure that it remains inclusive and protects the rights of diverse individuals. With the increasing challenges of globalisation and increasing political polarisation, there is a need to rethink the concepts of political community and democracy so that they are more inclusive of a diverse group of individuals and ensure that they are grounded on certain ethical ideals that define cosmopolitanism in the modern world.
To conclude, the feasibility of cosmopolitanism in a globalised world is influenced by expanding technological platforms that make worldwide connections feasible. Cosmopolitanism offers opportunities to unite people globally to mitigate the challenges the world faces. However, this philosophy has significant challenges, resulting in scepticism from some quarters. As globalisation has expanded, the ethical dilemmas inherent in moral universalism pose a considerable challenge to cosmopolitanism. Additionally, the institutional dimensions of cosmopolitanism render it challenging to apply, with democracies and cosmopolitanism having their inherent limitations. The institutional focus of cosmopolitanism also neglects the need for ethical foundations that protect the rights of diverse individuals. As a result, there is a need to rethink the concepts of political community and democracy to ensure they remain inclusive and grounded on ethical ideals that define cosmopolitanism in the modern world.
