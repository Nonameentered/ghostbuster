Introduction
The term “dual diagnosis” refers to the co-occurrence of a substance use disorder and a mental health disorder in an individual. Mental health and substance use disorders commonly co-occur, resulting in significant negative outcomes for individuals, including increased hospitalization rates, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates. The prevalence of dual diagnosis is increasing in both the United Kingdom and the United States, with the majority of individuals receiving care for either their mental health or substance use issue but not for both. This essay aims to investigate the prevalence of dual diagnosis among mental health service users in the UK and the US, explore the negative outcomes associated with dual diagnosis, examine the evidence base for effective interventions for dual diagnosis, and analyze the debate surrounding the most effective approach.
Prevalence of Dual Diagnosis
The prevalence of dual diagnosis is relatively high, with studies indicating that substance use disorders are present in approximately 30-50% of individuals with a severe mental illness in both the UK and the US (Shaner, Khalsa, Roberts, Wilkins, & Anglin, 1993; Burns et al., 2001). Individuals with a dual diagnosis are often excluded from mental health services due to a lack of training and resources to address both issues effectively. A survey in the UK by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) found that only 4% of psychiatrists have received specialist training in substance misuse, and only 10% have received any training in addiction psychiatry (RCP, 2010). Furthermore, dual diagnosis is frequently underdiagnosed, with clinicians prioritizing either the mental health or substance use disorder without considering the co-occurring issue.
Negative Outcomes Associated with Dual Diagnosis
Dual diagnosis is associated with various negative outcomes, including increased hospitalization rates, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Individuals with a dual diagnosis experience more frequent and prolonged hospital admissions, with up to 60% of all psychiatric inpatients having a co-occurring substance use disorder in the UK (Hughes, Bellis, Calafat, Juan, & Kokko, 2011). Dual diagnosis also increases the risk of mortality, with overdose and suicide being the most common causes of death (Oliver, 2012). Additionally, dual diagnosis results in reduced quality of life, difficulty in performing daily activities, lower social functioning, and a higher risk of infectious diseases and other health concerns (Dar & Thakur, 2015).
Evidence Base for Effective Interventions for Dual Diagnosis
The treatment of dual diagnosis requires a coordinated approach, focusing on managing both the mental health and substance use disorders concurrently. The most effective interventions for dual diagnosis typically involve a combination of pharmacological and psychological treatments, including medication-assisted treatment, behavioral therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). An extensive randomized controlled trial in the UK found that integrated treatment, which involved pharmacology and psychological interventions for both mental health and substance use disorders in conjunction, were more effective in reducing substance misuse, improving quality of life, and reducing hospitalizations rates compared to usual treatment (Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment, 2008). Similarly, a cross-national study by Humphreys et al. (2014) identified various effective interventions, including motivational enhancement, individual counseling, group therapy, and pharmacotherapy, in treating dual diagnosis.
Debate Surrounding the Most Effective Approach
While there is evidence for various interventions, there is debate around the most effective approach to treating dual diagnosis. The integrated approach, which involves multidisciplinary teams coordinating care to treat both mental health and substance misuse issues, is considered the most effective approach. However, concerns have been raised, including the potential for the aggressive management of psychotropic and substance use medications, reduced patient autonomy, and the potential for stigma surrounding substance use disorders (NSDUH, 2017). Moreover, other approaches, such as sequential or parallel treatment, have been developed to treat dual diagnosis, although these have been less studied and are less common in practice. The sequential approach, which addresses one disorder before moving onto the co-occurring issue, is favored by some (Hulse et al., 2002), while parallel treatment, which involves separate treatments with different providers for each disorder, has been criticized for its limited collaboration and lack of communication between providers (Torchalla et al., 2012).
A Qualitative Study
A qualitative study by Hesse (2006) aimed to explore the perspective of mental health professionals regarding the treatment of patients with dual diagnosis in the US. The study found that professionals lacked experience and training in treating dual diagnosis, leading to frustration and feelings of inadequacy. Moreover, the majority of professionals did not agree on the most effective approach, with some favoring the integrated approach, while others suggested that focusing on one disorder before moving to the co-occurring issue was the best approach. The study also identified the challenges of treating dual diagnosis, including the potential for medication misuse and difficulty in finding suitable treatments for individuals with co-occurring disorders simultaneously.
Conclusion
Dual diagnosis is a significant public health issue, with high prevalence rates in both the UK and the US. Dual diagnosis is associated with negative outcomes, including increased hospitalization rates, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Evidence suggests that integrated treatment is the most effective approach in treating dual diagnosis, with a combination of pharmacological and psychological interventions. However, there is still considerable debate around the most effective approach, with different professionals favoring different methods. Moreover, the challenges in treating dual diagnosis, including a lack of resources and training, suggest that further work is required to address this growing issue better.
