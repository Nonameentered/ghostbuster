PESTE stands for Political, Economic, Socio-Cultural, Technological, and Environmental factors. A PESTE analysis is a useful tool for businesses because it enables them to identify and analyze the external factors that can impact their operations. This analysis is particularly useful in identifying changes in the external environment that can impact the operations of a business.

Macro-Environmental Factors at Kirtlington Golf Club 
Political Factors 
The political environment can have a significant impact on businesses, and in the case of Kirtlington Golf Club, there are a few political factors to consider. First, the UK's decision to leave the European Union has impacted the golf industry, as the availability of seasonal workers has decreased. The club may have to consider alternative staffing methods such as automation or seeking staff from other countries.
Economic Factors 
Economic factors such as inflation and recession can have a significant impact on businesses. For Kirtlington Golf Club, economic factors such as decreasing disposable incomes can impact facility usage. With a focus on golf and its associated amenities, the club may face challenges in keeping members and attracting new ones.
Socio-cultural Factors 
Socio-cultural factors are shifting continuously and can have a significant impact on businesses. In the case of Kirtlington Golf Club, shifts in social behavior may affect the number of memberships, impacting the revenue stream. In addition, society's growing concern around health and fitness may dictate that members can find alternative ways of exercise, which may decrease the revenue of the golf club.
Technological Factors 
Technological advancements can impact businesses on a significant scale. In the case of Kirtlington Golf Club, innovations in online booking, gaming, and alternative means of entertainment could affect the organization's traditional dependence. To remain competitive, the club may need to integrate technology and explore innovative entertainment options beyond golf.
Environmental Factors 
Environmental factors such as climate change and sustainability can impact an organization's operations. In the case of Kirtlington Golf Club, climate change could affect the safety of the golf course, and the availability of water could affect the maintenance of the grounds. To mitigate these risks, the club must have a strategic plan in place to address such environmental issues.
Concept of the Customer Audit Trail 
The customer audit trail is a tool that allows businesses to track a customer's journey from being a prospect to becoming a loyal customer. It involves mapping a customer's touchpoints, including their brand interactions, contact points, and sales transactions. The tool is useful because it identifies the customers' pain points, allowing businesses to improve customer experiences and increase customer loyalty.
Using the customer audit trail in the context of Kirtlington Golf Club would involve identifying how a customer interacts with the club from the initial booking to the departure after their time at the club. The trail would identify how the customers learned about the club, how they made reservations, interacted with staff, and enjoyed the services offered at the club.
Example of How the Customer Audit Trail can be used to Identify Business Strengths and Weaknesses 
By mapping the customer journey and identifying touchpoints, strengths and weaknesses can be identified. For example, the audit trail may identify that customers are having difficulty booking online or are receiving slow responses from the staff. This information can help the organization take corrective measures to address the weaknesses and improve the customer experience.
Use of Positioning Maps and Positioning Statements in Competitive Analysis 
A positioning map is a tool that helps to visualize a business's positioning relative to its competitors. For example, a positioning map could represent two essential factors that customers care about, such as quality and price. By plotting a business and its competitors on a graph, businesses can track their position relative to their competitors and make changes accordingly.
A positioning strategy statement is a statement that summarizes how the business wants to be perceived by the customers relative to its competitors. A positioning strategy statement should identify what differentiates an organization from its competitors.
Positioning Map and Statements in the Context of Kirtlington Golf Club and its Competitors 
In the case of Kirtlington Golf Club, they could use a positioning map to plot their prices against their competitors. They could use the map to understand how they compare to their competitors and adjust their prices accordingly. Kirtlington Golf Club's positioning strategy statement might involve emphasizing their high-quality facilities and personalized service to distinguish themselves from their competitors. This strategy could help them gain a competitive advantage over their competitors.
