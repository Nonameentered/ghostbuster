Financial Health and Performance
To evaluate IHG’s financial health and performance, we will analyze the company’s financial statements and use various financial ratios. The financial statements used for analysis are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, covering the period from 2016 to 2020. The financial ratios used for the analysis are profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, and solvency ratios.
Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios measure the company’s ability to generate profits. The three profitability ratios used for this analysis are gross profit margin, net profit margin, and return on equity (ROE).
Gross profit margin is the percentage of revenue that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold. IHG’s gross profit margin has been consistent from 2016 to 2020, ranging from 77.7% to 78.2%.
Net profit margin is the percentage of revenue that remains after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. IHG’s net profit margin has shown a steady increase over the past five years, from 34.1% in 2016 to 42.6% in 2020.
ROE is a measure of the company’s profitability relative to how much shareholder equity it has. IHG’s ROE has been consistently high, with an average of 108.6% over the past five years.
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios measure the company’s ability to meet its short-term financial obligations. The two liquidity ratios used for this analysis are the current ratio and the quick ratio.
The current ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s current assets by its current liabilities. IHG’s current ratio has remained consistent over the past five years, ranging from 0.90 to 1.09.
The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s current assets minus inventory by its current liabilities. IHG’s quick ratio has also remained consistent over the past five years, ranging from 0.67 to 0.82.
Solvency Ratios
Solvency ratios measure the company’s ability to meet its long-term financial obligations. The two solvency ratios used for this analysis are the debt-to-equity ratio and the interest coverage ratio.
The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing the company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity. IHG’s debt-to-equity ratio has remained consistent over the past five years, ranging from 3.68 to 4.23.
The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expenses. IHG’s interest coverage ratio has been consistently high, with an average of 17.1 over the past five years.
Growth Potential
IHG’s growth potential can be evaluated by analyzing its financial metrics, market capitalization, and future growth prospects. IHG’s revenue has steadily increased from 2016 to 2019, reaching $4.6 billion in 2019 before decreasing to $2.4 billion in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company has shown strong signs of recovery in 2021, with revenue increasing by 51.3% compared to the same period in 2020.
IHG’s market capitalization as of August 2021 is £7.8 billion, which reflects the company's potential for growth. In addition, IHG’s recent partnership with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company, to provide a new platform for travel agents is a positive indicator of the company's future growth prospects.
