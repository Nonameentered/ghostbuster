The role of humor in the intercultural adjustment of international students studying abroad in the U.K. is multifaceted. Humor can serve as a coping mechanism, a tool for building social connections, and a way to navigate cultural differences. International students can use humor and humor styles to establish social support and enhance their intercultural adjustment, improving their objective sense of well-being. Correlational research can be used to study the relationships between humor and intercultural adjustment, but an experimental design is not suitable for this type of study. Limitations exist in this research, but it has the potential to innovate the study of humor in the field of positive psychology.
When international students first arrive in a new country, they may experience culture shock and feel isolated. Humor can be an effective coping mechanism for dealing with the stresses of intercultural adjustment. As defined by Martin and Lefcourt (1984), humor can be broken down into four different styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating. Within these styles, affiliative and self-enhancing humor tend to be the most effective for promoting adjustment and well-being. Affiliative humor is a way to connect with others through shared experiences and positive emotions, while self-enhancing humor allows individuals to maintain a sense of control and resilience in the face of adversity (Berk, 2001).
International students can also use humor to establish social support and build relationships with others. Humor can serve as a way to bridge cultural divides and create bonds with individuals from different backgrounds. For example, international students may use humorous stereotypes to poke fun at cultural differences, allowing them to laugh at themselves and their new surroundings (Romero et al., 2015). These types of interactions can create a sense of social connectedness and reduce feelings of isolation.
In addition to its social benefits, humor has been linked to objective well-being. Individuals who score high in happiness tend to use more positive humor styles, such as affiliative and self-enhancing humor (Kuiper et al., 1996). Conversely, individuals who score low in happiness tend to use more negative humor styles, such as aggressive and self-defeating humor. For international students, using positive humor styles may help improve their objective sense of well-being and promote intercultural adjustment.
Correlational research can be utilized to study the relationships between humor and intercultural adjustment. This type of research can examine how humor styles are related to adjustment outcomes, such as academic success and social support. For example, a study by Romero et al. (2015) found that international students who used more affiliative humor experienced greater social support and were more likely to feel connected to the campus community. However, correlational research is limited because it cannot establish causality. It is possible that other factors are driving the relationship between humor and intercultural adjustment.
Experimental designs are not suitable for studying the relationships between humor and intercultural adjustment. This type of research requires manipulating variables and controlling for extraneous factors, which is often difficult or impossible in intercultural contexts. Additionally, experimental designs may not accurately reflect real-life experiences. For example, a study by Chuang and Chen (2015) found that participants who were told to use humor in intercultural interactions actually felt less confident and more nervous. This suggests that explicit attempts to use humor may backfire in intercultural encounters.
There are limitations to the current research on humor and intercultural adjustment. First, much of the research is correlational and cannot establish causality or control for confounding variables. Second, the majority of research has been conducted in the United States, limiting generalizability to other cultural contexts. Finally, research has largely focused on the positive effects of humor and has not examined potential negative consequences, such as perpetuating stereotypes or offending others.
Despite these limitations, research on humor and intercultural adjustment has the potential to innovate the study of humor in the field of positive psychology. By examining the ways in which humor can be used to promote social support and well-being in intercultural contexts, this research can inform interventions aimed at improving intercultural communication and adjustment. Additionally, future research can investigate how humor can be used to address negative stereotypes and bias, promoting a more inclusive and accepting society.
In conclusion, humor plays an important role in the intercultural adjustment of international students studying abroad in the U.K. Humor can serve as a coping mechanism, a tool for building social connections, and a way to navigate cultural differences. International students can use humor and humor styles to establish social support and enhance their intercultural adjustment, improving their objective sense of well-being. Correlational research can be used to study the relationships between humor and intercultural adjustment, but an experimental design is not suitable for this type of study. Despite limitations, research on humor and intercultural adjustment has the potential to inform interventions and promote a more inclusive society.
