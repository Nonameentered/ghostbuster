Ren√© Descartes, a prominent philosopher of the seventeenth century, is widely recognized as the father of modern philosophy. One of his significant contributions in philosophy is his Meditations wherein he presented some of his philosophical arguments and epistemological theories. In his Meditations, Descartes attempted to prove the existence of God and the external world. The questions of the existence of God and the external world have been at the center of philosophical discourse, with scholars attempting to provide proofs of their existence or non-existence. This essay will discuss Descartes' attempt to prove the existence of God and the external world in his Meditations, analyze his ontological argument, and explore whether his argument for the non-deceitfulness of God proves the existence of the external world.
In his Meditations, Descartes sets out to doubt everything he knows to be true, including his senses, beliefs, and ideas. This doubt was not only for the sake of skepticism, but also to establish a firm foundation for knowledge by seeking a certainty that cannot be doubted. Descartes began by doubting sensory information, which he considered unreliable. He argued that what one's senses perceive could be an illusion, and therefore, they cannot be trusted.
Descartes' first meditation leads him to doubt the external world and any knowledge based on the senses. He argues that the senses have misled humans in the past and, therefore, they are not a reliable source of knowledge. However, he cannot doubt his own existence, and hence, he comes up with the famous "Cogito, ergo sum" ('I think, therefore I am') to prove his own existence. Descartes' cogito establishes his own existence, but it does not necessarily prove the existence of the external world.
In the second meditation, Descartes proceeds to prove the existence of God as he believed that God is the only foundation of knowledge that cannot be doubted. He argues that the very idea of God necessitates God's existence. Descartes states that he has an innate idea of God, which he understands as an infinite, all-perfect being. Since the idea of God is far beyond human comprehension, he could not have created it; hence, it must have come from something outside of the human mind. He, therefore, concludes that God must exist and that all clear and distinct ideas, like mathematics and geometry, are true because God guarantees their truthfulness.
Furthermore, Descartes' ontological argument attempts to prove the existence of God. He argues that God's existence is necessary for the very idea of God to exist since an all-perfect being must possess existence. Descartes' argument is based on the premise that existence is a necessary attribute of perfection, and therefore, God being a perfect being, must exist. He argues that if one can conceive of an infinite and perfect being, then it must exist because the idea of such a being includes the attribute of existence. Descartes, therefore, concludes that God's existence can be deduced solely by reason and logic.
While Descartes' ontological argument appears plausible, it has been subjected to criticism from various philosophers. For instance, Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, found Descartes' reasoning flawed. Kant argued that existence is not a necessary attribute of perfection; hence, the ontological argument falls apart. For Kant, the idea of existence cannot be deduced from reason or logic alone; instead, it requires empirical evidence.
Another significant argument against Descartes' ontological argument is that the idea of God can be perceived as subjective. Similarly, Descartes' claim that the idea of God is innate and beyond doubt is also questionable. Critics argue that Descartes' argument presents a mere definition of God, and that this definition does not necessarily show that God exists in reality.
Moreover, Descartes argues for the non-deceitfulness of God as proof for the existence of the external world. He argues that God could not deceive him about the external world's existence because God is non-deceitful. Descartes argues that God created humans with a faculty of reason, and since reason is perfect, it cannot be deceived. Therefore, if human beings use their faculty of reason to explore the world, they will undoubtedly discover the true nature of reality. Descartes concludes that the external world must exist because a non-deceitful God created humans with reason, and hence, they can discover the true nature of reality.
However, Descartes fails to recognize that his argument from the non-deceitfulness of God is neither convincing nor empirically verifiable. Descartes' argument is based solely on his belief that God is non-deceitful without providing any empirical evidence to back up his claim. Besides, people have different beliefs concerning the existence of God and the nature of reality. Therefore, relying on a personal belief in God's non-deceitfulness is not sufficient in affirming the existence of the external world.
Furthermore, there is a possibility that even if God were non-deceitful, humans could not fully comprehend the external world. The human perception of reality is limited, and it can only achieve partial knowledge of the world. Therefore, even if God were non-deceitful, humans would still have a limited understanding or knowledge of the world.
In conclusion, Descartes' attempt to prove the existence of God and the external world in his Meditations is significant in the history of philosophy. His argument for the existence of God through the ontological argument presents a thought-provoking idea. However, his argument from belief in God's non-deceitfulness to prove the existence of the external world is questionable. Descartes' argument does not provide empirical evidence and is not convincing since it relies solely on his belief in God's non-deceitfulness. Therefore, while Descartes presented some powerful arguments, his proofs for the existence of God and the external world remain a subject of debate and scrutiny.
