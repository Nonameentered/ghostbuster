Adenosine triphosphate or ATP is the molecule responsible for providing energy for cellular work in all living organisms. The energy required for the synthesis of ATP comes from different sources, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. The body processes these energy sources differently, depending on their availability and the energy demands of the cells. In addition, the body has a system for storing glucose in the form of glycogen- a readily mobilized energy reserve that is quickly accessible during times of increased energy demands. This essay aims to discuss the different energy sources used for ATP synthesis, their processing in the body and mechanisms of breaking down glycogen to yield glucose.
Carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for the body and are the most readily available energy source for ATP synthesis. The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth with the enzyme amylase breaking down polysaccharides into monosaccharides like glucose. These monosaccharides enter the bloodstream across the intestinal lining via facilitated diffusion and are transported to the liver, where they are either stored or broken down to produce ATP.
Glucose is the primary monosaccharide molecule used by cells to produce ATP. The glucose molecules undergo a series of chemical reactions, collectively known as cellular respiration, to produce ATP. It begins with glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm and generates two pyruvate molecules, two ATP molecules, and two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules. The pyruvate then enters the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl-CoA, producing two carbon dioxide molecules and two NADH molecules. The acetyl-CoA is then oxidized in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, in the mitochondrial matrix to produce six NADH molecules, two reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) molecules, two ATP molecules, and four carbon dioxide molecules. The NADH and FADH2 are then used in the electron transport chain, where they transfer electrons to oxygen, generating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.
Lipids are another source of energy for ATP synthesis. They undergo a process called beta-oxidation, which involves the breakdown of fatty acids to produce acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle and undergoes the same process as glucose to produce ATP. One gram of lipid yields more ATP than one gram of glucose because lipids contain more energy per gram than glucose. However, the breakdown of lipids is slower than glucose because it takes longer to break-down lipids into usable energy intermediates.
Proteins are a source of energy, but they are only used when carbohydrates and lipids are insufficient. The breakdown of proteins results in the generation of amino acids that can either undergo gluconeogenesis, which generates glucose, or enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP. The breakdown of proteins is a less efficient process as it requires more energy to break down their structural molecules and is only used when other sources of energy are absent.
Glycogen is a polymer of glucose that is stored in the liver and muscle cells and is quickly mobilized to generate energy in response to increased energy demands. When blood glucose levels decrease, hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. The breakdown process, known as glycogenolysis, involves the release of glucose-1-phosphate from the glycogen molecule by phosphorylase and then the conversion of this molecule to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. Glucose-6-phosphate is then converted to glucose by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is present in the liver but absent in the muscle. The glucose generated from glycogenolysis can then enter the bloodstream and be transported to other cells in the body that require energy.
In summary, ATP synthesis requires energy sources, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, to be processed differently to yield ATP. Carbohydrates and lipids undergo similar processes, starting with glycolysis and beta-oxidation, respectively, followed by the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Proteins are less efficient and only used when other sources of energy are absent. Glycogen is a storage form of glucose that is quickly mobilized during times of increased energy demand. The glycogen is broken down to glucose-1-phosphate by phosphorylase and then converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase and ultimately to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase. This glucose can then be used to produce ATP through cellular respiration.
