Large dams and hydropower projects have been a significant source of energy for decades, contributing to the development of various countries worldwide. Nevertheless, these projects have also been met with controversy over their mixed benefits, leading to complex debates surrounding their environmental, social, and economic impacts. 
The benefits of large dams and hydropower projects are numerous, and they have contributed significantly to the development of various countries worldwide. Firstly, they provide an essential source of energy, particularly for developing countries. In 2018, hydropower accounted for approximately 16% of global electricity generation, making it one of the largest renewable energy sources worldwide. Furthermore, hydropower projects have proven to be cost-effective compared to other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. 
The construction of large dams and hydropower projects also promotes economic growth and development by providing employment opportunities and encouraging local businesses. For instance, the construction of the 3 Gorges Dam in China, which is regarded as the largest hydropower project globally, employed over 1.4 million people, and it provided energy to more than 18 million households. The project also enhanced shipping and irrigation, thereby increasing the productivity of farmers in the region. 
In addition to the benefits of large dams and hydropower projects, there are also negative impacts. In the environmental aspects, dams usually cause significant ecological changes, including the alterations of natural aquatic systems, sediment transport, and fish reproduction. Furthermore, the construction of large dams and hydropower projects may lead to flooding, which can damage habitats, properties, and livelihoods in the region. The construction process may also involve the displacement of communities residing within project areas, leading to social challenges, such as insufficient compensation for displacement, resettlement, and loss of cultural heritage. 
Moreover, the energy and water supply implications of hydropower must be analyzed concerning the current and future demands for water supply and other related essentials. Climate change is altering the behavioral patterns of various water resources, which threatens the reliability of high volumes of water storage dams and the electricity generation potential of hydropower facilities. With climatic change leading to severe water scarcity in many parts of the world, large dams and hydropower projects should be designed with the adaptability of hydrology models to withstand changing patterns. Considering that hydropower relies on water supply, the reduction in water availability leads to the reduced capacity of hydropower facilities, which may precipitate costly and excessive transmission investments. 
Despite the negative impacts of large dams and hydropower projects, they have contributed significantly to meeting the world's energy demands and the enhancement of social and economic development. The design and implementation of these projects have evolved to consider various environmental and social concerns, leading to an increased level of sustainability. 
There are other renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and geothermal energy, that have the potential to offer significant benefits while reducing some of the negative impacts of large dams and hydropower projects. These renewable energy sources make it possible to generate clean energy without relying on water supply or having significant impacts on ecosystems. For instance, solar and wind energy have already shown immense potential in the energy scene, and their cost is quickly falling, which makes them an attractive option for countries aiming to increase their renewable energy sources. 
Moreover, the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Realistic planning, comprehensive environmental assessments, and enhanced hydropower technologies can be incorporated to reduce the negative impacts of large dams and hydropower projects. In addition, there needs to be a focus on advancing the efficiencies with existing hydropower projects. These recommended steps would ensure sustainable hydropower development globally that ensures energy security and environmental protection. 
In conclusion, the benefits and negative impacts of large dams and hydropower projects have been widely debated, with growing concerns about their sustainability. While they contribute significantly to energy supplies and social and economic development worldwide, these projects come with environmental and social impacts that need consideration during planning and implementation. The emergence of other renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and geothermal energy, provides an opportunity to generate clean energy without relying on water supply or causing severe environmental impacts. Hence understanding the trade between the benefits and negative impacts is necessary to ensure sustainable hydropower projects.
