Introduction
Working in a multidisciplinary group in the health and social care field comes with various challenges and successes. Group dynamics play an essential role in determining the success of the group's task. This essay reflects on my experience of working in a multidisciplinary group in the health and social care field by using Tuckman's stages of group development and Belbin's team roles to guide the discussion. The essay delves into my perceptions, thoughts, and feelings throughout the group process, discussing the challenges and successes. Additionally, the essay explores how group dynamics impacted the task at hand and integrates published literature on teamwork to support the reflections.
Tuckman's Stages of Group Development
Tuckman's stages of group development comprise of forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. These stages occur in the following order: Forming - the team comes together, Storming - members confront and question one another, Norming - the team establishes norms and roles, Performing - the team accomplishes its task, and Adjourning - the team attains closure (Tuckman, 2010).
Forming Stage
At the forming stage, our group comprised individuals from different healthcare professions. As a member of the group, I was excited and nervous about meeting new people from diverse professional backgrounds. In the initial meetings, the group was polite to each other and introduced themselves and their profession. Everyone seemed interested and committed to the group's task.
Storming Stage
In the storming stage, the group members became more familiar with each other and started questioning their ideas and contributions. The process seemed slow, and some members expressed frustrations about the group's lack of progress. I became anxious and worried about the group's future dynamics. However, after an open conversation, the group began to understand each other's perspectives, and the level of openness and respect for each other's ideas increased. As a member, I felt more comfortable with the rest of the team and more confident in expressing myself.
Norming Stage
At the norming stage, the group started to establish norms, values, and roles. Each member willingly adjusted their behavior to accommodate the group's recommendations. At this stage, I felt a sense of belonging to the group and welcomed the recognition of each other's contributions. The discussions became more goal-oriented, and we started aligning on our task and objectives.
Performing Stage
In the performing stage, the group was constructive and efficient in achieving our goals. The dynamics of the team involved respect for one another's roles, cooperation, and collaboration. As a member of the group, I felt more confident and motivated to contribute to the group's tasks, and the group's achievements inspired a sense of pride.
Adjourning Stage
At the adjourning stage, the group was able to attain closure, and the relationships established during the group project ended. Members of the group expressed their gratitude and appreciation for each other's contributions. As a member of the group, I felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment and appreciated the relationships that developed during the group project.
Belbin's Team Roles
Belbin's team roles comprise of the Plant, Resource Investigator, Co-ordinator, Monitor Evaluator, Implementer, Team Worker, Shaper, Completer Finisher, and Specialist. These roles are necessary in a team to ensure cohesion, efficiency, and overall success (Belbin, 2010).

The Plant role entails unconventional thinking and creativity. Individuals with this role are proficient in brainstorming unusual ideas and often act as the group's source of inspiration. As a member of our group, I appreciated the presence of individuals who displayed strong Plant roles. They generated innovative ideas that led to the group's success.
Resource Investigator Role
The Resource Investigator role is responsible for networking, interacting with the outside world, and identifying available resources. Members with this role have an inbuilt advantage of exploring new opportunities for the team to harness. As a member of the group, I admired the members who had this role as they had several connections that we leveraged to accomplish the group's objectives.
Coordinator Role
The Coordinator role entails organizing, delegating tasks, and managing the team's resources. Individuals who possess this role are natural leaders, and they guide the team towards its objectives. As a member of the group, I found the presence of individuals with strong coordinator roles to be vital to the group's success.

The Monitor Evaluator role is responsible for evaluating available ideas and providing objective analysis. Members with this role are objective and impartial. They ensure that all ideas are heard and provide valuable feedback for the team to consider.

As a member of the group, I found individuals who had strong Specialist roles to be invaluable, as they brought specialized knowledge to the group.
Group Dynamics and Task Impact 
Group dynamics play a crucial role in determining the success of the task assigned to a group. The stage of group development, teamwork, and efficient communication are all contributors to successful group outcomes. In our multidisciplinary health and social care group, group dynamics were essential in facilitating collaboration and coordination, and they ultimately impacted on the group's performance.
The use of Tuckman's stages of group development was instrumental in identifying the group's strengths and weaknesses. The norming and performing stages were critical for the group's success. These stages were achieved by respecting each other's ideas, establishing norms and roles, and working collaboratively towards our objectives. These stages ensured that the group developed a healthy communication system, efficient delegation of tasks, and enhanced productivity.
Belbin's team roles were vital in ensuring that the group task was completed efficiently. Each member contributed with their unique abilities, knowledge, and skills. The combination of roles ensured that there was a balance of innovation, critical evaluation, organization, and attention to detail. Our group was able to leverage each of these unique characters to ensure that the task was completed to a high standard.
In conclusion, working in a multidisciplinary group in the health and social care field comes with various challenges and successes. Group dynamics play an essential role in determining the success of the group's task. Tuckman's stages of group development and Belbin's team roles were instrumental in facilitating our group's performance. The norms established in the norming stage, the strong collaboration and communication during the performing stage, and the balance of expertise brought by each member's unique role were some of the factors that led to our group's success. The successful completion of our task was fulfilling and indicative that multidisciplinary collaboration is necessary for effective health and social care service delivery.
