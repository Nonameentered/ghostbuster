The Neoclassical literary movement, also known as the Enlightenment era, was a significant turning point in the history of literature. This period was characterized by a revival of classical art, literature, and philosophy, with a focus on the importance of reason, order, and clarity. One of the significant influences on the Neoclassical literary movement was Aristotle's 'Poetics,' which served as a rulebook for playwriting for many playwrights of the era. In this essay, we will explore the ways in which the Neoclassical literary movement used Aristotle's 'Poetics' as a rulebook for playwriting, the unities outlined in the 'Poetics,' and how playwrights attempted to adhere to these guidelines while also seeking flexibility in their work.
Aristotle's 'Poetics' is a collection of notes and observations on literary theory, specifically on tragedy. It was written in the fourth century BCE, and it is one of the earliest works of literary criticism that we have. The book has been the subject of much study and interpretation, and it has influenced many playwrights throughout history. In the Neoclassical era, the 'Poetics' served as a guideline for the construction of plays and the evaluation of their quality.
One of the principal ways in which the Neoclassical literary movement used the 'Poetics' was as a guide for the structure of plays. Aristotle outlined the three parts of a drama: the exposition, the climax (or turning point), and the resolution. He also wrote about the importance of unity in a play, both in terms of action and time. The Neoclassical playwrights adhered to this structure, and their plays were typically divided into five acts, each with its own exposition, climax, and resolution.
In addition to the structure of plays, Aristotle's 'Poetics' also outlined the importance of the unities. The unities refer to the idea that a play should have unity of time, place, and action. Unity of time means that the events depicted in the play should take place within a single day, unity of place refers to the idea that the action should take place in a single location, and unity of action means that the play should have a single, unified plot. These unities were crucial to the Neoclassical playwrights, who sought to create plays that were clear, rational, and concise.
The unities outlined in the 'Poetics' were not without their challenges, however. It was often difficult for playwrights to adhere strictly to these rules while also creating engaging and complex plays. For example, the unity of time presented a significant challenge, as it limited the events that could take place in a play and made it difficult to develop characters and storylines fully. To overcome these challenges, playwrights often employed techniques such as flashbacks and offstage events to convey more extensive periods of time and action.
Similarly, the unity of place also created challenges, primarily in terms of dramatic effects. Because the action had to take place in a single location, playwrights had to find creative ways to create tension and suspense. Many playwrights did this by using dramatic irony or by having offstage events that affected the action on stage.
Another significant challenge created by the unities was the need for unity of action. Traditional dramas often included multiple plotlines, subplots, and characters, making it difficult to maintain a single, unified plot. To overcome this challenge, Neoclassical playwrights often focused on a single dramatic conflict or created a plot that revolved around a central character or group of characters.
Despite the challenges presented by the unities, the Neoclassical playwrights recognized their importance in creating clear, concise, and rational plays. By adhering to these guidelines, they were able to create plays that were both entertaining and thought-provoking, while also conveying important moral lessons.
In conclusion, the Neoclassical literary movement was heavily influenced by Aristotle's 'Poetics,' which served as a rulebook for playwriting. The unities outlined in the 'Poetics' were essential to the Neoclassical playwrights, who sought to create plays that were clear, concise, and rational. However, these guidelines also presented challenges, particularly in terms of developing complex characters and plots. To overcome these challenges, playwrights employed various techniques while still adhering to the unities. Overall, the Neoclassical literary movement created some of the most enduring and influential plays in history, many of which are still performed today.
