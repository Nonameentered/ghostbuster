The year 2008 saw Liverpool being awarded the prestigious title of European City of Culture. This designation offered an array of opportunities to businesses in Liverpool, including the Premier Lodge Hotel. However, while taking advantage of these opportunities, it is important for Premier Lodge to maintain focus on sustainable tourism. This essay will discuss the internal and external factors that Premier Lodge should consider in developing a strategy to maximize its gains, while minimizing negative impacts on the environment and society.
The designation of Liverpool as the European City of Culture opened up new avenues for Premier Lodge to increase its revenue by attracting more tourists. The first step towards this would be to offer attractive packages catering to the requirements of different segments of tourists. The hotel could offer packages that include tickets to cultural events and concerts, city tours, and information about Liverpool's history and culture. Additionally, Premier Lodge could also collaborate with local businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, to offer discounts to its guests, further enhancing the attraction of the hotel.
Premier Lodge should prioritize the sustainability aspect of tourism while developing a strategy to facilitate its growth within the Liverpool tourism industry. Sustainable tourism refers to development that meets the needs of tourists without compromising the environment, culture, and society of the local community. The hotel can adopt a number of measures to achieve this, starting with the reduction of its carbon footprint. One strategy could be to implement an environmentally friendly waste management system, such as recycling, composting, and waste reduction. Additionally, by sourcing locally produced products and employing staff from the local community, Premier Lodge can contribute to the sustainability of the local economy.
Considering the external factors impacting Premier Lodge's operations, it is essential for the hotel to consider the competition. Liverpool is home to a vast array of hotels, ranging from upscale to economy. Premier Lodge must differentiate itself from other hotels by offering a unique guest experience. This could involve providing personalized attention to its guests, a distinctive design, and exclusive amenities. A unique aesthetic or niche service could attract a different segment of tourists, who may not have considered Premier Lodge as their go-to accommodation choice.
One important factor which Premier Lodge should take into account is the socio-cultural impact of tourism. As the number of tourists increases, so does the burden on the local community to preserve their way of life. Premier Lodge can help educate their guests about the local customs and traditions and encourage them to be respectful of the local way of life. This way, the hotel can help protect the local culture and social fabric.
Lastly, the hotel should also think about the importance of aligning its vision with the goals of the European City of Culture event. Premier Lodge has to capitalize on the city's unique history and cultural heritage by integrating culturally specific themes into its offerings. For example, introducing a local cultural activity, creating a dedicated cultural package, or offering an artistic experience will help create a memorable guest experience for tourists. The hotel should aim to be a part of the initiative rather than just being an observer.
In summary, Premier Lodge has an opportunity to leverage Liverpool's designation as the European City of Culture in 2008. However, the organization must consider sustainable tourism practices, including environmentally friendly strategies and sourcing local products and services. To succeed in a highly competitive market, Premier Lodge needs to differentiate itself from other hotels by offering unique guest experiences, integrating local customs and traditions, and aligning its vision with the goals of the European City of Culture. By doing so, the business can maximize gains from the influx of tourists into Liverpool while minimizing the negative impacts of tourism on the local community, environment, and society.
