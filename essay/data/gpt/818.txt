A pulmonary embolus (PE) is a blockage of a pulmonary artery that is usually caused by a blood clot that has travelled from another part of the body, usually the legs. Clinical features of a PE include sudden onset of dyspnea or shortness of breath, chest pain that may be pleuritic (sharp, worsened by breathing in), cough, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). However, the presentation of a PE may be different in an elderly diabetic as they may have underlying comorbidities that affect their presentation. Differentials for the presenting combination of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath in an elderly diabetic patient include myocardial infarction, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.
The elderly diabetic patient is a high-risk group for developing a PE due to their age and comorbidities. Elderly individuals may have weakened immune systems, previous myocardial infarctions, and a history of blood clotting disorders that may predispose them to developing a PE. Diabetics, on the other hand, have an increased risk of developing clots, and their blood may have an increased viscosity, making it difficult to flow. Diabetics are also at risk of developing arterial disease, which may lead to atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolism.
Pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath can be a presenting sign for many conditions. The differential diagnosis of a PE includes myocardial infarction, pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. The presence of pleuritic pain may suggest the presence of pulmonary pathology, making it important to rule out such pathologies before considering a PE. Pneumonia is a common condition in the elderly, which may present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. Exacerbation of COPD may present with wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Pulmonary hypertension may present with fatigue, shortness of breath, and a racing heartbeat. Heart failure may present with coughing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.
The comorbidity of the patient is essential in determining the approach to their management. A person-centred approach is crucial in their management as the elderly diabetic patient is likely to have a complex medical history that may interact with their current condition. A person-centred approach ensures that care is tailored to the patient's specific needs and preferences, taking into account their goals and expectations. It involves engaging the patient and their family in the decision-making process, providing clear information about the condition and treatment options, and addressing any concerns they may have.
The National Service Framework for Older People outlines key principles for the provision of healthcare to the elderly, which are relevant in managing an elderly diabetic patient with suspected PE. These principles include promoting independence, dignity, and harmony, respecting the patient's choices, and involving the patient and their families in the decision-making process. A holistic approach that considers the patient's medical, social, and psychological needs is necessary to promote the patient's overall well-being.
In conclusion, pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath in an elderly diabetic patient may indicate the presence of a PE. However, a comprehensive differential diagnosis is necessary to rule out other conditions. The comorbidity of the patient is essential in determining their management, and a person-centred approach is crucial in addressing their specific needs and preferences. The National Service Framework for Older People provides essential principles that guide the provision of healthcare for the elderly. By incorporating these principles, healthcare providers can ensure that the elderly diabetic patient with suspected PE receives the best possible care.
