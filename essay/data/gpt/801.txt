Introduction
The Wheatstone Deflection Bridge is a well-known circuit used in the measurement of resistance. The circuit is named after Sir Charles Wheatstone, who first proposed the circuit in 1833. The Wheatstone Deflection Bridge is widely used in many applications, including electrical engineering, physics, and chemistry, due to its ability to accurately measure small changes in resistance. In this paper, we will explore the purpose of the assignment and the steps involved in designing and constructing the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge and amplifier system to measure and analyze the change in output under loading. We will also discuss the findings of our experiment and how noise reduction via a low pass filter impacted accuracy. A detailed description of the bridge and amplifier setup will also be provided.
Purpose of the Assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to design and construct a Wheatstone Deflection Bridge and amplifier system to measure and analyze the change in output under loading. This involved the use of various components such as resistors, capacitors, op-amps, and potentiometers to construct the bridge. The amplifier system was used to amplify the small change in output and filter out any noise that could affect the accuracy of the measurement. The aim of the assignment was to provide students with hands-on experience in designing and constructing electronic circuits and measuring resistance accurately.
Steps Involved in Designing and Constructing the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge and Amplifier System
The design and construction of the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge involved several steps. The first step was to determine the values of the resistors that would be used in the bridge. For accurate measurements, the resistance values of the resistors used in the bridge should be as close as possible. We then proceeded to construct the bridge using four resistors, each with a resistance value of 1kΩ.
Once the bridge was constructed, we then made the necessary connections to the amplifier. The amplifier used in our experiment was an operational amplifier (op-amp) configured as an inverting amplifier. The op-amp was used to amplify the small change in voltage output generated by the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge. To minimize noise, we used a low pass filter consisting of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series between the output of the op-amp and the load.
The next step was to calibrate the system by setting the input voltage to zero and adjusting the potentiometer until the output voltage was also zero. We then proceeded to connect a known load resistance (in our case, a variable resistor) to the bridge and observed the change in output voltage. We changed the load resistance and noted the corresponding change in output voltage, recording the data obtained.
Findings of the Experiment
The experiment revealed that the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge is a very accurate circuit for measuring small changes in resistance. When we varied the load resistance, we observed a corresponding change in the output voltage. The change in output voltage was proportional to the change in load resistance, as expected. We were able to obtain very accurate resistance measurements, as evidenced by the consistent readings we obtained.
The use of a low pass filter greatly improved the accuracy of the measurements. The low pass filter helped to filter out any noise that could affect the accuracy of the measurements and provided a more stable signal. When the filter was turned off, we observed significant noise in the output signal, resulting in less accurate measurements. Therefore, for accurate resistance measurements, the use of a low pass filter is recommended.
Description of the Bridge and Amplifier Setup
The Wheatstone Deflection Bridge and amplifier setup consisted of a Wheatstone Bridge composed of four 1kΩ resistors arranged in a diamond formation. The bridge was powered by a DC voltage source, which was connected to the top and bottom of the diamond. The amplifier was connected to the output of the bridge via a voltage divider consisting of two resistors, which provided the input voltage to the op-amp. The output of the op-amp was then connected to a low pass filter consisting of a resistor and capacitor connected in series. The output of the low pass filter was then connected to a load resistor.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the design and construction of the Wheatstone Deflection Bridge and amplifier system is an effective way to measure resistance with great accuracy. The system is relatively simple to construct, and the use of a low pass filter greatly improves the accuracy of the measurements obtained. The system can be used in a wide range of applications, from electrical engineering to physics and chemistry, where accurate measurement of resistance is essential. Overall, this assignment was an excellent opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience in designing and constructing electronic circuits and measuring resistance accurately.
