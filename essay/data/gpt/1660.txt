The poem "The Long Small Room" by Edward Thomas is a hauntingly beautiful reflection on the passing of time and the inevitability of aging. Written in 1916, the piece is notable for its masterful use of linguistic techniques to convey complex emotions and ideas. This essay will explore the range of techniques employed by Thomas in his poem, and how they contribute to the overall themes of the piece.
One of the most striking elements of "The Long Small Room" is Thomas's use of personification. Throughout the poem, he imbues inanimate objects with a sense of life and movement, giving them a voice and personality of their own. For example, in the opening lines, Thomas describes how "the long small room has lulled me / by her mild lamp-smile". Here, the room is portrayed as a nurturing and comforting presence, with the ability to provide a sense of calm and tranquillity. This technique serves to create a vivid and evocative atmosphere, drawing the reader into the space of the poem and heightening their emotional connection to its themes.
Furthermore, Thomas uses symbolism to great effect in "The Long Small Room". In particular, he employs nature imagery as a means of exploring the passing of time and the fragility of life. For instance, he describes the "slippered silence creeping / from room to room and down the stair", suggesting a sense of slow decay as the years roll on. Later, he depicts the "cherry-blossom fading / from the window-ledge", linking the transience of nature with the human experience of aging and mortality. By making these subtle connections, Thomas creates a rich and layered portrait of time passing and the passing of individual lives.
Another technique employed by Thomas in "The Long Small Room" is repetition. He uses certain phrases and ideas repeatedly throughout the piece, creating a sense of fluidity and continuity. For example, the phrase "the long small room" is repeated several times, serving to anchor the poem in a specific physical space and providing a sense of structure. Similarly, the line "I have been here before" recurs throughout the poem, suggesting a sense of cyclical time and a feeling that everything - including life itself - is subject to repetition and patterns.
Finally, Thomas's use of sensory language is a key component of "The Long Small Room". He utilises vivid descriptions of touch, smell, and sound, immersing the reader in the sensory experience of the environment he describes. For instance, he writes of the "warm perfume of the house" and the "shower of sweet notes" that emanate from the piano in the corner. This sensory richness serves to create a palpable atmosphere of nostalgia and longing, evoking memories and feelings of longing for a simpler time.
Taken together, these linguistic techniques contribute to the overall themes of "The Long Small Room", which are primarily concerned with the passage of time and the experience of aging. By personifying inanimate objects, using symbolism to explore the natural world, employing repetition to suggest patterns and cycles, and engaging the reader's senses through sensory language, Thomas creates a complex and multi-layered portrait of the human experience of time and mortality. The poem is infused with a sense of melancholy nostalgia, a longing for a time that has passed and cannot be recovered.
In conclusion, "The Long Small Room" by Edward Thomas is a work of great beauty and emotional resonance, built around a range of sophisticated and carefully calibrated linguistic techniques. By personifying objects, using symbols to explore the natural world, repeating key phrases, and engaging the reader's senses, Thomas creates a rich and evocative portrait of the passage of time and the experiences of aging. The poem stands as a testament to the enduring power of language to capture the complex and often elusive nature of human experience.
