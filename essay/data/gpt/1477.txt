Identity and displacement are common themes in literature as they are universal experiences that individuals go through in life. These experiences are often reflected in poetry where poets explore these themes through language, structure, and literary devices. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the themes of identity and displacement in Louise Bennett's poem "Colonization in Reverse" and another poem by Langston Hughes titled "Theme for English B." I will analyze how each poet uses language, structure, and literary devices to convey their ideas.
Louise Bennett’s poem “Colonization in Reverse” explores the theme of identity by describing the migration of West Indian migrants to England during the postcolonial period. The poem speaks of the desire of West Indians to leave their homeland and go to England, where they would be seen as equals, free from the oppressive colonial rule. Bennett crafts the poem in Jamaican Creole, a language that played a significant role in shaping the identity of the West Indian population. The use of this language connects to the cultural identity of the community, which is perceived as being inferior to that of the English.
The poem is written in free verse, and the language used by the poet is significant in conveying the themes of identity and displacement. Through the use of Jamaican Creole, the poet paints a vivid picture of the West Indian migrants who have left their homeland in search of a better life in England. The poem’s opening lines call upon the ‘coloured’ people to go back to their roots, their native lands, to their countries and homes, and to forget the idea of living in cold and wet climates of England.
Bennett’s use of metaphor is also significant in conveying the themes of identity and displacement. In the third stanza of “Colonization in Reverse,” the poet describes England as being a plantation that is worked on by the West Indian people. This metaphor compares the treatment of West Indian migrants in England to the oppressive treatment they received while working on plantations in their homeland. It implies that even though they had left their homeland, they were still being exploited and treated as if they were still under colonial rule.
Langston Hughes' poem "Theme for English B," on the other hand, explores the theme of identity, particularly in terms of race, in a similar vein to Bennett's poem. However, unlike Bennett, Hughes writes in standard English, a language that connects with both black and white audiences. The poem explores the narrator’s struggle to establish his identity as a black man living in a predominantly white society. The poem’s opening line summarizes the theme of the poem, “I am the only colored student in my class.”
Hughes' structure is significant in conveying the theme of identity in the poem. The poem is written in free verse, but it is divided into stanzas of varying lengths, which represent the different stages of the narrator's journey to identity. The first three stanzas describe the narrator’s background, beliefs and interests. The fourth stanza, in which the poem’s climax is reached, captures the narrator’s feelings of disillusionment and confusion that came with the realization that his experiences were not unique to him alone.
Hughes’ use of metaphor is also significant in conveying the themes of identity and displacement. The narrator compares his experiences to those of white people to highlight the marginalization and discrimination that comes with being black in America. The metaphor of the page, which represents the narrator’s writing, mirrors the exclusion and marginalization that he has experienced in society based on his race. The use of such literary devices serves to highlight the challenges faced by the black community in clinging on to their identity while also trying to integrate into American society.
In conclusion, "Colonization in Reverse" by Louise Bennett and "Theme for English B" by Langston Hughes offer a critical portrayal of identity and displacement through language, structure, and literary devices. The two poems link the themes to the experiences of the black community and how these experiences shape their identities. Bennett’s use of Jamaican Creole is significant in conveying the cultural identity of West Indian migrants, while Hughes writes in standard English that appeals to both black and white audiences. Despite the difference in language and structure, both poets use metaphor to highlight the challenges encountered by the black community in integrating into American society, to challenge the exclusivity and marginalization that comes with being of African descent in America.
