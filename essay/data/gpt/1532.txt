Yield management is a pricing strategy used in the hospitality industry to maximize revenue by charging different prices for a room based on the time of booking, demand, and other factors. While yield management can provide a hotel with a competitive advantage and increase profits, its perceived fairness can be questionable. In this essay, we will discuss the fairness of yield management, the benefits of rate fences, and the practice of overbooking, as well as make recommendations for a hotel in Edinburgh to improve its yield management system.
One of the main criticisms of yield management is that it is unfair to customers who might feel that they are being charged arbitrary prices for a room. This is particularly true in the case of dynamic pricing, where prices can fluctuate greatly depending on demand. However, while dynamic pricing may seem unfair, it is actually a reflection of the supply and demand of the market. Prices are determined by demand, and as such, customers are paying for the convenience of booking a room at a particular time. In other words, the perceived unfairness of yield management is a result of a lack of understanding of how market forces operate.
One way to address the perceived unfairness of yield management is through the use of rate fences. Rate fences are a way of segmenting customers based on their willingness to pay for different room types and services. For example, a hotel might offer lower rates to customers who book well in advance or on weekdays, while charging higher rates for last-minute bookings or weekend stays. By using rate fences, hotels can charge different prices for different customers based on their willingness to pay, without causing resentment among customers who feel they are being unfairly charged.
Another benefit of rate fences is that they can increase customer satisfaction. By segmenting customers based on their willingness to pay, hotels can provide different levels of service to different customers. For example, a customer who is willing to pay more for a room might receive additional perks such as a complimentary breakfast or access to a fitness center. This not only provides a better experience for high-paying customers but also makes them feel valued by the hotel.
While rate fences can be effective in improving the perceived fairness of yield management and increasing customer satisfaction, there is also the practice of overbooking to consider. Overbooking is when a hotel accepts reservations for more rooms than are available, in the expectation that some customers will cancel or fail to arrive. While overbooking may allow a hotel to maximize occupancy and revenue, it can also result in customer dissatisfaction if it leads to guests being "walked" or relocated to another hotel.
To prevent customer dissatisfaction and improve the effectiveness of overbooking strategies, hotels can use data analysis to make more accurate predictions about reservation cancellations and no-shows. By using data to forecast demand and adjust booking policies accordingly, hotels can reduce the risk of overbooking and avoid having to relocate guests. This not only reduces the chance of customer dissatisfaction but also increases revenue by allowing the hotel to maximize occupancy without risking overbooking.
With these considerations in mind, we can provide recommendations to an Edinburgh hotel looking to improve its yield management system and prevent customer dissatisfaction. First, the hotel should use rate fences to segment customers based on their willingness to pay for different room types and services. This will allow the hotel to charge different prices for different customers without causing resentment or dissatisfaction. For example, the hotel could offer lower rates to customers who book well in advance or on weekdays, while charging higher rates for last-minute bookings or weekend stays.
Second, the hotel should use data analysis to make more accurate predictions about reservation cancellations and no-shows. By using data to forecast demand and adjust booking policies accordingly, the hotel can reduce the risk of overbooking and avoid having to relocate guests. This not only reduces the chance of customer dissatisfaction but also increases revenue by allowing the hotel to maximize occupancy without risking overbooking.
Finally, the hotel should communicate clearly with guests about its yield management strategies. By being transparent about how prices are determined and why overbooking occurs, the hotel can build trust and reduce the likelihood of customer dissatisfaction. For example, the hotel could provide information on its website or at check-in about its dynamic pricing strategies, rate fences, and overbooking policies.
In conclusion, while yield management can be an effective pricing strategy for hotels, its perceived fairness can be questionable. However, by using rate fences, practicing effective overbooking strategies, and communicating clearly with guests, hotels can improve the perceived fairness of yield management and increase customer satisfaction. For hotels in Edinburgh, in particular, these strategies can help to maximize occupancy and revenue without risking customer dissatisfaction.
