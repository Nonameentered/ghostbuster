Insider dealing is a controversial practice that has been ongoing for decades in the financial industry. Insider dealing, also referred to as insider trading, occurs when an individual uses non-public information to buy or sell securities, thereby making a profit or avoiding a loss. Since insider dealing often involves individuals with privileged access to confidential information, it is a complex regulatory issue that requires proper scrutiny and surveillance to prevent and punish. This essay aims to analyze whether insider dealing should be subject to regulation and criminal sanctions, while shedding light on the current regulatory system's effectiveness.
One of the primary reasons why insider dealing should be regulated and sanctioned is to uphold ethical standards in the financial industry. Insider dealing is an unethical practice that creates an unfair advantage for a select few and undermines the integrity of the financial markets. When a small group of individuals has access to confidential company information, they can make informed decisions on when to buy or sell securities and gain an advantage over other market participants. This not only undermines free market competition but also erodes public trust in the financial sector. Therefore, imposing criminal sanctions on individuals found guilty of insider dealing would serve as a deterrent to potential violators and restore trust in the industry.
Another reason that supports the regulation and criminal sanction of insider dealing is its negative impact on the economy. Insider dealing is illegal since it is misleading and disadvantages small investors who do not have access to confidential information. This creates a perception that the capital markets are not level, leading to a decline in investor confidence, loss of investment opportunities, and decreased economic growth. Therefore regulating insider dealing and imposing criminal sanctions to culprits will enhance market confidence, reduce market manipulation, and promote compliance with ethical standards.
However, the current regulatory system may not be effective enough to prevent and prosecute insider dealing. The regulatory authorities lack the technical capacity, insufficient financial resources, and limitations on their jurisdiction. These limitations create room for manipulation and insider dealing, given the lack of sufficient and reliable regulation. There is a need to enhance the current regulatory system to prevent and detect insider dealing, establish clear regulatory oversight, and empower regulatory authorities to bring culprits to justice. Increasing the regulatory resources, enhancing the regulatory body's independence, and conducting more thorough investigations can help improve monitoring and regulation.
Additionally, criminal sanctions should be limited to specific individuals to prevent the arbitrary use of criminal sanctions. Some individuals might unknowingly engage in insider trading without significant adverse effects on the stakeholders involved. Therefore, criminal sanctions should be limited to bad-faith or flagrant conduct that results in direct harm to third parties. The use of targeted sanctions based on the level of severity of the offence committed is vital to ensuring equity, fairness, and justice in the regulatory process.
In conclusion, insider dealing is a contentious issue that undermines the ethical conduct of the financial sector and threatens the stability of the economy. Regulating and imposing criminal sanctions on insider dealing would help maintain a fair and just financial system, protect small investors, and promote market confidence. However, the effectiveness of current regulation systems to prevent and punish insider dealing is questionable. An enhanced regulatory system is necessary to strengthen monitoring, detection and establish clear regulatory oversight. Limited criminal sanctions based on the level of severity of the offence committed are vital to ensuring equity, fairness, and justice in the regulatory process. By implementing these changes, insider dealing will be minimized, investor confidence restored, and the financial market integrity upheld.
