Working memory is a crucial mechanism of the cognitive system that allows individuals to temporarily hold and manipulate information in order to complete complex mental tasks. Working memory is a limited capacity system that operates by taking in incoming information, manipulating it, and then either discarding it or transferring it to long-term memory. The present essay will discuss the components of working memory, including phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the central executive, their functions, as well as the experiments that support these theories.
The first component of working memory that will be discussed is the phonological loop. The phonological loop is responsible for the temporary storage of verbal information including numbers, words, and sentences. The phonological loop comprises of two sub-components, the phonological store, and articulatory control process. The phonological store is responsible for the temporary storage of verbal information for a few seconds inside the working memory. On the other hand, the articulatory control process is responsible for the rehearsal of verbal information. The articulatory control process allows individuals to mentally articulate words, sentences, or numbers, which work to refresh the material in the phonological store and maintain it in the working memory.
The phonological loop was first introduced by Baddeley and colleagues (1975) who conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of phonological similarity in short-term memory. The study used lists of monosyllabic words that had either similar sounding or different sounding endings. The participants were asked to recall the lists shortly after hearing them. The results indicated that the participants had more difficulty recalling lists with similar sounding endings than those with different sounding endings. The findings suggest that the phonological loop is responsible for a temporary, auditory-based storage mechanism for verbal material.
The second component of working memory is the visuo-spatial sketchpad. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of visual and spatial information. The visuo-spatial sketchpad allows individuals to mentally visualize images and their relationships inside the working memory. The visuo-spatial sketchpad enables individuals to solve complex problems that require the manipulation and transformation of visual and spatial information.
The visuo-spatial sketchpad was first introduced by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) in their dual-task experiment that used a concurrent task. Participants were required to complete two tasks simultaneously-one involved remembering a sequence of numbers, while the other involved remembering a series of spatial arrangements. The findings indicated that the participants made more errors when both tasks required the same component of memory; this suggested two independent memory systems- auditory and visuo-spatial working memory stores.
The central executive is also a crucial component of working memory. The central executive is responsible for the control of attention, the coordination of information from the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory. The central executive serves as the primary control mechanism of working memory, as it helps in the integration of the attentional control, decision making, and planning of behavior.
The central executive is responsible for allocating attention when needed, choosing what information needs to be processed, and carrying on the manipulation of information in working memory. The function of the central executive makes it crucial for cognitive processes like decision making, problem-solving, and task switching.
The importance of the central executive and the dual-task interference effect were investigated by Baddeley (1986). In his study, participants were asked to complete two tasks simultaneously. One task was tailored to overload the phonological loop, while the other task was tailored to overload the visuo-spatial sketchpad. The results demonstrated that performance of both tasks was disrupted, which suggests that the central executive is necessary for task processing.
In conclusion, working memory comprises of three components including the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the central executive. The phonological loop is responsible for the temporary storage and rehearsal of verbal information, while the visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of visual and spatial information. The central executive is responsible for the control of attention, the coordination of information from the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory. These three components of working memory work simultaneously to allow individuals to manipulate and use information in their immediate surroundings in a flexible and adaptive manner. The present essay also provided examples of experiments that support the theories behind the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad to better understand the working of these components. Ultimately, the understanding of this mechanism can assist in the development of better educational techniques, improve work performance, and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of memory disorders that affect the capacity of working memory.
