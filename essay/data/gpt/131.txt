The migrations to New England and the Chesapeake colonies in the early seventeenth century were both a part of the larger push to colonize the North American continent, though they differed significantly in terms of the demographic characteristics, social status, and their motives. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the demographic characteristics, social status, and motives of those who migrated to New England and the Chesapeake colonies. Additionally, I will examine the differences in the societies the migrants created, including the influence of Native American relations and disease.
The demographic characteristics of those who migrated to New England and the Chesapeake colonies differed significantly. In New England, the vast majority of migrants were English Puritans seeking to escape the religious persecution and political turmoil in England. These migrants were predominantly English families who were relatively well-educated and affluent, with many having experience in various trades. However, the Chesapeake region, which encompasses modern-day Maryland and Virginia, attracted a far different demographic. The majority of those who migrated to Maryland and Virginia were indentured servants, some of whom were children as young as ten years old. Both free and enslaved Africans were also brought to the Chesapeake to work on tobacco plantations.
In terms of social status, those who migrated to New England possessed a higher social status compared to those who migrated to the Chesapeake. The New Englanders were primarily small to mid-sized farmers, skilled artisans, merchants, and professionals such as lawyers, ministers, and teachers. Many of the New England migrants were affluent and educated, and they had high cultural expectations for their communities. Additionally, most of the New England migrants had a significant degree of control over their migration process and could travel with their families and possessions. Conversely, those who migrated to the Chesapeake colonies were almost exclusively poor, struggled considerably, and did not have a lot of social status or cultural expectations. They mostly came from the servant and tenant society of England and were paid little for their work. In the beginning, many of them could not afford to travel with their families, while some were brought over as indentured servants, having signed contracts whereby they agreed to work for a set number of years in exchange for passage to the new world.
The motives of those who migrated to New England and the Chesapeake colonies also differed greatly. As mentioned earlier, the Puritans who migrated to New England did so primarily to escape religious persecution and the political chaos in England. They aimed to create a theocratic society where they could practice their religion freely. Many of the New England migrants were motivated by a desire to be self-sufficient, expanding both the solvency and opportunities for economic growth. On the other hand, those who migrated to the Chesapeake colonies were motivated almost entirely by economic opportunities. The Virginia Company, which established the Jamestown colony in 1607, hoped to find gold or any other precious minerals that might enrich the investors and to help the Virginia Company establish a profitable trade settlement. For most of the men and boys who came to work in the Chesapeake region, their primary motivation was to earn wages or become independent landowners.
The societies that the migrants created were vastly different. The New England colonies, which included Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, were predominantly Puritan in religion and had a strong social and moral foundation. The Puritans believed in the idea of a "calling from God," where they saw their work and personal life as an answer to their salvation. This Puritan ethic created a disciplined and industrious society that heavily contributed to their economic growth. The Puritan society mandated that everyone be educated, and they established schools, as literacy was essential for the success of their people. They also had more homogeneous societies and little input from Native Americans in their development. The Chesapeake colonies, on the other hand, were centered entirely on agriculture and relied on the African slave trade for their economic growth. The society was stratified, with wealthy landowners exploiting cheap labor from indentured servants, while many African slaves were forced into inhumane conditions. One of the most definitive experiences in the Chesapeake colonies was the rapid spread of disease, with native populations experiencing mortality rates as high as 50%.
Finally, the issue of Native American relations and disease played significant roles in the development of these two distinct societies. The English Puritans who came to New England were exceptionally intolerant to anyone who was different from them. This meant that they often mistreated the Native Americans who were inhabiting New England lands. This practice resulted in years of conflict that finally ended with the Native Americans accepting coexistence. Generally, the New England colonies had less exposure to diseases such as smallpox due to their homogeneous societies and seafaring lifestyles. On the other hand, the Chesapeake colonies had significantly more contact with Native Americans and, as a result, experienced greater exposure to diseases such as smallpox and influenza. These diseases decimated early Chesapeake settlements and contributed to the colony's unpredictable nature.
In conclusion, the New England colonies and the Chesapeake colonies had different demographic characteristics, social status, and motives leading to migration until 1640. The New England colony primarily attracted English Puritans seeking religious freedom, had relatively higher social status and cultural attainment, and saw their society built around a strong moral and ethical foundation. Meanwhile, the Chesapeake colony was predominantly driven by economic interests and attracted poor indentured servants and enslaved Africans who played a significant role in shaping the society. Overall, the New England colonies had less of a culture of intolerance, while the Chesapeake colonies witnessed a great deal of abuse and exploitation of poor workers of all races. This essay has also highlighted the significant role that different environmental factors played in each region's different societies, such as Native American relations and the rapid spread of diseases.
