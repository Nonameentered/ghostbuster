In the poem “The Convergence of the Twain” by Thomas Hardy, the author utilizes various poetic techniques to convey the theme of guilt and the repercussions of violent actions. Through the use of alliteration, personification, and symbolism, Hardy creates a haunting and powerful poem that reflects upon the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic and the overwhelming sense of guilt that resulted from it. The poem’s use of these techniques help to draw attention to the destructive consequences of pride and vanity and the price that can be paid for humanity’s tendency toward overindulgence.
One of the key poetic techniques that Hardy utilizes in the poem is alliteration. Throughout the poem, Hardy employs a variety of repeating consonant sounds to create a sense of ominous foreboding. For example, in the first stanza, Hardy writes, “In a solitude of the sea / Deep from human vanity.” Here, the repeated “s” sound serves to emphasize the idea of being alone and isolated, highlighting the tragedy of the Titanic’s sinking. Additionally, the use of alliteration in the following lines, “Steel chambers, late the pyres / Of her salamandrine fires” further emphasizes the destructive nature of human vanity and the consequences that can come from it. By using alliteration, the poem produces a sense of unease, and the emphasis placed on certain words builds upon the theme of guilt and regret.
In addition to alliteration, the author utilizes the technique of personification to evoke emotion and create a sense of empathy within the reader. Through personifying the Titanic, the poem gains a sense of pathos and becomes a commentary on the nature of humanity and the consequences of our choices. For example, in the second stanza, Hardy writes, “The moonbeams slid on the slumbering waves, / And the waves were white with fleet-winged ships,” painting a picture of a peaceful and serene ocean. However, the image is soon disrupted by the description of the Titanic – “And the laughing stars lay down.” Through the use of personification, the image of the stars laughing is jarring, and serves to remind the reader of the destruction that pride and vanity can bring. The personification of the Titanic is also seen throughout the poem, such as in the line “Till the Spinner of the Years / Said ‘Now!’” By using this personification, Hardy creates a sense of connection between the ship and the reader, allowing the tragedy to be more relatable and impactful.
Furthermore, the use of symbolism throughout the poem adds to the themes that underlie it. The use of the iceberg, for example, is a powerful symbol of the destructive consequences of human vanity. Throughout the poem, the iceberg is described in a way that emphasizes its power and destructive nature, such as when Hardy writes that it “towered up between / The stars and the sun.” This description contrasts with the Titanics’ description, which is full of pride and glory: “And they smiled to think God's greatness / Flowed around our incompleteness." This contrast serves to emphasize the hubris that led to the ship’s downfall, while also highlighting the destructive power of nature and the consequences that can come when humanity oversteps its bounds.
Ultimately, the use of these poetic techniques is essential in conveying the central themes of the poem. Through the use of alliteration, and personification, the poem creates a sense of foreboding and impending doom, while the use of symbolism serves to illustrate the cost of overindulgence and the destructive power of nature. The theme of guilt and regret is brought to the forefront, reminding readers of the tragedies that result from our actions and the importance of acknowledging and learning from our mistakes.
In conclusion, Thomas Hardy's “The Convergence of the Twain” uses various poetic tools to effectively explore the themes of guilt, pride, and the destructive nature of humanity. The use of alliteration, personification, and symbolism create a haunting and powerful poem that encourages readers to consider the consequences of their actions and the destructive nature of pride and vanity. Through the careful use of language and imagery, Hardy delivers a poignant commentary on human nature, reminding us of the importance of humility and the need to be aware of the consequences of our actions. The poem serves as a powerful reminder of the tragic history of the Titanic and the importance of examining our own role in history and the responsibility we have to learn from our past mistakes.
