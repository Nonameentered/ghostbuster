Oticon is a Danish hearing aid manufacturer that was established in 1904. The organization is well-known for the introduction of radical HR policies to improve their business performance. The company found itself under tremendous business pressures, which were leading to financial losses and low productivity rates. Therefore, Oticon underwent a major transformation process by changing its culture and structure. The company also utilized a unique motivational function of reward and recognition designed to improve employee morale and productivity.
Oticon's HR policies have shown great results in many ways. Firstly, the organization was under pressure due to the frequent changes in the market and the introduction of modern technology. The company lacked the latest technology and the ability to produce in small batches. This led to significant losses in sales, which hurt the bottom-line of Oticon. To mitigate these pressures, the company decided to completely restructure its HR policies.
The change was radical, as the company dismissed many of its senior employees and hired young and dynamic employees. Oticon also changed its work culture from a hierarchical and bureaucratic one to a non-hierarchical and open one. These changes resulted in a more agile environment that was able to make quick decisions and changes in response to market needs. The newly restructured organization was highly receptive to change from within and was focused on becoming innovative. The HR policies made Oticon responsive to market conditions and the changing environment.
Another area where the HR policies proved effective was in the application of motivational rewards and recognition. Oticon employed a unique program called "spaghetti organization," which involved the creation of many cross-functional groups. The program helped each employee to take personal responsibility for their work. Employees were given the freedom to put forward their ideas and have them evaluated by other employees. This was a radical but highly effective approach that rewarded innovation and encouraged employees to take ownership of their work.
The motivational function of reward and recognition was also applied to the compensation structure of Oticon. The company adopted the "pay-for-performance" model, which linked employee compensation to their performance. This approach incentivized employees to work harder and produce higher quality work to receive rewards and recognition. 
The HR policies of Oticon were based on several theoretical concepts. The company adopted Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of motivation to identify the key motivators for the employees. The company also made changes to the hygiene factors that could lead to dissatisfaction among employees to improve the work environment. The adoption of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory was another important concept that helped the organization motivate its employees in an effective manner. These theories helped Oticon to determine the factors that could help to motivate its employees and improve their job satisfaction.
The restructuring process at Oticon led to some unintended consequences. The changes were so radical that some employees resisted the new way of doing things. The company also had to make significant investments in training and development to acclimate the new employees to the intended culture and structure. The spaghetti organization led to some confusion among employees due to the absence of the hierarchical structure. These internal issues hindered the productivity of the company.
In conclusion, Oticon was wise to adopt these HR policies to overcome the business pressures it was facing. The changes were radical but proved highly effective at turning the company around and creating a more healthy and productive work environment. The motivational function of reward and recognition was a key aspect of the HR policies applied by Oticon. The company applied several theoretical concepts, such as Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, to determine the factors that could motivate its employees. Though Oticon faced unintended consequences of these policies, the overall impact was highly positive, leading to a complete transformation of the company.
