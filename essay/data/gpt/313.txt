Credit rationing has been a prevalent issue in financial markets around the world, and it refers to the inability of borrowers to obtain sufficient credit at reasonable terms even when they are willing and able to pay the prevailing interest rates. The concept of credit rationing arises from the presence of information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, which makes it difficult for lenders to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers accurately. In such situations, lenders may resort to rationing credit as a risk management strategy, resulting in a suboptimal allocation of resources in the economy. In this essay, we will discuss the concept of credit rationing, the role of imperfect information in explaining it, and critically analyze the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models and their impact on the efficient allocation of resources. We will also discuss the empirical evidence on credit rationing and its possible impact on the Argentine economy and address the criticisms of the imperfect information assumption's ability to explain credit rationing.
The concept of credit rationing arises when lenders restrict the supply of credit to borrowers, leading to a reduction in the demand for credit at the prevailing interest rates. This phenomenon occurs when lenders have incomplete or imperfect information about the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, making it difficult for them to assess the likelihood of non-payment accurately. A lack of information can also lead to adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Adverse selection occurs when borrowers with risky credit profiles are more likely to apply for loans than those with good credit profiles. This phenomenon creates an asymmetric information problem for lenders, who have to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers. Moral hazard arises when borrowers have an incentive to engage in risky behavior, knowing that they will not bear the full cost of default. This phenomenon creates an additional risk for lenders who have to evaluate the likelihood of borrowers engaging in risky behavior.
Jaffee and Russell (1976) introduced the theory of credit rationing by examining the conditions under which lenders ration credit in the presence of information asymmetry. They argued that credit rationing arises under two conditions. First, there must be a market imperfection, which results in an inefficient allocation of resources. Second, there must be an asymmetric information problem that results in lenders being unable to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers accurately. Jaffee and Russell identified four possible equilibria in the credit market: a separating equilibrium, a pooling equilibrium, a partial separating equilibrium, and a partial pooling equilibrium.
In the separating equilibrium, lenders can distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers, and they offer different interest rates to each group. High-risk borrowers are charged higher interest rates, reflecting the higher probability of default, while low-risk borrowers are charged lower interest rates. As a result, high-risk borrowers may be excluded from the credit market, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. In the pooling equilibrium, lenders offer the same interest rate to all borrowers, regardless of their credit risk. This equilibrium is suboptimal, as low-risk borrowers are disadvantaged by being charged a higher interest rate than they would be in a separating equilibrium, while high-risk borrowers are charged a lower interest rate than they would be in a separating equilibrium. In the partial separating equilibrium, lenders are able to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers, but they are unable to offer separate interest rates. This equilibrium is also suboptimal, as high-risk borrowers may be rationed out of the market, while low-risk borrowers may be charged a higher interest rate than they would be in a separating equilibrium. In the partial pooling equilibrium, lenders offer different interest rates to high-risk and low-risk borrowers, but the difference in interest rates is not sufficient to induce high-risk borrowers to exit the market. As a result, this equilibrium is suboptimal, as low-risk borrowers are charged a higher interest rate than they would be in a separating equilibrium, while high-risk borrowers are not charged enough to compensate for their higher probability of default.
Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) built on the Jaffee and Russell (1976) model and introduced the concept of a credit ceiling, which refers to the maximum loan size that a borrower can obtain. They argued that lenders face a trade-off between the size of the loan and the probability of default. As the loan size increases, the probability of default also increases, leading to a higher expected loss for the lender. If lenders are unable to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers, they may set a credit ceiling that is lower than the loan size that would result in the optimal allocation of resources. This credit ceiling creates credit rationing, as some borrowers may be unable to obtain sufficient credit to finance their investments, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources.
Both the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models highlight the importance of imperfect information in explaining credit rationing. They demonstrate that when lenders are unable to accurately assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, they may ration credit as a risk management strategy, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. However, these models have been subject to some criticism, particularly regarding their empirical relevance and their ability to explain credit rationing in developing countries.
Empirical evidence suggests that credit rationing is prevalent in many economies, including developed countries such as the United States and developing countries such as Argentina. For example, a study by Petersen and Rajan (1995) found that small firms in the United States faced credit rationing, with many firms unable to obtain the amount of credit they desired. Similarly, a study by Pagano and Jappelli (1993) found evidence of credit rationing in Italy. In developing countries, credit rationing is also prevalent, with firms and households unable to access formal credit markets due to a lack of collateral or credit history (Werth and Brosnan, 2014). In Argentina, credit rationing has been a significant problem, with limited access to credit markets due to macroeconomic instability, legal restrictions, and political uncertainty (Cavallo and Blanchard, 1991).
Critics of the Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models argue that the imperfect information assumption is not the only factor that drives credit rationing. They contend that other market imperfections, such as limited competition, financial market imperfections, and regulatory restrictions, can also contribute to credit rationing. For example, Rochet and Tirole (1996) argue that credit rationing can arise due to market power, where lenders can extract surplus from borrowers by setting high interest rates. In this case, credit rationing reflects a market failure rather than an information failure. Similarly, Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) argue that credit rationing can arise due to financial market imperfections, such as the limited availability of collateral or the inexperience of lenders in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In conclusion, credit rationing arises when lenders restrict the supply of credit to borrowers, leading to a suboptimal allocation of resources in the economy. The imperfect information problem is a key driver of credit rationing, as lenders have incomplete or inaccurate information about the creditworthiness of borrowers. The Jaffee and Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) models highlight the importance of the imperfect information problem in driving credit rationing, and their impact on the efficient allocation of resources has been studied extensively. However, these models have also been subject to criticism, particularly regarding their empirical relevance and their ability to explain credit rationing in developing countries. In practice, credit rationing is prevalent in many economies, and other market imperfections, such as limited competition and financial market imperfections, can also contribute to credit rationing. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that drive credit rationing and to develop policies that can mitigate its negative impacts on the economy.
