Multinational organizations are expanding their operations into international markets at an ever-increasing rate. As a result, they need to consider a range of factors when developing human resource strategies in these new markets. One of the key considerations is the impact of geographical and cultural factors on people management approaches. This essay will analyze these factors using the Lakeside Group's expansion into the Kenyan market as an example, and provide recommendations for appropriate people management strategies. Additionally, we will discuss the importance of incorporating local community needs in HR planning.
The Lakeside Group, a global provider of water filtration systems, has recently expanded its operations into the Kenyan market. The company faced various challenges in developing a human resource strategy for this new market. One significant challenge was the geographical disparity between the company's headquarters in the United States and its new office in Kenya. The distance made it challenging to manage and oversee employees in Kenya. Other factors that the company had to consider included cultural differences, socio-economic disparities, and language barriers.
Cultural differences are often the most significant challenge for multinational organizations when developing HR strategies. In Kenya, the culture is markedly different from that of the United States. For example, the work-life balance is more heavily weighted toward personal life in Kenya. Additionally, the hierarchical structure is more pronounced in Kenyan businesses than in the United States. These differences impacted the management style of Lakeside's Kenyan office, which had to be adapted to suit the local culture.
The socio-economic disparities of the Kenyan market also impacted HR strategies. In Kenya, the average wage is far lower than in the United States. As a result, Lakeside had to adapt its compensation strategies to suit local expectations. Additionally, many Kenyan employees may not have had prior experience in a corporate setting. So, the company would have had to develop training programs to help employees adapt to their new work environment.
The language barrier is also an important factor to consider. English is the national language in Kenya, but local languages such as Swahili are more commonly spoken. Therefore, Lakeside had to consider the language skills of employees when making hiring decisions. The company would have needed to recruit employees who were proficient in English and Swahili to ensure effective communication in the workplace.
In light of these challenges, Lakeside had to adapt its people management strategies to suit the Kenyan market. For instance, the company had to adopt a more hierarchical management structure and modify recruiting policies by ensuring diversity and inclusion. It also had to establish training programs to help employees adapt to the corporate work environment in Kenya. Lastly, it had to implement a compensation strategy that was more appropriate for the local market.
Recommendations for appropriate people management strategies include implementing a localized approach to HR policies. This approach involves tailoring HR strategies to suit the local culture and market dynamics of the new market. For instance, companies that want to operate in Kenya could consider adopting a more hierarchical management structure and modifying recruitment policies by ensuring diversity. Additionally, companies should ensure that employees are sufficiently trained in critical skills and core competencies that are relevant to the business. This is to make sure that they can successfully adapt to their work environment.
Effective HR strategies in international markets should also consider the incorporation of local community needs. For instance, Lakeside could ensure that its HR strategy aligned with Kenya's policy objectives, such as the National Employment Policy of 2015, which aims to promote inclusive growth and social equity. Also, companies could consider Local Content Policies, which will require that a certain percentage of their labor force and raw materials used in the production process are sourced from the local market. Such policies could promote social equity and community development in the host market.
In conclusion, successful multinational organizations must consider several factors when developing human resource strategies for international markets. Cultural differences, socio-economic disparities, language barriers, and geographical separation are some of the most significant challenges. To succeed in the Kenyan market, the Lakeside Group had to adapt its people management strategies to suit local conditions. This adaptation included developing training programs and modifying compensation and management structures. For other companies looking to enter the Kenyan market, it is essential to focus on tailoring HR strategies to suit the local culture and market dynamics to ensure success. Additionally, companies must consider the importance of incorporating local community needs in their HR planning. By doing this, they can create a more conducive work environment for employees and contribute to the social and economic development of the host market.
