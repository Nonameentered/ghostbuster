Introduction:
Compotech Industries Plc is faced with a challenge of how to increase the production capacity of the Flexi-Connector component. They have three alternative options, and this essay explores these options, their advantages and disadvantages and which two options would be the most advisable to focus on. The essay further explores the Net Present Value (NPV) method in evaluating investment opportunities, its advantages, and disadvantages.
Alternative Options:
1. Upgrade the current production process:
The first alternative option would be to upgrade the current production process of the Flexi-Connector component. This would involve investing in new machinery and equipment such as automated machines that would increase production efficiency, reduce production lead times, and increase production capacity. This option would require a significant capital investment.
2. Outsourcing:
The second alternative option would be to outsource the production of the Flexi-Connector component to a third-party manufacturer. This alternative could be cheaper and faster compared to upgrading the current production process as it would eliminate the need for capital investments in new equipment. This option would, however, come with some risks, such as quality control, transportation costs, and communication challenges.
3. Building a new production plant:
The third alternative option would be to build a new production plant that would exclusively produce the Flexi-Connector component. This option would require significant capital investments, including land and building costs and the acquisition of new machinery and equipment. However, this alternative would offer full production control, eliminate the risks associated with outsourcing, and accommodate future production expansion. 
Evaluation of Alternative Options:
To assess these three options for Compotech Industries Plc, the Net Present Value (NPV) method would be ideal. NPV evaluates net present value by considering the present values of future cash inflows and outflows. The NPV formula would be as follows:
NPV = (CF1 / (1 + r) ^1) + (CF2 / (1 + r) ^2) ... (CFn / (1 + r) ^n) - Initial investment
Where CF is the cash flow, r is the discount rate, CF1 is the cash flow during the first year of the investment, and n is the number of years during which the project is expected to generate cash flows.
Advantages of using NPV:
1. Consideration of all relevant cash flows: NPV considers all relevant cash flows related to a project, including initial investments, operating costs, and projected future revenues.
2. Time value of money: By discounting cash flows, NPV accounts for the time value of money. A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future.
3. Intuitive interpretation: A positive NPV indicates that the investment is profitable, while a negative value indicates a loss.
Disadvantages of using NPV:
1. Selection of the discount rate is subjective: The selection of the discount rate is subjective, and different people may have different perspectives on this rate.
2. Inconsistent assumptions: The output of NPV is affected by the consistency of assumptions, which may vary from one project to another.
3. Difficulty in quantifying intangible benefits: It may not be easy to quantify intangible benefits that are not readily convertible into monetary values when calculating the NPV.
Based on the NPV evaluation, the second and third alternative options are the most advisable to focus on. Outsourcing would require a lower initial investment and could, therefore, generate a positive NPV value in the short term. Building a new production plant would offer full control, accommodate production expansion in the future, and eliminate outsourcing risks. 
Conclusion:
In conclusion, Compotech Industries Plc has three alternative options for increasing the production capacity of the Flexi-Connector component. The NPV method is an effective tool for evaluating these options, enabling the selection of the two most advisable alternatives to focus on. Outsourcing and building a new production plant are the most advisable options. NPV, however, has some disadvantages, such as inconsistencies in assumptions and the difficulty of quantifying intangible benefits that need to be taken into consideration before making investment decisions.
