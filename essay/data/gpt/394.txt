George Berkeley, an Irish philosopher, was a prominent figure in the 18th century and is widely known for his idealist philosophy. Berkeley’s philosophical views are deeply rooted in the idea of immaterialism or idealism, which proposes that the material world that we perceive around us is not real but merely a construct of our minds. In his argument against the possibility of conceiving an unperceived thing, Berkeley used his imagistic theory of understanding to explain why this idea is impossible to conceive. This essay will explore Berkeley's argument, the role that his imagistic theory of understanding played in the development of this argument, how the argument could collapse if it is proven to be invalid, and the implications that this would have for his overall description of the world.
Berkeley argues that “to be is to be perceived” and that everything that exists can only be perceived by the mind. He posits that the material objects that we see, hear, touch, or smell are merely ideas in our mind and are not real in the sense that they exist independently of perception. According to Berkeley, if something is not perceived, then it does not exist. Thus, the idea of an unperceived thing, something that exists but is not perceived, is absurd.
Berkeley’s imagistic theory of understanding plays an important role in his argument against the possibility of conceiving an unperceived thing. This theory states that all knowledge is based on sensory experience and that the mind is incapable of abstract thinking. According to Berkeley, the mind does not have the power to conceive anything that is not derived from sensory experience. Therefore, the mind cannot conceive of an unperceived thing, as it is not something that can be perceived. In other words, if we cannot form an image of something in our minds, then it cannot exist.
To understand this argument in more detail, let us consider an example. Suppose we are presented with a table. According to Berkeley, what we perceive as a table is not an object that exists independently of our perception. Instead, it is simply an idea in our mind, created by our sensory experience. We perceive the table through our senses, and our mind creates an idea of the table based on these perceptions. If we were to stop perceiving the table, then the idea of the table would cease to exist as well. Therefore, the concept of an unperceived table is impossible to conceive, as it would require something to exist without perception.
Now, let us explore how Berkeley's argument could collapse if it is proven to be invalid. If we are able to conceive of an unperceived thing, then it would contradict Berkeley's argument that everything that exists can only be perceived. Additionally, if our capability to conceive of unperceived things is not limited to sensory perception, this could indicate that the imagistic theory of understanding is inadequate. It could imply that the mind is capable of abstract thought and can conceive of ideas that do not rely on sensory experience. 
However, it is essential to note that Berkeley's argument cannot be disproved in this manner. The claim that everything that exists can only be perceived is a fundamental assumption that Berkeley makes while proposing his idealist philosophy. Any attempt to disprove this claim would require empirical evidence that runs contrary to the nature of his argument.
Furthermore, if Berkeley's argument is proven to be invalid, it could have significant implications for his overall description of the world. His idealist philosophy would lose its foundation, and the entire framework of his metaphysical worldview would be called into question. If we can conceive of an unperceived thing, then it would suggest that an external reality exists that is not dependent on our mental perceptions. It would imply that there is a real world that exists independently of us, rather than the world being a mere construct of our mind's perception. This would fundamentally contradict the crux of Berkeley's philosophy, where he believes that nothing exists independently of perception and the mind.
In conclusion, George Berkeley's argument against the possibility of conceiving an unperceived thing is based on his idealist philosophy, which proposes that the material world that we perceive around us is not real but merely a construct of our minds. He suggests that an unperceived thing is impossible to conceive, as everything that exists can only be perceived by the mind. This argument is deeply rooted in his imagistic theory of understanding, which posits that all knowledge is based on sensory experience. If Berkeley's argument were to be proven invalid, it would have significant implications for his overall description of the world, as it would challenge the foundation of his idealist philosophy and the entire framework of his metaphysical worldview. However, it is important to note that any attempt to disprove his argument would require empirical evidence that contradicts the nature of his argument, making it challenging to challenge his views.
