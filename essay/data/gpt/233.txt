Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. It is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread between animals and humans, and outbreaks have occurred in many parts of the world. In this essay, we will explore the history of tularemia, how it is contracted, its potential use as a biological weapon, and current information available on its lifecycles, symptoms, and incidence rates.
Tularemia was first discovered in 1911 by the bacteriologist Oskar Johannsen, who isolated the bacterium from dead ground squirrels in California. However, it was not until 1919 that the disease was identified as a human pathogen, after an outbreak in Tulare County, California. The disease was named after this county, and since then, numerous tularemia outbreaks have occurred across the United States, Europe, and Asia.
Tularemia can be contracted in several ways, including through the bite of infected ticks and mosquitoes, contact with infected animals or animal products, and inhalation of contaminated aerosols. The bacterium can survive in the environment for extended periods, making it a potential biological weapon. Its relatively low infectious dose and lethality make it an attractive biological weapon candidate.
In terms of its potential use as a biological weapon, tularemia was investigated as a possible biological weapon during World War II by several countries. The bacterium was tested on animals and humans in Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s. Afterward, the US and other countries continued to study tularemia as a potential biological weapon, developing it into an aerosol form that could be used for mass dissemination. Today, concerns persist about the possibility of tularemia being used as a biological weapon by terrorists or rogue states.
Currently, the incidence rates of tularemia are low, with most cases reported from Sweden, Finland, and Russia. In the US, tularemia is a rare disease, with an average of 118 cases reported annually between 2010 and 2014. The highest incidence rates are reported in the central and western parts of the US, where the disease is most prevalent in the summer months.
The lifecycle of F. tularensis is complex and involves several hosts. The bacterium primarily infects rodents, rabbits, and other small mammals and can be transmitted to humans through bites by infected ticks or mosquitoes. Additionally, humans can be infected by handling contaminated animal tissues, drinking contaminated water, or inhaling airborne bacteria. Once inside the body, the bacterium can survive and replicate inside immune cells, which then carry the bacteria to other organs, causing damage and symptoms. 
Symptoms of tularemia range from mild to severe and can include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and coughing. More severe cases can lead to pneumonia and sepsis, and if not treated promptly, the disease can be fatal. Tularemia is treated with antibiotics, such as streptomycin or gentamicin, and in mild cases, the disease can be self-limiting and resolve on its own.
To summarize, tularemia is a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium F. tularensis. The disease can be contracted through the bite of infected ticks and mosquitoes, contact with infected animals or animal products, and inhalation of contaminated aerosols. While the disease is a relatively rare occurrence, there are concerns about its potential use as a biological weapon. Current information available about the lifecycle, symptoms, and incidence rates of tularemia can help public health officials to take measures to prevent outbreaks and keep the public safe.
