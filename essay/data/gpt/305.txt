Efficiency wage theories propose that firms pay workers higher wages than the market equilibrium rate to enhance productivity and reduce turnover. The concept emerged as an explanation for why wages often exceed the lowest level required for the job, even in highly competitive markets. Efficiency wage theories suggest that higher wages incentivize workers to perform better, reducing monitoring and enforcement costs to motivate workers. Therefore, firms have an incentive to pay efficiency wages to maximize their profits. This essay will delve into efficiency wage theories and highlight their relationship with real wages, unemployment, and monitoring costs. It will also discuss the Shapiro-Stiglitz model and its assumptions and intuition to understand the concept of efficiency wages thoroughly.
The first efficiency wage theory was proposed by Solow in 1979. He suggested that higher wages improve workers’ health, reduce absenteeism, and increase their motivation to work hard. Solow hypothesized that firms would willingly pay higher wages to their employees if the benefits of higher pay exceed the costs. Another efficiency wage theory is the effort model proposed by Shirking. The effort model hypothesizes that workers may put in less effort when they do not feel important or fairly compensated for their work. This, in turn, can lead to decreased productivity and increased monitoring and enforcement costs for the firm. The key idea here is that workers' effort is not perfectly observable or contractible. In particular, contractors are less efficient in enforcing contracts when workers' effort cannot be verified beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, firms may pay wages above the market rate to incentivize workers to work harder. Higher wages reduce the value of shirking and, to some extent, monitoring costs as workers self-select to work hard.
A more complex efficiency wage theory is the Shapiro-Stiglitz model, first proposed in 1984. The Shapiro-Stiglitz model builds on Solow's idea that high wages reduce turnover rates, but also incorporates the Shirking model's understanding that workers' effort is not always observable. According to the Shapiro-Stiglitz model, firms can increase productivity by paying higher wages to motivate workers to work harder. The intuition behind this model is that the cost of worker selection is very high, and it is costly to find workers who have high-effort levels. Firms, therefore, pay wages higher than the market equilibrium rate to incentivize workers to remain with them, which reduces the expensive cost of finding, hiring, and training new employees.
The model derives specific propositions regarding the relationship between monitoring costs, real wage levels, unemployment, and productivity. The model suggests that if nominal wages increase, real wages must also increase to incentivize workers to put more effort into production. An increase in wages will result in a decrease in unemployment and higher productivity levels. Shapiro-Stiglitz model also hypothesizes that monitoring costs are decreasing in real wages, which can be read in terms of the efficiency of monitoring technologies. Generally, firms that use more efficient forms of monitoring can pay lower monitoring costs, leading to a reduced need to pay efficiency wages.
The Shapiro-Stiglitz model makes several assumptions about the labor market and firm behavior. First, the model assumes that workers are heterogeneous in their effort levels, and that effort is unobservable by the employer. Second, the model assumes that firms pay a fixed cost in selecting high-effort workers. Third, the cost of monitoring workers decreases as wages increase over the equilibrium wage. Finally, it is assumed that workers have more bargaining power when they receive efficiency wages, which results in higher real wages. As a result of these assumptions, the Shapiro-Stiglitz model concludes that firms will choose to pay efficiency wages that are greater than the market-clearing wage rate. Consequently, real wages will be higher than they would be in the absence of efficiency wages.
Efficiency wage theories that incorporate the Shapiro-Stiglitz model have been extensively applied in empirical research. The empirical research has found support for efficient wage theories' primary predictions. Research reveals that firms that pay efficiency wages have lower turnover rates, higher productivity levels, and lower hiring and training costs. Moreover, firms that pay efficiency wages tend to operate within highly competitive markets, which suggests that the wage premium may be optimal for profitability. 
However, one limitation of the efficient wage theory is that it is difficult to measure the direct impact of efficiency wages on firm productivity. For instance, it's hard to isolate the impact of higher wages from that of other factors that may affect productivity, such as technology, outsourcing, and changes in production processes and management practices. The theories can also be challenged by industry-specific factors like the demand for skilled labor. For instance, the Shapiro-Stiglitz theory may not apply to such industries where compensation is already high.
Efficient wage theories’ predictions regarding productivity and employment can also be challenged by alternative theories examining the relationship between wage and productivity. Other theories, such as the human capital theory and the screening theory, suggest that employers pay higher compensation to attract the best and brightest candidates. Human capital theory suggests that firms pay high wages to employees who possess the required knowledge, education, and experience to contribute to the highest level of productivity. In contrast, screening theory proposes that firms offer high wages as a screening tool to attract highly motivated and productive workers striving for career growth and job satisfaction.
In conclusion, efficient wage theories propose that paying higher wages than the market rate can result in higher productivity and lower monitoring costs. The Shapiro-Stiglitz model builds on these theories by incorporating the concept of unobservable effort and the decreasing cost of monitoring. The theory proposes that firms choose to pay efficiency wages because that increases productivity by inducing high effort from employees. Real wages are also hypothesized to increase by efficiency wage theories due to a higher bargaining power of employees. While empirical research provides support for efficient wage theories' primary predictions, the direct impact of efficiency wages on productivity is hard to isolate from other factors affecting productivity. Furthermore, the efficiency of the system can vary according to industry-specific factors such as the demand for skilled labor. However, the theories provide an important perspective to understand firms' incentives to pay workers higher wages and the impact of efficiency wages on employment and productivity.
