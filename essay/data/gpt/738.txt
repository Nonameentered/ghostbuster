Introduction
The interpretation and abuse of scripture have been an issue of concern throughout history. When people use religious texts to justify their actions, the consequences can be dire. This is the case in the dystopian worlds of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984. These novels explore what happens when religion is misused to control people and create oppressive societies. This essay will examine how the interpretation and abuse of scripture have been translated into dystopic fiction, with specific reference to The Handmaid's Tale and 1984.
Religious Fundamentalism in The Handmaid's Tale
Atwood's novel is set in a theocratic regime, where the government has taken control of society using religious justification. The Gilead regime is grounded in Christian fundamentalism, where the Bible is interpreted and used to control the population. The regime uses a group of women known as "handmaids" for the purpose of reproduction. The handmaids are stripped of all their rights, and their only purpose is to bear children for the ruling class. The government makes use of bible verses to justify the rules enforced on the women.
The Bible is often used as a justification for the regime's actions, but it is not the only source of religious influence. The government's use of the Bible is selective, emphasizing only the parts that justify their actions while excluding the parts that do not. The Gilead regime is not simply a product of religion; it is a critical reflection of the abuse of religious power.
The regime in The Handmaid's Tale mirrors the dangers posed by religious fundamentalism in the real world. Religious fundamentalism is frequently invoked to justify the subjugation of women and marginalized groups. The novel presents a dystopian vision of a world where the fundamentalist beliefs of those in power have led to extreme oppression and subjugation.
Religion as a Tool of Oppression in 1984
1984 presents a similar dystopian vision of a society controlled by a totalitarian regime. Unlike The Handmaid's Tale, the ruling party in 1984 does not use religion to gain control. Instead, they reject religion altogether and uphold their ideology as the only legitimate source of truth. The party's ideology, known as "Ingsoc," emphasizes the importance of obedience to the state and complete control over individual thoughts and actions.
It is important to note that the society depicted in 1984 is not a strictly religious one, although religious imagery is sometimes used to reinforce the power of the state. The government makes use of language to manipulate the truth and compel obedience to the ruling party. The role of Big Brother, the government's figurehead, is similar to that of a religious figure. The government's ability to manipulate language is central to their effort to control the minds of citizens.
The total control exerted by the ruling party in 1984 is reminiscent of the way some religious fundamentalists attempt to control their followers. The government's aim is to eradicate individual thought and create complete submission to the state, which is similar to the way some religious cults attempt to control their members.
The Interpretation and Misinterpretation of Religious Texts
Both The Handmaid's Tale and 1984 show how religious texts can be misinterpreted to justify the abuse of power. In the case of Atwood's novel, scripture is interpreted by the ruling class to justify the suppression of women. In 1984, religion is absent, but the ruling party creates a new language and ideology to control its citizens.
In both cases, interpretation is key. What religious texts mean and how they are understood can be used to justify oppression or liberation. Debates about what the Bible says are often at the heart of moral and cultural conflicts in society.  The interpretation of religious texts is key to how they are applied in society. Both The Handmaid's Tale and 1984 suggest that religious texts can be a double-edged sword, with the potential to liberate or oppress.
Conclusion
The misuse of religious power is a critical issue, and The Handmaid's Tale and 1984 offer a dystopic vision of what can happen when religious texts are misinterpreted. The use of religion can lead to oppression and subjugation, and it can also be used to justify the most heinous of crimes. The interpretation of religious texts is crucial, and both novels show that it can be used to control or liberate people. Religious fundamentalism and totalitarianism are both rooted in the attempt to control the minds and actions of individuals. Atwood and Orwell's novels show that the consequences of this control can be catastrophic.
