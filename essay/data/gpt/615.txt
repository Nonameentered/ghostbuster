Exchange rates are an important factor of international economics, affecting the finances and trade of different countries. The Law of One Price (LOOP) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theories attempt to explain the movements of exchange rates, but each is criticized by economists who propose alternative theories. This essay examines the LOOP and PPP theories while discussing the problems arising in their explanations of exchange rates. Additionally, this text will explore how these theories have implications in Open Macroeconomics, particularly in the Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates and the concept of the real exchange rate (RER).
The Law of One Price commonly applies to similar products across borders, which should sell at the same price, allowing for transaction and transportation costs. The concept is useful for understanding the dynamics of international trade and exchange rates. If this theory holds, exchange rates should be a reflection of price differences in different countries. For example, if a computer costs $1000 in the US, it should cost an Australian consumer approximately AUD 1571.2, assuming that the two countries do not have any trade restrictions, exchange controls, and neither party incurs any significant transactions costs. If the price discrepancy exists, the importer could purchase the computer in the country where it costs less, take it back to their country, and sell it at a higher price.
The Law of One Price implies that any changes in foreign exchange rates should result from changes in relative prices or inflation. It follows that the exchange rate should adjust to cancel out any price discrepancies. However, there are many barriers to this process, such as transaction and transportation costs, trade restrictions, and taxes, which hinder the arbitrage process, leading to large appreciations in exchange rates. The phenomenon is known as the exchange rate puzzle, where exchange rates are volatile and respond unexpectedly to economic shocks.
The Purchasing Power Parity theory is different from the Law of One Price, focusing on identical baskets of goods and services in different countries. PPP states that in equilibrium, the price of a particular basket of goods and services should be identical across different countries after converting the exchange rate. For instance, a basket of commodities and services costing $20 in the US should have an equivalent costing €15.7 in the Eurozone, assuming an exchange rate of €1.28 for each dollar. The PPP theory applies this principle across a broad range of products and services across a long period.
Like the Law of One Price, the PPP theory is useful in explaining exchange rates and their variations. In the long-term, exchange rates should reflect the relative inflation rates between two countries. This means that countries experiencing high inflation should have their currencies depreciated relative to countries with low inflation rates. However, the theory suffers from the same problem as the Law of One Price, such as transaction and transportation costs, trade restrictions, changes in consumption patterns, differing baskets of goods used for comparison, exchange controls, and taxes.
There are several problems that the PPP and LOOP theories have in explaining the movements of exchange rates. Firstly, the theories fail to consider fluctuations in exchange rates due to political turmoil or crises, or changes in economic policy, which also influence exchange rates in the short-term. This is particularly significant in developing countries, where exchange rates can quickly fluctuate due to political instability, such as civil wars or interventions. 
Secondly, the Law of One Price, which mainly applies to similar products and even secures a price difference due to issues like quality discrepancies, has significant limitations. The law is also unable to account for goods and services that are not tradable, such as real estate, education, and healthcare.
Further, the LOOP and PPP theories do not account for non-traditional trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers, which can create price discrepancies and affect exchange rates. For example, trade policies on imported cars may make it cheaper to purchase vehicles produced domestically, leading to high demand and inflated prices, creating a price difference relative to other countries.
Moreover, there are difficulties in comparing prices over time. The PPP theory assumes that the baskets of goods used for comparisons are the same quality as previously, but this is not always the case. Quality achieves improvements, and consumers' demands preferences change over time, making it difficult to compare prices across different periods accurately.
Finally, there is the issue of sticky prices and wages that lead to the slow adjustment of exchange rates to price and inflation changes. This leads to an underestimation of exchange rate volatility, as there is inertia in their adjustment caused by post-transaction rigidity. This means that even if there is inflation or deflation in a country, it may take time for the exchange rate to adjust, leading to misalignments between PPP and actual exchange rates.
For these and more reasons, many economists have started looking for alternative theories to explain exchange rate movements. The Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates (MAER), which considers macroeconomic variables such as inflation, real income, and interest rates, is one such theory. In MAER, each country is assumed to maintain internal balance, that is, the quantity of money in a country is proportional to its wage and price level. When this fails to hold, leading to a disparity, the exchange rate must adjust to restore internal and external balances. MAER is preferred over PPP and the LOOP, as it considers fundamental economic factors that drive exchange rates, not just price comparisons and inflations.
The concept of the real exchange rate (RER) determines the competitiveness of a country in international trade. The real exchange rate takes into account the relative price difference between foreign and domestic goods in a way that considers differences in inflation rates between two countries.
Whether PPP or LOOPS holds, what matters at the end of the day is the impact on real wages in the countries involved. The RER measures the comparative price level in terms of one country's currency to another country's currency, adjusted for the different inflation rates of the two countries. Suppose there is an inflation differential, such that country A experiences an inflation rate of 5% while country B has an inflation rate of 3%. In that case, the RER should depreciate as the relative price of goods in country A is preferable.
In conclusion, the Law of One Price and Purchasing Power Parity theories have limitations in explaining exchange rates in modern international trade due to various factors such as sticky prices, non-traditional trade barriers, and political instability. However, the concepts of RER and MAER have emerged as useful in explaining exchange rates, given they account for many factors such as macroeconomics and global trade.
By understanding the theories that explain exchange rate fluctuations, Open Macroeconomics students can gain a comprehensive view of the forces governing the global economy. The theoretical and practical implications of these concepts are significant, as they aid in examining the global strength of currencies, aids in the calculation of countries' actual economic growth and the impact of factors such as inflation and interest rates in their economies.
