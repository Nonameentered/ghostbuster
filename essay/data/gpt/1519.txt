Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and scope of knowledge. It is concerned with the question of what knowledge is, what we can know, and how we can acquire it. The Tripartite theory of knowledge is one of the leading theories in epistemology that seeks to answer these questions. In this essay, I will examine the Tripartite theory of knowledge, its alternatives, assumptions, and the Gettier problem. I will discuss why the author argues that there is not a good alternative to the Tripartite theory of knowledge and how the alternatives to the theory either clarify its terms or concepts or are unsound.
The Tripartite theory of knowledge holds that knowledge is justified true belief. According to this theory, in order to know X, one must (a) believe that X is true, (b) have a good reason or justification for believing that X is true, and (c) it must be true that X is true (Mosley, 2020). If any one of these conditions is not satisfied, then one cannot be said to have knowledge.
One of the reasons the author argues that there is not a good alternative to the Tripartite theory of knowledge is that other theories of knowledge fail to account for the relationship between belief, justification, and truth. For instance, the coherence theory of knowledge holds that knowledge is justified by its coherence with other beliefs that a person holds. However, this theory fails to account for the possibility of having false but coherent beliefs. A person may hold a set of beliefs that cohere with each other but are not true. Therefore, coherence alone cannot be a sufficient condition for knowledge.
Another alternative to the Tripartite theory of knowledge is the reliabilist theory. This theory holds that knowledge is produced by reliable cognitive processes. However, this theory fails to account for the possibility of having true beliefs that are not produced by reliable cognitive processes. For example, a person may believe that the earth is round based on a false belief that all scientists agree on this fact. This belief is true, but it is not produced by reliable cognitive processes. Therefore, the reliabilist theory alone cannot be a sufficient condition for knowledge.
The author also argues that the Tripartite theory of knowledge is more intuitive and corresponds to our everyday understanding of what it means to know something. In our everyday experiences, we tend to think that in order to know something, we need to believe it, have good reasons for believing it, and it must be true. Therefore, the Tripartite theory of knowledge is more intuitive and corresponds to our common sense understanding of knowledge.
The Tripartite theory of knowledge assumes that knowledge must be justified, true, and believed. These assumptions are interrelated. Knowledge must be believed because one cannot know something that one does not believe. Knowledge must be justified because it distinguishes between true belief and knowledge. For instance, if someone believes that the earth is flat based on watching a video made by a conspiracy theorist, it is not knowledge because the belief is not justified. True because if a belief is not true, it cannot be called knowledge. Therefore, the Tripartite theory of knowledge assumes that knowledge must meet a certain standard of justification, truth, and belief.
The author defines different types of knowledge based on the level of justification. The first type of knowledge is presuppositional knowledge, which is knowledge that does not require justification. This includes knowledge that is self-evident, like the knowledge that we are thinking. The second type of knowledge is perceptual knowledge, which is knowledge that is gained through the senses. The third type of knowledge is inferential knowledge, which is knowledge that is gained through reasoning or inference from other beliefs.
The theory of justification plays a role in the Tripartite theory of knowledge because it is the condition that distinguishes between true belief and knowledge. Justification refers to the reasons or evidence that supports a belief. According to the Tripartite theory of knowledge, in order to have knowledge, one must have a good reason or justification for believing that X is true. Justification, therefore, is an essential component of knowledge.
The Gettier problem is a challenge to the Tripartite theory of knowledge. The problem centers around cases where someone has a true belief that is justified, but it is not knowledge. In these situations, the belief is true and justified, but there is some kind of luck involved in the formation of the belief. For instance, consider a case where someone believes that a friend is in town because they saw someone who looks like their friend across the street. Unknown to the person, the friend had a twin brother who looks exactly like him, and it was the brother who was in town. In this case, the belief is true and justified, but it is not knowledge because it is based on luck and not on the justification of the belief itself.
The author provides several arguments against the Gettier problem. First, the author argues that the Gettier problem is an epistemic anomaly, which means that it is a rare situation that does not pose a serious challenge to the Tripartite theory of knowledge. According to the author, most of our beliefs are formed through reliable cognitive processes, and so the Gettier problem is not a serious challenge to the Tripartite theory of knowledge.
Second, the author argues that the Gettier problem requires extra attention to the justification condition of knowledge. In other words, we need to revise our understanding of justification by adding additional conditions, like avoiding luck, to avoid the Gettier problem. The author argues that while this might be a challenge to the Tripartite theory of knowledge, it does not mean that the theory is unsound. Rather, we need to refine our understanding of justification in the light of the Gettier problem.
In conclusion, the Tripartite theory of knowledge holds that knowledge is justified true belief, and it provides a clear and intuitive concept of knowledge. The alternatives to the theory, such as the coherence theory and the reliabilist theory, are either unsound or fail to account for the relationship between belief, justification, and truth. The author assumes that knowledge must be justified, true, and believed, and provides different types of knowledge based on the level of justification. The theory of justification plays a vital role in the Tripartite theory of knowledge because it distinguishes between true belief and knowledge. While the Gettier problem poses a challenge to the Tripartite theory of knowledge, the author argues that it does not mean that the theory is unsound. Rather, it requires extra attention to the justification condition of knowledge.
