Econometrics is a branch of economics that is concerned with the application of statistical and mathematical models to analyze and explain economic relationships. The use of econometric models and regression analysis is becoming increasingly popular in the field of education as researchers seek to understand the factors that influence student academic performance. One such study that applies econometric analysis to evaluate the impact of certain variables on exam marks is “The effect of revision lectures on the performance of economics students,” by J. M. Pahlavani and A. Khobreh.
The study uses linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between exam marks and three variables - revision lecture attendance, ability, and the number of hours spent on lectures. The authors hypothesized that there was a positive relationship between exam marks and all three variables, and they aimed to determine the strength of this relationship using a regression model. This essay aims to analyze the econometric analysis performed in this study, focusing on the regression model used, the significance of dummy variables, and the contribution of the Chow-test to our understanding of the coefficients in the model.
The main econometric analysis and regression model used in the study by Pahlavani and Khobreh is a simple linear regression model. A linear regression model is a statistical method commonly used in econometrics to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this study, the dependent variable is exam marks, while the independent variables are revision lecture attendance, ability, and hours spent on lectures. The authors employed a simple linear regression model where the dependent variable is regressed against each independent variable separately to assess the individual effect of each variable on exam marks.
The regression model, therefore, takes the form of:
Yi = β0 + β1Xi + εi
Where
Yi is the examination mark for student i
β0 is the y-intercept of the regression line
β1 is the slope of the regression line, which measures how much Yi will change when Xi increases by one unit
Xi is the independent variable (revision lecture attendance, ability, or hours spent on lectures)
εi is the error term, which represents the variability of Yi that is not explained by the independent variable Xi.
To test the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between exam marks and each of the independent variables, the authors used the coefficients of regression. The coefficients quantify the effect of a one-unit change in the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, if β1 is 0.15, a one-unit increase in Xi will lead to a 0.15 increase in Yi. The direction and magnitude of the coefficients provide an understanding of the strength and direction of the linear relationship.
The results of the study showed that all three independent variables - revision lecture attendance, ability, and hours spent on lectures - had a statistically significant positive effect on exam marks. Specifically, the regression coefficients for revision lecture attendance, ability, and hours spent on lectures were 4.667, 21.723, and 0.324, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.708, indicating that 70.8% of the variance in exam marks was explained by the three independent variables.
In addition to the use of linear regression analysis, the authors also employed dummy variables in their regression model. A dummy variable is a binary variable (typically 0 or 1) that captures the effect of categorical variables that cannot be measured continuously. In this study, a dummy variable was used to capture the effect of gender, as females were coded as 1 and males as 0. The coefficient of the dummy variable indicates how much the dependent variable (exam marks) would change when gender changes from male to female. This allowed the authors to determine if gender has a statistically significant effect on exam marks, after controlling for the effects of the other independent variables.
The significance of dummy variables in regression analysis cannot be overstated. They allow researchers to capture the effect of categorical variables that cannot be measured continuously and to control for the effects of other independent variables. Dummy variables are also used to handle multicollinearity, which is a phenomenon where two or more independent variables are highly correlated. In this study, the authors used the dummy variable to control for the effect of gender on exam marks.
Finally, the authors also employed the Chow-test to determine the constancy of the coefficients over time. The Chow-test is a statistical test used to determine if there are structural breaks in the model coefficients across different sub-samples. Structural breaks occur when the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables changes over time or when there is a change in the causal relationship between the variables. The Chow-test assesses whether it is appropriate to estimate the coefficients for different sub-samples separately or to estimate them as a single model.
In this study, the Chow-test was employed to evaluate whether there was a break in the relationship between exam marks and the independent variables across different years, thereby examining the constancy of the coefficients over time. The results of the Chow-test showed that the coefficients were not significantly different across the sub-samples, indicating that there was no structural break in the relationship between exam marks and the independent variables across different years. This finding suggests that the model was robust and that it could be used to predict exam marks for interventions in subsequent years.
In conclusion, the study by Pahlavani and Khobreh employed econometric analysis and regression models to examine the relationship between exam marks and three independent variables - revision lecture attendance, ability, and hours spent on lectures. The results of the study showed that all three independent variables had a statistically significant positive effect on exam marks. The study also employed dummy variables to handle categorical data and the Chow-test to evaluate the constancy of the coefficients over time. The study's findings remind us of the importance of econometric analysis and regression models in analyzing and explaining the causal relationship between variables, which can have significant implications for improving student academic performance.
