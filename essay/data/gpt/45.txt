The authoritarian personality refers to a collection of traits that predispose a person to be highly obedient and uncritically loyal to those in authority. These individuals frequently exhibit hostility towards individuals or groups who are of different backgrounds, hold opposing viewpoints, or appear unconventional. The authoritarian personality theory comes from social psychology, and it has been used to explain why some individuals are more susceptible to fascism, racism, and other far-right movements.
Authoritarian personality has been examined and researched by social scientists for decades. One of the earliest scholars to explore the concept was Theodor Adorno, who was part of the Berkeley school of social psychology. Adorno and his colleagues created surveys and questionnaires to attempt and measure the authoritarian personality type. According to Adorno and his contemporaries, this personality type is marked by rigid thinking, intense loyalty to authority, and resistance to new ideas. These individuals often have a fear of other cultures or groups and arrange them into hierarchical categories, with those at the top having deserved all the privileges and those at the bottom deserving of nothing.
People with an authoritarian personality type also have a tendency to engage in black-and-white thinking. They can be intolerant of ambiguity and will frequently view issues in polarizing or extreme terms. They prefer to follow the norms, conventions, and values defined by the powerful, rather than to observe and reflect about how these norms may contribute to existing inequalities. The lack of regard for the diverse perspectives of others can lead to dogmatism and intolerance in the realm of politics, as they will often view complex socio-political issues in stark terms of good versus evil. 
This personality type is said to begin developing early in childhood. The early family environment can play a significant role in children's development of an authoritarian personality. For example, if parents are authoritarian or utilize harsh punishment, children may learn that it is appropriate to be rigid and conformist. Furthermore, harsh parenting may lead to children fearing the consequences of going against authority, as well as the belief that those with power are the only ones that can maintain order in society.
The theory of the authoritarian personality can help to explain how far-right societies become prevalent. Individuals with this personality type appreciate authoritarian leaders that can keep the rest of society under control and make decisions in their name. Additionally, members of society with the authoritarian personality type may view ethnic and minority groups as a threat to the status quo of their society. Believing that the dominant group is superior, members of the authoritarian personality type may react with hostility and aggression towards those who have different values or ideas. Fascism is an extreme manifestation of the authoritarian personality type as it relies on the subjugation of individual rights, the central role of the state, and an idolized dictator to maintain order.
While the authoritarian personality theory has gained popularity in social psychology research, it has also faced some criticism. One of the major criticisms of the theory is the lack of predictive power as it attempted to classify an individual as either authoritarian or non-authoritarian. It is also debated whether an authoritarian personality type causes racism and fascism, or if people become authoritarian because of the normative and cultural environment in which they grow up. Furthermore, the theory lacked a clear distinction between authoritarian and non-authoritarian ideologies, with both conservatism and liberalism being associated with authoritarianism in several research works. 
These criticisms led to the development of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scales, which attempted to overcome some of these limitations by distinguishing between different types of authoritarianism. RWA scales assess an individual's level of conformity, intolerance, preference for power hierarchies, and aggression towards dissidents. RWA scales differentiate between individuals who have an authoritarian personality and those who adhere to an authoritarian ideological disposition. In contrast to prior approaches where individuals were classified based on whether they possessed an authoritarian personality or not, the RWA scales approached authoritarian as a political value. 
One criticism of the RWA scale is that it cannot accurately identify individuals with left-wing authoritarian tendencies. It is also further limited by its seemingly inadequate recognition of the structural dynamics of power relations, focusing primarily on individual dispositions. Despite these limitations, the RWA scale seems to have somewhat alleviated earlier limitations. It has even become one of the most widely utilized measures of authoritarianism in contemporary social psychology research.
In conclusion, the authoritarian personality type is characterized by the rigid thinking, obedience, and conformity to authority figures. It arises from early childhood experience, and its development is propelled by the experiences an individual has with their family and surrounding society. The authoritarian personality theory is useful in explaining how individuals can be led to embrace far-right ideologies like racism and fascism. However, it has been widely criticized, and the Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale is based on these criticisms. While the RWA has somewhat addressed previous criticisms, new research ought to remain alert to the limitations of classifying individuals as either authoritarian or non-authoritarian. The complexity and multidimensionality of authoritarianism should be taken with the utmost consideration. It is essential to understand authoritarianism in all its complexities and forms to ensure democracy and civil liberties are maintained in society.
