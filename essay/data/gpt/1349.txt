Introduction
Same-sex marriage has been a controversial issue worldwide since the nineteenth century. Despite people understanding homosexuality as an alternative sexual orientation, the societies are still divided over its legality. Legalizing same-sex marriages remains a crucial step in eliminating discrimination against gays and lesbians globally. With the United States and India constantly presenting different perspectives, it is necessary to understand the current discourse on gay rights in both nations. Therefore, this essay seeks to explore the impact of legalizing same-sex marriages in eliminating discrimination against gays and lesbians in the United States and India. The essay will examine some case laws in both regions regarding the issue with the aim of providing a clear understanding.
Gay Rights in the United States
The United States has been on the forefront of the gay rights movement, seeing significant developments in the past few years. The battle for marriage equality has been a significant issue in the US. Prior to the declaration of same-sex marriage equality in the US in 2015, the right to marriage remained inaccessible to these individuals. However, the Supreme Court expanded the constitutional protection of same-sex couples in legalizing same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.
The legalization of same-sex marriages in the US marked an era of progress for gay rights. The historic ruling was a milestone in ensuring that the same sex couples had access to extensive benefits in the country, such as hospital visitation rights, access to healthcare, end-of-life decisions, and tax benefits. The legalization of same-sex marriages is a transformative decision that demonstrated the power of judicial review in protecting the constitutional rights of minority groups (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015). In the decision, the Supreme Court held that same-sex couples had an equal right to marry, and therefore states had a constitutional obligation to license and recognize marriages involving same-sex couples.
Prior to the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges, several cases had successfully challenged provisions that discriminated against gays and lesbians. For instance, the US Supreme Court declared the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional in United States Vs. Windsor in 2013. The 1996 act enabled states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states or countries. The ruling overturned 2004 state constitutional amendments in eleven states that banned same-sex marriages. DOMA's Declaration of Unconstitutionality appeared to advance the DOMA policy towards the legalisation of gay marriage.
Additionally, Lawrence v. Texas and Evens v Philadelphia provided basic protection for members of the LGBT community in the US. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Court held that state laws criminalizing consensual homosexual conduct within a private facility were unconstitutional. Conversely, the Evens v Philadelphia case aimed to prohibit the city commissioner from declining to provide foster children to same-sex couples. Both cases aimed at ensuring that the laws were reflective of the current trends worldwide and that homosexuals had the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.
Gay Rights in India
On the other hand, India has been struggling for years to legalize same-sex marriages. In India, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code criminalizes homosexual activity. Criminalizing homosexuality has had disastrous effects on the Indian LGBT community, such as isolation, stigmatization, and physical violence. However, tides have been changing, resulting in two significant cases that demonstrate India's commitment towards ending discrimination against gays and lesbians: Naz Foundation v. Govt. of N.C.T of Delhi and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India.
The Naz Foundation case marked a significant advancement in ending discrimination against gays and lesbians in India. In the case, Naz Foundation, a Delhi-based HIV/AIDS intervention organization, challenged a decision by the Delhi High Court dismissing its PIL to declare Section 377 to be partially unconstitutional. In 2009, a two-judge bench of the Delhi High Court relied on the Indian Constitution and the Indian Penal Code and held that penalizing consensual gay sex violates the fundamental rights of life, liberty, and dignity. The Court held that Section 377 is unconstitutional when it applies to consensual sexual acts between adults in private.
Nonetheless, the government appealed the ruling to the Indian Supreme Court, setting up a final decision. Although the appeal was in progress, an Indian court refused to approve “gay sex” in 2010. The Court's ruling upheld the constitutionality of Section 377, which criminalizes homosexuality in India. The decision marked a serious setback for gay rights in India. Nonetheless, following the 2018 Navtej Singh Johar case, the Indian Supreme Court declared Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code unconstitutional.
The Navtej Singh Johar case marked a significant victory for India's LGBT community. The decision decreed that homosexuality could not be criminalized in India and affirmed the LGBT community's right to freely express their sexual orientation. Similar to the US, when gay rights advocates sought legal remedies, the Navtej Singh Johar case demonstrated India's progress towards eliminating discrimination against gays and lesbians. The judgment of a constitution bench made up of five judges overturned the 2013 Shreya Singhal case that re-criminalized homosexuality in the country.
Elimination of Discrimination against Gays and Lesbians
The legalizing of same-sex marriage in the US has advanced efforts to eliminate discrimination against gays and lesbians. Legalizing same-sex marriages has led to the elimination of discriminatory laws. For instance, in the US, the legalization of same-sex marriages in 2015 saw state constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages in over thirty states invalidated. The decision was a significant blow to anti-gay organizations, as it recognized the principle of equality and non-discrimination as fundamental values for a democratic society.
As stated, many precedential cases in the US challenging provisions that discriminate against gays and lesbians have been successfully adjudicated. The cases resulting in landmark decisions in the US courts have been significant in shaping the culture of gay rights in the country, leading to the protection of their basic rights. Legalizing same-sex marriages has also helped facilitate the acceptance of same-sex relationships, thereby reducing discrimination and stigma against gays and lesbians. Legalizing same-sex marriages is one way of ensuring that the families of gay couples enjoy the same legal protection and benefits that heterosexual couples have always enjoyed.
Analyzing the situation in India, the legal struggles to eliminate discrimination against gays and lesbians might be longer. However, the current situation provides a glimmer of hope for the country. For instance, the recent decisions by Indian courts have challenged the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality. Similarly, with the decriminalization of consensual gay sex by the Delhi High Court in 2009 and the Supreme Court's recent declaration that Section 377 of the Penal Code is unconstitutional, the attempt to eliminate discrimination against gays and lesbians in India has made significant progress.
Conclusion
Legalizing same-sex marriages significantly impacts the elimination of discrimination against gays and lesbians. The United States and India present different perspectives on gay rights, but both have made significant progress towards eliminating discrimination against gays and lesbians. In the US, legalizing same-sex marriages had a significant impact on eliminating discriminatory laws, but in India, the path to eliminating discrimination is longer but suggests a positive trend. This essay explored the current discourse on gay rights in the US and India by examining significant case laws. The examination highlighted the progress made and the challenges to eliminate discrimination against this group. Discrimination against gays and Lesbians is a violation of fundamental human rights and an offense against democracy and social justice. Therefore, it is necessary to continue advocating for the rights of this group and the legalization of their unions.
