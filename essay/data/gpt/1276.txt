The criminal justice system is a complex web of laws, procedures, and institutions. One of the key components of this system is the role of public prosecutors in the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure. The public prosecutor’s job is to investigate crimes, gather evidence, and present cases to the court. But how does their independence impact the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure in England, France, and Germany? In this essay, I will examine the role of public prosecutors during the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure, discuss the concept of independence, and evaluate how this concept is understood in the three countries. Furthermore, I will explore how this conceptualization of independence aligns with reality, with a particular focus on the role of prosecutors in investigations and alternative case disposal.
The Role of Public Prosecutors in the Pre-Trial Phase of Criminal Procedure
Public prosecutors play a crucial role in the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure. Their primary responsibility is to determine whether there is enough evidence to charge a suspect with a crime. This involves investigating crimes, gathering evidence, and then presenting it to a court. Once a case has been presented to a court, a public prosecutor must be present to argue the case and present evidence to the judge or jury. This process requires a good amount of legal expertise and knowledge of the criminal justice system.
During the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure, the public prosecutor is required to exercise impartiality and ensure that justice is served. They must follow strict ethical guidelines and adhere to the law in order to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected at all times. A prosecutor’s job involves seeking the truth rather than securing a conviction. It is essential that they do not let emotions or personal biases impact their decisions.
The Concept of Independence
To properly understand the role of public prosecutors in the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure, we need to first examine the notion of independence. Independence is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. It refers to the ability of public prosecutors to operate with a degree of freedom from political influence. Prosecutors must be independent from both the executive and the judiciary in order to ensure that they can fulfill their role without any interference.
The notion of independence is essential because it allows for the impartial administration of justice. Public prosecutors must be free to make decisions based on the law and the evidence alone. Without independence, it would be easy for political motivations to influence the decisions of prosecutors, leading to a lack of impartiality and the fair administration of justice.
England
In England, public prosecutors are known as Crown Prosecutors. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is responsible for prosecuting criminal cases that have been investigated by the police in England and Wales. The CPS operates under the supervision of the Attorney General, who is a political appointment. However, the Attorney General does not have any direct control over the CPS's decisions regarding which cases to prosecute or their overall management.
The CPS is expected to uphold the principle of independence, which is reflected in the CPS’s Code for Crown Prosecutors. The code sets out how the CPS must exercise its discretion when deciding whether to prosecute a case, as well as how to proceed with it. The code emphasizes impartiality, stating that it is the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice, not a conviction.
The CPS’s structure and independence are reinforced by the Public Prosecution Service for England and Wales (PPSEW) Act 1986. The act requires the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to be independent from the government and the police in deciding which cases to prosecute. The DPP is accountable to Parliament only through the Attorney General and is required to publish an annual report and to appear before the Justice Select Committee.
France
In France, the public prosecutor is known as the Procureur de la République. The Procureur de la République is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that have been committed within their jurisdiction. They are part of the judiciary and operate independently from the executive branch. The Procureur de la République’s primary role is to ensure that criminal cases are investigated thoroughly and that the victims of crimes receive justice.
The role of the Procureur de la République is slightly different from that of other prosecutors. While they do have a duty to investigate crimes and prosecute suspects, they also have a duty to protect the public interest. This means that they have the power to decide whether or not to prosecute a case based on the public interest, rather than just the evidence.
Germany
Germany has a different model of public prosecution than England and France. In Germany, there are two types of public prosecutors: the Staatsanwalt and the Generalstaatsanwalt. The Staatsanwalt is responsible for investigating and prosecuting smaller, less complex cases, while the Generalstaatsanwalt prosecutes higher-profile or more complex cases.
The German system is highly centralized, with the federal government responsible for appointing prosecutors at all levels. However, the federal government is not involved in the day-to-day running of the prosecutor's office, and the prosecutors are expected to operate with a high degree of independence.
The Concept of Independence and the Reality
While the concept of independence is essential to ensure impartiality and the fair administration of justice, there are instances in which the reality does not align with this conceptualization. The role of prosecutors in investigations and alternative case disposal is particularly noteworthy, as there is often a tension between independence and political influence.
Prosecutors can be influenced by various factors, including political pressure, public opinion, and media scrutiny. These factors can affect the decisions that prosecutors make, including which cases to prosecute, how to investigate them, and how to dispose of them.
One of the main factors that can affect the independence of public prosecutors is political pressure. Politicians may exert pressure on prosecutors to pursue certain cases or to avoid pursuing others. This can lead to a lack of impartiality and unfairness in the administration of justice.
Another factor that can affect the independence of prosecutors is public opinion. When prosecutors are under public scrutiny, they may be tempted to make decisions that are influenced by the court of public opinion, rather than the law and the evidence. This can lead to a lack of impartiality, as the prosecutors may be more concerned with public opinion than with the facts of the case.
Alternative case disposal is also an area where the independence of public prosecutors can be challenged. Alternative case disposal refers to the process of resolving cases without going to trial. This can include plea bargaining, diversion programs, or fines. It is essential that prosecutors remain impartial during this process, as the decision to dispose of a case in this way can have significant implications for the accused. However, prosecutors may be incentivized to dispose of cases quickly or easily, leading to a lack of impartiality and fairness.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the role of public prosecutors in the pre-trial phase of criminal procedure is essential to ensure the fair administration of justice. The concept of independence is fundamental to this role, as it ensures impartiality and protects the rights of the accused. However, the reality of independence can be challenged in various ways, including political pressure, public opinion, and alternative case disposal. Thus, it is crucial to maintain the balance between independence and accountability, which will allow for the proper administration of justice.
