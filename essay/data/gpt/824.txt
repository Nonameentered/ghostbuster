The tourism industry of Oxford has been witnessing increased footfall of Chinese tourists for the past couple of years, and this inflow is expected to grow further in the coming times. The impact of Chinese tourists on Oxford's tourism industry is multi-faceted, and the understanding of cultural influence on trip characteristics is vital for devising appropriate marketing strategies for this target market. This essay aims to analyze the consumer behavior of Chinese tourists in Oxford, using the Mayo and Jarvis (1981) model, and identify the cultural value and motivation factors that are relevant for tourism managers in selecting appropriate marketing strategies.
Oxford has been a popular tourist destination for decades now, and its reputation as a center for education, culture, history, and nature has been attracting visitors from all over the world. However, in recent years, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Oxford has been steadily growing, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. According to VisitBritain, the tourism board of the UK, there were 391,000 visits to the UK from China in 2018, and this number is likely to grow to over 1 million by 2025. This exponential growth is due to several reasons, including increased air connectivity between China and the UK, relaxed visa policies for Chinese nationals, rising middle-class population in China, and an appreciation of British culture and heritage among Chinese tourists.
The impact of Chinese tourists on the tourism industry of Oxford is multi-dimensional. On the positive side, Chinese tourists bring significant revenue to the local economy through their spending on accommodation, food, transport, shopping, and activities. According to the Oxford City Council, the average Chinese tourist spends around Â£1,200 on a four-day trip to Oxford, which is significantly higher than the spending of domestic and other international tourists. Moreover, Chinese tourists tend to travel in groups, which further adds to the revenue stream for local businesses. Additionally, Chinese tourists contribute to the diversity of the tourist population in Oxford, bringing their unique perspectives, cultures, and preferences. This enriches the experience of other tourists and locals alike and creates opportunities for cross-cultural learning and exchange.
However, there are also some challenges associated with the influx of Chinese tourists in Oxford. One of the primary challenges is the language barrier, as most Chinese tourists do not speak English fluently. This creates communication problems with locals and businesses, which can lead to misunderstandings, lack of trust, and unsatisfactory experiences. Another challenge is the cultural gap between Chinese tourists and the local culture of Oxford. Chinese tourists tend to have different values, beliefs, and expectations regarding travel, tourism, and hospitality, which can clash with the local culture and norms. This can lead to cultural conflicts, misinterpretations, and negative reviews, which can harm the reputation of the destination and deter future Chinese tourists.
To overcome these challenges and maximize the opportunities presented by Chinese tourists, it is important to understand their consumer behavior and motivations for travel. The Mayo and Jarvis (1981) model of consumer behavior provides a useful framework for analyzing the decision-making process of Chinese tourists in selecting Oxford as their destination. According to this model, consumer behavior is influenced by three factors: internal stimuli (such as culture, personality, and motivation), external stimuli (such as marketing, advertising, and word-of-mouth), and decision-making processes (such as information search, evaluation of alternatives, and post-purchase evaluation).
In the case of Chinese tourists visiting Oxford, several factors influence their consumer behavior, which can be categorized according to their cultural value and motivation. Chinese culture is characterized by collectivism, interdependence, face-saving, and hierarchy, which influence the way Chinese tourists perceive and evaluate travel destinations. Moreover, Chinese tourists are motivated by several factors, including social status, family ties, education, adventure, and novelty, which shape their preferences and expectations of travel experiences.
One of the key cultural values that influence Chinese tourists' behavior is collectivism. Chinese tourists tend to travel in groups and emphasize social harmony, group cohesion, and shared experiences. They prefer to travel with family, friends, and acquaintances and often trust the recommendations of their social network. This implies that word-of-mouth and social media are effective marketing channels for targeting Chinese tourists in Oxford. Tourism managers can encourage Chinese tourists to share their experiences on social media platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, and Instagram, and offer incentives such as discounts, vouchers, and free gifts for promoting Oxford among their peers.
Another cultural value that influences Chinese tourists' behavior is hierarchy. Chinese society is characterized by a strong sense of authority, respect for elders, and deference to those in power. This translates into the way Chinese tourists interact with local businesses and hosts. They expect to be treated with respect, dignity, and hospitality and value personalized attention and care. Oxford tourism managers can cater to this expectation by training local staff and hosts to be culturally sensitive, respectful, and welcoming towards Chinese tourists. Additionally, they can offer customized services such as Chinese-language signage, menus, and brochures, as well as Chinese-speaking guides and translators.
Motivation factors also play a significant role in influencing Chinese tourists' behavior and preferences in Oxford. One of the key motivations for Chinese tourists is education and learning. They value the opportunity to explore new knowledge, cultural heritage, and historical landmarks. Oxford is known for its world-renowned universities, libraries, and museums, which offer rich learning opportunities for Chinese tourists. Tourism managers can leverage this motivation by highlighting the educational and cultural aspects of Oxford in their marketing campaigns and offering specialized guided tours, workshops, and lectures that cater to the interests of Chinese tourists.
Another motivation factor for Chinese tourists is adventure and novelty. They seek out unique and exotic experiences that challenge their comfort zones and broaden their horizons. Oxford has plenty of opportunities for adventure and novelty, ranging from punting on the rivers, exploring hidden alleys and gardens, and discovering secret spots and trails. Tourism managers can promote these experiences as part of their marketing strategies and offer packages that combine adventure and novelty with education and relaxation.
In conclusion, the impact of Chinese tourists on Oxford's tourism industry is significant, and the understanding of cultural influence on trip characteristics is vital for devising appropriate marketing strategies for this target market. The Mayo and Jarvis (1981) model provides a useful framework for analyzing the consumer behavior of Chinese tourists in Oxford, and identifying the cultural value and motivation factors that are relevant for tourism managers in selecting appropriate marketing strategies. By catering to the expectations, preferences, and motivations of Chinese tourists, Oxford tourism managers can maximize the opportunities presented by this growing market and create a positive and sustainable impact on the local economy and community.
