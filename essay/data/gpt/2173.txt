The stories of ancient Greece and its mythology have fascinated us for centuries. The tales of gods and heroes have been told and retold in countless forms, from epic poetry to Hollywood blockbusters. One such Hollywood blockbuster was the 1997 animated film, Disney’s Hercules. While this film is set in the ancient world of Greece, it differs significantly from classical films that portray the same period. This essay will examine those differences, and evaluate whether Disney’s Hercules is a true representation of Greek myth and history.
One of the primary differences between Disney’s Hercules and classical films set in ancient Greece is the treatment of the gods and their relations with mortals. In most classical films, the gods are portrayed as powerful and majestic beings that stand above mortals. However, in Disney’s Hercules, the gods are depicted as whimsical and comical characters. For example, Zeus, the king of the gods, is depicted as an absent-minded and forgetful father who often forgets about his mortal son, Hercules. Thunderbolts, which are symbols of Zeus’s power in classical myths, are seen as playthings in Disney’s Hercules, and the god himself is often more preoccupied with his next meal than with governing the universe.
Moreover, in Disney’s Hercules, the gods’ relationships with mortals seem far more harmonious than those depicted in classical films. Hercules’s parents, Zeus and Hera, are portrayed as loving spouses, rather than archenemies, as they often are in Greek mythology. Also, the story arc of the film, with Hercules’ quest to become a god, involves far less infighting between the gods than in traditional mythology. In a way, Disney’s Hercules trivializes the profound conflicts between the gods that are at the heart of classical myths.
Another significant difference between Disney’s Hercules and classical films is the portrayal of the gods’ powers. In most classical films, the gods’ powers are often portrayed as mysterious, unpredictable, and all-encompassing. Poseidon can stir the seas; Demeter can make the grains flourish, and Apollo can rain fiery arrows on his enemies. In contrast, the gods’ powers in Disney’s Hercules are presented in a more simplified way: they appear to have specific areas of expertise in which they can operate.
For instance, Apollo is depicted as a sunny god of music and poetry, while Ares is the god of war. This limited portrayal of the gods’ powers reduces the magical and mystical elements of classical mythology, and makes the Greek gods far more human than divine. In addition, some viewers might consider Disney’s approach to the gods as a simplistic way of depicting divine powers and thus reduces the sense of awe and admiration that the Greek gods used to inspire.
Another significant difference between Disney’s Hercules and classical films set in ancient Greece is the portrayal of the hero. Classical heroes embody a set of values that are essential to their society, such as bravery, cunning, and loyalty. In most classical films, the heroes are far more complex characters than they are in Disney’s Hercules. They often must navigate intricate moral quandaries, and their lives are often filled with tragedy and sacrifice. On the other hand, in Disney’s Hercules, the hero is portrayed in a much less complex manner.
Hercules is naïve and idealistic, and he shows little of the cunning that most classical heroes possess. Additionally, while classical heroes often need to use violence to achieve their ends, Hercules is portrayed in Disney’s film as a nonviolent hero who uses his superhuman strength to protect and nurture. In a way, Hercules is stripped of many of the complexities that make classical heroes compelling, making him seem a one-dimensional character.
Finally, the question that begs an answer is whether Disney’s Hercules is a faithful representation of Greek myth and history. As we have seen, there are significant differences between Disney’s Hercules and classical films set in ancient Greece, particularly when it comes to depicting the gods and the hero, and their relations with mortals. However, a depiction of mythology or a movie does not have to be a historical document. A creative retelling of a story that is respectful of its source material can still be enjoyable in its own right. Thus, as long as people do not misinterpret the animated film as an accurate representation of Ancient Greece's history or mythology, Disney’s Hercules can be appreciated on its own merits.
In conclusion, Disney’s Hercules differs from classical films set in the ancient world of Greece and should not be taken as a true representation of Greek myth and history. Disney’s Hercules portrays the gods as whimsical and comic characters, with a harmonious relationship with mortals, and it simplifies the powers of the gods. The film portrays the hero as a one-dimensional and naive character that lack complexities present in most classical heroes. Nonetheless, this animated film remains popular, despite the significant historical and mythological deviations. Ultimately, it is okay for movies to embellish and deviate from their source material as long as they remain respectful and provide entertainment.
