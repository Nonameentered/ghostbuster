Pregnancy toxaemia is a metabolic disorder that affects pregnant ewes (female sheep) when they enter the late stages of pregnancy. It is also known as ketosis, twin lamb disease, or pregnancy ketosis, and it is a serious condition that requires prompt intervention to avoid serious consequences for the ewe and her unborn lambs.
Causes of Pregnancy Toxaemia in Ewes
Pregnancy toxaemia is caused by a severe negative energy balance in the ewe’s body. As the pregnancy progresses, the growing fetus requires increasing amounts of nutrients to support its development. However, the ewe’s appetite may decrease as they become more uncomfortable with the increasing size of their uterus. This can lead to a reduction in the intake of energy-giving food, including carbohydrates and fats.
When there is insufficient energy intake by the ewe, the body begins to use fat reserves as the primary source of energy. This results in the production of ketones, which are toxic to the body in high concentrations. The accumulation of ketones in the blood is known as ketosis or pregnancy toxaemia.
Symptoms of Pregnancy Toxaemia in Ewes
The symptoms of pregnancy toxaemia are similar to those of any metabolic disorder. It often begins with a loss of appetite, lethargy, and depression. As the condition progresses, the ewe will become weak, unsteady, and disoriented. Their breath may smell fruity or sweet, indicating the presence of ketones, and they may develop a fever.
In advanced cases, pregnancy toxaemia can result in the onset of convulsions, coma, and ultimately death. Pregnant ewes in late pregnancy that exhibit these symptoms may be suffering from pregnancy toxaemia.
Treatment of Pregnancy Toxaemia
Prompt treatment is essential for a positive outcome when dealing with pregnancy toxaemia. The focus is on providing the ewe with additional energy to balance the negative energy state. Administering propylene glycol orally or via an injection is the most common treatment. Propylene glycol provides an immediate source of energy for the body and aids in reducing ketone levels.
In addition to this, a veterinarian may prescribe additional medications to control convulsions and support recovery. Intravenous fluids may be used to replenish fluids lost through dehydration, and glucose or dextrose may be given to boost blood sugar levels.
Prevention of Pregnancy Toxaemia in Ewes
Prevention is always better than treatment when it comes to managing metabolic conditions in pregnant ewes. Here are some tips to prevent pregnancy toxaemia:
1. Monitor the condition of pregnant ewes regularly and separate any that show signs of weakness or poor appetite.
2. Provide adequate nutrition for ewes during pregnancy, including green pastures, forages, and feeding concentrates.
3. Monitor body weight and condition to ensure sufficient energy reserves are maintained.
4. Movement should be minimized as much as possible, and any stressful events should be avoided entirely to reduce the occurrence of energy wastage.
5. Minimize the occurrence of twin pregnancies in ewes. Twin pregnancies are common triggers for pregnancy toxaemia.
Conclusion
In summary, pregnancy toxaemia is a metabolic condition that occurs when pregnant ewes experience a negative energy balance due to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy. The impact of pregnancy toxaemia can be catastrophic in some cases, leading to the death of the ewe and her unborn lambs. Treatment involves providing energy supplements, and prevention is the best approach through the implementation of effective management practices to ensure that ewes maintain sufficient nutritional levels throughout the pregnancy.
