Manufacturing exports play a significant role in the economic growth of low to middle income countries. The manufacturing sector's ability to catalyze growth has been demonstrated in various economies across the world. However, what determines manufacturing exports, and how they impact policy making varies across different national contexts. This paper analyzes cross-sectional data from 40 developing countries between 1985-2000, including variables such as gross domestic savings, foreign direct investment, and electricity production to understand the relationship between exports and economic growth. Additionally, this paper explores the role of manufactured exports in contributing to economic growth and the importance of export composition in determining growth expansion.
There is a growing recognition of the role that manufacturing exports play in achieving economic growth. The manufacturing sector is characterized by the production of goods that create value, with higher job productivity and greater innovation compared to other sectors. It is these characteristics that contribute to growth in gross domestic product (GDP). However, growth in manufacturing exports depends on various factors. One such factor is the availability of capital. Countries with sufficient capital often have a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector, as they have the ability to purchase machinery and hire skilled labor. 
Another factor that influences manufacturing exports is foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI is an investment made by a foreign firm in a local entity that produces goods. Countries that have high levels of FDI have a greater chance of experiencing growth in manufacturing as foreign firms set up factories. FDI also increases the availability of capital in the local economy, making it more likely for firms to seek growth in manufacturing exports. However, FDI can also displace local firms, leading to reduced opportunities for local residents.
While investment plays an important role, electricity production is also essential for growth in manufacturing exports. The manufacturing sector requires a significant amount of energy to maintain production. Countries with low levels of electricity production have been unable to expand their manufacturing sector despite having sufficient capital and FDI. Thus, electricity production is a crucial factor in determining manufacturing exports, as no amount of capital or foreign investment can substitute for the necessary energy required in the manufacturing process.
Moreover, the savings rate within a country plays a major role in determining the rate of manufacturing exports. Gross domestic savings are funds the residents of a country save in banks and other financiers domestically. It is these savings that finance the investments needed for manufacturing growth. Countries with low savings rates find it challenging to finance investment in the manufacturing sector. International banks are often unwilling to lend to countries with low savings rates, especially if the country lacks a sound banking and financial infrastructure. Therefore, countries with a high rate of domestic savings have a greater chance of achieving sustained growth in manufacturing exports.
Manufacturing exports can contribute significantly to economic growth in low to middle income countries. These exports increase output, and in turn, create jobs leading to higher levels of income. Moreover, growth in manufacturing exports has a positive impact on other sectors of the economy, leading to growth in the agricultural and service sectors. Additionally, the efficiency gains from the manufacturing sector could cause cost reductions in other sectors, making their products more competitive in the global market.
However, the composition of exports is another essential factor to consider. Countries that have a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector can only achieve significant growth if they specialize in the most profitable and labor-intensive products. The range of products manufactured must also be diverse and reflect changes and evolving demand trends. Diversification reduces the risks countries face in a volatile marketplace, as individuals in different regions demand different products. Additionally, increasing the complexity of production within the economy leads to higher value-added activities. This increases income levels for workers and the economy as a whole. 
In summary, manufacturing exports have a significant impact on GDP growth in low to middle income countries. The factors that influence manufacturing exports include access to capital, electricity production, foreign direct investment, and gross domestic savings. A combination of these factors is necessary to achieve significant growth in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the composition of manufactured goods must be diverse to maximize the returns from the manufacturing sector. 
Making policies that effectively promote manufacturing exports requires an understanding of the different factors that promote growth. As a result, policy makers need to implement strategies targeted at increasing electricity production, capital formation, savings, and FDI. Strategic plans should focus on diversifying the export portfolio based on innovative techniques, which will provide comparative advantage in value-added activities and capture emerging productivity gains through increasing technology. This will allow low to middle income countries to increase their manufacturing exports, ultimately leading to economic growth, high productivity, and job creation.
