Neolithic monuments are some of the most intriguing creations left behind by our ancient ancestors. Built in the Stone Age, these structures have mystified archaeologists, historians, and scholars for years, evoking interest not only for their technological sophistication but also their apparent religious and cultural functions. Among these monuments is the Avebury stone circle, an impressive prehistoric site located in Wiltshire, England. This expansive stone circle, encompassing over 28 acres, has remained an enigma to modern-day researchers, with many theories explaining its purpose, construction, and significance. In this essay, we will explore the various theories behind the function and use of the Neolithic monuments at Avebury and the evidence that supports them.
To begin with, it is important to provide historical context on the Avebury stone circle’s creation. According to archaeological evidence, the monument was built during the Neolithic period, specifically around 3000 BCE, in three distinct phases, each of which saw the addition of more stones and earthworks. During the initial phase, the builders erected a large circular bank, measuring approximately 420 meters in diameter, using Wiltshire chalk to create a mound with a depth of 6 meters and a height of over 10 meters. In the second phase, they inserted very large standing stones, sourced from Marlborough Downs, into the banks to form the current circle. The final phase, the so-called Avenues Phase, saw the construction of two long, parallel stone rows that run from the circle to the nearby River Kennet.
One of the most popular theories for the function of the Avebury stone circle is the astronomical alignment hypothesis, which suggests that the builders designed the monument to observe celestial events, such as the solstices, equinoxes, and phases of the moon. Since the location of the standing stones and the rows is in a design pattern, so they may have represented celestial bodies or served as markers for some astronomical event. According to this theory, the stones are positioned in alignment with the sunrise and sunset of the midsummer and midwinter solstices, and with the point of the winter solstice sunset. Likewise, the earth bank was constructed to align with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset. Finally, the Southern entrance to the circle may have aligned with the moon's southernmost rising point, while the northern entrance with its northernmost rising point. This astronomical alignment hypothesis is supported by observed astronomical events during sunrise and sunset at the solstices, as well as the discovery of Neolithic artifacts, including an antler pick, wooden mallets, and cattle bones, which also suggest an important cultural or spiritual role in the monument construction.
Another theory proposes that the Avebury stone circle was a venerable pilgrimage site, sought out by Neolithic people from far and wide led by their priests or shamans. This theory does not reject the astronomical alignment hypothesis, as it could also be a part of a cultural identification concerning the site's auspiciousness. Pilgrims visiting Avebury may have believed that it held the power to connect them with ancestral spirits, the dead, or possibly deities or divine beings. The location of the monument next to a known water source and crossing point may also be significant for prehistoric travelers. Evidence that supports this theory includes the discovery of human remains buried in the vicinity, including skeletons and artifacts believed to be associated with funerary practices, receiving more substantial importance from thousands of years of human sacrifice. Some scholars suggest that the imposing nature of the stones and the circular shape of the monument may have been designed to reinforce feelings of community and a shared sense of purpose for those gathered within the circle.
A third theory aims to explain the function of the Avebury stone circle as a symbol of regional power or a significant representation of the agricultural society. This theory suggests that the monument was an embodiment of the ruling powers' authority, probably represented by the elite's ruling the area. Specifically, it could be a statement of the power of the farming community, celebrating a successful harvest. The agriculture theory explains that the monument's location indicates that the Wiltshire landscape was an essential agricultural region, and the circle could are represent that farming prosperity and embodied the deity of the land and seasons connected to the offerings of food and drink at important times of the year, such as harvest and sowing times. The Avenue hypothesis supports this theory, augmenting that it enhanced and created connections with other monuments or the countryside, enabling the movement of local produce to the area and increasing its importance and influence in the region.
A further theory that should be mentioned is the ritual landscape hypothesis, which supposes that each monument in a given area of the land would constitute a part of a larger ritual landscape. According to archaeologist Joshua Pollard, these landscapes were purposefully constructed so that individual monuments would interconnect and communicate, in the same manner as buildings in a modern-day village. The Avebury monument set within the broader Wiltshire landscape, including neolithic monuments like Stonehenge, Silbury Hill, and West Kennet Long Barrow, it has been suggested that these places form a single, interconnected landscape. At the center of this landscape, Avebury would have played a central role in the events and festivals of the region, allowing the movement of people, goods, and animals through its gates and entrances. Excavation and evidence from the West Kennet Long Barrow provide evidence bolstering the theory that passed along an ancient “landscape highway." Pilgrims, traders, and townspeople alike using the “highway” and stopping at the sites on their journeys.
In conclusion, there are various theories about the function and use of the Neolithic monument at Avebury, including the astronomical alignment hypothesis, the pilgrimage theory, the agricultural theory, and the ritual landscape hypothesis. Each of these theories is supported by archaeological evidence, including the location of Avebury and its connection to astronomical events, the discovery of human remains, the monument's positioning in the agricultural landscape, and evidence of social interactions linking Avebury to other ancient sites. The enigmatic nature of the Avebury stone circle has captured people's imaginations for centuries. Although we may never learn the creators' true purpose, these theories offer fascinating insights into a bygone era's customs and activities. As more scientific information becomes available, the circle's mystery may be unlocked, and we may be able to appreciate this ancient monument more fully. Whatever the purpose of the Avebury stone circle, it remains a testament to the ingenuity of our prehistoric ancestors and an intrigue of mystery and fascination for those who visit it today.
