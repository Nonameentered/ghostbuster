The theory of endosymbiosis posits that several eukaryotic organelles, specifically mitochondria and chloroplasts, are derived from bacterial cells, which were taken up by proto-eukaryotes and subsequently evolved into organelles that are now integral to intra-cellular energy production and photosynthesis. The experimental techniques employed by the scientific community over the decades have been instrumental in providing considerable evidence on the topic, which has in turn, revolutionized our understanding of the nature and the evolution of life. The theory of endosymbiosis has significant implications for several areas of biological research such as developmental biology, genetics, and systematics. This essay aims to explore the theory of endosymbiosis, the evidence supporting it, and its implications on biological research, in addition to some alternative theories involving the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
Endosymbiosis theory was first proposed in the early 1960s by Lynn Margulis, an American biologist who posited that mitochondria and chloroplasts within eukaryotic cells arose from independent, free-living prokaryotic organisms that assimilated into a common ancestral cell. Margulis's theory helped to solve some long-standing problems in evolutionary biology, particularly the origins of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiosis theory presupposes that two independent organisms that initially formed a symbiotic relationship have gradually evolved into a unified entity, a notion known as symbiogenesis. 
The argument put forward by Margulis and others is that mitochondria and chloroplasts started out as free-living bacteria, with the former producing energy for eukaryotic cells through oxidative phosphorylation, while the latter manufacture energy via photosynthesis. Eukaryotic cells that engulfed these progenitors of mitochondria and chloroplasts hence gained significant competitive advantages during the process of evolution. This idea has been corroborated by substantial empirical evidence, including morphological and genetic similarities between organelles and bacteria and how they function in eukaryotic cells today.
In addition to functional similarities, the presence of DNA in eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts provides compelling evidence for the endosymbiotic origin of these organelles. The mitochondrial genome has unique features similar to that of gram-negative bacteria, including a circular genome, the presence of multiple replication origins, and the similarity between mitochondrial ribosomes and bacterial 70S ribosomes. It has been estimated that mitochondrial DNA contains roughly 37 genes, all of which relate to the electron transport chain, ATP synthesis, and other essential mitochondrial functions. Likewise, the chloroplast genomes of plants and other photosynthetic eukaryotes are similar in structure to bacteria, with circular DNA encoding genes for photosynthesis and other chloroplast-specific functions.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts replicate autonomously, and they have their own machinery for gene expression, replication, and repair. Mitochondrial fission occurs by a process similar to binary fission in bacteria, which allows for each daughter cell to inherit mtDNA. Cells with damaged mitochondria can contain "rescue" organelles that share genetic similarities to bacteria and can provide the proper function of the damaged organelle. Hence, endosymbiont theory excellently and sensibly explains why mitochondria and chloroplasts are not only unique features of eukaryotic organisms but also why they retain many characteristics of their bacterial predecessors. 
Due to the experiments carried out by researchers, the endosymbiosis theory has gained considerable empirical support. For example, it has been demonstrated that when eukaryotic cells are treated with antibiotics to eliminate bacterial infections, mitochondria lose their ability to generate ATP, resulting in cell death. This is because the electron transport chain in mitochondria is similar to one in bacteria, and bacterial-targeting antibiotics can hence target mitochondria as well, inhibiting ATP production. Similarly, chloroplasts exhibit similarities to bacteria when it comes to protein synthesis and metabolism, so treating plants with antibiotics kills the chloroplasts. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy studies reveal that living cells consisting of phototrophic algae and bacteria display a significant degree of movement within these cells under various light and dark conditions. It further supports the notion that these cells create unique, symbiotic associations over time.
Apart from providing insights into the origin of eukaryotic cells, the theory of endosymbiosis has significant implications for other areas of biological research. It has advanced our understanding of the evolution and diversity of life on earth, in addition to the genomic and cellular basis of human diseases. Furthermore, research into mechanisms underlying symbiotic associations between organisms, analogous to the endosymbiosis theory, has become an essential topic of investigation in the study of microbial ecology.
Finally, some alternative theories have been proposed to explain the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. One of them argues that mitochondria and chloroplasts arose through the gradual development of such organelles from the endoplasmic reticulum within eukaryotic cells. While an interesting idea, it has been demonstrated to have considerable weaknesses in comparison to the endosymbiont theory. The most significant weakness is that it cannot adequately explain the process by which chloroplasts first emerged in eukaryotic cells or why the genetic content of the endoplasmic reticulum was discarded while the genome of the chloroplast persists. The idea that they arose through abiotic means, i.e., they formed from the non-living environment, has been proposed, but it has also been discounted because their structure and metabolism are similar to bacteria.
In conclusion, the theory of endosymbiosis provides an elegantly concise explanation for the origin and functional abilities of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells. Empirical support of the endosymbiont theory has been gathered over the decades, providing significant insights into the evolutionary origins of eukaryotic cells, as well as opportunities for new lines of investigation in diverse biological fields. While alternative theories have been proposed, many of these have been found to lack empirical support or are inconsistent with the evidence, leaving the endosymbiosis theory as the most plausible explanation for the origin of these critical eukaryotic organelles.
