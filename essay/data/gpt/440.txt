Edmund Husserl is widely considered to be one of the most revered philosophers of the 20th century, particularly for his creator of the phenomenological method. Phenomenology is an influential branch of philosophy that reflects upon the experience or observation of things rather than the things themselves. It implies a methodological reorientation from goals and outcomes to the subjective experience of the subject. The overarching objective of Husserl's phenomenological method is to enable a detailed and methodical investigation of the essential structure of consciousness. To achieve this objective, the method employs a technique of abstracting from the actual features of a specific experience while preserving the content of this experience. This process is known as suspension, or bracketing, which leads to a realm that Husserl terms the "phenomenological reduction." While Husserl denied that the results of phenomenological reduction lead to metaphysical idealism, it is easy to see that this is, in fact, one of its core features.
The term "phenomenological reduction" refers to a methodological requirement that every phenomenon must be stripped of all interpretations, preconceptions, presuppositions, and natural attitudes before it can be described precisely. For Husserl, phenomenological reduction involves suspending all acquired knowledge and beliefs through epoché or bracketing. In the bracketing process, the phenomenologist intentionally withholds his or her natural attitude toward an object or phenomenon to which the attention is directed. The phenomenologist focuses only on the object, “bracketing” any preconceptions or assumptions. This process enables researchers to describe how things appear in conscious experience rather than their physical nature, without imposing any preconceived judgments on the matter.
Husserl believed that by eliminating preconceptions, he could reach the "essence" of the phenomenon in question. The essence of an object was something that was present in the consciousness of the observer. To get to this level of observation Husserl believed that one needed to discard the outside world and concentrate solely on the conscious experience as it occurs. In Husserl's words, "Phenomenology requires a return to the things themselves (re-awakening of naivete) which includes a frank re-awakening of the lifeworld and the natural standpoint, recognition of the real world and the situation of the subject” (Carlson, 2003). 
Phenomenological reduction thus relies on the view that the content of experience precedes our establishment of objective reality, allowing us to gain an understanding of the essence of things that we couldn't have obtained from looking at them alone. The content of experience, rather than absolute truth, is secured via reflection and intuition, accompanied by a process of reduction of all objective assumptions. Reduction can thus be understood as a dialectical process that transforms merely subjective representations into objective ones or even ideal concepts. Therefore, Husserl's phenomenological reduction aims to uncover the mental content of experience that pervades our interpretation of any given match and to remove as much subjectivity from the analysis of reality as possible (Dan Zahavi, 2003). 
The interpretation of phenomenological reduction has yielded different outcomes among scholars and critique. Some view it as a solid groundwork for Husserl's transcendental phenomenology, which ascribes a fundamental affinity between the phenomenological subject and the constituting subject of transcendental philosophy, leading to the idealistic verdict. Phenomenological reduction employed by Husserl implies that one has no way of accessing an external, objective world beyond the realm of subjectivity. That which we can attain via phenomenological reduction is an ideal or conceptual reality that remains an ideal that is never realized. It is founded on the idea that the only world we can know is the world we find in the act of experiencing it. Therefore, the experienced world is not an independent reality but a creation of the observing subject, giving rise to the subjective idealist interpretation.
Husserl defines transcendental phenomenology as the radicalization of phenomenology, which he says involves moving back further in the analysis towards the transcendental horizon of "the possible having-been of all constitution," which is the condition for the constitution of things as objects for consciousness (Shaviro, 2014). In this sense, the transcendental phenomenology is essentially an examination of the fundamental structures of consciousness that are required for the constitution of meaning. This investigation leads to the discovery that meaning is generated by consciousness itself in interplay with transcendental structures that Husserl first described in his Ideas, notably the transcendental ego, which is responsible for the constitution of meaning through its intentional relationship to the world.
The transcendental idealism arising from Husserl's phenomenological reduction is a significant point of debate among scholars. The phenomenological reduction is based on the rationalization of our perception of reality as it exists in our minds. Thus the reduction goes beyond mere empirical observation and takes us to a level where all preconceptions and presuppositions are void. As Husserl himself describes it, the process of reduction "results in the purification of the phenomenon as an intentional correlate" (Husserl, 1960, p. 98). This purification results in the discovery of the essence of the thing being observed, which reveals that all experiences arise from the subject, and the object is purely subjective. As such, critics have argued that Husserl's transcendental phenomenology leads to subjective idealism, involving a world created by ourselves rather than an external reality that we discover. 
Husserl himself prepared his methodology of idealism, in which the role of the human mind is considered primary in creating the world we perceive. In this way, the burden of proof is on the observer to show that any given judgment matches up with how things are independent of human consciousness. This leads to the idea that objectivity is a product of a particular set of experiences and cannot represent external alternatives beyond the domain of the experience. Such a conclusion can be associated with metaphysical idealism since it posits that reality is created within the human mind. 
Husserl himself, however, denied the link between his phenomenological reduction method and metaphysical idealism. He preferred to use the term "transcendental idealism" to signify that the objects of experience were phenomena rather than things in themselves. Husserl accepts that the subject of phenomenological reduction provides a detailed and exact analysis of the object's mental content. He believed that what we experience is not a given fact but the result of our contingent perspectives. However, he stopped short of endorsing the concept that everything perceived is subjective since they are responses to a particular stimulus. For Husserl, transcendental idealism accentuates the importance of the mental world and the fact that it prevails over the objective world, which, while we cannot escape it, is ultimately possible to transcend through reduction. 
In summary, Husserl's phenomenological reduction is a method of bracketing, allowing the subject to discriminate from all presuppositions, interpretations, and natural attitudes about an object or phenomenon. This technique empowers the phenomenologist to explore the essence of an object or phenomenon in question. The phenomenological reduction process has generated different interpretations, including an idealistic interpretation, which sees it as leading to a form of subjective idealism, where reality depends on perception and the mind's essential structure. Husserl made significant contributions to the transcendental idealism that emphasizes the importance of the mental world and the fact that it prevails over the objective world. Husserl's critique, however, denied the link between his phenomenological reduction method and metaphysical idealism, preferring to refer to it only as transcendental idealism. 
Ultimately, the core strength of Husserl's method is its ability to provide an account that is highly reflective of the fundamental structures of our experiences. Phenomenology as a method has been applied in various fields, including psychology, where it has been used to study individual's subjective lived experiences. While Husserl's method has produced various interpretations, the value of phenomenology as a framework for facilitating a robust understanding of experience at the fundamental level endures, and this is down to his application of phenomenological reduction.
