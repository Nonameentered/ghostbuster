Introduction
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects children and can be particularly distressing for parents. Families attending a clinic for diagnosis or treatment of ADHD can exhibit various behaviors that can be analyzed using attachment theory. Attachment theory suggests that the quality of attachment patterns between parents and children can influence child development and their future mental health. Erickson's developmental theory can be used as a framework to understand the impact of early experiences on child development, and the genogram can provide further insight into the complexities of family dynamics. This essay will describe two observations of a family attending a clinic for ADHD and analyze the behaviors observed using attachment theory. It will also discuss possible implications for the child's future mental health using Erikson’s developmental theory and provide a genogram to illustrate the complex family system.
Observation 1
During the intake interview, a mother and her 8-year-old son were observed. The mother was highly anxious and seemed on edge, while her son was fidgeting and climbing on the furniture. The mother repeatedly interrupted her son and completed his sentences before he could finish them. She also blamed herself for her son’s behavior and seemed emotionally exhausted. The son appeared disinterested in the conversation and seemed to be seeking attention by jumping and fidgeting instead of listening to his mother or answering the clinician's questions.
Attachment Theory Analysis
In this observation, it is evident that the mother and her son have a problematic attachment relationship. The mother seems highly anxious and unable to create a secure environment for her son. She is also interrupting him and completing his sentences, which can indicate a lack of trust in her son's communication skills. This behavior can impact the child’s self-esteem, as he may feel his opinions are not valued. The son’s fidgeting and jumping can be a reflection of his insecure attachment style, which can be an indication of a lack of nurturing. This type of behavior can also reflect a way of seeking attention, which can be an indication of an insecure attachment.
Implications for Future Mental Health
There is evidence that insecure attachment patterns in childhood put children at risk for worse mental health outcomes later in life. Children who have an insecure attachment pattern with their parent tend to have lower self-esteem and more externalizing behaviors like aggression, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Sroufe, 2009). The son's behavior in this observation indicates that he might be at risk for an externalizing disorder like ADHD. The mother's anxious behavior further complicates his attachment style, possibly making him more vulnerable to future emotional issues.
Erikson’s Developmental Theory Analysis
Erikson's developmental theory is essential for understanding how early experiences shape future mental health. According to Erikson’s theory, a child’s development is shaped by a series of psychosocial crises that require resolution for healthy development. At age 8, the child should be resolving the psychosocial crisis of industry vs. inferiority (Erikson, 1980), which describes the child's developing sense of competence. In this case, the son's behavior indicates that he may be struggling with this crisis, resulting in feelings of inferiority. This can also indicate that he may not be developing a sense of mastery, which can affect his future mental health and well-being.
Observation 2
In the second observation, a father and his 10-year-old daughter were observed during the intake interview. The father appeared highly critical and dismissive of his daughter's behaviors and concerns. He repeatedly cut her off, talked over her, and seemed to belittle her complaints. The daughter appeared angry and frustrated, and her responses were often short and curt.
Attachment Theory Analysis
In this observation, it is evident that the father and daughter have a problematic attachment relationship. The father's dismissive behavior creates an insecure attachment style for the daughter, where she does not feel heard or acknowledged. This type of behavior can lead to feelings of rejection and cause the child to have difficulty forming healthy relationships later in life. The daughter's anger and frustration can be a reflection of her feelings of rejection and her attempts to assert herself and communicate her needs.
Implications for Future Mental Health
Children with a problematic relationship with their parents can have significant mental health implications in the future. In this case, the daughter may develop low self-esteem and a lack of confidence, which can impact her social skills and ability to form healthy relationships in the future. The daughter's anger and frustration can also indicate the potential for developing an internalizing disorder like anxiety and depression later in life.
Erikson’s Developmental Theory Analysis
According to Erikson's theory, at age ten, a child should be resolving the psychosocial crisis of industry vs. inferiority (Erikson, 1980), which describes the child's developing sense of competence. In this case, the daughter's behavior indicates that she may be struggling with this crisis, as she is not feeling heard or acknowledged by her father. Her father’s negative comments and dismissive behavior may cause her to doubt her abilities and undermine her developing sense of self-confidence and self-efficacy.
Genogram
Appendix A provides a genogram of the family system. The genogram reveals that the mother's relationship with her mother was problematic, as her mother was emotionally unstable and had a history of substance abuse. The father's relationship with his father was also problematic as his father was critical and judgmental. These patterns of insecure attachment in the family can explain the current attachment difficulties their children are experiencing.
Conclusion
In conclusion, attachment theory provides a framework for understanding the complex parent-child relationships observed during the intake interviews in the ADHD clinic. The observations revealed that the families had problematic attachment relationships, which could result in future mental health issues for their children. Erikson's developmental theory provided insights into how early experiences can shape the child's future mental health and pointed out the potential for negative outcomes for the children in these families. The genogram revealed the complexities of the family system, including a history of insecure attachment relationships, which can impact current parent-child relationships. Understanding these issues and addressing them through interventions can help alleviate the impact on the children's future mental health.
