The Futurist movement emerged in the early 20th century in Italy, with a strong desire to create a new artistic, social, and technological world. Among their various innovative endeavors, performance and theatre played a significant role in their creative agenda. In this essay, I will discuss the goals of the futurists in their performance innovations and explore how they aimed to achieve them.
The Futurists sought to reinvent art, literature, and culture by rejecting traditional forms and embracing new technologies and perspectives. They were fascinated with speed, technology, and the power of machines, as these elements symbolized the progress and modernization they envisioned for society. Their search for novelty was driven by a desire to escape from the constraints and conventions of past artistic traditions, which they regarded as outdated and uninspired.
One of the main goals of the Futurists in their performances was to create a new style of theatre that would express their vision of a modern world. They aimed to create a form of theatre that was not tethered to the past, but rather evolved in sync with the pace of contemporary life. They wanted to break free from the constraints of traditional theatre and create performances that reflected the technological advances of modern times.
The Futurists sought to achieve their goals through various techniques and innovations. They wanted to disrupt the conventional boundaries between the audience and the performers. They sought to create an immersive experience that would allow the audience to be an active participant in the performance. They aimed to create a theatre that stimulated the senses, bringing the audience closer to the emotions and experiences of the performers.
One of the key innovations that the Futurists embraced was the use of machinery and technology in their performances. They saw machines as a symbol of progress and a source of inspiration for new art forms. They used various forms of machinery in their performances, such as electric lights, projectors, and sound machines, to create a sense of dynamism and excitement.
Another technique that the Futurists employed was the use of fragmentation, simultaneity, and the division of space on stage. They sought to create a sense of multiple perspectives or experiences happening at the same time, aiming to stimulate the viewer's senses and imagination. They sought to create a new form of performance that didn't represent a single linear narrative but instead created a kind of associative montage of images and sounds.
The Futurists also aimed to create a new kind of performer, one who would embody the energy and dynamism of modern times. They sought to train performers who are physically and emotionally capable of conveying the speed and excitement of the modern world. The performers were expected to be more than simple actors reciting lines, they were to be highly skilled, physically fit and capable of expressing their emotions through their bodies in a dynamic and engaging way.
The Futurists' performances often featured provocative and controversial subject matter. They used nudity, violence, and shock tactics to create a sense of energy and tension on the stage. They sought to challenge the audience's preconceptions and push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in public performances.
One of the main reasons why the Futurists embraced performance and theatre was that they saw it as a medium for social change. They believed that by creating new forms of artistic expression, they were contributing to the creation of a new social order. They sought to tear down the walls that divided art and life, creating a new kind of art that would be accessible and relevant to the general public.
In conclusion, the Futurists were avant-garde artists who used performance and theatre as a tool to express their vision of a new world. They aimed to create a new kind of theatre that would embody the speed, dynamism, and progress of contemporary life. They sought to break free from the limitations of traditional theatre by embracing technology, fragmentation, and provocative subject matter. The Futurists sought to create a form of performance that would become a part of people's everyday life, contributing to the creation of a new social order. Today, their work remains a vital example of innovative art that challenges conventions and inspires new forms of creative expression.
