Thrombelastography (TEG) is a tool used to measure hemostasis and coagulation in patients undergoing surgery. This test provides a detailed analysis of the clotting process, which helps physicians understand the patient's risk of bleeding or thrombosis during perioperative coagulopathy. TEG is a global assay of the clotting process, measuring the entire clotting cascade, from clot formation to lysis.
The scientific principles of hemostasis involve the balance between the clotting cascade and the fibrinolytic system. The clotting cascade consists of platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrin formation, leading to the formation of a clot. Fibrinolysis, on the other hand, is the process of breaking down clots to prevent thrombus formation. These two systems work in harmony to maintain the delicate balance of hemostasis.
TEG measures the clotting cascade through several parameters, including reaction time (R), clot formation time (K), angle (α), maximum amplitude (MA), and lysis. The R time determines the time to the start of clot formation, indicating the presence of coagulation factors, platelets, and other clotting proteins. The K time represents the time for clot formation, indicating the rate of fibrin cross-linking and platelet activation. The α angle is the slope between K and MA, indicating the rate of clot formation. The MA represents the maximum clot strength, indicating the strength of the clot. Finally, lysis represents the degradation of the clot by the fibrinolytic system.
TEG provides several advantages over standard coagulation tests. It is a global coagulation assay that provides a more comprehensive view of hemostasis. Standard coagulation tests, such as PT, PTT, and INR, are limited to the evaluation of individual coagulation factors and do not provide information on the fibrinolytic system. TEG can also provide real-time monitoring of clot formation, allowing physicians to adjust transfusion requirements accordingly. Additionally, TEG provides information on the effectiveness of antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel.
There is evidence for the accuracy and relevance of TEG in predicting perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements. A study published in the journal Anesthesiology found that TEG was more accurate in predicting blood transfusion requirements than PT and PTT. Another study published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery found that TEG identified the need for transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets more accurately than PT and PTT. Additionally, a study published in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia found that TEG-guided transfusion resulted in a reduction in transfusion requirements and improved patient outcomes.
However, there are some disadvantages to TEG. It is more expensive and time-consuming than standard coagulation tests. Additionally, TEG requires specialized training and expertise to interpret the results accurately.
In conclusion, thrombelastography is a valuable tool in assessing perioperative coagulopathy and transfusion requirements. Through its comprehensive analysis of the clotting and fibrinolytic systems, TEG provides physicians with a more accurate and real-time view of the patient's hemostasis. While it may be more expensive and time-consuming than standard coagulation tests, TEG's ability to improve patient outcomes and reduce transfusion requirements makes it a powerful tool in the management of perioperative bleeding.
