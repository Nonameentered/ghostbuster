Introduction
When it comes to finishing beef cattle, the type of silage used as their main feed has an impact on the characteristics of the beef carcass, as well as the cost of production. Two of the most commonly used types of silage are maize and grass. This essay aims to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using maize silage compared to grass silage as the primary feed for finishing beef cattle, and how it affects the final characteristics of the beef carcass.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Maize Silage Compared to Grass Silage
Maize silage is a high-quality feed that has a high energy content and is readily available for feeding. It is also easily digestible, which makes it an ideal feed for beef cattle that are being finished for market. Additionally, maize silage has a longer shelf life than grass silage, making it an excellent option for farmers who want to store their feed for an extended period.
On the other hand, grass silage is an excellent feed for beef cattle as it contains a high amount of fibre, which enables animals to maintain a healthy digestive system. Grass silage also contains a wide range of minerals and vitamins that are essential for the overall health and wellbeing of animals. Furthermore, grass silage is cheaper compared to maize silage, making it an attractive option for farmers who operate on a tight budget.
The final characteristics of the beef carcass are also affected by the type of silage used as the primary feed. A study conducted by Lynch et al., (2016), aimed at evaluating the effect of using maize silage compared to grass silage on the quality of beef carcass. The study involved feeding beef cattle with either maize silage or grass silage for 150 days before slaughter. The researchers evaluated several parameters, including carcass weight, dressing percentage, fat coverage, and intramuscular fat content.
Results of the Study Comparing Maize Silage and Grass Silage
The study by Lynch et al., (2016) found that feeding beef cattle with maize silage resulted in an increase in intramuscular fat content compared to grass silage. Intramuscular fat, commonly referred to as marbling, is the fat that is found within the muscle tissue. A higher amount of marbling results in more tender and flavourful beef. The researchers attributed the increase in intramuscular fat to the higher energy content of maize silage compared to grass silage.
Additionally, the study found that feeding beef cattle with maize silage resulted in higher carcass weights and dressing percentages compared to grass silage. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The researchers attributed the higher carcass weights and dressing percentages to the higher energy content of maize silage.
Further analysis of the results showed that beef cattle fed on maize silage had a higher fat coverage compared to those fed on grass silage. Fat coverage refers to the thickness of the external fat layer on the carcass. However, the increase in fat coverage is considered undesirable as it results in a higher proportion of trimmable fat, which leads to a lower retail yield.
Conclusion
In conclusion, both maize silage and grass silage have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of feed depends on several factors, such as the availability and price of the feed. When it comes to finishing beef cattle, the type of silage used has an impact on the final characteristics of the beef carcass. A study by Lynch et al., (2016), showed that feeding beef cattle with maize silage resulted in a higher intramuscular fat content, higher carcass weights, and dressing percentages compared to grass silage. However, feeding with maize silage also resulted in a higher fat coverage, which is considered undesirable as it leads to a lower retail yield. Ultimately, the choice of feed depends on several factors, and farmers must evaluate the cost and benefits of each option before making a decision.
