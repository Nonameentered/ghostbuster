Youth culture has been a topic of fascination for sociologists, psychologists, and other scholars in various fields for decades. It has often been the subject of intense debate and analysis, as society attempts to decode the enigma of the young and understand their motivations. However, youth culture has often been viewed as problematic, particularly with regard to so-called "problem youth." This viewpoint was famously propounded by cultural theorist Dick Hebdige, who argued that the dominant cultural narrative has always constructed young people as a threat to the established social order. This essay seeks to explore Hebdige's argument and how it is supported by moral panics and youth subculture theories. Additionally, it discusses the portrayal of young people in a negative light and the consequences of negative labeling in society.
In his 1979 book, "Subculture: The Meaning of Style," Hebdige posits that society has always viewed youth culture as a threat to social and cultural values. He argues that young people often form subcultures as a way of rejecting the dominant culture and creating their own, distinct identity. These subcultures may include punk, hip hop, rockabilly, mods, and many others. According to Hebdige, such subcultures are often seen as problematic by the dominant culture because they challenge the status quo. They are seen as a rejection of the mainstream culture, and therefore, a threat to the social and cultural values that the mainstream culture represents.
To illustrate his point, Hebdige turns to several examples. He notes that in the early 20th century, the Teddy Boy subculture in the UK was seen as a threat to the traditional, conservative values of British society. Similarly, the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s were viewed as a menace to public order and morality. Hebdige argues that the media played a significant role in perpetuating this narrative by depicting these subcultures in a negative light.
Another phenomenon that supports Hebdige's argument is the concept of a moral panic. A moral panic is a phenomenon in which a particular group or behavior is identified as a threat to society. Moral panics often lead to an exaggerated, disproportionate response from society and the media. Examples of moral panics involving youth culture abound. For instance, the "Satanic Panic" of the 1980s was triggered by fears that young people were engaging in devil worship and engaging in other anti-social behavior. Similarly, the "Mods and Rockers" moral panic of the 1960s was triggered by reports of violent clashes between the two subcultures.
Youth subculture theories also support Hebdige's argument. These theories suggest that young people form subcultures as a way of expressing their identity and rejecting the dominant culture. According to these theories, young people often feel disconnected from society and mainstream culture, and may join subcultures as a way of finding belonging and identity. However, these subcultures are often seen as problematic by the dominant culture, which views them as a threat to social and cultural values.
The depiction of young people in a negative light has significant consequences for society as a whole. Negative labeling can lead to stigmatization, marginalization, and exclusion. This, in turn, can lead to social and economic disadvantage for young people who are already struggling to find their place in society. Additionally, negative labeling can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about young people and reinforce negative views about them. This can further exacerbate the problems faced by young people, leading to increased social marginalization and exclusion.
Furthermore, the view of youth as problematic can also lead to a culture of fear and suspicion. This can create tensions between young people and society, leading to increased conflict and mistrust. It can also lead to a reluctance on the part of society to engage with young people and understand their concerns. This can further perpetuate the cycle of marginalization and exclusion, leading to a social divide between young people and society.
In conclusion, Hebdige's argument that youth culture has always been viewed as problematic by society is supported by moral panics and youth subculture theories. Moreover, the depiction of young people in a negative light has significant consequences for society as a whole. Negative labeling perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces negative views about young people. It creates a culture of fear and suspicion, which can exacerbate social tensions and lead to further marginalization. To break this cycle, society must work to understand and engage with young people, recognizing subcultures as a valid form of expression and identity. It is only then that we can move towards a more inclusive and positive vision of youth culture.
