The tourism industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Each year, millions of people travel across the globe, and the industry generates billions of dollars in revenue. However, the advent of the internet has brought with it changes that have disrupted the traditional distribution channels in the tourism industry. This essay will examine the impact that the internet has had on the tourism industry, particularly on electronic distribution channels. It will also explore how traditional electronic distribution channels work, the intermediaries involved, and the impact these changes have had on tourism organizations.
Electronic distribution channels refer to the systems used to distribute products or services electronically. In the tourism industry, electronic distribution channels refer to the platforms that allow hotels, airlines, tour operators, and other travel-related businesses, to distribute their products to consumers. The internet has been a game-changer in this industry, enabling consumers to access a wider range of products, compare prices, and make reservations in a matter of minutes with minimal effort.
Before the internet, traditional electronic distribution channels involved the use of intermediaries, also known as travel agents. These agents acted as middlemen that helped customers book their travel arrangements. They took on a critical role in the tourism industry by providing customers with information, advice, and recommendations. Today, however, traditional intermediaries have been disrupted by internet-based intermediaries such as online travel agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity.
The impact that the internet has had on the tourism industry has been significant. It has transformed the traditional role of intermediaries, making it easier for customers to make their travel arrangements online. This improved accessibility has led to a decline in the use of traditional intermediaries. Customers can now book their travel arrangements directly with airlines, car rentals, or hotels, through their websites, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Tourism organizations and customers have also been impacted by the internet. It has provided organizations with a more cost-effective way to market their products and services. They can now reach a wider audience by using online marketing tactics. Moreover, customers are now more informed about the products and services available, and can make informed decisions due to the availability of online reviews and feedback from other customers.
The surge of internet use and availability has not only impacted tourism organizations and customers but has also prompted travel intermediaries and traditional distribution channels to re-evaluate their business models. With the rise of disintermediation, travel intermediaries must now remain competitive by providing their customers with an added value that cannot be obtained through direct online bookings. These intermediaries must offer personalized services that enhance the customer experience, such as advice, recommendations, and assistance with travel arrangements.
Research findings can be linked to the literature with a focus on tourist consumer behavior on the web to make recommendations for organizations involved in the tourism industry. As more people continue to use the internet, organizations must ensure that their websites are user-friendly, responsive, and provide customers with relevant and up-to-date information. Furthermore, offering incentives such as loyalty programs, discounts, and value-added services can enhance customer experiences and increase the likelihood of repeat business.
In addition to these recommendations, firms involved in the tourism industry should invest in data analytics. Data analytics can help organizations to understand customer behavior, preferences, and trends. They can use this data to personalize their services, target their marketing efforts, and improve the overall customer experience. Data analytics is also a valuable tool for intermediaries and travel agencies, who can use these insights to target their marketing efforts to specific customer segments.
In conclusion, the internet has had a significant effect on electronic distribution channels in the tourism industry. Traditional intermediaries have been disrupted, and companies must now remain competitive in the face of disintermediation. The internet has also provided organizations with a more cost-effective way to market their products and services while providing customers with more accessible information about the products and services available. Finally, research findings can be linked to the literature with a focus on tourist consumer behavior on the web to make recommendations for organizations involved in the tourism industry. As the industry continues to evolve, companies must be prepared to adapt and embrace change to remain competitive.
