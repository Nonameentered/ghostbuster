Democracy is a system of government in which the power lies in the hands of the people. The concept of democracy was introduced in Athens, Greece in the 5th century BC. Athenian democracy is often referred to as the first democracy in the world. Euripides’ play ‘Suppliants’ is a testament to the Athenian democracy and its portrayal through the character of Theseus. The play depicts the Athenian system of government, as exemplified by Theseus, who defends it passionately and addresses its perceived flaws.
In the play ‘Suppliants’, Theseus, the Athenian King, is portrayed as a wise and just leader. He is presented as a man who respects the laws of the land and upholds the rights of individuals. Theseus is a benevolent ruler who feels a sense of responsibility towards his people, their well-being, and their needs. His actions throughout the play reflect his commitment to Athenian democracy, which emphasizes the need for government officials to be accountable to the people they serve.
Theseus defends the Athenian system of government in several ways in the play. Firstly, he argues for the importance of the law and the need to uphold it. He tells the suppliants that he cannot accept their request because it violates the laws of his city. Theseus states that justice must be served under the law and that he cannot overlook the established rules and regulations of his city.
Secondly, Theseus highlights the importance of individual rights and freedom. He argues that everyone has the right to choose their own destiny and that nobody should be forced to do anything against their will. In the play, Theseus tells the suppliants that they have the freedom to leave Athens if they wish, but if they choose to stay, they must abide by the laws and customs of Athens.
Theseus also acknowledges that democracy is not a perfect system of government, and he addresses some of its perceived flaws in the play. For instance, he admits that the system can be slow and that it may take time for decisions to be made. Theseus highlights the importance of patience when dealing with democratic government, as the process can be slow but also ensures everyone has a voice.
Moreover, Theseus also addresses the issue of factionalism and its impact on the democratic system. He recognizes that people may have different views and opinions and that these differences can lead to tension and conflict. To address this problem, Theseus emphasizes the importance of unity and compromise. He tells the suppliants that it is only by working together that they can achieve a peaceful resolution to their problem.
The play accurately reflects the reality of Athenian democracy at the time it was written. The Athenian system of government was a direct democracy, which meant that every citizen had a voice. The people of Athens gathered in the Agora, or the public square, to discuss important issues, debate and vote on proposals. The system allowed for a large population to be represented and allowed citizens to exercise their rights as active members of government. 
‘Suppliants’ reflects this system of government by portraying Theseus as a leader who is committed to democracy. He respects the laws of the city, the voice of the people, and the rights of individuals. Theseus is not an autocratic leader, but rather a leader who is accountable to his people and listens to their concerns.
Furthermore, the Athenian democratic system was not without flaws. The system was designed primarily for the participation of men, and women were excluded from the political process. The system also allowed for slave labor and did not treat non-Athenians equally. These flaws are reflected in the play through the characterization of the suppliants who are not Athenians.
While the concept of democracy was progressive at the time it was introduced, there were still certain limitations that needed to be addressed. The play ‘Suppliants’ highlights some of these limitations, such as the exclusion of non-Athenians and the limited rights of women. 
In conclusion, ‘Suppliants’ portrays democracy through the character of Theseus, who is a passionate defender of Athenian democracy. He upholds the laws of the land, defends individual rights and freedom, and acknowledges the flaws of the democratic system while emphasizing the importance of unity and compromise. The play accurately reflects the reality of Athenian democracy, and while the system had its flaws, it was a significant step forward in terms of political evolution. Despite the limitations, Athenian democracy paved the way for modern democracies where every citizen has a voice in the government, and this is something that we should be grateful for.
