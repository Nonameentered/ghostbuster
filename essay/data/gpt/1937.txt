Learning a new language can be an exciting yet daunting task. As someone who has attempted to learn a new language – Persian, in my case – I can attest to the challenges that come with it. Although I was exposed to the language through various resources, I found my experience to be incomplete and lacking in some aspects. In this essay, I will discuss what was missing from my experience of learning Persian and the instruction that would have been helpful in making my journey more successful. I will also examine different methods of instruction, their limitations, and benefits.
My experience of learning Persian was a mixed bag. On the one hand, I had access to an array of resources like grammar books, audio-visual content, and language learning apps. However, on the other hand, I found some critical aspects of learning the language missing, which made it challenging for me to make significant progress. 
One of the most significant aspects that were missing from my learning experience was structured guidance. When I started learning Persian, I had no roadmap to guide my studies. I had no understanding of the language's structure or how to approach it systematically. Consequently, I was left grappling with the language's grammatical structures, vocabulary, and syntax, with no clear direction. 
As I delved deeper into my studies, I realized that I was missing a comprehensive understanding of Persian grammar. I learned vocabulary and phrases from different resources, but I struggled to piece them together coherently. The language's complex system of case marking, verb conjugation, and noun declension, for instance, proved to be intimidating. While I did have access to grammar books, they were often too dense and technical and, therefore, difficult to understand. What I needed was a structured grammar curriculum that focused on teaching the language's fundamental principles in a way that was easy to understand and digest.
Another shortcoming of my learning experience was a lack of immersive learning opportunities. While I did have access to audio-visual content that helped me develop my listening and speaking skills, I found it challenging to find opportunities to practice these skills in a real-world setting. This, in turn, made it difficult for me to retain what I was learning and apply it in practical situations. 
Beyond these critical gaps in my learning experience, I also encountered several other challenges that detracted from my success. For instance, I found it difficult to strike a balance between learning new vocabulary and grammar and retaining what I had already learned. I would spend hours memorizing new words, only to forget them soon thereafter. Additionally, I found that I lacked the motivation to study regularly, which was necessary for making consistent progress.
If I were to start learning Persian again, there are several things that I would do differently to enhance my learning experience. First and foremost, I would seek out structured guidance from an experienced Persian language instructor. This could be someone who provides online instruction or someone I meet with in-person. This person would provide me with a clear roadmap for my studies, helping me to identify my strengths and weaknesses and providing me with tailored guidance to improve my skills.
Secondly, I would seek out opportunities for immersion learning. This might involve joining a language exchange program or seeking out a language partner with whom I could practice speaking and listening to Persian regularly. This would allow me to become more comfortable with the language and develop my listening and speaking skills in an authentic context.
Thirdly, I would focus on building a strong foundation in Persian grammar. Rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of the language's various rules and structures, I would seek out a comprehensive grammar program that provided me with a step-by-step guide to mastering the language's grammar. This would allow me to develop a better understanding of the language's structure and help me to piece together vocabulary and expressions more effectively.
Finally, I would take a more proactive approach to learning and retaining vocabulary and other language skills. This might involve breaking down my study sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks, or using spaced repetition techniques to help me retain information for longer periods. I would also seek out practical opportunities to use my language skills, such as reading books or other materials in Persian, or watching television programs or films with Persian subtitles.
Different methods of instruction can be used to learn a new language. Among the commonly used methods are self-guided learning, traditional classroom instruction, and immersion programs. Each of these methods has its limitations and benefits.
Self-guided learning is a popular approach for learning a new language. This method allows individuals to take control of their learning and progress at their own pace. Self-guided learning typically involves using resources such as textbooks, workbooks, and language learning apps. While this method is convenient and flexible, it can be challenging for learners to stay motivated and to develop a comprehensive understanding of the language's structure and grammar.
Traditional classroom instruction is another popular method of language learning. This method involves attending classes led by a language instructor. Classroom instruction provides learners with structured guidance, allowing them to develop a strong foundation in grammar and vocabulary. Classroom instruction can also provide learners with opportunities to practice speaking and listening skills in a supportive environment. However, this method can be costly, inflexible, and often dependent on the instructor's knowledge and expertise.
Immersion programs are a third method of language learning. Immersion programs provide learners with opportunities to practice their language skills in an authentic context. This method involves living in a community where the target language is spoken, often attending classes or participating in activities that are conducted entirely in the target language. Immersion programs can be highly effective in promoting language learning, as they provide learners with opportunities to practice and develop their skills quickly. However, immersion programs can be costly, logistically challenging, and may require learners to take time away from work or other commitments.
In conclusion, my experience of learning Persian was a mixed bag, with several key shortcomings that detracted from my success. To make my journey more successful, I would have sought out structured guidance, opportunities for immersion learning, and a comprehensive grammar program. Additionally, I would have taken a more proactive approach to learning and retaining vocabulary and other language skills. Different methods of instruction, including self-guided learning, traditional classroom instruction, and immersion programs, all have their benefits and limitations. Ultimately, the most effective method for any given individual will depend on their learning style, resources, and goals for language learning.
