The evolution of eukaryotic cells can be traced to a partnership between two types of prokaryotes; the eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This theory is popularly known as the endosymbiosis theory. Evidence shows that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from bacteria that entered the host cell and formed a mutualistic relationship. The “hydrogen hypothesis” is a subcategory of endosymbiosis theory, and it explains the origin of mitochondria, which are organelles responsible for cellular respiration. This paper will discuss the different pieces of evidence that support the hydrogen hypothesis.
The hydrogen hypothesis suggests that the symbiotic relationship between eukaryotes and prokaryotes led to the evolution of mitochondria. Specifically, the hypothesis posits that a hydrogen-utilizing bacterium entered an archaeal host cell and formed a mutual relationship. The bacterium gained protection and nutrients, while the host cell gained energy in the form of ATP. The bacterium was eventually converted into mitochondria while the host cell evolved to become eukaryotic (Lane and Martin, 2010). This hypothesis has several pieces of evidence to support it. 
The first piece of evidence comes from the observation that mitochondria rely heavily on hydrogen. Studies show that hydrogen is the most abundant compound in the universe, and it's widely used by microorganisms as an electron donor. This compound was likely abundant on the ancient Earth and may have fueled early metabolic processes. A variety of microbes utilizes hydrogen for respiration, including some methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (Lane and Martin, 2010). These organisms were likely abundant in the ancient anoxic environment of the Earth, and it's possible that an archaeon could have utilized a hydrogen-fueled metabolism, making these organisms suitable candidates for endosymbiosis. 
The second piece of evidence supporting the hydrogen hypothesis comes from the examination of the genetic information stored in mitochondria. The genetic material of mitochondria is a small, circular DNA molecule that is structurally similar to bacterial DNA (Lane and Martin, 2010). This circular DNA molecule contains genes that encode enzymes necessary for ATP synthesis, and other genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial mitosis and the electron transport chain. The genes present in mitochondrial DNA are also present in the bacterial lineages. This observation supports the idea that mitochondria evolved from bacteria, and the genetic transfer between the bacteria and the host cell happened after the initial endosymbiosis event. 
Another supportive piece of evidence is the observation that hydrogen is a reductant in the electron transport chain, which is the process by which ATP is synthesized in mitochondria. Hydrogen is oxidized by hydrogenases, releasing electrons that are fed into the electron transport chain. Additionally, SRB, which are known to be hydrogen-utilizing organisms, have a similar electron transport chain to the mitochondria. The use of such a shared pathway between the archaeal host and the hydrogen-utilizing bacterium could have been a possible evolutionary progression that led to the formation of the mitochondria (Lane and Martin, 2010).
The fourth piece of evidence comes from the ATP synthase found in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The ATP synthase enzyme is a molecular machine that transforms ADP into ATP by using the proton gradient formed in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. ATP synthase uses a rotary motor mechanism to convert the energy stored in the proton gradient to mechanical energy, which ultimately facilitates ATP production. This enzyme complex has been shown to resemble the rotor component of bacterial flagella. Moreover, the mechanism used for the synthesis of ATP via the rotary motor-like structure, rather than the chemiosmotic machinery that the archaea uses, further supports the hydrogen hypothesis as the most likely explanation for the evolution of eukaryotic organelles (Martin et al., 2016). 
The fifth piece of evidence that supports the hydrogen hypothesis comes from genetic and biochemical studies of eukaryotic organelles’ membranes. Both the mitochondrial and chloroplast endosymbionts have functional electron transport systems similar to some bacterial lineages. To enable this electron transport chain to function correctly, a particular lipid called cardiolipin is vital. Studies show that cardiolipin is synthesized in a similar pathway to that found in some bacteria (Lane and Martin, 2010). This observation could indicate that the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, providing additional support for the hydrogen hypothesis. 
Lastly, modern bacteria can also form endosymbiotic relationships. Studies have shown that some bacteria have the abilities to live inside other bacteria and can exchange genetic material, providing the potential to evolve into organelles. Present-day examples of endosymbiotic relationships between prokaryotes include mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and rhizobia, which live in nodules on the roots of plants, and some extreme thermophilic bacteria living in hydrothermal vents in the ocean. Such relationships could provide potential connections to similar events that lead to the evolution of mitochondria (Martin et al., 2016).
In conclusion, the hydrogen hypothesis provides an elegant explanation for the mechanism by which eukaryotic organelles, specifically mitochondria, and chloroplasts developed from bacterial endosymbionts. The hypothesis explains a sequence of events in which an archaeal host enters into a symbiotic relationship with a hydrogen-utilizing bacterium. The host gives protection, and the bacteria offers the host cell with usable energy in the form of ATP. Over time the guest, or the bacteria, become a permanent resident and evolute into mitochondria or chloroplasts. The multiple pieces of evidence that support the preceding sequence of events suggest that the hydrogen hypothesis likely provides the most plausible explanation for the origin of eukaryotic organelles. With recent research and advancements in genome sequencing of numerous organisms, it has become clear that there is an exciting prospect to learn much more about the evolution of eukaryotic organelles in the future.
