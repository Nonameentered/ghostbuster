Bertolt Brechtâ€™s contribution to theatre is irreplaceable. He is a playwright who, through his use of epic theatre, has challenged the traditional genre of naturalism, and has laid the foundation for a new kind of theatre that aims to change the world. Brecht was a theatre practitioner who was not content with representing the world as it is. Instead, he believed that theatre must reflect the world in a way that makes change possible. In this essay, I will examine the development of Bertolt Brecht as a playwright and his use of epic theatre to challenge the traditional genre of naturalism, focusing on three plays that illustrate the progression in Brecht's use of epic technique, connected by their use of specific themes and particularly in their portrayal of the plight of the individual. I will also analyze the social and political context of Brecht's work in the early 1920s Germany, his response to the socio-political condition, and how it is reflected in his plays. Finally, I will discuss Brecht's belief that theatre must not only reflect the world but most importantly, change it and how he used his theories of epic theatre to achieve this.
Brecht's life began on February 10, 1898, in Augsburg, a small town in Germany. Although his parents were lower-middle-class, they provided him with a classical education, which would have a significant impact on his artistic development. In 1917, Brecht began studying medicine at the University of Munich, but he soon abandoned this pursuit to focus on his passion for writing. By 1920, he had become a published writer and journalist. In 1922, he moved to Berlin, where he would soon become a prominent figure in the city's cultural scene. Brecht's first major play, "Baal," premiered in 1923 and established him as a rising star in German theatre.
One of the defining characteristics of Brecht's work is his use of epic theatre, a style that he developed in response to the socio-political conditions of Germany in the early 1920s. Epic theatre is a form of theatre that seeks to break down the audience's emotional identification with the characters and events on stage and to make them aware of the play's artificiality. Epic theatre aims to create a critical distance between the audience and the action on stage, encouraging reflection and engagement with the subject matter. This technique enables the audience to think critically about the issues presented and become aware of the causes of the events portrayed on stage, rather than simply accepting them as inevitable.
One of the themes that run through Brecht's work is the plight of the individual in society. This theme is particularly evident in "Baal," "Drums in the Night," and "The Threepenny Opera," three plays that illustrate the progression in Brecht's use of epic theatre. In "Baal," Brecht portrays the story of a poet who rejects society's norms and seeks to live life on his own terms. Baal is a character who symbolizes the rejection of bourgeois values and traditions, and his fate reflects the fate of many artists and intellectuals who were marginalized by society. The play emphasizes the alienation and loneliness of the individual in modern society, a theme that would become central to Brecht's later work.
"Drums in the Night" is another play that deals with the plight of the individual in society. The play explores the lives of soldiers returning from World War I and the sense of disillusionment and alienation they experience when they return home to find a society that does not care about them. The play is an indictment of the capitalist system and the way it exploits those who fight its wars. The use of epic theatre in "Drums in the Night" highlights the artificiality of the world that the characters inhabit, forcing the audience to question the reality of the situation and to identify the causes of the characters' suffering.
"The Threepenny Opera" is perhaps Brecht's most famous play and is a masterpiece of epic theatre. The play is a satirical take on the capitalist system and the way it uses and exploits the poor. The play is set in Victorian London and tells the story of Macheath, a notorious criminal who is caught between two women, Polly Peachum and Lucy Brown. The use of song and music in the play is an important aspect of Brecht's epic theatre, as it creates a critical distance between the audience and the action on stage. The songs comment on the action of the play and provide a satirical commentary on the characters' motivations and desires.
The socio-political context of Germany in the early 1920s was one of turmoil and uncertainty. Germany had just suffered a humiliating defeat in World War I and was facing economic and political instability. The rise of fascism and the threat of communism created a climate of fear and uncertainty. Brecht's response to this situation was to create a theatre that reflected the complexity of the world and encouraged people to think critically about the issues facing them. Brecht believed that theatre should not simply reflect the world as it is but should also seek to change it. His use of epic theatre was a way to achieve this goal, as it forced the audience to question the reality of the situation and to identify the causes of the characters' suffering.
Brecht's theories of epic theatre were rooted in his belief that theatre should be a tool for social change. His approach to theatre was highly political, and he saw theatre as a way to make people think about the world they lived in and to challenge the existing order. Brecht believed that theatre should not simply entertain but should also educate and inspire people to action. He saw theatre as a way to create a more just society, and his plays were designed to reflect this goal.
In conclusion, Brecht's contribution to theatre is immeasurable. He was a playwright who, through his use of epic theatre, challenged the traditional genre of naturalism and laid the foundation for a new kind of theatre that aimed to change the world. In this essay, I have examined the development of Bertolt Brecht as a playwright and his use of epic theatre to challenge the traditional genre of naturalism, focusing on three plays that illustrate the progression in Brecht's use of epic technique, connected by their use of specific themes and particularly in their portrayal of the plight of the individual. I have also analyzed the social and political context of Brecht's work in the early 1920s Germany, his response to the socio-political condition, and how it is reflected in his plays.

Brecht's legacy is a theatre that challenges and inspires, a theatre that seeks to make a difference and a theatre that is committed to social justice.
