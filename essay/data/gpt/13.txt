Introduction
Sociology is an attempt to understand the social formations, structures, and interactions that occur between different individuals in society. Its founders, Durkheim and Simmel, created two of the most influential sociological theories of the 19th and 20th centuries. While Durkheim's view emphasizes the importance of social norms and institutions in maintaining social order, Simmel focuses more on individual interactions and their effect on societal structures. This essay explores the differences between the approaches of Durkheim and Simmel, with a particular emphasis on Simmel's concept of forms-of-sociation and its effect on his perspective on the social bond.
Comparing Durkheim's and Simmel's Approach to Sociology
Durkheim's approach to sociology focuses on social facts that are external to the individual but exert a powerful influence on their behavior. These social facts include norms, values, and institutions that direct and give meaning to social interactions and behaviors. For Durkheim, society exists as a collective entity, with individual members bound together by shared values and institutions that create a sense of cohesion and harmony. He believed that society can only exist if individuals subsume their own interests in the service of the greater good, and that this could be achieved through the development of social institutions such as religion, education, and the law.
Simmel, on the other hand, saw society as a collection of loosely connected individuals who interacted with one another on a regular basis. He was interested in exploring how these interactions could lead to the creation of new forms of social organization and the emergence of social structures. Simmel was more focused on the micro-level of social interaction and saw individual behaviors as determinative of societal structures. He was not as interested in the development of large-scale social institutions, as Durkheim was, but instead, focused on the ways in which these institutions were created from the bottom up, through the interactions of everyday individuals.
Forms-of-Sociation and the Social Bond
Simmel's concept of forms-of-sociation is critical to understanding his unique perspective on the social bond. Forms-of-sociation refer to the various ways in which individuals can come together to form societies. These can include formal organizations such as political parties, religious denominations, and trade unions, but also include informal groups such as clubs, social networks, and kinship relationships. According to Simmel, the social bond is not something that is given, but rather something that is created and re-created through the interactions of individuals with one another. Thus, forms-of-sociation exist as pre-existing structures that individuals occupy, and that shape their actions and interactions with others.
The function of the separation between form and content in Simmel's theory is to suggest that these forms-of-sociation are not fixed and immutable, but rather constantly evolving and changing. While forms-of-sociation may have a certain amount of content, such as norms, values, and traditions, these are not the only things that create social structures. According to Simmel, the content of social structures is always in a state of flux, as individuals engage with each other and strive to create new social forms. Thus, Simmel sees society as a constantly evolving entity, with new social structures emerging as individuals create new forms-of-sociation.
The Microsocial Element of Simmel's Sociology
Simmel's focus on the micro-social element of society can be seen as both a strength and a weakness of his theory. On the one hand, this focus allows him to explore the ways in which individuals interact with one another to create new social forms. This is different from Durkheim's approach, which is more focused on the macro-level of social institutions. Simmel's approach allows him to explore the ways in which social institutions are created through the actions and interactions of individual members.
On the other hand, Simmel's focus on the micro-social element of society limits his overall theory in several ways. For one, Simmel tends to ignore the role that macro-level structures play in shaping individual interactions. While he acknowledges that social structures are created through individual actions, he fails to account for the ways in which these actions are constrained and shaped by larger social forces. Furthermore, Simmel's focus on the individual can sometimes lead him to overlook the role that social institutions play in shaping individual behaviors. While he acknowledges that social norms and values exist, his focus on the individual can sometimes overshadow the importance of social institutions in maintaining social order and cohesion.
"The Metropolis and Mental Life"
One of the most famous essays written by Simmel is "The Metropolis and Mental Life." In this essay, Simmel examines the ways in which modern cities have changed the social interactions and behaviors of their inhabitants. According to Simmel, the increased population density of cities has led to a fragmentation of social structures and the creation of new forms-of-sociation that are not tied to traditional social institutions. This has resulted, in Simmel's view, in the creation of a new type of individual, one which is highly individualistic and self-centered.
While Simmel's analysis of the effects of modern cities on individual behavior and interaction is insightful, it also highlights some of the limitations of his theory. The focus on the individual in "The Metropolis and Mental Life" overshadows the importance of macro-level social structures in shaping individual behavior. For example, Simmel does not account for the ways in which economic structures may have influenced the development of modern cities or how these structures may have encouraged individualistic behavior over time. Furthermore, Simmel does not account for the ways in which social institutions may have adapted to the changing environment of modern cities.
Strengths and Weaknesses of Simmel's Reductionist Sociology
Overall, Simmel's reductionist sociology has both strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, his focus on the individual and micro-level interactions provides a unique perspective on the social structures that shape society. This perspective allows him to explore the ways in which social institutions are created and shaped through individual actions and interactions. Furthermore, his concept of forms-of-sociation allows for a more nuanced understanding of the social bond and the ways in which social structures evolve and change over time.
On the other hand, Simmel's focus on the individual can sometimes lead him to overlook the importance of macro-level social structures. Furthermore, his theory can sometimes lack the explanatory power to account for how social structures emerge and are maintained over time. While Simmel's theories are useful for understanding the role that individual actions and interactions play in shaping society, they may be less useful for understanding the broader forces that drive social change.
Conclusion
Simmel and Durkheim's approaches to sociology differ in important ways. While Durkheim's theory emphasizes the importance of social institutions and social norms in shaping social behavior and interaction, Simmel's theory focuses more on the micro-social element of society and the ways in which social structures are created through individual action and interaction. His focus on the individual and micro-level interactions provides a unique perspective on the social structures that shape society, but can also sometimes lead to a lack of explanatory power when considering macro-level social structures. Overall, Simmel's reductionist sociology provides a useful counterpoint to Durkheim's theory, but should be viewed in conjunction with other sociological approaches in order to gain a complete understanding of social phenomena.
