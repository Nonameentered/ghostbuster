The European Commission is often referred to as the executive arm of the European Union (EU), and is one of the principal institutions tasked with running the EU. It is important to understand the extent to which the European Commission can be considered a governmental body since this is essential to understanding its role, accountability and legitimacy.
To begin with, the European Commission is a supranational institution which is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. The Commission is composed of one member per EU member state, and those members are appointed for a term of five years by the member state governments. This, however, does not mean that the Commission is a mere extension of the national governments. The Commission, in fact, functions separately from the national governments and has the authority to act in the best interests of the entire EU rather than just one individual member state.
The European Commission has several functions which are similar to those of a government. For example, its primary function is to propose legislation, a key role that is normally regarded as a governmental power. As the executive branch of the EU, the Commission also has the power to enforce laws, impose sanctions and negotiate international agreements on behalf of the EU. The Commission also has the authority to manage the EU budget and oversee the implementation of policies across all EU institutions.
In terms of legislative power, the role of the European Commission follows a similar pattern to many democratic governments. While the Commission prepares legislative proposals, they must be approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before they can become law. This process provides democratic legitimacy to the Commission's proposals and ensures that they are subject to scrutiny by elected representatives.
One major difference between the European Commission and a government, however, is that the Commission cannot act on its own initiative. In other words, it cannot make laws or take action unless given the power to do so by the EU treaties or by the Council acting in concert with the European Parliament. This constraint limits the Commission's power and authority, which is a significant deviation from traditional notions of what constitutes a government.
Another way in which the European Commission differs from a government is its accountability. The Commission is accountable to both the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Unlike a national government, the Commission is not directly accountable to citizens, and this creates a democratic deficit. While the Commission is responsible for implementing EU treaties, citizens of the EU do not have a direct role in selecting the officials who run the Commission. This limited democratic involvement can be seen as a potential weakness of the Commission.
Critics of the European Commission argue that it operates in a bureaucratic manner, controlled by unelected officials. They suggest that the Commission lacks the legitimacy that comes from democratic accountability. This criticism has been exacerbated by the rise of Euroscepticism in recent years.
Despite this, the European Commission has several judicial functions. The Commission has the power to interpret EU law, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) can be used to enforce EU law and make legal decisions on disputes between member states. The Commission also has investigative powers and can take legal action against member states that are not complying with EU law.
To conclude, the European Commission is an important institution within the EU, playing a vital role in proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and managing day-to-day business. While there are similarities between the Commission and a government, there are also significant differences, particularly when it comes to legislative power, accountability, and democratic legitimacy. Criticisms of the European Commission suggest that the institution lacks democratic accountability and operates in a bureaucratic manner, controlled by unelected officials. Despite these criticisms, the Commission continues to play a crucial role in the governance of the EU, and its power will continue to evolve and adapt to changing conditions within Europe.
