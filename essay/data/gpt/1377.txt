Introduction
Trust law is a crucial component in the legal system, which seeks to manage the affairs of individuals both in their lifetime and after their death. In general, trust law allows a person to create a trust, which is a legal relationship where assets are held by one party on behalf of another. Trustees are designated to manage the trusts and ensure that the assets are used effectively and lawfully. The role of a trustee is crucial and requires them to execute their fiduciary duties to the best of their abilities. In cases where trustees fail to execute their fiduciary responsibilities, a breach of trust occurs. Owing to the magnitude of their duties, trustees are subjected to a high standard of care meant to uphold the beneficiaries' interests. In cases of breach of trust, the affected parties are entitled to damages which are not limited to the financial compensation. However, trustees may claim that their contributory negligence was the reason for the breach of trust, which raises the question: should contributory fault be introduced as a defense in cases of trustees' breach of their duty of care? This essay will explore this question by analyzing the current legal framework, case law, and the impact of introducing contributory fault as a defense in cases of trustees' breach of their duty of care.
Legal Framework
In England and Wales, trust law is founded on equity principles, with the fiduciary duties well defined under the Trustee Act 2000. The act outlines the role and responsibilities of trustees, including the obligation to act impartially, keep the beneficiaries' interests at heart, and prudently manage the assets under their care. Notably, the statute does not explicitly provide for a defense to a breach of trust based on contributory fault (Kuipers, 2014).
The concept of contributory fault was first introduced in common law jurisdictions in the case of Davies v Swan Motor Co [1949] 2KB 291, which related to personal injury. The jurisprudence was then extended to other areas, such as contract law, tort law, and recently, company law. Notably, the Trustee Act 2000, which is the primary statute governing trust law, does not explicitly provide for contributory fault as a defense. However, the trust law recognizes the principle of ex turpi causa non oritur actio (no claim arises from wrongdoing), meaning that a claimant cannot recover damages from an illegal act. Therefore, if the claimant was involved in illegal activities leading to the breach of trust, the court may bar the claim and deny him or her remedies.
Case Law
Despite the Trustee Act 2000 not providing for contributory fault as a defense, some judgments recognize the concept. For instance, in the case of Armitage v Nurse [1997] Ch 241, the court stated that a plaintiff's conduct could constitute a contributory breach of trust. In that case, the plaintiff had failed to inform the trustees of a claim an insurer made, leading to a loss of a substantial amount of money. The court found the plaintiff to have failed in his duty to provide sufficient information to the trustees, and the trustees would not have sanctioned the transaction, had they known about the claim.
Similarly, in Gorringe v Thompson [2007] 1 WLR 1185, the court expounded on the impact of contributory negligence in a breach of trust claim. The trustees had invested money in a venture capital company without adequate due diligence in place. The company subsequently collapsed, leading to losses for the beneficiaries. The trustees claimed that the beneficiaries were jointly responsible for the loss since they had failed to inquire about the investment adequately. Although the court agreed that the beneficiaries were partially responsible for the loss, the trustees were the primary culprits and bore the brunt of their fiduciary duties.
Therefore, although the Trustee Act 2000 does not explicitly provide for contributory fault, some secondary legal resources indicate that its application is possible. Furthermore, the case law reveals that the courts may be willing to accept contributory negligence as a defense in a breach of trust claim.
Impact of Introducing Contributory Fault
Introducing contributory fault as a defense in cases of trustees' breach of their duty of care may have both advantages and disadvantages. One of the benefits of this introduction is that it would encourage beneficiaries to exercise more significant control over the trust matters and act in their best interests. For instance, beneficiaries could be involved in the decision-making process, especially on significant investments, to ensure that they align with their interests. The result would be better accountability and prudence on the part of the trustees. Furthermore, introducing contributory fault would hold beneficiaries equally responsible for any losses arising from an illegal act.
However, the drawbacks of introducing contributory fault outweigh the potential benefits. Firstly, it would dilute the trustees' role and encourage them to shirk their fiduciary duties. The trustees would be more willing to blame the beneficiaries for any losses, instead of taking responsibility for their actions. As such, it would be easier for trustees to justify their actions, even if they acted recklessly or without adequate due diligence. Secondly, it would cost more money and time to resolve disputes concerning contributory negligence. Beneficiaries would be eager to absolve themselves of any wrongdoing, leading to a protracted legal process, which would be costly for all parties involved.
Conclusion
In conclusion, trustees are subjected to a high standard of care in carrying out their fiduciary duties. The Trustee Act 2000 does not provide for contributory negligence as a defense in cases of breach of trust. However, some case law suggests that it may be possible to apply the concept. The introduction of contributory negligence would have numerous repercussions, including encouraging better control and accountability over the trust matters. However, the drawbacks of the introduction outweigh the potential benefits since it would dilute the trustees' role and encourage them to shirk their fiduciary duties. It is therefore recommendable for the courts to continue ruling on cases based on the existing legal provisions without introducing contributory negligence as a defense.
