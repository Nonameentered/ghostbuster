The global marketplace is highly competitive, with firms from various countries vying for supremacy. In the last few decades, Chinese firms have risen to prominence, creating a significant impact on the world economy. However, what are the implications of Chinese firms' emergence, and what advantages and disadvantages do they possess? These are crucial questions that could be answered by analyzing them via Porter's Diamond of National Advantage model.
Michael Porter developed a Diamond of National Advantage model to explain why some countries are prosperous in certain industries while others are not. Porter suggested that four determinants contribute to a country's competitive advantage and success in a specific industry: Factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. Let us examine each of these factors to better understand their impact on Chinese firms.
Factor conditions refer to the resources available to firms within a country, including natural resources, labor, and infrastructure. China has an abundance of low-cost labor, which has helped fuel the country's manufacturing and export industries. Additionally, China's robust infrastructure and efficient logistics systems have enabled firms to transport goods to markets around the world. However, its resource-rich regions aren't well developed, and firms must import certain raw materials. Thus, they are at a disadvantage regarding raw materials that are relatively scarce and those that they don't have control over.
Demand conditions, on the other hand, refer to the size and nature of local demand for goods and services. China's population of 1.4 billion represents a vast and diverse marketplace for Chinese firms. Chinese firms have gained a reputation for creating low-cost goods that are popular both in China and abroad. However, international companies that want to enter China must adapt to the unique needs and tastes of Chinese consumers. Additionally, saturation in certain markets in China has led to intense competition.
Related and supporting industries refer to industries that support a particular industry. In China, strategic industries such as banking, finance, and logistics have emerged to support growing firms. State-owned enterprises have helped create suppliers and contractors that have made businesses more affordable and resilient. Also, China has leveraged its manufacturing experience and built a cluster of industries that support manufacturing. However, it means that Western firms that want to enter China must compete with these established industries and tailor their businesses to adjust to the Chinese ecosystem.
Lastly, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry encompass the competitive environment of an industry. Chinese firms are often state-owned and controlled by the Chinese government. Thus, they can leverage China's vast resources to fuel their growth. Additionally, Chinese firms have adopted a low-price strategy, which is a competitive advantage. However, the trade-off is that Chinese firms are often seen as copycats of Western firms, and lack in brand recognition.
Porter's Diamond of National Advantage model could tie into a SWOT analysis. While the Diamond of National Advantage model outlines a country's competitive position in the global market, a SWOT analysis could evaluate a firm's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. For example, a SWOT analysis of a Chinese firm could reveal that its strengths are lower production costs and a large domestic market, but its weaknesses are the lack of intellectual property rights and questionable quality control. Opportunities could arise from international expansion, while threats could include increasing competition from other Chinese firms.
Despite its utility, there are criticisms of the Porter Diamond Model. Firstly, the model seems more applicable to industries where there are high barriers to entry and where economies of scale are concentrated in locations that have a long history of industrial experience. Industries that rely heavily on natural resources or automation might not adhere to these conditions. Additionally, the model's assumptions regarding governments' role could be overly simplistic or not accurate given some countries' political and institutional dynamics.
To conclude, Porter's Diamond of National Advantage model is a useful tool for analyzing the competitive position of Chinese firms. By understanding how factor, demand, supporting industries, and competitiveness play a role in a country's competitiveness, Western multinationals could better understand their position in the Chinese market. However, the model has limitations, and firms should not rely solely on it while making decisions regarding international expansion.
