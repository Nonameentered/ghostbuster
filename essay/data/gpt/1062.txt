Stonehenge, an iconic prehistoric monument located in Wiltshire, England, has long been the subject of extensive research, discussion and debates. Over the years, numerous theories have been put forth, attempting to explain the purpose and significance of the monument. In his book “The Archaeology of Personhood: An Anthropological Approach,” Chrisopher Tilley argues that Stonehenge was built as a symbol to celebrate the ancestors of the indigenous people of the area, thereby establishing a connection between past, present, and future. Certainly, archeologists are not left unimpressed by Stonehenge, as it is a symbol of a long-standing heritage, attracting tourists, research organizations, and scholars alike. One such scholar, Chris Whittle, has provided us with an entirely different perspective regarding Stonehenge.
Whittle’s argument regarding the study of Stonehenge is that it is vital that researchers approach the monument from a phenomenological perspective. He asserts that by employing this methodology, they will be able to appreciate Stonehenge, not as a purely archaeological structure, but as a place that can still evoke feelings of wonder and awe within visitors. In other words, Whittle’s argument is that by understanding the monument through the eyes of the beholder, we can appreciate its true worth as well as the role it has played in the lives of people over the years.
To Whittle, phenomenology is more than just an approach to research. It is, in fact, a philosophy that emphasizes on individual perception and subjective experience. Therefore, in the case of Stonehenge, phenomenology seeks to understand the monument through the eyes of the people who built it and interacted with it over the centuries. Whittle believes that by examining Stonehenge from this perspective, researchers can gain a better understanding of it, not just as an architectural marvel, but also as a sacred space that has played a crucial role in the lives of ordinary people.
One way that Whittle employs phenomenology to support his argument is by studying the etymology of the word ‘monument’. In this regard, he points out that the term belongs to a class of words that signify an object that is capable of evoking a response in the viewer. He cites examples of other terms that fit this category, including ‘spectacle’, ‘miracle’, and ‘rhetoric’. According to Whittle, the monument is not just a physical structure, but rather, it is something that stimulates a particular response in the beholder. In the case of Stonehenge, he argues that it is not just a pile of rocks, but, rather, it is a place that has played an important role in the lives of people for centuries.
Another way Whittle employs phenomenology is by examining the relationship between the physical structure of the monument, its surrounding landscape, and the way in which people have experienced it over the years. He argues that phenomenology emphasizes on getting a holistic view of experience, by looking beyond the physical structure itself. In this regard, Whittle believes that by understanding how people have interacted with Stonehenge over the years, researchers can gain a deeper appreciation of the monument.
According to Whittle, there is strong evidence to suggest that Stonehenge has been seen as a place of healing by people over the centuries. He cites examples of written accounts by people who visited the site and attested to its healing properties. Whittle argues that by understanding how people have responded to Stonehenge over the years, we can gain an appreciation of its purpose. Rather than just being a pile of rocks, it is, in fact, a sacred place where people came to heal, to be close to their ancestors, and to feel a sense of belonging.
Whittle also uses phenomenology to challenge the commonly held belief that Stonehenge was used for astronomical observations. He argues that by focusing solely on the physical structure of the monument, researchers may be failing to appreciate its role as a place of spiritual significance. To support this argument, Whittle highlights the fact that many of the activities that have taken place at Stonehenge, such as rituals and offerings, cannot be accounted for using an astronomical framework.
To Whittle, the study of Stonehenge is not just about understanding its physical structure. He believes that by examining the experience of people who visited the site, we can gain a deeper appreciation of its significance. Therefore, Whittle’s argument is that it is important that researchers approach Stonehenge from a phenomenological perspective. By doing so, they can gain a deeper understanding of the monument, as well as appreciate its role as a sacred place. 
In conclusion, Whittle’s argument regarding the study of Stonehenge is that it is important to approach the monument from a phenomenological perspective. By studying its history and the experience of people who have interacted with it over the years, researchers can gain a better appreciation of its value, and appreciate the role it has played in the lives of ordinary people. Whittle argues that Stonehenge is not just a series of rocks, but it is, in fact, a spiritual place that evokes feelings of wonder, awe and connectivity to those who interact with it. Phenomenology means that to understand Stonehenge, we need to be able to perceive the significance or presence it exudes, and to do that, we need to analyse how people experienced it over the years. By embracing the phenomenological perspective, we will, subsequently, have a better understanding of Stonehenge.
