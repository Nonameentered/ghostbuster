Virtue has always been considered as an essential quality that is necessary for individuals to lead a successful and meaningful life. While some believe that virtue is innate, others argue that it can be learned. In Plato's dialogue in the Meno, Socrates and Meno engage in a conversation about the teachability of virtue. This essay analyzes the dialogue in the Meno and evaluates the arguments for and against the teachability of virtue.
The conversation between Socrates and Meno in the Meno takes place in the context of a discussion about the nature of virtue. Meno starts by asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught or whether it is innate. Socrates responds by saying, "I am certain that no one knows what virtue is" (Meno, 71e). This statement sets the stage for the rest of the conversation, which is a search for the nature of virtue.
Meno then suggests that virtue is about doing good things and avoiding bad things. However, Socrates objects to this definition on the grounds that it is too general and vague. Moreover, he argues that people often do bad things thinking that they are good, which suggests that the definition is flawed. Socrates then proposes that virtue is a type of knowledge. He suggests that just as people can acquire knowledge of mathematics or geography, they can also acquire knowledge of virtue.
Meno is skeptical about this proposal and challenges Socrates to explain how someone can acquire knowledge of virtue. Socrates responds to this challenge by using the famous "slave boy" example. He asks Meno to bring a slave boy who has had no education and then proceeds to teach him how to double the area of a square. The boy is able to learn this without any prior knowledge, which suggests that knowledge of mathematics is not innate.
Socrates then makes the point that if knowledge of mathematics can be acquired, then knowledge of virtue can also be acquired. He argues that virtue must be a type of knowledge because it is not something that can be acquired by chance. Moreover, he argues that people who possess virtue are able to act in accordance with what is good and just, which suggests that they must have some knowledge of what is good and just.
Meno, however, remains unconvinced. He argues that Socrates has not shown him how virtue can be taught. He suggests that Socrates has only shown him that people can acquire knowledge of virtue, but not how they can acquire it. Socrates responds to this challenge by proposing the idea of "recollection." He argues that when people learn something, they are not really acquiring new knowledge, but rather recollecting knowledge that they already had in their souls.
Socrates then uses the slave boy example again to demonstrate this idea of recollection. He suggests that the boy already had knowledge of the principles of geometry in his soul, which he was able to recollect when Socrates prompted him with leading questions. He argues that the same thing is true for knowledge of virtue. People already have knowledge of virtue in their souls, and they can recollect this knowledge when prompted with leading questions.
Although the dialogue in the Meno is a powerful argument for the teachability of virtue, it has been subject to criticism. One of the main criticisms is that the dialogue is circular. Critics have argued that Socrates assumes that knowledge of virtue can be recollected, and then uses this assumption to demonstrate that virtue is teachable. However, this is a circular argument that does not prove anything.
Another criticism of the dialogue in the Meno is that Socrates does not provide a clear explanation of how virtue can be taught. While he provides examples of how people can acquire knowledge of mathematics and geometry, he does not provide any concrete examples of how people can acquire knowledge of virtue. This lack of a clear explanation has led some critics to argue that the dialogue is not a convincing argument for the teachability of virtue.
In conclusion, the dialogue in the Meno is a powerful argument for the teachability of virtue. Socrates proposes that virtue is a type of knowledge, and he uses the slave boy example to demonstrate that knowledge of virtue can be acquired. He also uses the idea of recollection to argue that people already have knowledge of virtue in their souls, and they can recollect this knowledge when prompted with leading questions. However, the dialogue has been subject to criticism for its circular reasoning and lack of a clear explanation of how virtue can be taught. Despite these criticisms, the dialogue in the Meno remains an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the teachability of virtue.
