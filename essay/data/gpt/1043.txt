John Locke’s model of perception is based on the idea that our knowledge of the world is gained through the operation of our senses. According to Locke, when we perceive an object, our senses receive certain sensations that are then processed by the mind. These sensations are then organized into ideas that form our knowledge of the world. However, Berkeley objects to Locke’s model of perception on the grounds that it is incomplete and flawed. This essay seeks to explain Locke's model of perception, and how Berkeley objects to it, and to assess the success of Berkeley's objections. In addition, the essay will suggest possible alternative models of resemblance. 
According to Locke, there are two types of qualities that objects have: primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are the fundamental qualities that are essential to the object’s existence, while secondary qualities are the subjective qualities that exist in the mind of the perceiver. Locke believed that primary qualities such as shape, size, and motion were inherent in the object and could be sensed by the senses. He argued that secondary qualities such as color and taste did not exist in the object itself but were produced by the interaction between the object and the senses. 
Locke’s model of perception is based on the notion of representative realism, which holds that our perception of the world is mediated by representations, which are mental copies of the external world. According to Locke, our senses function as mediators between the external world and our minds. When we see an object, for example, the retinal image is transmitted to the brain, where it is processed and transformed into the idea of the object. This idea is then stored in the mind, where it can be recalled at any time. 
Berkeley objects to Locke’s model of perception on several grounds. First, he believed that representative realism was incomplete since it did not account for the fact that our perceptions are always subjective. According to Berkeley, our perceptions are not passive copies of the external world but are actively constructed by the mind. For Berkeley, there is no clear distinction between the perceiver and the perceived object. In other words, the object only exists as a perception, and there is no independent reality beyond our perceptions. 
Second, Berkeley objects to Locke’s concept of primary and secondary qualities. According to Berkeley, all qualities are subjective and belong to the realm of ideas. He argues that there is no such thing as an object’s primary qualities that are independent of the perceiver. Berkeley claims that all qualities, primary and secondary included, are simply ideas in the mind, and that there is no reason to believe that they have any correspondence to a mind-independent reality. 
Third, Berkeley objects to Locke's concept of space and time, arguing that they are also subjective and do not exist independently of our perception. According to Berkeley, space and time are simply ideas in the mind. They do not have an existence beyond the mind, and there is no independent reality that corresponds to them. 
In response to Berkeley’s objections, Locke attempted to justify our belief in mind-independent physical objects. Locke argued that although we cannot know the essence of objects, we can still infer their existence based on our experience of them. According to Locke, our repeated experience of objects leads us to believe that they have an objective existence apart from our perception. Furthermore, Locke argues that the consistency of our experience of objects points to a mind-independent reality. 
In response to Berkeley’s objection to primary and secondary qualities, Locke defended the existence of primary qualities as being fundamental to the nature of the object. He argued that although we cannot access the true essence of an object, we can still know its primary qualities, which exist independently of the perceiver. Secondary qualities, on the other hand, are only produced by the interaction between the object and the senses. Therefore, Locke argued that while our perception of secondary qualities is subjective, our perception of primary qualities is objective. 
In response to Berkeley’s claim that space and time are subjective ideas, Locke argued that they were inherent properties of the mind-independent physical world. According to Locke, space and time exist objectively and are essential for our understanding of the physical world. He believed that our perception of space and time allowed us to understand the relationship between physical objects.
Assessing the success of Berkeley’s objections, it is clear that they pose significant challenges to Locke’s model of perception. Berkeley’s arguments against representative realism and the distinction between primary and secondary qualities are especially persuasive. Berkeley’s radical idealism suggests that the world is entirely dependent on our perceptions of it. The argument over space and time is not as strong as Berkeley’s other objections, since most people would find it difficult to conceive of these things as subjective. 
Nonetheless, Berkeley’s objections are not completely successful. For instance, Berkeley’s argument that the existence of objects can be inferred by our repeated experience of them is not entirely convincing. Experience alone is not enough to establish the objective existence of objects, as it is possible that our sensory experiences are simply illusions. Furthermore, the argument that primary qualities are objective and secondary qualities are subjective is not strongly supported. The borderline between primary and secondary qualities is blurred, and it is not clear which qualities can be considered primary or secondary.
Possible alternative models of resemblance include the direct realism and idealism models. Direct realism is a model of perception that holds that our perception of the world is direct and unmediated. The direct realist model suggests that we perceive the world as it is, without the need for any mental processing or representation. Idealism, on the other hand, is a model of perception that holds that our perception of the world is entirely dependent on our mind. The idealist model suggests that there is no objective reality beyond our perceptions, and that the world is entirely subjective. 
Locke’s model of perception and Berkeley’s objections to it provide a fascinating insight into the way we understand the world around us. Although their arguments are not entirely convincing, they have proved fruitful in the development of alternative models of perception that seek to explain the way we perceive reality. The study of perception is an ongoing endeavor, and it will be interesting to observe how it evolves in the years to come.
