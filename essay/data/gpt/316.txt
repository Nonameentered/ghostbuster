Introduction
The issue of unemployment is one of the most pervasive social problems across various countries. The failure of individuals to secure employment leads to a range of economic and social issues, such as income inequality, social exclusion, and poverty. To better understand the issue of unemployment, economists have developed a range of models. Among the models used to explain unemployment is the Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model. The model suggests that there can be involuntary unemployment even when wages are flexible. This essay will discuss the Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model and how it relates unemployment levels to the wage rate. The essay will also analyze the assumptions and variables used in the model to establish equilibrium and the empirical evidence that supports it.
What is the Shapiro-Stiglitz Shirking Model?
The Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model is an economic model that seeks to explain involuntary unemployment. The model was developed by two economists, Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz. According to the model, unemployment levels can remain high even when wages are flexible. Therefore, the model rejects the classical economic view that unemployment will disappear if wages are allowed to adjust freely.
The shirking model suggests that unemployment can arise when there is a mismatch between the job and unemployed workers' skills. In this context, skilled workers may refuse to take up menial work that is available, for example, because they believe that such work underutilizes their skills. This, in turn, may lead to a situation where the labor market experiences skill shortages, leading to wage increases for low-skilled jobs. However, the higher wages become, the more attractive low-skilled jobs become, increasing the supply of labor for such jobs. This leads to excess supply for low-skilled jobs, often resulting in unemployment for low-skilled workers.
According to the Shapiro-Stiglitz model, unemployment arises when workers are paid more than they would be worth if they were to work in terms of the value they generate for their employer. In this case, workers who earn wages that are higher than their marginal productivity may have an incentive to shirk, or not perform to their best abilities, since their wages are already high. This, in turn, may lead to lower productivity, lower profits, and eventually, loss of employment.
The Relationship between Unemployment Levels and Wages in the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model
The Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model suggests that unemployment levels are related to the wage rate. According to the model, firms may be willing to pay higher wages for labor if they believe that it will lead to greater productivity and profits. However, they may also face the problem of workers shirking or not working to the best of their abilities, leading to lower profitability and productivity.
In this context, the law of diminishing returns suggests that there is a limit to the amount of output that can be produced from the same amount of labor input before productivity begins to decline. Therefore, firms may be willing to pay higher wages to motivate workers to produce more. However, beyond a certain point, there may be no corresponding increase in productivity, leading to lower profitability and eventual loss of jobs.
Furthermore, the model suggests that there is an equilibrium level of wages and unemployment. When wages are too high, firms may decide to reduce their activity or outsource their labor, leading to higher levels of unemployment. Similarly, when wages are too low, workers may not be motivated to work, leading to lower productivity and lower profits.
Assumptions and Variables in the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model
The Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model uses a range of assumptions and variables to establish an equilibrium between wages and unemployment levels. One of the primary assumptions made in the model is that workers have varying levels of skills, and these skills are essential in determining the levels of productivity. Therefore, wages must be set according to the skills of the workers available. If workers are skilled, then employers may be willing to pay higher wages in exchange for higher productivity.
Another assumption made in the model is that there are information gaps in the labor market. In this context, employers often face difficulties when assessing the actual productivity of workers. This may lead to a situation where employers overestimate the productivity of workers and end up paying wages that are higher than the actual productivity.
The model also assumes that there is a link between productivity and wages. In this context, workers who are productive may be paid higher wages in order to motivate them further to maintain their productivity levels. Similarly, workers who are deemed unproductive may be paid lower wages as a form of punishment to motivate them to improve their performance.
Empirical Evidence that Supports the Shapiro-Stiglitz Model
Empirical evidence supports the Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model. Several studies have investigated involuntary unemployment and wages to establish whether there is a relationship between them. A study by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) investigated the impact of minimum wage legislation on the labor market in the UK. The study found that the minimum wage led to involuntary unemployment for low-skilled workers. This supports the model's suggestion that higher wages may lead to unemployment, particularly when the wages are not commensurate with the productivity levels of the workers.
Another study by Echevarria (2001) examined the impact of search effort and the efficiency of matching on the labor market in Spain. The study found that wage rigidity led to involuntary unemployment, particularly for low-skilled workers. This suggests that, in the absence of matching efficiency, unemployment may persist if wages are not adjusted accordingly.
Conclusion
The Shapiro-Stiglitz shirking model is a useful tool for economists to understand the relationship between wages and unemployment levels. The model's central assumption is that unemployment arises when wages are higher than the actual productivity of workers, leading to shirking or low productivity. The model suggests that there is an equilibrium level of wages and unemployment, and beyond this level, there may be unintended consequences, such as high unemployment or low productivity. Empirical evidence supports the model's suggestion that there is a relationship between wages and unemployment levels, particularly for low-skilled workers. However, the model has its limitations, and it may not be applicable in all labor market contexts. Nonetheless, the model offers a useful insight into the factors that drive involuntary unemployment.
