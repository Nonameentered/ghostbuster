Language is a crucial tool for communication, and many of us are encouraged to learn a new language as a way to broaden our understanding of different cultures and to enhance our communication skills. However, the mastery of a new language requires careful attention to several factors that affect the development of L2 foreign accent. In this essay, I will discuss the factors that affect L2 foreign accent and the reliability of these factors as described in two articles, and explore additional factors that may impact L2 foreign accent.
According to Munro and Derwing (2006), two prominent researchers in the field, there are five common factors that affect L2 foreign accent. These factors include age of arrival, length of residence, motivation, input frequency, and phonetic environment. Age of arrival was identified as a primary factor that has an effect on L2 foreign accent. Research suggests that those who arrive at a younger age tend to develop native-like accents compared to those who arrive at an older age. However, it should be noted that children entering an L2 environment for the first time before 6-7 years of age are more likely to develop native-like accents.
The second factor that affects L2 foreign accent is the length of residence in the country where the target language is spoken. Research by Munro (1993) suggests that with an increased length of residence, non-native speakers achieve a higher level of phonetic competence, which contributes to greater accuracy in pronunciation. The third factor is motivation. According to Munro and Derwing, motivated L2 speakers have been found to achieve lower accents than their less motivated counterparts.
The fourth and the fifth factors are input frequency and phonetic environment. Input frequency refers to the amount of exposure the learner has to the natural language environment. The more frequently an L2 speaker is exposed to the native language environment, the better their chances are of developing accurate pronunciation. The phonetic environment refers to the speaker's surroundings, where the sounds of the language are heard regularly. Munro and Derwing (1995) found that L2 learners who live or study in an environment where the target language sounds are absent or minimal may not be aroused to process the sounds, leading to less accurate pronunciation.
The second article, by Flege (1995), further supports the factors identified by Munro and Derwing, describing that learners who are exposed to foreign accents during their developmental years are more likely to attain native-like pronunciation and that age matters such that those who learn an L2 after the critical period may not achieve a native-like accent. Flege also found that input frequency and phonetic environment were influential factors, suggesting that increasing input frequency leads to superior phonetic development. Additionally, Flege noted that successful L2 speakers exhibited a high degree of phonetic flexibility which enables them to adapt to the pronunciations of different varieties.
While the factors identified by Munro and Derwing and Flege have been supported by several studies, they have also been challenged in some instances. For instance, studies of English learners by Jenkins (2000) and Seidlhofer(2004) identified that accent might not always be an issue that hinders international communication. Instead, a lack of global English discourse competence might be more impactful. Additionally, there are other uncontrolled variables like speaking anxiety, peer pressure and culture shock that may affect L2 foreign accent.
Moreover, other factors may contribute to L2 foreign accent too. For instance, some studies have suggested that L1 interference may also be a factor. Learners transferring aspects of their L1 accent into their L2 speech may produce foreign accents, which may affect their L2 pronunciation. Research also suggests that the quality and experiences of L2 instruction may also play a role, and that factors such as the learner's personality, socio-cultural background may interact with the five factors mentioned by Munro and Derwing and Flege to affect L2 pronunciation.
In conclusion, Munro and Derwing and Flege have identified five primary factors that affect L2 foreign accent: age of arrival, length of residence, motivation, input frequency, and phonetic environment. While these five factors have been proven to have an impact on L2 pronunciation, many other factors may contribute to L2 foreign accent, such as speaking anxiety, L1 interference, the experience of quality and instruction. Therefore, I believe that researchers must take into consideration diverse variables beyond the five factors mentioned by Munro and Derwing and Flege to better appreciate the complex nature of L2 foreign accents.
