International taxation is a complex and ever-evolving system that governs how countries tax individuals and businesses operating across borders. The concept of international taxation has been present since the early days of civilization, where rulers raised revenue through different forms of taxes. However, with the rapid growth of global trade and economic interdependence, the world has had to adapt its tax regulations to the increasingly complex transactions and interactions between countries. This essay analyzes the current state of international taxation, how it has evolved over time, and whether there can truly be such a thing as international taxation if taxation is considered an act of a state. Additionally, the essay will examine the factors that enable a country to tax individuals and companies, as well as the limitations imposed by fundamental rights and legal principles.
Before the contemporary global tax system, which is based on treaties and models, each state had complete sovereignty over its taxation system, which meant that each country could set its tax rules and policies to collect revenue. However, with the increase of globalization, multinational entities, and international trade, there was a need for some form of international coordination in the field of taxation. In response to this, states agreed to multilateral treaties and adopted tax policy guidelines for international transactions, creating the basis of international taxation in the modern world. Today, international taxation refers to the legal principles that govern cross-border taxation, including the rules for how income, assets, and taxes are allocated among different countries. 
The current state of international taxation is complex, diverse, and constantly changing, with various stakeholders like the OECD, UN, World Bank, and G20 playing vital roles in defining international tax laws and guidelines. In the past, the international tax system focused on taxing multinational companies to prevent tax avoidance. However, recently, the focus has shifted to individuals, primarily high-net-worth individuals, and the introduction of common reporting standards (CRS) by the OECD has improved information sharing between countries to ensure that taxpayers report all their income and pay tax as expected. 
Moreover, the recent developments in international taxation include digital taxation, transfer pricing adjustment, and anti-avoidance measures. Many governments are increasingly becoming more concerned with the implications of the digital economy on their tax revenue. The digital economy stretches across borders, which makes it challenging for governments to develop a tax system that accurately captures its value. Accordingly, many countries have created digital tax policies aimed at multinationals, including income taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), and advertising taxes. These taxes apply to companies that do not have a physical presence in a country but generate significant revenue within its borders. The aim of these taxes is to ensure that governments receive their rightful share of taxation from companies that operate within their borders. 
Similarly, transfer pricing is an essential element in international taxation and refers to a company's pricing of goods and services that it moves between its branches in different countries. Transfer pricing can enable companies to divert profits to lower-tax jurisdictions and avoid taxation in higher-tax jurisdictions. However, to prevent this practice, many countries have introduced transfer pricing adjustments to ensure that companies report their income accurately and pay the right amount of tax in each country they operate. 
Lastly, many countries are introducing anti-avoidance measures to prevent taxpayers from using legal loopholes to reduce their tax obligations. These measures can target certain transactions, structures, or behaviors, making them unattractive for taxpayers. One of the most common anti-avoidance measures that countries employ is General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAARs), which act as a catch-all anti-avoidance measure aimed at any transactions or structures aimed explicitly at tax avoidance.
International taxation has evolved over time, and its current state is influenced by several factors, including globalization, free-market policies, and trade agreements. One of the most common ways countries tax individuals and companies is through residence-based taxation, which is where a country taxes an individual or a company based on their residency or place of incorporation, regardless of where they earn their income or do business. This principle promotes fairness and ensures that individuals and companies pay taxes where they benefit from the public goods and services that the government provides. 
Another way countries tax individuals and companies is through source-based taxation, which is where a country taxes an individual or a company based on the location where they generate income or do business. Source-based taxation seeks to ensure that countries that provide the infrastructure and services that facilitate a company's business activity within their jurisdiction receive the appropriate amount of tax revenue for their efforts. 
Apart from these factors, there are several limitations imposed by fundamental rights and legal principles on international taxation. One of the most common rights that often pose a challenge in international taxation is the right to free movement, where individuals or companies have the freedom to move to different countries to work or conduct business. Taxation based on residence can interfere with this right, limiting individuals' and companies' freedom of movement. 
Moreover, the principle of non-discrimination can also limit how countries tax individuals and companies. The principle of non-discrimination ensures that individuals and companies are treated equally regardless of their nationality, race, or place of incorporation. Discrimination in taxation can interfere with an individual or company's ability to compete with others in the marketplace and can lead to unfair taxation practices. 
In conclusion, international taxation is a complex system that has evolved over time to meet the demands of global trade and economic interdependence. The current state of international taxation is diverse, constantly changing, and influenced by various stakeholders such as governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Although challenges remain, countries have made strides towards better coordination and transparency in their taxation policies. While it is debatable whether there can truly be such a thing as international taxation if taxation is considered an act of a state, the principles of residence-based and source-based taxation have helped to ensure that individuals and companies pay their fair share of tax where they benefit from public goods and services.
