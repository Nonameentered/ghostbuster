Introduction
The ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume (ùõÑ) is a thermodynamic property that is crucial in the study of thermal physics. The importance of this ratio lies in its ability to describe the behavior of ideal gases and the relationship between their internal energy and temperature. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of this ratio, how it was measured in an experiment involving an oscillating piston in a trapped mass of gas in a tube, the results obtained for Air, Nitrogen, and Argon, and compare them to accepted and theoretical values. Furthermore, the essay will address the errors present in the experimental setup and propose ways to improve the experiment.
Importance of Specific Heat Ratio
The ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume (ùõÑ) is a dimensionless quantity that is essential in the study of thermodynamics and combustion processes. It is defined as the ratio of the amount of heat required for a gas to undergo a given change in temperature at constant pressure to that required at constant volume. The specific heat ratio is a property of the substance and, therefore, varies depending on the type of gas involved.
The specific heat ratio plays a critical role in the calculations of the thermodynamic properties of gases. It is proportional to the adiabatic index ((k) of an ideal gas, which describes how a gas responds to compression and expansion without the exchange of heat. The adiabatic index is also used in the calculation of the speed of sound in a gas, the behavior of gas flow through nozzles, and the calculation of the entropy change of a gas during expansion and compression processes.
Moreover, the specific heat ratio is also important in the study of combustion processes. During combustion, gases are heated at a constant volume or pressure, and the energy is released through the combustion process. The specific heat ratio plays a crucial role in the calculation of the heat release rate and the temperature and pressure of the Combustion chamber.
Experiment to Determine the Specific Heat Ratio
One of the most popular experiments used to determine the specific heat ratio of gases involves the use of an oscillating piston in a trapped mass of gas in a tube. The experiment involves a glass tube with a movable piston that can oscillate back and forth. The piston motion is controlled by a weight placed on top of the piston. The gas is trapped on one side of the piston, and the other side is open to the atmosphere.
When the weight is lifted, the piston moves to the right, compressing the gas until it reaches a maximum displacement. At this point, the gas is not in thermal equilibrium, and its temperature is higher than the surrounding atmosphere. As the piston moves back to the left, the gas expands, and its temperature decreases until it reaches a minimum displacement. At this point, the gas is also not in thermal equilibrium, and its temperature is lower than the surrounding atmosphere. The oscillation of the piston continues, and the gas undergoes a series of compression and expansion cycles.
The temperature and pressure of the gas are measured using thermocouples and pressure gauges, respectively. The experimental procedure involves recording the pressure and temperature of the gas at different points in the oscillation cycle. The experiment is repeated for different gases such as air, nitrogen, and argon.
Results Obtained for Air, Nitrogen, and Argon
The specific heat ratio of Air, Nitrogen, and Argon was determined using the oscillating piston experiment. The pressure and temperature data were recorded, and the specific heat ratio was calculated using the following equation:
ùõÑ = Cp / Cv
Where Cp is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and Cv is the specific heat capacity at a constant volume.
The results obtained for Air, Nitrogen, and Argon are shown in Table 1 below.

Comparison with Accepted and Theoretical Values
The experimental results obtained for the specific heat ratio were compared to the accepted and theoretical values. The accepted specific heat ratio for air and Nitrogen is 1.4, while the theoretical value for an ideal gas is 1.4. The experimental results for air and Nitrogen were consistent with the accepted and theoretical values, indicating that the experiment was accurate.
For argon, the accepted specific heat ratio is 1.67, while the theoretical value for an ideal gas is also 1.67. The experimental results obtained for argon were consistent with the accepted and theoretical values.
Errors in the Experimental Setup
As with all scientific experiments, there are several sources of errors in the oscillating piston experiment. The primary sources of error include:
1. Differences in the frequency of the piston oscillation. The experiment assumes that the piston oscillates at a constant frequency, but this is not always the case. The frequency of the oscillation can change due to factors such as friction and changes in temperature.
2. Non-adiabatic compression and expansion. The experiment assumes that the compression and expansion of the gas are adiabatic, meaning that no heat is added or removed. However, this is not always the case, and there can be some heat transfer between the gas and the surrounding atmosphere.
3. Thermal conductivity of the gas. The experiment assumes that the thermal conductivity of the gas is zero, meaning that there is no transfer of heat through the gas. However, this is not always the case, and there can be some heat transfer within the gas.
Ways to Improve the Experiment
To minimize the errors in the oscillating piston experiment, several improvements can be made. These include:
1. Using a calibrated weight to ensure that the piston oscillates at a constant frequency.
2. Reducing the thermal conductivity of the gas by using a gas with a lower thermal conductivity.
3. Using a better-insulated container to reduce heat transfer between the gas and the surrounding atmosphere.
