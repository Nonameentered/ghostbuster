Human language is one of the most sophisticated and complex systems of communication in the world, enabling us to share our thoughts, emotions, experiences, and ideas with others around us. Learning how to communicate via language is an essential developmental milestone for all humans and is usually achieved through a process known as language acquisition. However, language acquisition is not the only linguistic skill that children must learn during their early years. They must also learn how to read and write, two additional essential skills needed to succeed in this modern world. In this essay, the differences between the acquisition of language and the acquisition of reading and writing in children will be discussed. Furthermore, we will examine how researchers determine whether chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives, are capable of acquiring language.
One of the main differences between the acquisition of language and the acquisition of reading and writing in children lies in their cognitive processes. Language acquisition is a natural, effortless, and automatic process that children actively engage in from the time of birth. Infants begin by acquiring the essential structures and sounds of their native language through observing and listening to their parents or other speakers. Gradually, they learn to comprehend and produce words, sentences, and eventually complex discourse that reflects mastery of their language. Children learn language because they inherently want to communicate with others and acquire information about the world. Language acquisition is, therefore, a bottom-up process that begins with sound recognition and subsequently progresses into more elaborate cognitive activities, such as syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse.
On the other hand, the process of learning to read and write is based more on top-down cognitive mechanisms that are grounded in the development of literacy skills in children. Unlike language acquisition, learning to read and write is a skilled-based process that requires explicit instruction from adults. Children must learn the alphabetic principle, which connects the spoken and written sounds of their language, and how to decode and spell words across a range of contexts. This process requires the development of several cognitive skills, such as phonemic awareness, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and morphological awareness. Once the child has attained these skills, they begin to develop reading comprehension, writing fluency and accuracy, and critical literacy skills.
Another difference between language acquisition and reading/writing acquisition is their developmental trajectories. Language acquisition is usually completed during the first few years of a child's life. By the age of five, most children have acquired their native language(s) completely. In contrast, learning to read and write is a life-long process that extends from the early years of schooling to adulthood. The rate of development of the two skills also differs significantly. Language acquisition is relatively rapid in the early stages, with children acquiring around ten new words each day. However, the process slows down as they develop more sophisticated structures and vocabulary. In comparison, reading and writing acquisition are slower and can vary significantly for each child, depending on their level of instruction, interest, motivation, and environmental factors such as access to reading materials and the frequency with which they use the language.
Another critical difference in the acquisition of language and reading/writing lies in their social context. Language acquisition occurs in a natural environment where children have access to many language models around them, such as their parents, siblings, peers, and caregivers. Children's acquisition of language begins when they engage in interpersonal interactions and experience social cues and feedback from their environment. This natural human interactivity sets the foundation for language acquisition through exposure to dialogue, structures, and context. In contrast, learning to read and write is more formal and relies heavily on instructional environments such as schools and homes, where children receive explicit and structured instruction on literacy-related activities and other activities that contribute to literacy development. Reading instruction often involves exercises related to phonics, vocabulary, spelling, grammar, syntax, and comprehension.
Finally, researchers have long sought to determine the extent to which human language acquisition processes are unique to humans. To achieve this, they have tested the capacity of different animals with varying degrees of genetic similarity to humans to acquire language. Chimpanzees are one of the most commonly studied animals in this regard because they share several genetic similarities with humans. Researchers have used different approaches to identify the ability of chimpanzees to acquire language. One approach is to see whether they can acquire sign language and use it to communicate with humans. For example, Koko, a female chimpanzee, is famous for learning American Sign Language fluently and using it to express her ideas, thoughts, and emotions. Another approach is to use "keyboard language," which involves giving chimpanzees access to a computer with a touch-sensitive screen that displays symbols that represent words and concepts. Researchers have found that chimpanzees can indeed learn to associate symbols with their meanings and, over time, use those symbols to communicate with humans and other chimpanzees. However, the extent and scope of chimpanzee language acquisition is still a matter of debate, as it is unclear whether they possess the full range of cognitive abilities necessary to comprehend and use language at the level that humans do.
In conclusion, language acquisition is a natural, effortless, and automatic process that children engage in from birth, whereas reading and writing acquisition is more structured and relies on explicit instruction from adults. Language acquisition is rapid early on, with children acquiring approximately ten new words each day, and is typically complete by the age of five. In contrast, learning to read and write is slower and continues throughout a person's life. Language acquisition occurs naturally and is grounded in social interactions, while learning to read and write are learned skills, typically taught in school. Finally, chimpanzees can acquire some form of language, but the full extent of their capacity to learn language remains uncertain.
