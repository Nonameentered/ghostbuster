The anti-poll tax riots of 1990 in London were a significant event in the history of protests in the United Kingdom. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the Thatcher government's new tax policy, which aimed to replace the outdated system of the rating system by a poll tax that was to be based on the number of adults living in a household. The events leading up to the anti-poll tax riots were multifaceted, involving economic and political factors, as well as class and social tensions. In this essay, I will explore the causes of the riots and how sociological theories of crowd behavior help us understand the dynamics of the protests.
The poll tax was introduced in 1989, amid a backdrop of economic turmoil and social inequality in the UK. The government proposed that each household would pay a fixed amount for local government services, regardless of income or property value. This policy was seen as unfair by many, particularly those on low incomes and in poverty. It would mean that poorer households would pay a larger proportion of their income in tax, while the wealthiest would pay significantly less. Additionally, many believed the poll tax was an attack on the working class, as it would be the first time in history that everyone had to pay the same amount of local tax, irrespective of income, property value, or social standing. 
The first opposition to the tax came from within Margaret Thatcher's own Conservative Party, where a small number of MPs warned that the proposed policy could lead to unrest. However, the government pushed ahead with the plans, and in March 1989, the first non-payment campaigns began, with the hope that it would disrupt the collection of the tax by encouraging households not to pay. Large scale protests had been launched by opposition groups and trade unions who sought to oppose the legislation. There were also protests across Scotland, where many felt they were being treated unfairly by the tax due to the high number of single adults, and by student groups who faced paying the tax alongside high tuition fees. These protests were met with fierce resistance by the police, who made a large number of arrests. 
In the months leading up to the anti-poll tax riots, several factors compounded to create the perfect storm for the protests to take place. Firstly, the policy's implementation came at the end of over a decade of cuts to public services, with a crisis in healthcare, education, and housing across the country. Public opinion had become increasingly critical of Thatcher's policies, and many felt that the government was only interested in supporting the rich. Secondly, the movement against the poll tax had grown significantly, with numerous local campaigns, groups, and individuals joining together to create a united front against the tax. A radical faction had also begun to emerge, with activists exploiting social tensions to create an atmosphere of disorder, which would ultimately lead to the riots. This was best illustrated when a woman named Dawn Brown refused to pay her poll tax in 1990, with thousands following her lead and protesting against the legislation.
Sociological theories of crowd behavior can help us understand the dynamics of the anti-poll tax riots. The social identity theory, which was proposed by Tajfel and Turner, suggests that people feel a sense of belonging and loyalty to different social groups, which can lead to group polarization and radicalization. This theory could explain why so many people joined the protests against the poll tax, as they identified with a wider social group that was negatively affected by the tax. This sense of collective identity led to a more radicalized protest movement, which, in turn, led to increased violence.
Another theory that can help us understand the anti-poll tax riots is the theory of collective behavior, which was proposed by Neil Smelser. The theory argues that large crowds would not engage in violent behavior unless certain conditions are present, including social structural strain, a triggering event, and the mobilization of people through communication networks. The poll tax was a powerful source of social structural strain, as it placed a disproportionate burden on those with the least ability to pay, while the mobilization of people against the tax was facilitated by the increased communication networks available at the time. The triggering event for the anti-poll tax riots was the failure of a peaceful march on March 31, which was organized by the All-Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation. The march was initially peaceful, but when a small group of protestors began to break away and engage in violence, the police responded with force, leading to running battles on the streets of London.
The final theory that can help us understand the dynamics of the anti-poll tax riots is the theory of social movements, which was developed by Herbert Blumer. This theory suggests that collective action is a result of a shared identity and a sense of collective grievance. It can also explain why the anti-poll tax riots turned violent, as the protests were fueled by a shared sense of injustice and frustration, which created a momentum that was difficult to control. This theory could also explain why the radical faction was able to hijack the protests, as their agenda was able to align with the overall grievances of the wider tax protest movement.
To sum up, the anti-poll tax riots of 1990 in London were a response to a wide range of economic, political, and social factors that were in place at the time. The implementation of the tax was seen as highly unfair, leading to a surge of non-payment campaigns and protests across the UK. By March 1990, several groups had joined forces to create a united front against the tax, with a radical faction emerging that would ultimately lead to the riots. Sociological theories of crowd behavior can help us understand the dynamics of the protests, with the social identity theory, the theory of collective behavior, and the theory of social movements all offering explanations for why the protests turned violent. Ultimately, the anti-poll tax riots were a significant event in the history of protests in the UK, leading to the removal of the poll tax and the resignation of Margaret Thatcher.
