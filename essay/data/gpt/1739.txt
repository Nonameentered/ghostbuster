A safety-critical system is a system that, if it fails, could cause harm or potentially fatal consequences to individuals. An example of such a system includes medical devices, aircraft, trains, and automobiles. The design, development, testing, and implementation of safety-critical systems require great attention to detail, as even the smallest of errors or bugs could lead to catastrophic consequences. 
In terms of software development, safety-critical systems differ from other high-availability systems in several ways. Safety-critical systems require greater reliability, robustness, and accuracy than other high-availability systems. For instance, high-availability systems aim to ensure that there is continuous availability of a service or application. On the other hand, safety-critical systems need to guarantee that the system's behavior conforms to certain safety requirements. Additionally, while high-availability systems prioritize uptime, performance, and scalability, safety-critical systems prioritize the safety, reliability, and stability of the system.
The safety integrity level (SIL) determines the level of safety-related risks that safety-critical systems can tolerate. The SIL is determined based on the potential severity of the harm that could result from a failure or malfunctioning of the system. The higher the potential severity of the harm, the higher the SIL the system must meet. The SIL ranges from SIL 1 for systems that are critical but cause minor harm, to SIL 4 for systems that could cause catastrophic harm. 
To meet the SIL requirements, software developers must adhere to strict guidelines outlined in the IEC 61508 standard, which provides safety rules and engineering practices that dictate the design, development, testing, and operation of safety-critical systems. One of the recommendations provided by the IEC 61508 standard for language selection is to use programming languages that support safety-critical software development. For instance, languages such as Ada and SPARK are suitable for developing safety-critical systems due to their strong type checking and automatic code analysis tools. Additionally, the standard suggests that the programming language should be efficient, maintainable, and have a well-established review process to reduce errors and bugs.
Fault injection testing is a technique used to test safety-critical systems by intentionally injecting faults or errors into the system. The purpose of fault injection testing is to identify and evaluate the system's response to potential errors and determine whether the system meets its safety requirements. For example, fault injection testing could involve initiating a system's failure to see how it responds and whether it meets the requirements stipulated in its safety plan. The testing could also involve removing or disconnecting important hardware components or introducing timing errors to simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate the system's performance under such conditions.
Fault injection testing is important for verifying the safety-integrity requirements of a safety-critical system as it identifies potential failure modes that could cause hazardous situations. By simulating various scenarios that could occur in the real world, the testing helps system developers understand how the system responds in an unsafe situation and allows them to incorporate safety features and modify the system's design to improve its safety.
Formal methods are techniques used to mathematically validate the correctness and reliability of safety-critical systems. Formal methods explore various mathematical models and analysis techniques to check the system's reliability and ensure that it performs as expected. Formal methods involve mathematically proving that a system is free of errors and bugs.
Formal methods contribute significantly to the reliability and dependability of safety-critical systems by providing a rigorous and precise approach to software development. Formal methods allow developers to validate the system's behavior, detect errors, and fix them before implementation. By ensuring that the system meets its safety requirements, formal methods increase the overall safety, dependability, and reliability of safety-critical systems.
In conclusion, safety-critical systems differ from other high-availability systems in that they prioritize safety, reliability, and stability over downtime, performance, and scalability. The safety integrity level determines the level of risks that safety-critical systems can tolerate, and developers must adhere to strict guidelines outlined in the IEC 61508 standard to ensure that the systems meet their safety requirements. Fault injection testing is essential for verifying the safety-integrity requirements of a safety-critical system, while formal methods ensure the reliability and dependability of safety-critical systems by providing a rigorous and precise approach to software development. As safety-critical systems continue to play a vital role in various industries, it is imperative that software developers prioritize safety, reliability, and stability during the design, development, testing, and implementation of these systems.
