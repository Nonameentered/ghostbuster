Melodrama is a genre of drama that became increasingly popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the ever-changing taste of the mass audience. It gained its popularity due to its ability to reflect the contemporary social climate, its ability to appeal to a wide audience, and the use of easily identifiable stock characterizations. This essay aims to discuss the reasons behind the popularity of melodrama during the 18th and 19th centuries while using three plays as examples to explore how it appealed to a wide audience.
Melodrama was appealing to a wide audience due to its ability to address pressing social issues of the time in a dramatic and emotional way. The genre was able to portray the moral dilemmas of the time, inequalities, and oppression, which were critical themes during this period. The plays focused on social issues such as poverty, crime, and working-class life, which were a significant concern for people during this period.
The theme of poverty was a popular social issue addressed in melodramas. For instance, in the play, "The Poor of Liverpool," written by James A. Harris in 1828, the theme of poverty is prevalent. The play portrays the life of the working-class people who are struggling to make ends meet. It also highlights the corrupt practices of the wealthy characters who exploit the poor. The play's emotional impact depicts the struggle of the poor and the pain they must go through. This draws the attention of the audience to the social issue of poverty and triggers an emotional response.
Another social issue addressed in melodramas is crime. The plays aim to teach the audience about crime and its devastating effect on society. The audience gets to learn about the immorality of crime and how it affects the perpetrators, victims, and society at large. For instance, in the play, "The Corsican Brothers," by Dion Boucicault, it portrays the theme of revenge and its violent consequences. The play depicts the two brothers and how their hatred for their enemy leads to a series of violent actions that eventually lead to their downfall. The play addresses the theme of revenge, which was a topical subject at that time, and it relates to the audience's moral and emotional values.
Stock characterizations were a crucial element in melodramas. These were easily identifiable characters that the audience could relate to or empathize with. The characters portrayed behavioral traits that the audience could easily understand, making them relatable. The most common stock characterizations in melodrama were the villain, the hero/protagonist, and the damsel in distress. The villain was a stereotypical character who caused chaos and destruction, the hero/protagonist was the lead character who was always triumphing over the villain, and the damsel in distress was a female character who was always in need of rescue.
The melodramatic characterizations of the play allowed the audience can easily identify with a particular character, allowing them to become emotionally invested in the story; they could identify with a specific character and feel empathy toward them. This emotional connection kept the audience coming back to the theater as they wanted to see their favorite characters triumph over their villains.
The play, "The Octoroon," written by Dion Boucicault in 1859, demonstrates how stock characterizations were used in melodramas to trigger an emotional response from the audience. The plot of the play focuses on the life of a young girl who struggles to accept her mixed race and eventually falls in love with a white man who also loves her. The play's main character, Zoe, is the damsel in distress character, while the white man, George, is the hero/protagonist. The villain is the plantation owner, Jacob McCloskey, who wants to destroy the relationship between Zoe and George. The melodramatic structure of the play allowed the audience to empathize with the main character, Zoe, and George and root for their relationship to triumph over the villain.
The melodramatic structure of the play, "The Octoroon," was able to reflect the contemporary social climate where prejudice and inequality were the common norm. The play highlights racial discrimination and prejudice, which was a major social issue of the time. The play reflects on the pain that people of mixed-race had to endure during that time and their struggles to fit into the society's structure. The play's emotional impact on the audience results in them feeling empathy towards the main characters and positions them to understand how the social issues of prejudice and inequality impact real people.
In conclusion, melodrama was a genre of drama that gained its popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries because of its ability to address contemporary social issues, appeal to a wide audience, and create easily identifiable stock characterizations. The genre was able to reflect the contemporary social climate, create emotional responses, and express the moral values of the audience. The use of stock characterizations allowed the audience to identify with a specific character and root for them. The three plays discussed in this essay demonstrate how melodrama was able to address pressing social issues while also being entertaining and engaging for the audience.
