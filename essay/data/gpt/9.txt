The Victorian period was a time of great change in the culture of the modern world. One of the most significant shifts was the rise of consumerism, which transformed the way people lived, worked, and related to one another. This essay will examine how consumerism in the Victorian period represented a fundamental shift in the modern world's culture. Specifically, it will explore the emergence of the department store, mass advertising, and the gendering of shopping and how they contributed to this shift. It will also examine the opposing views of critics in regards to mass consumerism and how they were ultimately overcome or channeled into the new middle-class model of consumerism.
The rise of consumerism in the Victorian period was a significant departure from earlier periods when goods were primarily produced for local consumption. The emergence of the department store was a key factor in this shift. Department stores offered a vast variety of goods under one roof, and they were designed to create a shopping experience. The first department store in the world, Bon Marché, opened in Paris in 1852.
The Bon Marché was a revolutionary store because it made shopping a new social activity that catered to women's leisure time. Female shoppers could browse the merchandise without pressure, and items such as gloves, ribbons, and laces were available to examine and compare. Departments such as millinery, new at the time, were introduced to serve women's growing interest in fashion. The store's layout was designed using a series of departments that led the shopper along a set path, encouraging her to make purchases. The store was such a remarkable institution that it even inspired the expression "Bon Marché spirit," meaning a love of shopping.
The department store soon spread to other cities around the world, and their popularity exploded in America and Britain. Harrods, Selfridge's, and Marshall Field & Co. are excellent examples of the proliferation of department stores. As a result, the department store became a social and cultural phenomenon, reflecting Victorian society's values, attitudes, and aspirations.
Mass advertising was another significant factor that contributed to the rise of consumerism during the Victorian period. Mass production and new transportation technologies made it possible for manufacturers and retailers to sell their products to a wider audience. The appearance of advertising in newspapers and magazines, street signs, and posters marked a new era of mass communication. Advertising was initially used to promote new products on the market, such as patent medicines, and quickly expanded to showcase consumer goods.
Advertising emphasized the idea of comfort and leisure in relation to consumer goods, encouraging more purchases. The campaigns used clever slogans, catchy music, and images of happy consumers to entice people to consume more. Advertising also featured cultural stereotypes concerning gender roles and even race. Women were prominently featured in advertising, and their depiction as passive, beautiful, and indulgent was designed to align with the domestic ideal. Advertising created a culture of desire and consumerism that helped promote the growth of the middle class.
The gendering of shopping was another factor that became more pronounced during the Victorian period. Women increasingly had the time and resources to shop and engage in leisure activities, including shopping. Department stores and advertising targeted their tastes and preferences, catering to their interests and creating spaces for them to shop and socialize. Shopping became a female-dominated activity associated with refinement, taste, and class distinction. The decoration of the store, the quality of goods, and the exclusivity of a shopping experience, such as tea rooms and tea salons, all worked to attract the female shopper.
Critics of mass consumerism emerged during the Victorian period as well. These critiques took various forms, ranging from concerns about ethical issues in advertising to criticisms of mass production, which was seen as dehumanizing and exploitative. Some critics saw mass consumption as a sign of moral decay, a form of decadence that contributed to social unrest and the destruction of traditional values.
Others believed that mass consumerism was incompatible with the development of human character. The philosopher John Ruskin argued that the new middle-class focus on material possessions led to the loss of intellectual and spiritual virtues. According to Ruskin, modern life's relentless pursuit of luxury and comfort led to a "hunger for false excitement and senseless pleasure." In contrast, medieval craftsmen, who put their hearts and souls into their work, embodied a more authentic mode of production that fostered creativity and moral character.
Despite these criticisms, consumerism in the Victorian period continued to grow and evolve. Critics were eventually absorbed into the middle-class model of consumerism, which emphasized individual choice, competition, and the idea that the consumption of goods was a form of self-definition. Consumerism became normalized as the driving force of modern life, and this trend continued into the twentieth century.
In conclusion, consumerism in the Victorian period represents a fundamental shift in the culture of the modern world. The emergence of the department store, mass advertising, and the gendering of shopping contributed to the rise of consumerism, which transformed the way people lived, worked, and related to one another. The opposing views of critics in regards to mass consumerism were ultimately channeled into the new middle-class model of consumerism that prioritized individual choice and competition. Today, consumerism remains an integral part of modern life, shaping our social, cultural, and economic lives in new and profound ways.
