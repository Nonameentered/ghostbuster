Introduction
Human resource management is widely recognized as a critical function in organizations. This is because it is responsible for the recruitment, selection, and retention of personnel with the right skills and abilities that lead to a high level of organizational performance. However, to ensure that the recruitment and selection process of employees aligns with organizational objectives, adopting a strategic approach is fundamental. Strategic human resource management involves the application of a set of HR practices in the recruitment and selection process, which aligns with the organization's strategic goals. Therefore, this essay will explore the importance of adopting a strategic approach to human resources, particularly in the recruitment and selection process. Additionally, it will discuss the various models of aligning HR strategy with the business strategy, the relevant policies and practices used for recruitment and selection, and explain the circumstances that lead organizations to adopt a strategic approach.
Importance of Adopting a Strategic Approach to Human Resources
In recent times, both academics and practitioners have agreed that HR's strategic approach is essential in adopting the best practices for recruitment and selection processes. A strategic HR function is an invaluable addition to business success as it ensures the recruitment and selection process's alignment with the strategic objectives of a particular organization. Studies show that a strategic approach enhances the recruitment and selection process's efficiency and effectiveness in attracting candidates with skills and qualifications relevant to the organization's current needs. Additionally, the strategic approach ensures that HR practices align with organizational objectives, which makes HR departments important partners in strategic planning and execution.
Furthermore, adopting a strategic approach to human resources strengthens the HR department's role in an organization, especially in facilitation of the talent management process. By applying a strategic approach, the HR department can ensure that potential candidates possess the necessary skills to attain high levels of organizational performance. Moreover, a strategic HR approach contributes to successful long-term and short-term objectives as it ensures that the HR practices align with the business goals. For instance, if an organization aims to increase its sales by 30% within the next two years, its strategic approach to HR is likely to focus on attracting and retaining talent with sales skills. Consequently, a strategic approach ensures that the recruitment and selection process attracts candidates with relevant expertise to support the long-term vision of the organization.
Models of Aligning HR Strategy with Business Strategy
The strategic approach of HR should align with business strategy to create value for an organization. According to Boxall and Purcell (2011), three models of strategic alignment exist. The first model is shared services where the HR department and the business function share the policies and practices. This model is more common in smaller organizations where the HR department doubles as the business unit. The second model is the devolved approach where the HR department with support from the senior management team receives the devolved responsibility for HR practices in different business units. The devolved approach model is most common in large organizations. Finally, the business partnership approach is the third model of strategic alignment, where HR practices align with business objectives. This model is more common in rapidly growing businesses with significant market shares.
Policies and Practices for Recruitment and Selection
For a strategic approach to HR in recruitment and selection, organizations must adopt relevant policies and practices. Firstly, broad-based recruitment practices ensure that the organization has access to a wide pool of candidates with different skills and qualifications. Broad-based approaches include a mix of paid and unpaid postings. This increases the organization's likelihood of attracting candidates from different backgrounds, ethnicities, races, and genders.
Secondly, organizations require effective interviewing methods to achieve a strategic approach in their recruitment and selection process. The most appropriate interview method is structured interviewing, where the interviewer asks specific questions from a prepared list. This ensures that all candidates apply for the same role and the opportunity to highlight their skills. Additionally, structured interviewing reduces the risk of interviewer bias, thus promoting diversity.
Furthermore, incorporating behavioral assessment tests in the recruitment and selection process improves the chances of finding a candidate that aligns with the organization's strategic objectives. Behavioral assessment tests focus on an individualâ€™s character traits, personality, and situational judgment abilities. Therefore, an organization can acquire a suitable candidate whose behavior aligns with its strategic objectives.
Lastly, relevant HR policies and practices must be used in determining the remuneration levels whereby compensation for skilled and talented employees aligns with the labor market rates. The compensation packages' pre-determined levels are a fundamental aspect of the organization's role in developing and aligning HR and business strategies and retaining quality employees.
Circumstances That Lead Organizations to Adopt a Strategic Approach to Recruitment and Selection
Organizations face various circumstances that lead to the adoption of strategic approaches in recruitment and selection. First, when an organization lays out a specific business plan, including measurable objectives, it needs to adopt a strategic approach in the recruitment and selection process. For instance, if the organization aims to increase its market share within two years, developing a talent management strategy that focuses on recruiting and selecting individuals with marketing skills is necessary.
Secondly, adopting the strategic approach to recruitment and selection is necessary when an organization requires skills or expertise that are unique to business. For example, suppose an organization is entering new markets that require novelty and creativity. In that case, its HR department needs a strategic approach in recruiting and selecting such individuals with innovative and creative abilities.
Lastly, organizations that face internal or external changes that impact business outcomes require a strategic approach to recruitment and selection. Such changes could include changes in technology, the introduction of new products, globalization, and changes in government regulations. A strategic approach to HR helps an organization to recruit and select individuals with specialist, relevant, or technical skills that address a company's changing needs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, adopting a strategic approach to human resources, particularly in recruitment and selection, is critical to an organization's success in creating a competitive advantage. Strategic HR practices contribute to long-term and short-term strategic objectives by aligning HR with organizational business objectives that increase the organization's chances of success. By aligning HR strategy with business strategy, an organization can retain a competitive advantage by developing a talent management process that adopts relevant policies and practices that promote diversity and talent retention. To achieve this, organizations must adopt relevant models of strategic alignment, broad-based recruitment practices, behavioral assessment tests, and expect compensation packages that align with labor market rates. Finally, organizations should adopt a strategic approach to recruitment and selection when there are significant internal or external changes that impact business outcomes that require specialist, relevant, or technical skills that address a company's changing needs.
