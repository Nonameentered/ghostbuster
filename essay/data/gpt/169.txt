Social housing has been an essential part of the housing system in various countries across the world. The fundamental reason behind the construction of social housing was to provide affordable, safe, and secure accommodation for those in need, particularly low-income individuals and families. However, in recent years, there has been a general trend of contraction in the social housing sector, leading to a rise in homelessness and the housing affordability crisis. This essay aims to analyse the underlying reasons for this trend by examining the housing policies of the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden since the mid-1970s.
In the mid-1970s, social housing was a central concern in many developed nations, including the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden. The aftermath of World War II had left many European nations with a severe shortage of housing, and the social housing sector was born out of this crisis. Therefore, the primary condition that necessitated the initial building of social housing was to address the acute shortage of affordable and decent dwellings. The post-war reconstruction of cities in Europe was at the time of building new homes to replace war-damaged ones. In the UK, public housing was the showpiece of post-war reconstruction efforts. As a result, Councils began to build millions of homes resulting in a boom in the social housing sector. This was followed by similar public housing policies in France, the Netherlands, and Sweden (Drescher, 2016).
By the 1980s, homeownership emerged as an attractive alternative to social housing for low-income individuals and families in the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden. The root of this shift can be traced back to the supply-side economics approach of the so-called Reagan-Thatcher era, which advocated for a laissez-faire economy. In the UK and the Netherlands, this approach led to the deregulation of the housing market, relaxing lending rules, and encouraging the growth of private property ownership. In France and Sweden, policies to encourage homeownership emerged later, in the 1990s. In Franceâ€™s case, laws allowing for the use of personal retirement savings to buy a home were introduced in 1967. The French government created several schemes that make it easier to get a mortgage, and benefits for first-time buyers in the 2000s (Drescher, 2016). Furthermore, in the early 2000s, many families in Sweden could take out loans representing up to 85% of the value of a house. This, in turn, increased the demand for property ownership and led many low-income individuals and families to shift away from social housing.
Another reason for the trend of contraction in the social housing sector is the self-eroding dynamic within social housing itself. The term self-eroding refers to the phenomenon in which social housing itself gradually becomes less desirable over time as it becomes stigmatized by lower-income households. Those with the financial ability to move prefer to live in private-market housing, as opposed to social housing, leading to the concentration of low-income households in social housing. This phenomena ultimately affects the social mix within these communities, leading to many social problems within these communities. Also, a lack of maintenance in social housing, due to chronic underfunding, is another problem that adds to the negative perception of social housing. This chronic underfunding often leads to situations where social housing becomes expensive, poorly maintained, and dilapidated.
A common feature of the housing policies in the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden since the mid-1970s is the widely perceived global economic pressures for fiscal prudence. Governments, in their quest for fiscal prudence, have focused their attention on reducing public debt, leading to spending cuts in social housing. The austerity measures that followed the global financial crisis of 2008 led to significant cuts in the social housing budgets of these countries, significantly reducing the availability of social housing. In the UK, for instance, the impact of the housing benefit cap cannot be overstated. This policy directly impacted over 640,000 people in 2012 and 2013 alone. Additionally, other policies, such as the bedroom tax and the limitation of benefits available to those aged 18 to 24 years, have also significantly reduced the availability of social housing (Greenshields, 2018).
Despite the contraction of the social housing sector in the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden, social housing is not completely doomed. There remains significant variation in housing policies and funding between these countries, which offers insight into how social housing can be made more viable. For example, in the Netherlands, social housing still plays an important role in the housing system and is not seen as an inferior form of housing. The Dutch government invests in social housing and sets rent prices, making it more accessible to the low-income individuals and families who need it. Similarly, in France, social housing has been built primarily as part of the public housing system, and the government's goal is to create more housing affordability through rent control policies. In contrast, UK social housing providers are largely funded by rental income from their tenants, which has resulted in a decrease of new developments and no proper funding for repairs. However, the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government is taking public housing seriously and spending more money on it (Greenshields, 2018). Sweden, on the other hand, has an interesting mix of policies. The Swedish government increased its focus on privately built and financed social housing, which it perceives as within reach of many aid-dependent households. A combination of investment in new social housing, tax breaks for new builds, and rental controls have pulled the Swedes back from the brink of a housing crisis (Dixon & Pawson, 2018).
In conclusion, this essay has analysed the underlying reasons for the general trend of contraction in the social housing sector in the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden since the mid-1970s. The allure of homeownership, the self-eroding dynamic within social housing, the widely perceived global economic pressures for fiscal prudence, and the absence of the main conditions that necessitated the initial building of social housing are some of the factors that have contributed to the contraction of social housing. Finally, the essay has presented evidence that social housing is not completely doomed in these countries and summarized the differences in housing policy and funding. While the future of social housing may be unclear, it is essential to consider the policies that can revitalise and strengthen this vital sector of the housing system.
