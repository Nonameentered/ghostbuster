Language is one of the most significant tools of communication in human society. While it is often assumed that a simple pairing between words and ideas exists, the relationship between them is much more complex and multifaceted. The claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind is closely linked with the theory of meaning that asserts that the meaning of language is established by the mental state of the speaker. However, this position has been challenged by varying objections. In this essay, we will examine the aforementioned claim while exploring the central objections to this notion and suggest solutions to refine this interpretation and make it more defensible.
The claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind is based on the notion of mentalism, which proposes that the meaning of language is established by analyzing the mental state of the speaker. On this view, language conveys ideas that exist in the mind of the speaker, and the meaning of a particular expression is determined by the content of the mental representation that corresponds to that expression. Hence, according to mentalism, the meaning of an utterance is only apparent when one knows the speaker’s mental state.
However, the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind has been challenged by some of the central objections. One of the most significant objections is the problem of vagueness. The vagueness objection asserts that if the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind, then the meanings of those ideas would be indeterminate and imprecise in many cases. For instance, the representation of the idea that corresponds to the word “chair” varies from one person to another. One person’s idea of a chair may include a backrest, while another’s may not. 
Moreover, the vagueness objection claims that the mental state of the speaker cannot be an adequate basis to define the meaning of language. If one were to define an expression based on the speaker’s mental state, then its meaning would change from one speaker to another. For example, the expression “cool,” means different things to different people. For some the word represents a temperature, while for others, it signifies an attitude.
Another objection that challenges the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind is the problem of diversity. In this regard, some critics argue that language diversity and the lack of a universal language indicate that linguistic expressions’ meanings cannot be analyzed in terms of ideas. The diversity objection suggests that since language speakers across the world have different ideas, then the meaning of words, and phrases would not be universal. Different languages have varying word orders and structures, and as such, mentalistic approaches have difficulties explaining how the same mental state can be expressed differently across languages.
The third objection challenging the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind relates to the limitations of mentalistic interpretations. This objection suggests that mentalistic interpretations cannot account for many features of language, such as figurative language, irony, and metaphor. For instance, in the expression “the apple of my eye,” the phrase does not literally mean that someone’s eye contains an apple. However, a mentalistic approach to the meaning of language cannot account for the figurative meaning of such expressions and can only offer a literal translation devoid of any figurative interpretation.
The discussed objections challenge the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind. Nonetheless, some solutions may serve to refine this interpretation and make it more defensible. One way of doing this is by introducing the concept of intersubjective meaning. The primary aim of the idea of intersubjective meaning is to demonstrate that linguistic expressions can have similar meanings across speakers, as meanings emerge from the interactions between speakers. Intersubjective meaning suggests that meaning is a dynamic and collective construct that emerges from social interactions. The same word or expression may have different meanings depending on the context of the exchange. Therefore, meanings need to be understood with respect to the context of interaction that produces them.
Another solution to refine the interpretation of the claim under discussion is by introducing the notion of evocation as a way of generating meaning. According to this view, language does not merely transmit information about the speaker’s mental state; instead, it evokes ideas in the mind of the receiver. Evocation supposes that the meaning of language is not just a matter of decoding the words, but it is a matter of relating language to our experiences and our worldviews. If we use this approach, we recognize that the meaning of an utterance is determined by what ideas it evokes in the mind of the listener, who have a diverse set of mental representations.
Finally, another solution to refine the interpretation of the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind may be to adopt a pluralistic approach. A pluralistic approach acknowledges that different linguistic contexts may be analyzed through different lenses. The meaning of a particular phrase in a psychological context may be better studied under mentalism, while its meaning in cultural anthropology may require more consideration of social factors. Therefore, instead of treating mentalistic approaches as the only method for analyzing the meaning of language, pluralistic approaches consider other possibilities like social, cultural, or historical interpretations to enrich the meaning of linguistic expressions.
In conclusion, the claim that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed in terms of ideas in the mind has been the subject of challenge by central objections such as vagueness, diversity, and limitations of mentalistic interpretations. In exploring solutions to these objections, it may be helpful to consider adopting a perspective based on the notion of intersubjective meaning, the concept of evocation, and a pluralistic approach. By applying these solutions and refining the interpretation of the claim, we open ourselves to a broader understanding of the meaning of linguistic expressions that reflect the richness and diversity of human communication.
