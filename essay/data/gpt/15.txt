Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the four prominent thinkers who have made significant contributions to communism. Their intellectual and political activity played a crucial role in shaping the philosophy of communism and establishing communist regimes in various countries. These philosophers' beliefs on democracy were central to their vision of a classless, egalitarian society. This essay aims to examine the intellectual and political activities of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and their beliefs about democracy and its role in creating a communist state.
Karl Marx was a German philosopher who founded socialism and communism. He analyzed the industrial revolution's effects on the working class in Europe and argued that capitalism creates inequality and exploitation. Marx believed that communism would replace capitalism as the dominant economic system and create a classless society. He stated that this would be achieved through a revolution by the working class.
Marx's concept of democracy was based on the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He argued that in capitalist societies, the state's power is used to maintain the ruling class' dominance and that the political system is meant to suppress the working class. In contrast, in communist societies, the state's power would be used to benefit the working class. He called for the abolition of the state and for workers to control it themselves. Marx believed that democracy was necessary for the destruction of capitalism and the creation of a communist society. 
Friedrich Engels was Marx's closest collaborator and worked with him on several studies and publications. He was a German philosopher and social scientist who contributed to the development of Marxist theory. Engels was critical of the capitalist system and believed that the exploitation of the working class was unjustifiable. He argued that communism would be achieved through the abolition of private property and the creation of a socialist state. 
Engels believed that democracy was central to the establishment of a socialist state. He stated that communism could only be genuinely democratic, in contrast to capitalist societies, which are democratic only for the privileged few in power. Engels believed that a proletarian revolution would be necessary to establish true democracy in society.
Vladimir Lenin was a prominent Russian revolutionary and the founder of the Soviet Union. He was greatly influenced by Marx's theories, and he adapted them to the Russian context by adding a focus on the role of the party. Lenin believed that a proletarian party should lead the revolution and that the party should act as the vanguard of the working class. 
Lenin's view of democracy was distinct from Marx and Engels, in that he argued that democracy could be manipulated by the ruling class. He believed that the bourgeoisie used democracy to maintain their power and that a proletarian revolution was necessary to establish genuine democracy. Lenin argued that the dictatorship of the proletariat was essential for defeating the bourgeoisie and establishing a socialist state.
Joseph Stalin followed Lenin as the leader of the Soviet Union and played a crucial role in consolidating Communist power in the country. Stalin's philosophy centered around the idea of socialism in one country, which called for the construction of communism in a single country, in this case, the Soviet Union.
Stalin's view of democracy was heavily influenced by Lenin's ideas. He argued that democracy under capitalism only reflected the interests of the bourgeoisie. Stalin further argued that the proletarian revolution would transform the current structure of democracy to ensure the working class's control of power. He believed that democracy had to be a part of the construction of communism, but it had to be controlled by the central government.
In conclusion, the intellectual and political activities of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were critical in shaping communism's philosophy and the establishment of socialist states. These leaders' beliefs about democracy were central to their vision of a classless, egalitarian society. In their view, bourgeois democracy was only an illusion that facilitated the capitalist class's domination over the working class. They believed genuine democracy could only be achieved through the dictatorship of the proletariat, which would ensure that the working class controlled the political system. Thus, these thinkers contributed significantly to the development of communism, and their ideas continue to influence socialist movements around the world.
