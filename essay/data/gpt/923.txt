Myocardial infarction (MI), also commonly known as a heart attack, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2019, over 120,000 deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom (UK). The treatment of MI involves reperfusion, or the restoration of blood flow to the blocked coronary artery. Effective reperfusion strategies can save lives, limit the extent of myocardial damage, and improve long-term prognosis. However, the accurate identification of successful or failed reperfusion remains a challenge for clinicians. This essay aims to explore the different reperfusion strategies available for treating MI in the UK and discuss the limitations and benefits of using clinical markers, coronary angiography, and ECG monitoring to accurately predict IRA patency and reperfusion. Moreover, it will identify potential factors that may affect the accuracy of these methods.
Reperfusion strategies for MI in the UK can be categorized into two main approaches: pharmacological and mechanical. Pharmacological reperfusion involves the administration of thrombolytic agents to dissolve blood clots obstructing arteries. In contrast, mechanical reperfusion involves the use of catheter-based interventions, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), to open and restore blood flow to the blocked artery. While both approaches have been shown to reduce mortality in MI patients, PCI has become the preferred strategy in the UK due to its superior outcomes (1).
PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the insertion of a catheter into the blocked coronary artery, followed by the inflation of a balloon to open the obstructed artery. A stent may also be implanted to keep the artery open and prevent re-occlusion. PCI is considered the gold standard for reperfusion in MI patients due to its high success rate, rapid restoration of blood flow, and low risk of bleeding complications (2). Indeed, numerous trials have demonstrated the superiority of PCI over thrombolytic therapy in terms of mortality, re-infarction rates, and stroke (3). Therefore, international guidelines recommend PCI as the preferred reperfusion strategy for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) patients, as it has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality (4).
Despite the superior outcomes of PCI, it is not without limitations. The success of PCI is dependent on several factors, such as the duration of symptoms, the extent of myocardial damage, and the location of the blockage (5). Furthermore, the procedural success of PCI is influenced by various patient factors, such as age, comorbidities, and the degree of arterial stenosis (6). In some cases, unsuccessful PCI may lead to thrombus formation, vessel spasm, coronary dissection, or embolization, which can reocclude the artery and exacerbate the MI (7). Therefore, the accurate identification of successful or failed reperfusion is crucial to guide appropriate management and improve outcomes.
Several methods are currently used to identify successful or failed reperfusion in MI patients, such as clinical markers, coronary angiography, and ECG monitoring. Clinical markers, such as chest pain relief, ST-segment resolution, and biomarker kinetics, are commonly used to assess reperfusion outcomes (8). Chest pain relief is subjective and dependent on patient perception and pain tolerance, making it unreliable as a stand-alone marker of reperfusion. Instead, ST-segment resolution on ECG is a more objective marker of reperfusion that reflects the restoration of blood flow to the ischemic region. Indeed, several studies have shown a strong correlation between ST-segment resolution and patency of the infarct-related artery (9). However, ST-segment resolution may be affected by non-ischemic factors, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or pacemaker placement, reducing its accuracy in some patients (10). Furthermore, ST-segment resolution may not be evident in all cases of successful reperfusion, making it an inconsistent marker.
Another clinical marker of reperfusion is the kinetics of biomarkers, such as troponin or creatine kinase levels. These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream following myocardial injury and can be used to assess the extent of myocardial damage. However, the kinetics of biomarkers can be influenced by patient factors, such as the time since symptoms onset, the presence of renal dysfunction, or prior myocardial injury, making them less reliable as standalone markers of reperfusion. Therefore, a combination of clinical markers, including chest pain relief, ST-segment resolution, and biomarker kinetics, is recommended for the assessment of reperfusion in MI patients.
Coronary angiography, the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, is also used to identify successful or failed reperfusion following PCI. Coronary angiography involves the injection of contrast dye into the coronary arteries, followed by visualization of the blood vessels using x-ray imaging. The presence of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade flow of 2 or 3 in the infarct-related artery (IRA) following PCI is considered a marker of successful reperfusion (11). However, the visual interpretation of angiographic images is subjective and may be affected by factors such as individual experience and intra-observer variability (12). Moreover, TIMI grade flow may not always correlate with myocardial perfusion and infarct size, limiting its predictive value.
ECG monitoring is also commonly used to identify successful or failed reperfusion in MI patients. ECG monitoring involves the continuous recording of electrical activity of the heart and the measurement of various parameters, such as QRS complex, QT interval, and T-wave amplitude. The presence of ST-segment elevation on pre-PCI ECG is a marker of the occluded IRA, while the resolution of this elevation post-PCI is an indicator of successful reperfusion (13). However, similar to ST-segment resolution, non-ischemic factors such as conduction abnormalities or medication use can affect ECG findings, limiting its accuracy as a stand-alone marker of reperfusion (14).
In conclusion, reperfusion strategies for MI in the UK can be categorized into pharmacological and mechanical approaches, with PCI being the preferred strategy due to its superior outcomes. The accurate identification of successful or failed reperfusion is crucial to guide appropriate management and improve outcomes. Several methods are currently used to identify successful or failed reperfusion, such as clinical markers, coronary angiography, and ECG monitoring. Clinical markers, such as chest pain relief, ST-segment resolution, and biomarker kinetics, when used in combination, present a reliable marker for reperfusion. However, each of these markers has limitations, including subjectivity, potential for non-ischemic influence, and inconsistency. Of the three markers, angiography is more objective but limited by the subjective interpretation, whereas ECG monitoring is limited by non-ischemic factors. Therefore, using a combination of these markers is recommended for more accurate identification of successful reperfusion. Clinicians should be aware that patient factors, such as comorbidities, time since onset of symptoms, and degree of stenosis, can affect the accuracy of these methods. Further research is required to identify novel markers of reperfusion to improve the outcomes of MI patients.
