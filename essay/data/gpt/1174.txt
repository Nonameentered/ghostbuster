In political philosophy, justice has been an important concept that has been debated for centuries. Two of the most notable approaches to justice are the utilitarian conception of justice and Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness." Although these approaches share some similarities, they have significant differences in their core principles. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the utilitarian conception of justice with Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness," analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and argue whether Rawls's conception of justice is truly a superior alternative to the utilitarian conception or merely a desirable one out of ethical considerations.
Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that seeks to maximize the overall happiness of society. According to utilitarianism, justice is a means to achieve this end. Therefore, justice is fair only if it maximizes overall happiness. In other words, utilitarians believe that justice requires the distribution of goods and resources in a way that maximizes the overall happiness of society. Jeremy Bentham, one of the most prominent utilitarian philosophers, famously said that "the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation." This statement captures the essence of utilitarianism and its conception of justice.
Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness," on the other hand, is a deontological approach which emphasizes fairness and impartiality in the distribution of goods and resources. Rawls begins his work with the idea that justice should be achieved through a social contract that is justifiable to all parties involved. Therefore, Rawls's conception of justice is a product of his hypothetical social contract. Rawls believes that justice requires the fair distribution of goods and resources in a way that is consistent with individual freedom and equality. In his work, Rawls introduces two principles of justice that are fundamental to his theory. These principles are the "principle of equal basic liberties" and the "difference principle." The first principle requires that each individual be granted an equal set of basic liberties. The second principle requires that injustices be allowed when they work to the advantage of the least advantaged members of society.
The utilitarian conception of justice and Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness" have some similarities. Both approaches believe that justice requires the distribution of goods and resources in a way that is fair. Additionally, both approaches recognize the importance of individual freedom and equality. However, the two approaches differ significantly in their core principles.
The utilitarian conception of justice is based on the idea that justice should be used to maximize overall happiness. Therefore, the needs and wants of individuals are not taken into account when determining what is just. For example, a utilitarian might argue that it is just for a wealthy individual to have more resources because he or she will use them to create jobs and boost the economy, thereby increasing overall happiness. This would be justifiable even if the wealthy individual did not need or want those resources. The utilitarian approach emphasizes the idea that what is just is what is best for society as a whole.
In contrast, Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness" emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and equality. Rawls believes that justice requires the fair distribution of goods and resources in a way that is consistent with individual freedom and equality. Therefore, Rawls's approach takes into account the needs and wants of individuals. Rawls believes that what is just is what is fair to all individuals.
One of the strengths of the utilitarian conception of justice is that it focuses on the overall happiness of society. The utilitarian approach seeks to create a society that is as happy as possible. This means that utilitarians are willing to sacrifice the needs and wants of a few individuals if it means increasing overall happiness. Additionally, the utilitarian approach has the advantage of being practical. It provides a clear and concise way of determining what is just.
However, there are also several weaknesses with the utilitarian conception of justice. One of the main weaknesses is that it can be difficult to measure overall happiness. Additionally, the utilitarian approach is vulnerable to the criticism that it can be used to justify atrocities if they increase overall happiness. For example, a utilitarian might argue that it is just to enslave a group of people if it means that overall happiness is increased. This would be considered unjust by most people.
The strength of Rawls's conception of justice is that it emphasizes fairness and impartiality in the distribution of goods and resources. Rawls's approach recognizes the importance of individual freedom and equality. Additionally, Rawls's approach has the advantage of being able to address inequalities in society. Rawls's difference principle requires that injustices be allowed only when they benefit the least advantaged members of society. This means that Rawls's approach seeks to create a fair and just society for all individuals.
However, there are also several weaknesses with Rawls's conception of justice. One of the main weaknesses is that it is difficult to determine how to reconcile conflicts between the two principles of justice. Additionally, Rawls's approach has been criticized for being too idealistic and lacking a practical application.
In conclusion, the utilitarian conception of justice and Rawls's conception of "justice as fairness" both provide important approaches to justice. The utilitarian approach emphasizes the overall happiness of society and provides a practical way of determining what is just. Rawls's approach emphasizes fairness and impartiality in the distribution of goods and resources and recognizes the importance of individual freedom and equality. However, both approaches have their weaknesses. The utilitarian approach is vulnerable to the criticism that it can be used to justify atrocities if they increase overall happiness. Rawls's approach has been criticized for being too idealistic and lacking a practical application. Overall, while Rawls's conception of justice may be a desirable alternative to the utilitarian conception from an ethical standpoint, it is debatable whether it is a truly superior alternative in practice.
