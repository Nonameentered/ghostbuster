The experience of having a family member hospitalized can be an extremely stressful and traumatic event. The Stacy family was no exception to this. Their daughter was hospitalized due to complications from a chronic illness, and the family faced a number of stressors during this time. This essay will discuss the stressors that the Stacy family faced while their daughter was hospitalized, and how they coped with them. Additionally, this essay will explore the Neuman Systems Model and how it can be applied to the Stacy family's experience.
The Stacy family's experience began when their daughter was admitted to the hospital due to complications from a chronic illness. One of the first stressors that they faced was financial strain. The hospitalization resulted in unexpected medical bills, which put a strain on the family's finances. The stress of having a sick child and struggling to pay bills was overwhelming.
Another stressor that the Stacy family faced was the emotional strain of having a child in the hospital. They were worried about their daughter's health and prognosis, and they had to struggle with feelings of helplessness and anxiety. They also had to deal with the fear of losing their child, which was a source of constant distress.
The Stacy family also faced logistical stressors. They had to balance their daily responsibilities with the need to visit their daughter in the hospital. This meant juggling work, school, and other commitments while still managing to be present for their daughter. The constant pressure on their time and energy was overwhelming, and they struggled to prioritize their responsibilities.
Additionally, the Stacy family faced social stressors. They were concerned about how their daughter's hospitalization would affect their relationships with family and friends. They had to manage the emotional reactions and support of others while still dealing with their own feelings.
To cope with these stressors, the Stacy family turned to each other for emotional support. They leaned on one another and shared their feelings openly. They also sought support from friends and family members who could offer emotional and practical help. Additionally, they made use of resources provided by the hospital, such as social work services and support groups.
The Neuman Systems Model is a theoretical framework that can be used to understand and assess the impact of stressors on individuals and families. According to this model, individuals and families exist within larger, interconnected systems, and stressors in one area can affect all areas of the system. The model consists of three interacting elements: the client or patient, the environment, and the health care provider.
In the Stacy family's case, the client or patient was their daughter who was hospitalized. The environment was the hospital and the stressors associated with hospitalization, such as financial strain and emotional distress. The health care provider was the hospital staff who provided medical care and emotional support.
The Neuman Systems Model can be applied to the Stacy family's experience by examining the interactions between these three elements. For example, the emotional distress experienced by the Stacy family was not just a result of their daughter's hospitalization, but also a result of the environment of the hospital. This environment was stressful and unfamiliar, which contributed to the overall emotional strain.
Additionally, the health care provider played a critical role in helping the Stacy family cope with the stressors they faced. The hospital staff provided medical care for their daughter, as well as emotional support and resources to help the family cope with the financial and emotional stressors they faced.
In conclusion, the Stacy family faced a number of stressors while their daughter was hospitalized, including financial strain, emotional distress, logistical pressures, and social concerns. To cope with these stressors, the family relied on each other for support and sought resources from the hospital and their social networks. The Neuman Systems Model provides a framework for understanding the interactions between the client, environment, and health care provider, and can be applied to the Stacy family's experience to better understand the impact of stressors on individuals and families.
