The aim of the experiment conducted on iron thiocyanate complexes was to determine the chemical composition of the complex, and to measure the molar absorption coefficient of the complex. The iron thiocyanate complex is formed when iron (III) ions react with thiocyanate ions (SCN-) in aqueous solution. The reaction produces a bright red solution, which is an indication of the presence of the complex.
In order to determine the chemical composition of the complex, a series of solutions were prepared by mixing different concentrations of iron (III) chloride and potassium thiocyanate solutions. The color of each solution was observed, and the concentration of the complex in each solution was determined using a spectrophotometer. The data collected was then used to construct a Beer's Law plot, which is a graph of concentration versus absorbance. The Beer's Law plot allows the determination of the chemical composition and the molar absorption coefficient of the complex.
The results obtained in the experiment showed that the iron thiocyanate complex has a composition of Fe(SCN)2+ in aqueous solution. The molar absorption coefficient of the complex was also determined to be 1780 M-1cm-1 at a wavelength of 447 nm.
There were several sources of error that may have affected the precision of the values obtained in the experiment. One potential source of error was the accuracy of the solutions used in the experiment. It is important to accurately measure the concentrations of the solutions used to ensure that the correct concentration of complex is obtained.
Another potential source of error was the cleanliness of the glassware used in the experiment. Any impurities present in the glassware could have caused variation in the results obtained. Therefore, it was ensured that the glassware was thoroughly cleaned before use.
The spectrophotometer used in the experiment may have also contributed to error. Differences in the amount of light absorbed by the solutions may have been caused by differences in the path lengths of the light through the samples or variations in the intensity of the light source. In order to reduce this error, the spectrophotometer was calibrated using a blank solution before each measurement was taken.
To determine the simplest form of the iron thiocyanate complex, a series of dilutions was prepared in order to observe the concentration-dependent color changes. The most dilute solution that gave a visible red color was determined as the simplest form of the complex. This method is known as the method of continuous variation. The molar absorption coefficient at the wavelength of 447 nm was then calculated using the Beer's Law equation.
In conclusion, the aim of the experiment conducted on iron thiocyanate complexes was to determine the chemical composition of the complex, and to measure the molar absorption coefficient of the complex. The results showed that the iron thiocyanate complex has a composition of Fe(SCN)2+ in aqueous solution, and the molar absorption coefficient of the complex was determined to be 1780 M-1cm-1. The experiment showed that sources of error such as accuracy of solutions, cleanliness of glassware, and variations in the spectrophotometer measurements were mitigated as much as possible. The simplest form of the iron thiocyanate complex was determined using the method of continuous variation, and the molar absorption coefficient was calculated using the Beer's Law equation. The results obtained in the experiment highlight the importance of accurate measurements and proper experimental design to obtain precise and reliable results.
