The proposed framework for a peoples' law tribunal on health violations in UNMIK-administered IDP camps suffered by the Roma community in Kosovo is aimed to provide justice, accountability, and remedies to the victims and survivors of the said violations. The Tribunal will be composed of legal and health experts and will operate independently from UNMIK and other government entities.
The Tribunal's political vision is to address the structural and systemic discrimination and marginalization experienced by the Roma community in Kosovo by exposing and condemning the health violations committed against them. Its strategies include conducting thorough investigations, collecting and analyzing evidence, hearing testimonies from witnesses and survivors, and making recommendations to the relevant authorities for policy reforms and reparations.
The Tribunal also aims to raise public awareness, educate the Roma community about their rights, and empower them to demand justice and accountability. It also seeks to support the efforts of civil society organizations and international human rights groups in advocating for the protection of the Roma community and the promotion of their fundamental human rights.
