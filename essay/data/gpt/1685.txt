Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the hand is a common and debilitating condition, with symptoms ranging from swelling, stiffness, and pain to loss of movement and grip strength. Patients with RA of the hand often require a combination of exercise and splinting treatments to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. However, the success of these treatments depends largely on patient adherence and engagement with their healthcare provider. This essay will examine the experiences and attitudes of patients with RA of the hand towards their exercise and splinting treatment regimes, as well as their levels of clinic attendance. It will also explore what this new knowledge can tell us about how healthcare provision can be improved for this patient population.
Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the benefits of exercise and splinting as treatment options for RA of the hand. Exercise, in particular, has been shown to improve hand function, range of motion, and grip strength, as well as reducing pain and inflammation in the joints. Splinting can also help to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and protect the joints from further damage. Patients who adhere to their recommended exercise and splinting regimes are likely to experience fewer symptoms and a better quality of life overall.
However, despite the potential benefits of these treatment options, many patients struggle to maintain the recommended regime. In a study by Tierney et al. (2016), patients with RA of the hand reported a range of barriers to exercise and splinting adherence. These included pain, fatigue, lack of motivation, forgetfulness, and difficulty fitting the exercises and splints into their daily routines. Patients also reported feeling frustrated and discouraged when they did not see immediate improvements in their symptoms. These barriers highlight the need for healthcare providers to take a patient-centered approach when prescribing exercise and splinting regimes, tailored to each individual's needs and preferences.
Moreover, the same study found that patients who did not follow their advised regimes did not attend clinic appointments as often as those who did. This raises the question of the relationship between clinic attendance and treatment adherence. One possible explanation is that patients who attend clinic appointments regularly are more motivated and engaged with their healthcare provider and are therefore more likely to adhere to their recommended treatment regime. On the other hand, those who do not attend clinic appointments may feel disconnected from their healthcare provider and less confident in their ability to manage their condition independently.
However, there may be other factors influencing clinic attendance, such as accessibility or lack of information about the importance of regular check-ups. By identifying and addressing these factors, healthcare providers can improve patient engagement and provide more effective treatment options for patients with RA of the hand.
In terms of patient experiences and feelings about treatment regimes, it is important to consider the impact that RA of the hand can have on daily life. Patients with RA of the hand may experience not only physical symptoms but also emotional and social difficulties, such as feeling isolated or stigmatized. They may also struggle with the practical challenges of performing daily tasks – such as washing, dressing, cooking, or working – which can affect their independence and self-esteem.
Given these challenges, it is important for healthcare providers to offer holistic support, incorporating not only medical treatment but also emotional and social support. Patients may respond positively to interventions such as support groups, counseling, or occupational therapy, which can help them to overcome practical and emotional barriers to adhering to their treatment regime.
Finally, this new knowledge about patient experiences and attitudes towards treatment regimes can be used to improve healthcare provision for patients with RA of the hand. One possible approach is to use patient-centered care, in which the patient's preferences, needs, and values are placed at the center of treatment decisions. This can involve tailoring treatment regimes to suit individual patients, providing regular check-ins to monitor progress, and offering emotional support alongside medical treatment.
Another approach is to use technology to support patient self-management, such as mobile apps or telehealth consultations, which can help patients to track their progress, receive guidance and feedback, and connect with healthcare providers remotely. By using these innovative tools, healthcare providers can help patients to stay engaged and motivated with their treatment regime, while also reducing the burden of clinic visits and improving access to care for those who face physical or logistical barriers.
In conclusion, patients with RA of the hand face a range of challenges in adhering to their exercise and splinting treatment regimes, as well as in attending clinic appointments. However, by understanding these challenges and addressing them through a patient-centered approach to care, healthcare providers can improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for these patients. By incorporating technology and emotional support alongside medical treatment, providers can help patients to stay motivated and engaged with their treatment regime, and to overcome practical and emotional barriers to effective management of RA of the hand.
