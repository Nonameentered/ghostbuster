Methyl oleate and methyl stearate are two unsaturated and saturated fatty acid methyl esters, respectively. Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to unsaturated molecules to form saturated molecules. The experimental procedure used to hydrogenate methyl oleate to form methyl stearate involves the use of a catalyst and hydrogen gas. This essay will discuss the experimental procedure used to hydrogenate methyl oleate to form methyl stearate, the differences in physical properties observed between the two compounds using thin layer chromatography, the challenges faced during the experiment, and the conclusions that can be drawn from the results.
Firstly, the experimental procedure used to hydrogenate methyl oleate to form methyl stearate involves the use of a catalyst and hydrogen gas. The catalyst used in this experiment is palladium on carbon (Pd/C). The hydrogen gas is bubbled through the solution of methyl oleate and Pd/C catalyst. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux with vigorous stirring for a period of time. Hydrogenation occurs when the double bonds in the methyl oleate are broken and hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule to form methyl stearate. The reaction can be represented as follows:
Methyl oleate + Hydrogen â†’ Methyl stearate
The reaction is exothermic and can generate heat. Therefore, the reaction mixture needs to be protected from oxygen, which can react with the catalyst to deactivate it. The products are then isolated from the reaction mixture by a rotary evaporator and analyzed by thin layer chromatography.
Secondly, thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to analyze the differences in physical properties between the two compounds, methyl oleate and methyl stearate. TLC is a technique used to separate organic compounds on a thin layer of silica gel. The molecules are separated based on their polarity, with polar molecules moving slower up the plate than nonpolar molecules. In this experiment, the TLC plate was coated with a thin layer of silica gel, and the analysis was performed using hexane as the mobile phase. The spots were visualized using an iodine chamber, and the Rf values of the two compounds were calculated. The Rf value is the ratio of the distance traveled by the compound to the distance traveled by the solvent.
The TLC analysis revealed that methyl oleate was less polar than methyl stearate. This is because methyl oleate is an unsaturated molecule with a double bond, while methyl stearate is a saturated molecule with no double bonds. The Rf value of methyl oleate was greater than the Rf value of methyl stearate, indicating that it moved further up the plate than methyl stearate.
However, it is essential to note that TLC is only capable of providing limited information about the molecular structure of the compounds. To gain more comprehensive insights into the physical and chemical properties of the two compounds, other techniques such as infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography can be employed.
Thirdly, the challenges faced during the experiment included controlling the rate at which the hydrogen gas was bubbled through the reaction mixture and ensuring complete conversion of methyl oleate to methyl stearate. If the hydrogen gas was bubbled too quickly, the reaction mixture could easily overheat, resulting in further unwanted chemical reactions. Additionally, if the conversion of methyl oleate to methyl stearate was not complete, impurities could be present in the final product, leading to inaccurate results.
Finally, from the results obtained in the experiment, it can be concluded that the hydrogenation of methyl oleate to form methyl stearate was successful. The physical properties of the two compounds were different, with methyl oleate being less polar than methyl stearate. However, to obtain more accurate results and more comprehensive information on the molecular structures of the two compounds, more advanced techniques such as gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy can be employed. The challenges faced during the experiment can be addressed by carefully controlling the rate at which the hydrogen gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture and ensuring complete conversion of methyl oleate to methyl stearate.
