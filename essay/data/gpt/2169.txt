Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy tells the story of Agamemnon's family, focusing primarily on his children, Orestes and Electra, and the characters surrounding their epic struggles for justice and revenge. Throughout the three plays - Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides - Aeschylus employs vivid and highly symbolic imagery to explore themes of motherhood, justice, and revenge. In this essay, I will analyze Aeschylus' use of imagery to represent these themes, and explain how they contribute to the overall impact of the Oresteia.
The theme of revenge is central to the Oresteia, and Aeschylus employs powerful imagery to represent it. Revenge is a particularly strong force in the first play, Agamemnon, where the entire story revolves around Agamemnon's murder at the hands of his wife, Clytemnestra. Aeschylus uses a range of poetic devices, such as similes and metaphors, to create striking images that portray the destructive nature of revenge. In the opening scene, the Watchman describes the wrath of the gods as something that "drives swift Orestes like a hound from a pack" (Agamemnon 19-20). Here, the image of Orestes as a hunting dog trailing his prey creates a sense of inevitability and ominousness that grips the audience. This sense of doom is further heightened when the Chorus invoke the "song of vengeance," comparing it to "the eyes of a sharp-bladed sword" (Agamemnon 230-232). This image effectively conveys the dangerous and volatile nature of revenge.
Later in the play, after Clytemnestra has killed Agamemnon, she demands that her son, Orestes, be brought to her so that she can kill him too. Orestes then consults with the Chorus, and they present him with the haunting image of the "furrow" that splits the earth, saying that "when the blood of the slaughtered falls upon the ground, it cries for the blood of the slayer" (Agamemnon 1383-1385). Here, Aeschylus uses the image of the furrow to represent the cycle of violence and the inevitability of retribution. The metaphor compares bloodshed to a plow that digs a deep and unbridgeable chasm, underlying the idea that revenge creates a permanent gulf between people that cannot be mended. These powerful images contribute to the overall sense of tragedy and inevitability that pervades the Oresteia, bringing home the human cost of revenge.
The theme of justice is another important element in the Oresteia, and Aeschylus uses a range of symbolic imagery to represent it. The play raises complex questions about what constitutes justice and how it can be achieved, and Aeschylus uses metaphors and similes to explore these issues. In The Libation Bearers, Orestes is described as being in the grip of the "Erinyes," the avenging Furies, who pursue him after he has killed Clytemnestra. Aeschylus uses highly evocative imagery to describe these fierce goddesses, comparing their appearance to "hellish snakes" with "eyes that drip with blood" (Libation Bearers 736-740). These terrifying images convey the inescapable nature of justice and the horror of confronting one's own guilt.
Similarly, in The Eumenides, Aeschylus employs a range of powerful images to represent the idea of justice. The play centers on the trial of Orestes for matricide, and the Furies are transformed into the Eumenides, or "Kindly Ones," as a result. Aeschylus uses a range of metaphors to describe the transformation, such as "wings of night have turned to wings of gold" (Eumenides 279-280), suggesting that justice is a transformative force that has the potential to move from darkness to light. The image of the balance of justice, with its "two sails hanging from a single beam" (Eumenides 745-746), highlights the notion of equilibrium and impartiality, suggesting that true justice must be equally weighted and balanced. These images reflect Aeschylus' deep understanding of the elusive and deeply personal concept of justice, and his use of symbolic imagery serves to deepen our understanding of the complexity of the human condition.
Finally, motherhood is a powerful theme in the Oresteia, and Aeschylus employs a range of vivid and somber images to represent it. The figure of Clytemnestra in particular embodies the potent and complex relationship between motherhood and revenge. Aeschylus uses a range of symbols to represent her conflicted character, from her epithets as the "lioness" (Agamemnon 1402) and the "female dragon" (Agamemnon 200) to her famous speech about birthing her own "anger-child" (Agamemnon 1399). These powerful images convey both the fierce protectiveness of the mother, as well as her capacity for destruction and violence. The play goes further, suggesting that Clytemnestra's thirst for revenge is driven by her self-perceived role as a mother. As she attempts to justify her actions to the skeptical Chorus, she speaks at length about the horrors of childbirth and the sacrifices that mothers must make for their children. "I slew my husband," she says, "because he slew my child" (Agamemnon 1399). This tragic image of the aggrieved mother, who feels her primordial bond with her child has been violated, conveys the overwhelming force of maternal instinct, and undermines easy distinctions between good and evil.
In conclusion, Aeschylus' use of imagery is a central element of the Oresteia, and serves to enhance our understanding of the themes of revenge, justice, and motherhood. The author's powerful descriptions of the forces that create the complex and tumultuous world inhabited by his characters are a testament to his skill as a writer, and serve to deepen our appreciation of the Oresteia's enduring impact. By employing vivid and symbolic images, Aeschylus creates a world that feels both mythic and deeply human, drawing us into the struggles of his characters and leaving us with an abiding sense of the the forces that shape and propel our own lives.
