Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. It is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the joints, resulting in joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. One of the most commonly affected areas of the body is the hand. Patients with hand RA experience persistent pain, reduced grip strength, and limited hand function, which in turn negatively impact their quality of life. Occupational therapists (OTs) play an essential role in the management of hand RA by prescribing exercise programs and splinting regimes to reduce pain, improve mobility and enhance function. This essay aims to explore the experience of patients with hand RA, who undergo exercise programs and splinting regimes prescribed by OTs, and factors that influence their adherence to the treatment. Additionally, this essay describes how a naturalistic, phenomenological research approach can be utilized to explore these questions, including data collection methods such as semi-structured interviews, participant diaries, and researcher diaries. It outlines the ethical considerations involved in conducting this type of research and how participant consent and confidentiality will be addressed.
Experience of Patients with Hand RA
RA is a chronic disorder that requires long-term management, and patients with RA face significant challenges managing their daily activities. Hand RA patients encounter numerous impairments that affect productivity, increasing their risk of emotional distress, and worsening their well-being. OTs help alleviate some of these symptoms by prescribing exercise programs and splinting regimes to improve function, decrease pain, and ultimately increase participation in daily activities to improve the patient's overall well-being. Patients with hand RA, who regularly engage in prescribed exercise programs, report a significant decrease in hand pain, swelling, and an increase in hand grip strength and function. OTs tailor exercise programs and splinting regimes to individual patients' needs, taking into consideration factors such as occupational and social activities, physical function, pain level, and extent of joint involvement. However, it is essential to understand the specific factors that influence patients' adherence to the prescribed exercise programs and splinting regimes to optimize their benefits.
Factors Influencing Adherence to Treatment
Patient adherence to prescribed treatment varies and can be influenced by various factors, including those associated with the patient, the disease, or treatment. In the case of hand RA, factors that influence adherence to the exercise program and splinting regime prescribed by OTs include pain, fatigue, motivation, and the presence of comorbidities. Pain is the most distressing symptom experienced by patients with hand RA, and it can discourage patients from adhering to prescribed treatment. It is also a significant factor in delayed diagnosis of the disease, which worsens patient outcomes. Additionally, fatigue, another common symptom of RA, can also decrease motivation and make one feel less likely to comply with the regimen. Furthermore, other comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation, can further increase the symptom burden and hamper the patient's ability to actively engage in prescribed exercise programs. Therefore, identifying and understanding patients' unique circumstances and challenges is crucial to ensure that they adhere to the prescribed treatment plan.
Naturalistic, Phenomenological Research
To understand the experience of patients with hand RA and their adherence to prescribed exercise programs and splinting regimes, a naturalistic, phenomenological research approach can be adopted. The approach is useful in investigating the subjective experience of patients by examining their lived experiences directly. It involves data collection methods such as semi-structured interviews, participant diaries, and researcher diaries. The qualitative data obtained from naturalistic, phenomenological research can provide valuable insights into patients' experience, their perspectives, and their adherence to the prescribed regimen.
Semi-structured interviews are one of the primary data collection methods used in naturalistic, phenomenological research. These interviews allow the researcher to explore patients' experiences in-depth, understand their challenges with hand RA, and identify factors that influence their adherence to the treatment regimen. The use of open-ended questions in semi-structured interviews allows for a more detailed exploration of patients' experience, and it allows patients to express their feelings and experiences without limitations.
Participant diaries are also valuable data collection tools in naturalistic, phenomenological research. Patients can document their experience with the prescribed treatment regimen regularly. Diary entries can provide significant insight into patients' daily challenges, adherence, treatment-related concerns, and achievements. Patients can also provide feedback on specific aspects of treatment that are particularly challenging or beneficial.
Furthermore, researcher diaries are another critical data collection tool that can be used to keep track of the researchers' observations, including insights and thoughts about the research process, interactions with patients, and any challenges encountered during the study. The use of researcher diaries helps in reflexivity and assists in maintaining a researcher's awareness and sensitivity to ethical considerations.
Ethical considerations
The ethical dimensions of research with human participants require careful attention. In naturalistic, phenomenological research, ethical considerations involve balancing the benefits and risks of conducting the research with patients' interests and well-being. A vital aspect of ethical research is obtaining informed consent from all participants to conduct the study. This process requires researchers to provide clear and understandable information about the study's purpose, design, risks, benefits, and the procedures involved. Researchers must provide an avenue for study participation and withdrawal that does not harm participants. It is important that researchers ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participant's response by maintaining confidentiality in the handling of personal data. The use of pseudonyms, coding, and secure storage of data are ways to maintain participant confidentiality. The researcher must also ensure that the data is used exclusively for research purposes and do not harm participants.
Conclusion
Patients with hand RA experience numerous impairments that negatively impact their well-being, from decreased grip strength and pain to limited hand function. Occupational therapists play a vital role in managing the symptoms of hand RA by prescribing exercise programs and splinting regimes that address patients' specific needs. The adherence to prescribed treatment can be challenging and influenced by factors that include pain, fatigue, and motivation. A naturalistic, phenomenological research approach can help explore the experience of patients with hand RA, including factors that influence treatment adherence, using data collection methods such as semi-structured interviews, participant diaries, and researcher diaries. Ethical considerations are central to the study's design, particularly obtaining informed consent from participants, maintaining privacy and confidentiality of the data, and ensuring no harm to the patient participants. The insights gained from this study can help enhance the quality of care of patients with hand RA by tailoring treatment approaches to individual patient needs, increasing adherence to treatment, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
