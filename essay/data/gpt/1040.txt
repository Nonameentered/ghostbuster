The "knowledge argument" is a philosophical concept put forth by Frank Jackson in response to Physicalism, which is the belief that everything in the world is physical and can be explained through the laws of physics. The knowledge argument highlights the idea that there is a difference between physical knowledge and theoretical knowledge. It questions whether the physicalist view is sufficient to explain consciousness and mental states. In this essay, we will delve deeper into Jackson's knowledge argument, his use of Mary and Fred as examples, Nagel's argument and Dennett’s criticism of the idea of Qualia.
Jackson's knowledge argument can be understood through the example of Mary. Mary is a scientist who has complete knowledge of the physical world. She knows everything there is to know about the physical properties and workings of the brain. However, Mary has never experienced the sensation of seeing the color red. She has only ever seen black and white. According to physicalism, Mary should be able to understand fully the experience of seeing red by analyzing its physical components. Jackson contends that there is a gap here, between Mary's physical knowledge and her qualia or subjective experience of seeing the color red. There is something it is like to experience the color red, that is unavailable to Mary's physical knowledge.
Later, Jackson also used the example of a man named Fred. Fred has a brain implant that allows him to see in infrared. He has never experienced this form of sight before. Thus, he knows everything about this physical state, but the qualia of seeing infrared is something he doesn't know. The knowledge argument points to the subjective nature of experience, which cannot be fully captured by physicalism.
This is an important argument to consider because it challenges the reductionist view of physicalism. The argument suggests that physicalism does not capture the essence of subjective experience, which poses a serious problem for theories that aim to explain consciousness and mental states as purely physical phenomena. The knowledge argument shows that there is an irreducible, subjective component of experience that cannot be explained away by purely physical properties.
Nagel's argument differs from Jackson's in a few ways. Nagel asserts that there's something it is like to be a bat. That is, the subjective experience of being a bat must exist, regardless of our ability to ever fully understand or replicate it. Nagel argues that we will never be able to fully understand what it is like to be a bat or any other conscious being simply through physical analysis. This is because subjective experience exists outside of the physical realm and cannot be captured solely by physical data. Nagel's point is that the physicalist worldview is incomplete. Representations of the physical world can't fully encapsulate the subjective experience of conscious beings.
While Nagel's argument shares similarities with Jackson’s regarding the subjective nature of experience, it differs in that Nagel focuses specifically on the limitations of physicalism when applied to conscious beings, while Jackson's argument is more general and not solely focused on conscious beings. Nagel suggests that subjective experience is an important, perhaps essential, aspect of what it means to be conscious, and that we can't capture that with physical measurements alone.
Dennett's criticism of the concept of qualia focuses on the idea that the knowledge argument itself assumes that subjective experiences cannot be observed through the physical world. Dennett argues that subjective experience is something that arises from the physical world rather than being an independent phenomenon. In other words, Dennett contends that the gap between physical knowledge and subjective experience is not as large as Jackson's argument suggests. Dennett suggests that qualia are simply the byproduct of the brain's neural processing, and that they do not necessarily exist outside of the physical realm. For Dennett, subjective experience can be explained through physical processes such as neural firing and patterns of activity within the brain.
Dennett's objection to qualia is one of the strongest criticisms of the knowledge argument. He posits that there is no need to invoke the idea of a separate, non-physical realm of experience in order to explain subjective experiences. Dennett's theory suggests that conscious experience is simply a reflection of the physical functioning of the brain, without any separate "qualia" that exist outside of the physical realm.
In conclusion, Jackson's knowledge argument challenges physicalism by pointing to the subjective nature of experience, which cannot be captured through physical analysis alone, and provides examples such as Mary and Fred to illustrate this point. Nagel goes further in suggesting that subjective experience is an essential aspect of conscious beings. Dennett, on the other hand, argues that there is no reason to assume that subjective experience exists outside of the physical realm and can be explained by understanding physical processes in the brain. These differing perspectives contribute to an ongoing debate regarding the relationship between physical properties and subjective experience, and the ability of physicalism to fully capture the phenomena of consciousness.
