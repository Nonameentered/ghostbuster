Introduction
Children spend a significant amount of time watching television shows and movies nowadays. The content of these media either being violent or non-violent can have an immense impact on the social and behavioral development of children. The relationship between viewing aggression on television/film and aggressive tendencies in children has been a concern for many years and research has been conducted to support or dispute this claim. This essay aims to explore the extent to which this relationship is supported by research. It will also examine the various methodologies used by researchers and evaluate whether or not concern over this issue is justified.
Link between Viewing Aggression and Aggressive Tendencies in Children
Several studies have been conducted over the years to examine if exposure to aggression on television and in movies leads to aggressive behavior in children. A study by Huesmann and Moise (1996) found that children who view violence on TV tend to be more physically aggressive than those who do not. This study was conducted with over 800 children and followed their lives for over 15 years. The study found that individuals who had a high exposure to violence on TV showed more aggressive tendencies than those who did not.
Similarly, a study by Robinson, Weaver, and Zillmann (1996) found that children who were exposed to violent television shows were more likely to show negative attitudes towards their peers and physical aggression. The study conducted a meta-analysis of several studies and found that violence on television had a consistent and long-lasting effect on children’s aggression. Even children who were exposed to violent content at a young age showed more aggressive tendencies as they grew older compared to those who were not exposed to such content.
Huesmann and Moise’s (1996) study also suggests that exposure to media violence can lead to a desensitization to violence which, in turn, can lead to an increase in aggressive tendencies. This desensitization occurs when viewers become numb to the violence they see on TV and shows decreased sensitivity to the negative consequences of aggression. This decreased sensitivity can lead viewers to engage in aggressive behavior without considering the potential harms it can cause.
Methodologies of Studies
Despite the abundance of research studies on the topic, there are discrepancies in the methodologies used. Some researchers use self-report questionnaires to gather data from children about their attitudes and behaviors in regards to aggression. Others use observational studies to measure actual aggressive behavior. There is also a discrepancy in the amount and type of television programs that children are exposed to.
The reliability of self-report questionnaires can be problematic as children may not always be truthful about their attitudes and behavior towards aggression. This could be due to social desirability or reluctance to admit to negative behavior. Observational studies, on the other hand, can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct but provide more reliable data on actual aggressive behavior. However, these studies can also sometimes be criticized for lacking ecological validity as the laboratory settings in which the studies take place may not be representative of real-life situations.
In terms of the types of programs and quantity of media exposure children are subjected to, this can also vary greatly between studies. Some studies have focused only on violent cartoons or movies, whilst others have included all programs containing violent content. This variability can make it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions from the data.
Justification for Concern
Despite the different methodologies used, there are consistent findings across studies that exposure to violent content on television and in movies has effects on children’s aggressive tendencies. Desensitization to violence, coupled with negative attitudes towards peers, can cause a long-lasting impact on the social and behavioral development of children. These behaviors can manifest themselves in different ways, including physical aggression towards peers or family members and increased antisocial behavior.
Furthermore, with the rise of streaming services, children now have access to an unprecedented amount of media content. As a result, parents’ ability to monitor what their children watch has decreased. This lack of monitoring may lead to an increase in exposure to violent media content and, therefore, an increase in aggressive tendencies. Children’s typical developmental stage can also exacerbate this problem as they tend to mimic what they observe in their daily routines.
Conclusion
The relationship between viewing aggression on television or in movies and aggressive tendencies in children is supported by research. Various studies have shown that children exposed to violent media content are more likely to exhibit negative attitudes towards peers and physical aggression. While the methodologies used in these studies can differ, there is a consistency in the findings that support the relationship between viewing aggression and aggressive behavior in children.
Therefore, the concern over this issue is justified as the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content can have lasting consequences on children’s social and behavioral development. Parents, educators, and policy makers must work together to identify appropriate measures to protect children from the negative effects of media violence. This can include parental monitoring of the media children watch, media education programs in schools, and stricter regulations on the amount and type of violent content available for children. It is important that children’s exposure to media content is moderated carefully to ensure that children can grow and develop in a safe and healthy environment.
