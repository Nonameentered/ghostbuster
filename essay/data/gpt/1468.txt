George Orwell, a renowned British writer, is recognized for his masterpieces, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Both these novels are considered as one of the most significant literary works of the 20th century. His work reflects his deep understanding of the political and social issues of his era. These novels portray a vivid and terrifying picture of a dystopian society that is under the control of a totalitarian government. The power of dictatorial government is enforced through the manipulation of language. George Orwell, through his novels, highlights how language can be used as a tool to manipulate people and control them. This essay will explore how George Orwell uses language as a method of control in Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four.
Animal Farm is a classic example of how language can be used to manipulate and control people. The novel describes how the pigs, who are the ruling class, use language to deceive and manipulate the other animals on the farm. The pigs use language as a tool to maintain their power and control over the other animals. They manipulate the language by constantly changing the meanings of particular words, making it difficult for the other animals to keep up. The pigs always seem to have an explanation for their actions, even when they contradict themselves. 
One of the significant examples of this manipulation of language is seen when the pigs justify their decision to take over the farm. The pigs use the term "Animalism" to describe their ideology and use it to justify their actions. They convince the other animals that their rule is based on equal rights for all the animals, and by obeying the pigs, they are working for the greater good of the animal community. The pigs claim to be the representatives of the animal community, and the other animals are misled into following their lead.
Another significant example of how language is used as a method of control in Animal Farm is seen during the re-education of the animals. The pigs use a propaganda technique known as "re-education" to impose their ideas on the other animals. The pigs use slogans and phrases that are repeated over and over again to control the thoughts of the animals. The animals are made to believe that the pigs' beliefs are the only right ones, and any deviation from them is considered wrong. 
A classic example of how language is used as a tool to manipulate people is seen when the pigs change the commandments that they had established. The pigs change the commandments from "No animal shall sleep in a bed" to "No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets". The pigs manipulate the language to deceive the other animals into thinking that they are not breaking the commandments, and in doing so, they create a loophole for themselves. This manipulation of language is a tactic that is used throughout the novel to exert control over the other animals.
Nineteen Eighty-Four is another of George Orwell's masterpieces that depicts the use of language as a tool for control. The novel is set in a dystopian society where the government is all-powerful and controls every aspect of people's lives. The novel describes a society where language is used as a means of controlling the thoughts, emotions, and actions of individuals.
In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the government has created a new language known as "Newspeak". Newspeak is a language that is designed to limit the range of thought among the people. The government uses Newspeak to control people's thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. In the novel, Newspeak is portrayed as a language that is designed to eliminate the possibility of expressing dissent or rebellion against the government. 
One of the significant examples of the use of Newspeak is seen when the government replaces words that have negative connotations with words that are positive. For instance, the word "bad" is replaced with the word "ungood". The word "bad" is replaced because it encourages critical thinking and creates negative emotions in people. "Ungood" is a word that does not carry a strong negative meaning, and therefore, it creates less of an emotional response in people.
Another example of the use of language for control in Nineteen Eighty-Four is seen when the government replaces complex words with simple ones. The government asserts that complex words can be misleading and create confusion. The government replaces complex words with simple words that have clear meanings. This limits people's ability to think and express themselves in a complex manner as they are given a limited vocabulary to work with.
In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the government also uses slogans to manipulate people's thoughts and emotions. One such example is seen in the slogan "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength". The slogan is a clear example of how language can be used to manipulate people's thoughts and emotions. The slogan is designed to make people believe that war will bring about peace, that freedom is not desirable, and that ignorance is a source of strength. 
In conclusion, George Orwell has effectively used language as a means of control in both Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. The novels show how language can be used to manipulate people's thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. The use of slogans, propaganda, and the manipulation of language are all tactics that are used to exert control over people. These novels serve as a warning to society about the dangers of a totalitarian government and the power of language to control people's thoughts and beliefs. Orwell's work emphasizes the need for individuals to be vigilant and to question the information that is presented to them. Orwell's work serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of free speech and the right to dissent in a healthy democratic society.
