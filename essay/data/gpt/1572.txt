Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right; however, inequalities exist in healthcare access and outcomes even in developed countries like the UK. This essay examines the factors that contribute to inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes in the UK, and how they reflect the history of the National Health Service (NHS) and healthcare in Britain.
Firstly, socio-economic factors play a crucial role in healthcare inequalities. People from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases, making them more likely to need healthcare assistance. Unfortunately, these groups have a limited understanding of the factors that contribute to good health, including healthy diet, exercise, and preventative healthcare measures such as immunisation. Moreover, people in lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to have access to health education, limiting their knowledge of healthcare treatments and interventions.
Another significant factor that contributes to healthcare inequalities in the UK is the inequalities in distribution of healthcare professionals. People living in remote areas or deprived areas of the country may struggle to access timely medical attention due to a lack of availability of healthcare professionals. For example, rurally located areas of the UK often have fewer healthcare professionals per 1000 population than urban areas.
Furthermore, there is a significant ethnic and cultural impact on healthcare inequalities. A lack of bilingual or culturally sensitive healthcare can lead to misunderstandings between patients with minorities and medical professionals resulting in an inadequate dispensation of care or poor patient outcomes. Specifically, research has found that people of color are more likely to receive poorer quality of care and experience delays in treatment than white individuals. This is due to language barriers, institutional discrimination, and implicit biases in healthcare.
The disparities in healthcare outcomes between different income groups, geographical locations, and ethnic backgrounds reflect the history of the NHS and healthcare in Britain. The NHS has been instrumental in making healthcare a universal right for every British citizen regardless of their income by providing free healthcare services since its establishment in 1948. However, the NHS was created primarily to treat acute illnesses rather than chronic diseases. This exclusionary approach meant that long-term healthcare provision was not heavily funded until later years, leading to poorer healthcare outcomes for people suffering from chronic diseases, which are most present in lower socio-economic backgrounds.
Furthermore, the way healthcare is provided in the UK historically reflects the cultural and ethnic preferences of the white, middle-class mainstream. This overlooks the culturally-specific health needs of minority groups, leading to underrepresentation of minority groups in the healthcare system. This negligence of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the UK's populace is fuelled by institutional racism, reducing access to healthcare for minorities, leading to poor healthcare outcomes and a disparity in healthcare access across demographic groups.
In conclusion, healthcare inequalities exist in the UK, and the factors behind them are multi-faceted. Socio-economic factors, geographical location, and ethnic disparities all play a crucial role in access to healthcare in this country. To eradicate healthcare inequality, healthcare policymakers must recognise these issues in public health policymaking and address the institutional biases in the healthcare system. They could achieve this by implementing culturally sensitive healthcare, strengthening the link between socioeconomic status and healthcare, addressing the inadequacies in healthcare distribution and determining the causes of geographic inequalities in healthcare. Only by fixing these issues can the country's healthcare system provide fair and just healthcare for all citizens of the UK.
