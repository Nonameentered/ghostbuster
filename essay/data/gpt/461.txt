In order to enable organisms to interact with the environment and respond to stimuli, cells have developed a complex array of signalling mechanisms. These mechanisms involve the transmission of signals across the cell surface membrane and the activation of intracellular pathways that ultimately lead to a physiological response. The senses – sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch – are prime examples of how cells use signalling mechanisms to respond to external stimuli. Each sense uses a different set of cellular mechanisms to process the signals it receives and convert them into a physiological response that can be interpreted by the brain. 
Sight is the sense that allows us to perceive light and colour. It relies on the cells in the retina of the eye, specifically the photoreceptor cells – cones and rods. Cones are responsible for colour vision, while rods are responsible for detecting light in low light conditions. The initiation of a visual signal begins when photons of light enter the eye and are absorbed by the photopigment, a protein molecule located in the outer segment of the photoreceptor cells. Light absorption causes a conformational change in the photopigment, that activates a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cascade. The activation of GPCRs in turn leads to an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and the opening of cGMP-gated ion channels in the outer segments of the photoreceptors. The opening of these channels leads to a decrease in the intracellular calcium levels, hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, and subsequent signal transmission to the bipolar cells which then pass the information to the ganglion cells, which forms the optic nerve and finally sends the signal to the brain. In this way, the initial activation of the photoreceptor cells leads to amplification, with a single photon initiating a cascade that causes the release of neurotransmitters that stimulate the bipolar and ganglion cells. Termination of the signal occurs when the cGMP-gated ion channels close, which depolarizes the membrane potential of the photoreceptors and causes the release of glutamate from the synaptic terminals. Glutamate then stimulates the horizontal cells and inhibitory amacrine cells, which modulate the signal and prevent overactivation of the bipolar cells. Overall, the signalling mechanisms involved in sight are complex and multifaceted, with a precise balance between activation, amplification and termination required to enable the brain to receive a clear and accurate image.
Hearing is the sense that enables us to perceive sound waves. The hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear are responsible for detecting these sound waves. Sound waves are transmitted through the air and cause vibrations in the tympanic membrane in the ear. These vibrations are then transmitted to the ossicles, which amplify the signal and then transmit it to the oval window, where the vibration of the stapes initiates wave-like motions of the basilar membrane. The motion of the basilar membrane causes the sensory hair cells, which are located on the organ of Corti located on the basilar membrane, to bend. This bending causes mechanotransduction channels on top of the hair cells to open and allow calcium ions to flow into the cells. The increase in calcium levels leads to the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, which activate the afferent nerve fibers that carry the signal to the brain. The activation of these nerve fibers leads to the amplification of the signal, with the vibratory energy being converted into an electrical signal that can be interpreted by the brain. The termination of the signal occurs when the stimulation of the hair cells ends, and the influx of calcium into the cell ceases. Overall, the signalling mechanisms involved in hearing are dependent on the precise physical movement of air molecules and the highly sensitive hair cells in the ear. The activation and amplification of the signal rely on the mechanotransduction channels to convert the physical stimulus into an electrical signal that can be transmitted to the brain.
Smell is the sense that enables us to detect and identify a vast range of chemicals in the environment. The olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity are responsible for detecting these chemicals. Each olfactory receptor cell has a single type of olfactory receptor protein, that responds to a different set of odorants. When an odorant molecule binds to a receptor protein, a G protein-coupled receptor cascade is initiated, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP levels opens cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, allowing calcium and sodium ions to enter the cell, causing depolarization of the membrane potential, and triggering action potentials in the olfactory receptor cells. The activation and amplification of the signal rely on the highly sensitive, specific receptor proteins and the cascade of intracellular events following the binding of an odorant. Termination of the signal occurs due to the desensitization of the receptor, where the continuous presence of the odorant leads to the receptor becoming unresponsive to the stimulus.
Taste is the sense responsible for detecting and distinguishing between different flavours. This sense is dependent on the chemoreceptor cells in the taste buds of the mouth and throat. There are five types of taste receptors that respond to different stimuli: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Each type of receptor uses a different set of mechanisms to detect its specific stimuli. For example, the sweet receptors use a GPCR to bind to a ligand and activate the G protein, leading to the activation of the enzyme adenylate cyclase and the generation of cAMP. This leads to the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and the release of a neurotransmitter to signal to the sensory neurons. The amplification and termination of the signal in taste buds rely on the precise activation of the receptor proteins by specific ligands and the downstream pathways that lead to the depolarization and release of neurotransmitters.
Touch is the sense responsible for detecting the pressure and temperature of objects in the environment. The sensors that are responsible for touch are the mechanoreceptors located in the skin and the temperature receptors located both in the skin and internally. The mechanoreceptors are classified into four types: Merkel cells, Meissner corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, and Ruffini corpuscles, each group responds to different types of stimuli. The activation of mechanoreceptors involves the mechanical deformation of membrane-linked channels on the cell surface, leading to the opening of ion channels and the depolarization of the membrane potential. The depolarization leads to the generation of action potentials, which are then transmitted to the brain. The amplification of the signal in touch relies on the precise activation of the mechanoreceptors by mechanical stimuli, while the termination of the signal occurs when the stimulus is removed and the channels close.
In conclusion, the senses rely on an intricate network of cellular signalling mechanisms to detect and interpret stimuli in the environment. While the specific mechanisms involved in each sense vary, some general principles can be drawn. Activation, amplification, and termination are all integral parts of these mechanisms, and a precise coordination between them is required for the sensory system to function correctly. Each sense uses a specific set of receptor cells to detect the stimulus, and these receptors are characterised by their specificity and sensitivity to particular stimuli. The strength of the response is then amplified by intracellular signalling events that enable the transmission of the signal to the brain. Finally, termination occurs as a result of a desensitization of the receptors or the removal of the stimulus. Overall, the signalling mechanisms of the senses provide a fascinating example of how cells can detect and respond to external stimuli in highly specific and specialised ways.
