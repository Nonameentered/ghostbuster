Immanuel Kant, the celebrated German philosopher of the 18th century, was fascinated by human faculties of reason and imagination, distinguishing them for their respective intellectual capacities. For Kant, the imagination has its limits when it comes to apprehension of magnitude and dynamics of objects. He argues that these can be better understood by the faculty of reason as imaginative representation is not sufficient for grasping the sublime. In this essay, I will explore Kant's arguments on reason, imagination, and their respective roles in apprehension of the mathematical and dynamic sublimes. Further, I will analyze Kant's solution to the problem of measuring extension and the limitations of his proposed method of measuring magnitude. I will also consider Kant's views on infinity and its relation to human faculties. Finally, I will explore Kant's definition of true sublimity.
Kant begins by presenting an important distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge. Empirical knowledge is derived from our senses, whereas a priori knowledge is independent of sensory experience. Mathematics, according to Kant, falls in the latter category. Mathematics is the study of abstract concepts such as numbers, shapes, and geometries and the relations between them. Kant argues that our ability to apprehend these abstract concepts is not due to our senses but because of the faculty of reason. Reason, for Kant, refers to our intuitive ability to understand the necessary and universal truths that cannot be perceived through any sensory experience.
Kant believed that the mathematical sublime is beyond the capabilities of imagination and can only be apprehended through reason. According to Kant, imagination is bounded by our empirical experience and is incapable of representing concepts beyond the realm of experience. Kant describes the mathematical sublime as "that which is great even beyond our capacity for a presentation of the sensible." (Kant, Critique of Judgment) He further notes that the mathematical sublime cannot be apprehended through the senses, nor can it be adequately represented by the imagination.
Kant's notions of the dynamic sublime are also closely related to his view of reason's superiority over imagination. The dynamic sublime refers to objects or events that are powerful and exhibit enormous potential for vast destruction or creation. Kant believed that the power of objects can be so overwhelming that it produces in the observer a sense of fear and awe, an experience which is beyond the capacity of the imagination. He noted that the dynamic sublime is related to the sublime of nature and the sublime of art, which can be experienced only by the faculty of reason.
Kant's ideas about measuring extension, space, and magnitude are closely linked to his views on the mathematical sublime. According to Kant, space is an a priori concept that provides the framework for the possibility of experience but it doesn't have any real existence outside our minds. Kant distinguishes between the two different kinds of magnitude: extensive magnitude, which is measurable and is used to measure the size or length of a physical object, and intensive magnitude which is measurable but is not used to measure size or length, rather it is used to describe degrees or intensities of qualities like color or sound.
Kant's proposed solution to measuring extensive magnitude was through the aesthetic method. The aesthetic method involves the introspective analysis of the subjective experience of the object. Kant believed that the aesthetic method is the only way to measure the magnitude of an object, as the sense of magnitude is subjective and cannot be measured mathematically. The aesthetic method, for Kant, is based on the subjective feeling of pleasure or displeasure while observing an object. He believed that the sense of awe and respect that an object inspires, or the sense of terror or fear that it evokes, can be used to measure the magnitude of the object.
Despite its advantages, the aesthetic method has its limitations. It is dependent on the subjective experience of the observer and varies from person to person. Also, the aesthetic method is not applicable to certain objects that do not evoke a sense of pleasure or displeasure, such as a mathematical formula.
Kant's views on infinity are also closely related to his view of reason's superiority over imagination. He argued that the concept of infinity is beyond the capacity of the imagination, and it is only through the faculty of reason that we can understand the idea of infinity. Kant believed that reason can think of infinity but cannot directly represent it, whereas imagination can only represent finite objects but not infinite ones. Kant noted that our innate sense of the sublime is related to the concept of infinity, and it can only be experienced through the faculty of reason as the imagination is incapable of representing it adequately.
Kant defines true sublimity as a feeling or experience that arises when we are confronted with something that is beyond our comprehension or understanding. This feeling can be either pleasurable or painful and is entirely subjective. Kant believed that true sublimity is only experienced through the faculty of reason, as the imagination is incapable of representing it. He notes that the sense of sublimity arises not from the object itself but from the observer's experience of it. It is a reflection of the observer's inner self and their mental state.
In conclusion, Kant believed that reason is superior to imagination when it comes to apprehending the mathematical and dynamic sublimes. For Kant, reason is not limited by our empirical experience and can grasp concepts beyond the limits of imagination. Kant's views on measuring extension and magnitude are closely linked to his views on the mathematical sublime. His proposed solution to measuring the magnitude of objects was through the subjective experience of the aesthetic method, which had its limitations. Kant's ideas about infinity suggest that it is a concept beyond the limit of imagination, and it can only be understood through the faculty of reason. Finally, Kant's definition of true sublimity emphasizes the subjective experience of the observer and their mental state while experiencing the sublime.
