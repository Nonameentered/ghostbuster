One of the primary concerns in international commercial contracts is the choice of law rules. In general, parties to these contracts seek an efficient and predictable legal framework that will govern their transactions. Traditionally, the state's laws have been the go-to choice for many businesses. However, in recent years, several non-state commercial codifications have emerged that provide an alternative system of law-making for international commercial contracts. Nonetheless, proponents and detractors have waged an ongoing debate on whether non-state commercial codifications should be recognized as a legal option for choice of law rules or not. In this essay, I will explore the limitations of party autonomy, the difficulty in identifying the content of non-state norms, concerns about infringing public policy, and the state's authoritative position as the monopoly on law-making in order to arrive at a conclusion on the issue.
To begin with, party autonomy is the first limitation of non-state commercial codifications. Although parties have a great deal of freedom and flexibility in choosing the governing law – a principle known as the “party autonomy” – it is unclear if non-state commercial codifications do indeed reflect parties' mutual intentions. It is questionable that a non-state commercial codification, established by a private organization or body, can completely comprehend the aims and objectives of the contracting parties. Parties make their case for the specific state law due to its predictability and stability, since it provides well-established rules of legal interpretation, and, as such, it is easily understood and enforced. Therefore, non-state commercial codifications may not be able to offer the same level of predictability and legal certainty as state laws. For instance, the “United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods” is widely accepted and recognized in international commercial contracts due to its predictability of outcomes if the parties' jurisdictional and national origins are different.
Apart from the limitation of party autonomy, identifying the content of non-state norms remains challenging. Ultimately, non-state commercial codifications have been developed internally whereby the parties involved in the commercial contract do not participate in the law-making process. It is entirely different than law-making procedures in the state, where laws are made after a lengthy and thorough consultation process with the stakeholders and the public. In the case of non-state commercial codifications, the content of the rules may not explicitly reflect the interests of relevant stakeholders, such as consumers, the public, and regulatory institutions. When these stakeholders' interests are not considered in the law-making within a commercial contract, adverse outcomes from these documents can arise.
Another concern about non-state commercial codifications is that they may infringe on public policy. State law is the product of an elaborate discourse with public institutions, researchers, practitioners, stakeholder communities, and elected representatives. As a result, state laws often reflect the fundamental principles of public policies that the state aims to achieve. For example, private contracts are barred from including provisions that violate anti-discrimination laws, antitrust laws, and environmental laws. In contrast, non-state commercial codifications may not adhere to public policies as rigorously; as a result, there is a risk of including provisions that can be construed to be contrary to public policy.
Finally, the state's authoritative position as a monopoly on law-making remains an issue concerning the recognition of non-state commercial codifications. States have a right and an obligation to legitimately fulfill the duty of law-making for their citizens. The international legal system is based on the principle that nation-states have the power to create and interpret laws within their jurisdictions. This power is particularly significant in terms of international commercial contracts. States have developed various types of laws influencing commercial contracts. Some of them include international private law, contract law, consumer protection law, anti-trust law, and intellectual property law. As a result, state laws govern international commercial contracts because of the need for predictability, stability, and certainty.
In conclusion, the debate on whether non-state commercial codifications should be recognized as a possible option for choice of law rules in commercial contracts or if state laws should continue to be the go-to option is ongoing. Even though non-state commercial codifications may provide an alternative legal framework for businesses, there are concerns about party autonomy, identifying the content of non-state norms, infringing public policy and the state's authoritative position as a monopoly on law-making. Similarly, state regulations have been developed to provide stability, predictability, and legal certainty in international commercial contracts.
From a personal perspective, I believe that the recognition of non-state commercial codifications should continue. However, it should be done within a regulated framework rather than in complete disregard of established law-making processes. This framework should guarantee that all stakeholders' interests, including consumer protection and public policies, are taken into account. It should also require a comparative analysis of state laws and non-state commercial codifications to ensure that non-state commercial codifications do not infringe on public policies. Even though state law will continue to play a critical role, non-state commercial codifications can provide an opportunity to improve the existing legal framework in international commercial contracts.
