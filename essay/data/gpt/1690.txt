The theme of grief is one of the most fundamental and universal topics in human literature. Many poets have explored the emotions of loss and the challenges of coping with the death of a loved one. Two such poets, Ben Jonson and John O'Callaghan, have taken different approaches in presenting grief in their respective poems using different verse structures. Jonson's "On My First Son" uses regular rhyme, while O'Callaghan's "Funeral Scene" employs free verse. This essay examines how each poet's verse structure impacts the presentation of grief, the emotions conveyed, and the overall effectiveness of the poem as a means of exploring the theme of loss.
"On My First Son" is a poem written by Ben Jonson that explores the poet's grief over the loss of his son. The poem follows a strict rhyme scheme and iambic pentameter, which adds a sense of order and stability in the poem. The predictable nature of the rhymes also creates a sense of closure that is appropriate for a poem about mourning. The poem begins with an exclamation of grief, with the poet lamenting the loss of his son. However, the regular rhyme structure of the poem soon brings a sense of calm and order to the poem. This serves to present grief as an incredibly intense and emotional experience that is ultimately contained and manageable.
The poem's regular meter also creates an effect of balance, which is reinforced by the poem's central message. The poet ultimately recognizes that his son's death is part of a larger cycle of life and death and accepts the inevitability of his son's passing. He realizes that his grief must be tempered by a sense of perspective and that he must find comfort in the belief that the child is in a better place.
Contrastingly, "Funeral Scene" by John O'Callaghan, uses a free verse structure that employs no pre-determined meter or rhyme scheme. This structure serves to emphasize the raw emotions of the poem's speaker, who is grappling with the loss of a loved one. The free verse structure is particularly effective in conveying the sense of chaos, confusion, and lack of control that comes with the devastating loss.
Unlike Jonson's poem, "Funeral Scene" does not attempt to provide any sense of closure or balance to the emotions it conveys. Instead, it presents grief as a chaotic and unpredictable experience, one that is impossible to contain or control. The poem begins with fragmented images that are either too painful to voice fully or too disorienting to organize coherently. The disjointed nature of the poem's imagery serves to create a sense of confusion and loss that mirrors the speaker's emotions.
The poem's free verse structure also adds a sense of breathlessness and urgency to the poem. The longer lines and unpredictable pattern convey a sense of urgency, which speaks to the deeper emotions behind the loss. The poem's betrayal of traditional forms reflects the shattered expectations of the speaker's prior life, adding to the overall effect of weighty emotions and loss.
Another way in which O'Callaghan's poem contrasts with Jonson's poem is in its overall message. O'Callaghan offers no platitudes or consolations for the grief of the speaker. Instead, he portrays grief as a natural response to loss that is necessary for healing, emphasizing the inevitable pain that comes with death.
Although Jonson's poem ultimately arrives at a place of acceptance and peace, it is important to recognize that the poet's path to this place was not an easy one. At first, he is at a loss on how to deal with his grief, asking, "Will man lament the state he should envy?" and stating that his child was too good for this world. Jonson's ultimate message, therefore, is similar to that of O'Callaghan's in that both poets acknowledge that grief is a natural response to loss and that there is no shame in expressing it.
Finally, it is important to examine how each poet's use of verse structure affects the overall tone of the poem. In "On My First Son," Jonson's use of a regular meter and rhyme scheme creates a poetic formality that speaks to the depth of the poet's emotion while adding a sense of stability and order. Meanwhile, O'Callaghan's free verse structure in "Funeral Scene" creates a sense of rawness and immediacy, conveying the turbulent emotions that accompany grief.
In conclusion, the verse structures used in "On My First Son" and "Funeral Scene" both present grief as complex and multifaceted experiences that resist easy categorization. The regular rhyme structure of Jonson's poem creates a sense of order and formality that speaks to the depth of the poet's emotion, while O'Callaghan's use of free verse structure heightens the vulnerability and rawness of the speaker's emotions. Both approaches serve to acknowledge that grief is a natural response to loss and that there is no shame in expressing it in whatever form it takes. Ultimately, both poems offer a moving exploration of the fragility of life, the pain of loss, and the power of poetry to transform these emotions into artistic expression that can help us cope.
