Introduction
The case of Sergei Konstantinovitch Pankejeff, who is commonly known as the “Wolf-Man,” is one of the most famous cases in the history of psychoanalysis. The Wolf-Man approached Sigmund Freud for treatment with severe anxiety and depression, which he believed had its roots in a traumatic childhood experience. Through his use of psychoanalytic techniques, Freud worked with Wolf-Man to uncover the unconscious motivations behind his behaviors and experiences. In this essay, we will examine the psychological condition of Wolf-Man according to Freud and psychoanalytic theory, analyze the role that his dreams played in interpreting his childhood experiences and the extent of success in curing him, and also discuss modern biomedical approaches to mental health and how they differ from psychoanalysis in treating patients like Wolf-Man.
The Psychological Condition of Wolf-Man according to Freud
According to Freud, Wolf-Man experienced a severe case of neurosis that had its roots in his childhood. The neurosis, according to Freud, was the result of a repressed childhood memory involving a traumatic experience. Wolf-Man, when he was four years old, witnessed a scene involving his parents having sex through a keyhole. This experience had a profound effect on him, and he felt that he had been castrated as a result of seeing the scene. The repressed memory had led to a series of symptoms that manifested later in his life, such as intense anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.
Freud suggested that the scene had triggered feelings of castration anxiety, which is a common issue among young boys. During this stage of development, boys fear that they may be castrated as punishment for sexual impulses, which might lead to an inability to reproduce. In the case of Wolf-Man, the anxiety caused by seeing the scene through the keyhole had been repressed, leading to a series of behaviors that were trying to avoid this anxiety. Freud suggested that Wolf-Man's obsessive-compulsive behaviors were a way of repressing the anxiety he felt about the scene, while his depression and anxiety were the result of his inability to confront the memory and its implications.
Treatment of Wolf-Man using Psychoanalysis 
Freud's technique for treating patients of psychoanalytic treatment involved a process called the “talking cure.” During this process, the patient would talk about their experiences, and the therapist would listen and provide a free-associative interpretation of the patient's words. This was meant to help uncover the unconscious motivations behind the patient's behaviors and experiences. In the case of Wolf-Man, Freud used psychoanalysis to connect the various symptoms that Wolf-Man had experienced to the childhood trauma of witnessing his parents having sex.
Through psychoanalysis, Freud was able to identify the repressed memories of the keyhole incident and the feelings of castration anxiety that it had triggered in Wolf-Man. Freud also discovered that Wolf-Man had a recurring dream, which he called his “dream of the wolves.” In this dream, Wolf-Man would be in his bed, and a pack of wolves would appear outside his window. The wolves would break in and attack him, biting him in his genital area. This dream was clearly related to his childhood trauma, as he saw the episode through a keyhole, which would have framed the event in a similar way as the wolves outside his window.
In analyzing the dream, Freud suggested that the wolves represented the parents in the keyhole incident, with the bite signifying the traumatic experience of castration anxiety for Wolf-Man. By interpreting the dream, Freud was able to help Wolf-Man understand the repressed memory of the keyhole incident and its implications for his later life. Freud used the process of free association to help Wolf-Man connect the memory of the keyhole incident to his symptoms.
Success Rates of Treatment 
In the end, Freud was unable to “cure” Wolf-Man completely. The treatment did help, however, as Wolf-Man was able to come to terms with the memory of the keyhole incident and its implications. While he never completely resolved his castration anxiety, he was able to reduce his symptoms of anxiety and depression. It has been suggested that Freud was not wholly successful because he focused too much on the repressed memory, and did not fully explore other aspects of Wolf-Man's life that may have contributed to his anxiety and depression. However, it is important to note that Freud was not working with Wolf-Man for the primary purpose of curing his anxiety and depression but was instead trying to help uncover and analyze the unconscious factors behind his symptoms.
Modern Biomedical Approaches versus Psychoanalysis 
Modern biomedical approaches to mental health differ from psychoanalysis in several ways. Instead of focusing on unconscious motivations, modern biomedical approaches tend to diagnose and treat specific symptoms through the use of medication and behavioral therapies. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac are used to treat depression by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Similarly, cognitive-behavioral therapy is used to treat anxiety disorders by helping patients identify and change negative patterns of thinking and behavior.
Unlike psychoanalysis, which tends to focus on uncovering and interpreting hidden meanings behind symptoms, biomedical approaches use empirical evidence to identify the specific causes of disorders and use targeted treatments to alleviate specific symptoms. While some critics argue that biomedical approaches can be reductionistic and fail to take into account the complexity of human experience, advocates for these approaches point out that they are effective at treating specific symptoms and have the benefit of being based on empirical evidence.
Conclusion 
The case of Wolf-Man provided an opportunity for Freud to demonstrate the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatment of neuroses. By uncovering the repressed memory of the keyhole incident and interpreting the recurring dream of the wolves, Freud was able to help Wolf-Man understand the unconscious motivations behind his behaviors and symptoms. While Freud was not entirely successful in curing Wolf-Man's neurosis, he made a significant contribution to the history of psychoanalysis by developing the process of free association and demonstrating how psychoanalytic treatment can be used to uncover unconscious motivations. The successful treatment of Wolf-Man opened up a new way of thinking about mental health disorders, and principles of psychoanalysis continue to have a significant influence on the understanding and treatment of psychological disorders today. However, modern biomedical approaches to mental health, with their focus on specific symptoms and evidence-based treatments, represent a significant departure from the tradition of psychoanalysis and reflect the evolution of our understanding of the causes and treatments of mental health disorders.
