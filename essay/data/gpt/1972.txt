Introduction 
The red fox, Vulpes vulpes, is one of the most common mammals in the British countryside and is found in both urban and rural areas throughout the country. Though generally seen as a favourite by some, the fox has become quite problematic, particularly in terms of its pest status. The issue of fox control through both lethal and non-lethal means sparks a considerable degree of disagreement, both among scientific circles and the general public. This essay will examine the pest issues associated with red foxes in rural and urban areas of Britain, and how they should be considered separately in terms of control methods. Moreover, it will demonstrate how the perceived pest status of foxes is overestimated, particularly in relation to predation on livestock. Finally, the essay will discuss the impact of fox predation on free-range poultry farming in the UK and the measures that can be taken to mitigate losses.
Pest issues of red foxes in rural and urban areas
The red fox is widely distributed throughout Great Britain, with populations found in both rural and urban areas. In urban areas, the fox population has increased dramatically over the past few decades (Baker, 2018). They are generally attracted to areas with plenty of food resources and shelter. However, they have also become a significant problem in rural areas, where they have been known to kill free-range chickens, and small livestock, such as lambs, rabbits, and game.
Foxes have been associated with pest issues in both rural and urban areas. In the countryside, foxes have been known to prey on game birds, young lambs, and free-range chickens. They have also been known to kill hares, rabbits and small ground-nesting birds, which have led to conservation concerns for these species. At the same time, foxes have been identified as rabies vectors and are susceptible to various diseases, including mange, which can be passed on to other animals as well as humans. They can also carry parasites, such as ticks and fleas, which can lead to illnesses, such as Lyme disease, and transmit them to other animals and humans (Anon, 2022a).
In urban areas, foxes have been linked to problems such as noise, house damage, fouling, and the risk of disease transmission. They can also pose risks to public health and safety, particularly when they scavenge in areas where there is waste food or when they have direct contact with people and pets (Anon, 2022b). In addition, foxes have been known to cause damage to gardens and property. For instance, they can dig up lawns, dig holes in gardens, and cause damage to fences, sheds, and bins.
Differentiating pest control methods in urban and rural areas
The control of foxes in both rural and urban areas is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving wildlife professionals, landowners, and local authorities. The most effective control method is one that considers the specific setting and can adapt measures accordingly.
In rural areas, the killing of foxes has been considered to be the most effective method of control, especially for livestock farmers. This is because foxes are known to be significant predators of young lambs and poultry, especially in the lambing season and when hens are left to free-range (Baker, 2018). Lethal control methods include using snares, trapping, shooting, and poisoning. However, these practices can be considered cruel and inhumane. They also require significant training and expertise to carry out humanely and efficiently, which may not always be available to farmers (Cole, 2008). Non-lethal measures, such as the use of repellents and habitat management, can be used as an alternative to lethal control methods. These methods aim to reduce the availability of food, shelter, and habitat. In particular, habitat management involves keeping grazing land tidy and cutting down long grass, which can help to reduce the number of food and shelter sources available.
In urban areas, foxes are typically not killed, but are instead managed using non-lethal methods. These methods include habitat modification, exclusion, and feeding deterrents. Habitat modification involves reducing the amount of cover available to foxes by keeping overgrown vegetation at a minimum, removing piles of rubbish and debris that provide shelter, and capping off vulnerable entrances to underground areas. Exclusion methods include erecting barriers to prevent foxes from accessing certain areas, such as gardens or even whole neighbourhoods. Feeding deterrents are used to discourage foxes from approaching homes, garbage bins, and other areas where food is regularly available. These methods include installing bird feeders and other devices that make it more difficult for foxes to access food sources.
Overestimation of the perceived pest status of foxes
The perceived pest status of foxes is often overestimated in both urban and rural areas. The media often portrays foxes as aggressive and dangerous, leading to public fear and over-reaction. Foxes have been blamed for attacking pets and even humans despite a low incidence rate of such events. In fact, it is only in rare cases that foxes have attacked humans (Baker, 2018). In most cases, the reasons for fox aggression are due to illness, injury, or starvation.
It is also frequently claimed that foxes are responsible for significant levels of predation on livestock and game birds. However, in reality, the impact of fox predation on livestock is generally low. A study conducted in the UK found that only a small percentage of lamb deaths were due to predation by foxes. The study revealed that lamb mortality was highest when mothers were too young, weak, or inexperienced, or when they gave birth to multiple lambs (Merino, 2016). Similarly, foxes have been identified as a cause of low numbers of ground-nesting birds mainly in areas where habitat is limited, but not enough to cause significant population declines (Anon, 2022a).
In urban environments, foxes are often blamed for creating a nuisance and health risks. However, studies have shown that the incidence of zoonotic diseases transmitted by foxes is minimal, and the chances of transmission to humans are low (Gleeson, 2010). Moreover, the incidences of property damage attributed to foxes can be minimised by responsible waste management and limiting access to food sources.
Impact of fox predation on free-range poultry farming
In response to fox predation on free-range chicken farming, farmers typically use lethal control methods, such as shooting, poisoning, and trapping, to keep foxes at bay. However, these methods can be both expensive and inhumane, despite being effective in reducing instances of predation. Moreover, killing foxes can also lead to population management issues, particularly in rural areas (Baker, 2018).
Fox predation on free-range poultry farming poses economic risks and impacts the welfare of the flocks and their owners. Studies have shown that even a few losses of chickens can result in significant impacts on the profitability of free-range poultry farms (Gleeson, 2010). Moreover, repeated losses over time can lead to significant reduction in the already small profit margins that free-range farmers operate on.
Mitigation measures
To minimise the impact of fox predation on free-range poultry farming, farmers can employ a range of prevention and mitigation measures. These measures include the provision of secure housing for hens at night, surrounding housing with fencing and the use of electric fencing, and preventing access to other food sources which could encourage and sustain the presence of foxes (Madden, 2016). Another successful method of predator control used on some farms is the deployment of livestock guardian dogs which are specifically bred to protect livestock from predators.
Conclusion
In conclusion, red foxes pose a considerable problem to both rural and urban areas in the UK. They are carriers of diseases, cause property damage and can pose risks to public health and safety. Their impact on livestock is central to the pest status of the animal. However, the perceived pest status of foxes tends to be overestimated and is often based on unsupported claims and misunderstandings. Control methods should be differentiated in urban and rural areas based on the specific setting. In rural areas, lethal control methods are used as a last resort and non-lethal methods such as habitat management are considered more humane. In urban areas, non-lethal methods such as exclusion and habitat modification are preferred. Finally, the impact of fox predation on free-range poultry farming can be mitigated using a range of measures including secure housing, electric and predator proof fencing, and the use of livestock guardian dogs.
