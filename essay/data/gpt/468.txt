The Ottoman Empire, one of the most powerful dynasties in history, reigned supreme for centuries. During its peak that spanned the 16th and 17th century, the empire was one of the most influential political, economic, and military powers in the world that expanded over three continents. Nonetheless, the empire experienced a significant decline in the subsequent years, which led to its ultimate disintegration in 1922. The fall of the Ottoman Empire has been attributed to a combination of internal and external factors, which worked together over time to erode the empire's power and influence. This essay will examine the factors that led to the decline of the Ottoman Empire, highlighting the role of international trade in shaping these dynamics.
The external factors that contributed to the fall of the Ottoman Empire were crucial and broad-ranging. The first significant factor was the emergence of rival empires. In the late 17th century, the rise of Russia as a significant imperial power, coupled with the territorial growth of Austria and the Netherlands, was the start of the Ottoman Empire's decline. These new threats destabilized the Ottoman's economic and political power, shifting the balance of trade and military power within the region. Russia, in particular, presented a severe challenge to the empire after it acquired lands in the Black Sea region, which was the gateway to the Mediterranean.
Another unambiguous impact came from military invasions by various European powers, including France, Great Britain, and Russia. These invasions were born from a significant thirst for power and a need for access to the empire's resources, including land and trade routes. Military defeat at the hands of European powers such as Austria in the 18th century forced the Ottomans to relinquish the title of European superpower and retreat within their borders. As such, the Ottomans' losses culminated in reduced power, influence, and loss of territories and resources necessary for the empire's survival.
Another external factor that contributed to the Ottoman decline was colonization. The Ottomans were unable to stand up against the European colonial machine, which was born from the industrial revolution. The onset of colonization in the region by Russians and British put significant pressure on the Empire's influence in the Middle East and Asia. Furthermore, colonization led to the exploitation of the empire's resources and manpower, which ultimately impeded Ottoman economic growth and development. It's essential to note that these tactics occurred throughout the region, with Egypt and Iran experiencing similar scenarios.
While external factors were significant contributing factors to the Ottoman Empire's decline, internal factors played an equally essential role. One of the key internal factors was the empire's inability to adapt and modernize. The Ottomans were slow to implement necessary reforms that would have boosted their military and economic power. As a result, the empire was left behind in that it lacked innovations that rival nations utilized in their governance and administration.
Another internal factor that resulted in the decline of the Ottoman Empire was corruption and a weak central government. Officials and leaders were more concerned with personal gain than steering the empire towards progress. Such officials would exploit their power and engage in embezzlement, thereby reducing the empire's revenue. This reduced revenue resulted in a lack of finances for the government to develop the economy and military. Furthermore, the lack of a centralized power structure led to low morale among the military and administration and opened the door to exploitation by foreign forces.
The trade routes that traversed the Ottoman Empire had a significant impact on its economic power. Global trade in the early modern period was driven by the transportation of goods through the Mediterranean and Black Sea, passing through the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans' role in global trade enabled them to accumulate a significant amount of wealth, which was essential to the functioning of the empire. However, this same trade also had a negative impact on the Ottoman economy. The empire relied on agricultural exports such as cotton and wheat to generate revenue. Competition from overseas markets such as Britain and the United States put significant pressure on the Ottoman economy. The influx of cheaper products from overseas put local farmers out of business, effectively reducing the empire's revenue. 
Furthermore, the growing reliance on global trade as a source of revenue forced the Ottomans to adopt policies that neglected the local economy's development. The effects were catastrophic in that it resulted in a lack of growth in the empire's domestic production. In contrast, the increased reliance on imports and the decline in exports led to a trade deficit, further weakening their economy.
In conclusion, the decline of the Ottoman Empire was a culmination of external and internal factors that worked together over the centuries to erode the empire's power and influence. External forces such as neighboring empires and colonization, coupled with internal factors such as corruption, lack of modernization, and poor administration, decisively impacted the empire's decline. International trade was a critical aspect, shaping the empire's decline, as the Ottomans' reliance on agricultural exports and global trade put a significant dent in their economy. However, while international trade was crucial, it was only one of the many factors contributing to the decline. Ultimately, it was the lack of adaptability, corruption, and poor governance that left the Ottoman Empire unable to face the challenges of change and progress in the modern world.
