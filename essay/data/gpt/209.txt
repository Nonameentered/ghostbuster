Profit maximization is a critical objective for firms as it represents the ability to generate a return on investment for shareholders and sustain operations. However, the pursuit of profit maximization is not always a guarantee of survival. In highly competitive markets or situations where ownership and control of the firm are separated, the relationship between profit maximization and survival becomes complex and requires a nuanced analysis. This essay aims to explore the relationship between profit maximization and survival for firms and the changes that occur when firms operate in highly competitive markets or under separated ownership and control.
Profit maximization is the main goal of most firms. The ability to generate profits ensures the long-term survival of the firm, increases its value, and creates shareholder wealth. In basic terms, profit maximization means that firms attempt to maximize revenues and minimize costs to achieve optimal profitability. To achieve this goal, firms undertake various activities such as pricing strategies, cost reduction, product differentiation, and market expansion.
Firms strive to maximize profits because of the potential benefits that accrue to shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the company and are entitled to a share of the firm's profits. For example, Apple Inc. announced $57.41 billion in profits in 2020, with shareholders receiving $3.28 per share in dividends. Therefore, it is evident that the profit motive is critical to both the firm and its shareholders.
While the profit motive is essential to firms, the relationship between profit maximization and survival is not straightforward. Competition, which is present in all markets, frequently threatens the survival of firms. In highly competitive markets, firms face increased pressure to lower prices, innovate, and be more efficient to maintain competitiveness. This competition can lead to lower profit margins, which can compromise the firm's survival.
In such situations, firms must balance the pursuit of profits with the need to remain competitive. For example, the airline industry is highly competitive, typified by low-profit margins and intense competition among firms. To survive in such an industry, firms must focus on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and customer service. Despite passenger traffic increasing by 4.3% in 2019, the industry recorded only 1.1% profit margins for that year. In such industries, pricing strategy plays a critical role in determining if a firm can compete effectively.
Pricing strategies are one of the key ways of balancing profit maximization and survival. In highly competitive markets, firms must price their products and services correctly to maximize their survival chances. For example, firms may adopt a low-price strategy to increase demand and volume. Alternatively, they could adopt a premium pricing strategy to differentiate their products and services. Each strategy has its benefits and drawbacks and must be carefully considered based on the firm's competitive position and operational requirements.
However, in a highly competitive environment, firms must exercise caution when employing pricing strategies. Adopting a high price strategy may attract competition, thus eroding margins. Low-price strategies can lead to poor margins, which may result in loss-making operations. Therefore, in highly competitive markets, the pursuit of profit maximization must be moderated by a desire to remain competitive.
In situations where ownership and control of the firm are separated, the relationship between profit maximization and survival becomes more complex. Separation of ownership and control occurs when the owners of a firm elect a board of directors to manage the business. The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the firm's management team, making strategic decisions, and maximizing shareholder value.
However, in some situations, the board of directors may be motivated by other objectives besides profit maximization. For example, the board may focus on furthering their own interests, such as obtaining lucrative employment opportunities, bonuses, or stock options. In such a situation, the pursuit of profit maximization can compromise the survival chances of the firm. This is because the board may prioritize their interests over those of the shareholders, thus leading to poor strategic decisions.
Additionally, when ownership and control of the firm are separated, the separation can lead to a lack of strategic direction. The owners may have different objectives from the board of directors, leading to conflicts over the firm's strategy and direction. This can lead to poor decision-making and a lack of direction, which may result in the firm's collapse.
However, firms can mitigate the risks associated with ownership and control separation by implementing effective governance structures. For example, firms can adopt a dual board structure to separate the supervisory and management functions. Additionally, firms can enhance transparency in their dealings and ensure that there is clear communication between the board of directors and other stakeholders.
In conclusion, profit maximization is critical to the long-term survival of firms as it enables them to create value for their shareholders. However, the relationship between profit maximization and survival is complex and requires careful consideration of various factors such as competition, pricing strategies, and ownership and control structures. In highly competitive markets, firms must balance the pursuit of profit maximization with the need to remain competitive. Additionally, in situations where ownership and control of the firm are separated, firms must establish effective governance structures to mitigate the risks associated with such a situation. Ultimately, the pursuit of profit maximization must be moderated by the goal of ensuring the long-term survival of the firm.
