When examining liquid samples, it is important to collect a representative sample, which can be achieved through homogenization or shaking. Dilution is often necessary when bacterial concentrations are high, and serial dilution can be conducted to achieve a suitable concentration for enumeration. Standard microbiological methods such as plating or filtration followed by growth on culture media can be employed to quantify bacterial numbers.
Similarly, when analyzing samples with high bacterial concentration, dilution is necessary to achieve accurate counts. Additionally, enrichment techniques such as pre-enrichment, selective enrichment, and resuscitation can be beneficial for recovering and identifying low levels of specific bacterial species.
Cream used to make cream cake can be analyzed by various method depending on the type of test required. For example, the amount of fat in cream can be determined by gravimetric methods, and microbial contamination can be detected by conventional plating or alternative methods such as PCR or sequencing.
Factors such as Enterobacteriaceae contamination, cooking, temperature, and storage can significantly affect bacterial counts in food samples. Contamination with Enterobacteriaceae can indicate poor hygiene and handling practices, and can result in significantly higher bacterial counts in food. Cooking and temperature can affect the survival and growth of bacteria, with higher temperatures leading to increased growth and lower temperatures leading to reduced growth or even death. Proper storage can help to prevent bacterial growth, with refrigeration being the most effective method of preservation.
