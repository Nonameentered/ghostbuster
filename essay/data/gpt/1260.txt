Water is an essential resource, and its availability and quality can greatly impact public health and the economy. With global warming, changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather conditions are expected to alter the availability, distribution, and quality of water resources. In semi-arid areas such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, The Mediterranean, and parts of Australia, which are presently water-stressed regions, global warming is expected to further exacerbate water availability and contribute to the emergence or spread of water-related diseases. This essay will discuss how global warming will impact water supplies and water-related diseases in semi-arid areas and highlight various adaptation strategies that can be implemented to mitigate these impacts.
One of the most significant impacts of global warming on water resources is the altered hydrological cycle. With increased temperatures, evapotranspiration rates will rise, leading to reduced soil moisture, lower stream flows, and decreased water availability. In semi-arid areas, which are already water-stressed, reductions in water availability can have serious implications for agricultural production, human consumption, and industrial processes. In North-East China, for instance, the average annual precipitation is already less than 400 mm per year, and with global warming, this region could witness a further decline in water availability by 20-30% by 2050 (IPCC, 2019). This could lead to reduced rice production, decreased industrial activity and increase in water demand for domestic use which could exacerbate existing social and economic disparities.
In addition to reduced water availability, global warming could also compromise water quality. In regions where there is limited availability of clean water, such as the grasslands of Africa, climate change could exacerbate water pollution and contamination. Higher temperatures in these areas could lead to more accumulation of pollutants in water bodies with resulting health implications for humans and animals that depend on such water. These pollutants could have long term implications for the quality of soil, water, and biodiversity. 
Moreover, global warming could contribute to an increase in the spread of water-related diseases in semi-arid areas. Climate change impacts such as changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and extreme weather events create conducive environments for the proliferation of pathogens and their vectors. For instance, in the Mediterranean, changes in temperature and rainfall patterns have been associated with the emergence of diseases like West Nile, Dengue, and Malaria (Dinglasan et al., 2018). These diseases, which are largely spread by insects and arthropods, thrive in environments with increased temperatures and humidity.
In Africa, the emergence and spread of waterborne and vector-borne diseases such as cholera and malaria are already a significant public health concern. With global warming, the incidence and geographical range of these diseases are likely to increase. Higher temperatures could lead to increased evaporation and reduce surface water availability, increasing the likelihood of using contaminated water resources. Furthermore, the increase in temperature could lead to more suitable habitats for disease vectors like mosquitoes, which could lead to an increased transmission of water-related diseases.
Effective adaptation strategies that focus on safeguarding water supplies and reducing the burden of water-related diseases should be a priority in semi-arid regions. In water-scarce regions such as North-East China, water resource management systems should be enhanced to ensure efficient water use. The construction of reservoirs and dams, and water-harvesting structures, targeting small-scale farmers, can lead to improved water availability for agriculture and domestic use. Investing in drip and micro-irrigation systems, for example, can help minimize water wastage in agriculture, leading to more efficient use of water resources. Legislation and policies that are aimed at preventing unregulated access to limited water resources could also promote sustainable water resource use.
Investing in water and environmental security can also help mitigate the impact of global warming on water supplies. For example, water source restoration such as that of wetlands and riparian zones can help improve water retention capacity for shallow groundwater and stabilize fragile ecosystem services. In some African countries, there are community-based wetland conservation programs that have been successful in reducing water scarcity, promoting biodiversity and improving access to clean water for drinking and irrigation.
Furthermore, the impacts of a changing climate on water-related diseases must be addressed by public health interventions. For example, in regions where malaria is prevalent, vector control programs should be ramped up to reduce the number of infection rates. Educational programs targeting vulnerable communities should be implemented to promote regular hand washing, proper sanitation, and efficient water management practices to avoid waterborne diseases. Collaborating with Regional and international partners can help raise the necessary resources to support environmental security and build resilience for these communities.
In conclusion, the impacts of global warming on semi-arid regions such as Africa, North-East China, The Mediterranean, and parts of Australia, are significant and varied. Changes in water supplies, water quality, and the emergence of water-related diseases are just some of the challenges that these regions face. Nevertheless, with a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, targeted interventions that prioritize water and environmental security, and regular monitoring and evaluation of adaptation strategies, it is possible to mitigate these impacts. While there is no one size fits all approach to adaptation, ensuring that initiatives are region-specific, community-centered and enforceable by legislation, can safeguard water supplies and reduce the impacts of water-related diseases in semi-arid areas.
