In a world where economic instability is increasingly becoming the norm, governments are often caught in a dilemma about whether to use stabilisation policies. Stabilisation policies refer to monetary and fiscal policies that are implemented to reduce the severity of fluctuations in economic activity. The main goal of these policies is to achieve economic stability, which entails reducing inflation and unemployment rates, among other things. However, the effectiveness of stabilisation policies has been a subject of debate among economists. This essay provides arguments for and against the use of stabilisation policies in the economy, using examples from the United Kingdom.
Arguments for the use of stabilisation policies in the economy
Proponents of stabilisation policies argue that they are essential in achieving macroeconomic stability. In particular, stabilisation policies help to reduce the severity of economic booms and busts. During economic booms, for example, the inflation rate tends to rise as consumers demand more goods and services than the economy can produce. Stabilisation policies such as raising interest rates, reducing government spending, and increasing taxes can help to dampen demand and stabilize the economy. Similarly, during economic busts, stabilisation policies such as lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and cutting taxes can stimulate demand and prevent the economy from plunging into a recession.
Another argument for the use of stabilisation policies is that they can help to create certainty and predictability in the economy. Uncertainty about future economic conditions can discourage investment and savings, which can further exacerbate economic instability. Stabilisation policies can help to provide a predictable and stable economic environment that encourages investment and savings. For example, in the UK, the government uses fiscal policy to stabilize economic growth and employment by balancing the budget and managing public debt. This creates an environment that encourages private investment and reduces uncertainty.
Finally, supporters of stabilisation policies argue that they can help to improve economic equity and social welfare. Economic instability tends to affect vulnerable groups such as low-income earners and the unemployed disproportionately. Stabilisation policies that reduce economic volatility can help to protect these groups from the negative effects of economic instability. For instance, the UK government uses monetary policy to reduce unemployment rates and support employment growth. This can be seen through various public programs that support job creation and training programs, such as the Apprenticeship Levy.
Arguments against the use of stabilisation policies in the economy
Critics of stabilisation policies argue that they are prone to policy misjudgments, which can exacerbate economic instability instead of reducing it. Policy misjudgments can occur when policymakers respond to incomplete or inaccurate information about the state of the economy. For example, policymakers may raise interest rates in response to inflation that is caused by cyclical factors such as temporary supply disruptions. This can lead to unnecessary economic contraction, which can exacerbate economic instability.
Another argument against the use of stabilisation policies in the economy is that they can lead to unintended consequences, such as excessive inflation or government debt. For example, during the 1970s, the UK government used demand-side stabilization policies to reduce unemployment rates and stimulate growth. This led to a surge in inflation and a decrease in productivity as wages increased faster than productivity. Similarly, during the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government used expansionary fiscal policy, which resulted in a large budget deficit and an increase in government debt.
Finally, some critics argue that stabilisation policies can be short-sighted in nature, focusing on short-term economic growth at the expense of long-term growth. Stabilisation policies often rely on demand-side economic theories, which focus on short-term fluctuations in demand. However, these policies neglect long-term supply-side factors such as technological innovation, education, and workforce development, which are essential for long-term economic growth. This can lead to a situation where the economy becomes stuck in a consumer-driven cycle of boom and bust, without addressing long-term structural economic issues.
Conclusion
In conclusion, stabilisation policies are an essential tool for achieving macroeconomic stability. However, their effectiveness in achieving this goal has been a subject of debate among economists. Supporters of stabilisation policies argue that they help to reduce economic volatility, create certainty, and improve economic equity and social welfare. Critics, on the other hand, argue that stabilisation policies are prone to policy misjudgments, unintended consequences, and can be short-sighted in nature. Ultimately, the effectiveness of stabilisation policies depends on the specific economic circumstances and the policy decisions made by policymakers.
