The concept of modernism emerged as a cultural, political, and scientific movement during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a response to the socio-economic changes brought about by industrialization, urbanization, technological advancements, and new philosophical and artistic movements. Modernism challenged traditional norms and values by seeking a new form of expression that accurately reflected the complexities of modern life. This essay explores the socio-political, cultural, and scientific context of the conception of modernism and how modernism responded to the changes brought about by industrialization, technology, war, and new philosophical ideas. Furthermore, this essay analyzes the portrayal of modernist ideas in the film Metropolis and Lola Lola, and how each film explores the fear of castration and the relationship between gender and technology. Lastly, this essay evaluates the extent to which Marxism espoused modernism and attempted to change social conditions, while providing a critical evaluation of modernism as a movement.
The socio-political, cultural, and scientific context of modernism was influenced by many factors. The unprecedented changes brought about by industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancements led to the emergence of new social classes, which created a sense of alienation and displacement in modern society. This sense of alienation and displacement was also reflected in the new philosophical ideas of existentialism, which questioned the traditional beliefs and values of modern society. Furthermore, the devastation caused by the First World War led to a loss of faith in traditional institutions, and a growing sense of hopelessness and disillusionment. These social, cultural and intellectual changes created a ripe atmosphere for modernism to emerge and to challenge the established norms and values of society.
Modernism responded to the changes brought about by industrialization, urbanization, war, and technological advancements in a number of ways. Firstly, modernism challenged the traditional forms of artistic expression by seeking a new form of art that reflected the complexities of modern life. This led to the emergence of new artistic movements such as cubism, futurism, dadaism and surrealism, which sought to break free from the restrictive traditions of the past. Secondly, modernism emphasized individualism and self-expression over the collective norms and values of society, which challenged the established social order. This led to the emergence of new genres of literature, such as stream of consciousness and modernist poetry that sought to capture the inner lives of individuals. Thirdly, modernism responded to the growing fear of technological advancements by exploring the relationship between humans and machines, and the implications of this relationship for society. This can be seen in the portrayal of modernist themes in works of literature, art, and film.
The film Metropolis is a prime example of how modernism portrayed the fear of castration and the relationship between gender and technology. The film depicts a futuristic society that is divided into two classes - a ruling elite that lives in luxury above ground, and a working-class that lives in poverty below ground. The film explores the relationship between the ruling elites and their machines, and how this relationship led to a dehumanizing effect on workers. The portrayal of machines as dehumanizing, and a threat to the individual and society, is a common theme of modernism. In Metropolis, the relationship between gender and technology is explored through the feminine figure of Maria, who brings about a sensual and spiritual revolution among the workers. The portrayal of Maria as a spiritual figure is in contrast to the dehumanization of the working-class by machines. Therefore, the film portrays modernism's anxieties about the alienating effects of technology on human beings and the potentially liberating role of spirituality.
Similarly, the film Lola Lola explores the fear of castration and the relationship between gender and technology. Lola Lola is a German silent film that portrays the story of a cabaret singer who manipulates men through her sexuality. The film explores the relationship between gender and technology by depicting Lola Lola as a woman with an industrial exterior, but with a warm and sensual interior. The film also explores the idea of female sexuality as a powerful tool for manipulation and self-expression. It portrays modernism's anxieties about the potential for machines to replace authentic human experience with superficial and artificial ones.
Marxism espoused the ideals of modernism, particularly its emphasis on individualism, self-expression, and a new forms of artistic expression. Marxism saw modernism as a way to challenge the established social order, and to create a new society based on equality and social justice. Marxism encouraged artists to embrace modernism as a means of empowering the working class against the ruling class. However, some Marxist intellectuals were critical of modernism, seeing it as a bourgeois movement that privileged the individual over the collective. For example, the philosopher Georg Lukacs, a prominent Marxist thinker, criticized modernist literature for its focus on individualism and experimentation, and its rejection of realism and social engagement.
In conclusion, modernism emerged as a cultural movement during a time of historic social, political, and technological change. Modernism responded to these challenges by seeking new forms of artistic expression, emphasizing individualism and self-expression over the collected norms and values of society, and exploring the relationship between humans and machines. The film Metropolis and Lola Lola are examples of how modernism portrayed the fear of castration and the relationship between gender and technology. While Marxism espoused the ideals of modernism, some Marxist intellectuals were critical of it. Modernism had a profound impact on the cultural, intellectual, and artistic fabric of modern society, which continues to influence the arts even today.
