Deep focus cinematography is a technique used in filming that incorporates the use of a deep space where both foreground and background images are in sharp focus. This technique was popularized by the Hollywood movie director Orson Welles, who used it in his film Citizen Kane. This technique enables a filmmaker to maintain sharp focus on both the foreground and the background simultaneously, which creates a striking three-dimensional effect. Bazin argued that this technique is significant because it allows the audience to see the world as it is, in all its complexity and depth.
Bazin was a French film critic who believed that cinema was a medium of artistic expression that was inherently linked to realism. He argued that cinema could be used to capture reality in its raw form and that this realism that cinema provided is essential for the medium's transformative power. As such, deep focus cinematography was significant because it accentuated the realism of the medium. While other film techniques that were used at the time, such as montage, had a tendency to break down the continuity of space and time, deep focus allowed for a continuity of vision that accentuated the realism of the medium.
Bazin stressed that deep focus is indicative of the way the human eye sees the world. He believed that the human eye, unlike the camera lens, perceives depth in the background and focuses on the foreground and that this is what makes deep focus cinematography unique. By using this technique, film directors can give audiences a more realistic perception of the world. In his article "The Ontology of the Photographic Image," Bazin said: "The essence of the photographic image is to rend asunder the constraints of space and time, to profile things in their absolute contingency, to present them in their existential otherness." Bazin meant that the photographic image, including the film, captures reality in its purest and most objective form.
Although Bazin's arguments are compelling, they have come under intense criticism from those in the film industry who believe that his view of deep focus is an over-statement. Critics have pointed out that only a few elements in any frame can be in focus at any given time. For instance, the human eye cannot focus on everything that is in the foreground and background simultaneously—only one locus is in focus at any given time—the rest remain blurred-out perceptually. However, the cinematographer can create a sense of focus to enhance the realism of an image through the use of light, color, and composition. In this sense, deep focus is an illusion of realism, albeit a powerful one.
Film scholars have also criticized Bazin's arguments for deep focus, claiming that his views are too idealistic. In his article, "The Myth of Total Cinema," scholar André Gaudreault pointed out that Bazin presupposed an idealistic notion of cinema that was not empirically provable. Gaudreault argued that, in the early days of Hollywood cinema, deep focus cinematography was not yet fully developed, and the cinema was, in many ways, still in its infancy. As such, deep focus was not the primary mode of creating realistic images. Instead, Hollywood cinema relied on other techniques, such as close-up shots or medium shots, to convey realism.
Bazin's argument for deep focus cinematography, however, is not the only factor that distinguishes his approach to film criticism. Bazin also believed in the significance of montage, which is the use of editing to combine multiple images into a single composition. Montage is significant because it allows filmmakers to convey a message through images that are not necessarily connected to each other in a direct way. This technique was pioneered by the Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, who used it to create powerful films that expressed a political message.
Unlike montage, deep focus cinematography emphasizes the realism of the medium by presenting the world in its complexity and depth. Montage, on the other hand, emphasizes the subjectivity of the medium by creating a message through the combination of seemingly unrelated images. Both techniques are essential in filmmaking, and Bazin recognized their significance.
Finally, Bazin's discussion on deep focus cinematography relates to his argument about the importance of realism in classical Hollywood cinema. For Bazin, classical Hollywood cinema was significant because it was the first time that film had achieved a level of realism that was comparable to other forms of art. Classical Hollywood cinema emphasized the use of deep focus cinematography, natural lighting, and minimal editing. This style of filmmaking sought to convey the action genuinely and create a unified world on screen. Bazin believed that this methodology allowed cinematic art to achieve the realism that other art forms had been able to.
In conclusion, Bazin's argument for the importance of deep focus cinematography is grounded in his belief that cinema is a medium that should emphasize realism. For Bazin, deep focus cinematography is the key to cinematic realism, as it allows the audience to see the world in all its complexity and depth. Critics have argued that Bazin's views are idealistic and that deep focus is an illusion of realism. Still, they agree that deep focus is an essential technique that creates a powerful image that accentuates the realism of the medium. By understanding the importance of deep focus, filmmakers can create powerful films that capture the essence of reality and convey powerful messages through the art of cinema.
