Language is one of the most essential human abilities. It is the means through which individuals communicate complex ideas and emotions, express their creativity and culture, and connect with other people. For a long time, it was believed that only humans possess this extraordinary talent. However, over the years, research has shown that some of our closest relatives, apes, also acquire and use language in various ways. The experiments of Washoe and Kanzi, the views of Piaget and Chomsky, and other studies help to understand how apes acquire and use language and what this suggests about the ability of humans to do the same.
The early studies on animal behavior suggested that apes were incapable of using language because the structure of their vocal cords is different from that of humans. Hence, they could not produce the same sounds that humans do. However, researches have shown that apes have several ways of communicating with each other and with humans. For instance, they use gestures, facial expressions, and body languages.
One of the earliest studies on the use of language by an ape was conducted by psychologists Beatrix and Allen Gardner on Washoe, a female chimpanzee, in the 1960s. The aim was to teach her American Sign Language (ASL) and determine if she could learn and use it to communicate complex ideas. The Gardners used a technique called shaping, which involves starting with simple signs and gradually building up to more complex ones. Within a short period, Washoe had learned over 160 signs and could use them to communicate about her needs, wants, and desires. For example, if she wanted to go outside, she would make the sign for "outside." 
The success of the Washoe experiment suggested that language acquisition is not unique to humans. However, some critics of this experiment argued that Washoe's language use was not on the same level as that of a human child. They suggested that Washoe was only using signs as conditioned responses to get rewards such as food or attention.
Another experiment that shed more light on the language use of apes was conducted on Kanzi, a bonobo ape, in the 1990s by psychologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh. Kanzi was not taught using shaping techniques. Instead, he learned ASL by observing humans communicate with each other and other apes. Kanzi learned over 200 signs and used them to communicate about complex ideas such as emotions, intentions, and desires. What made Kanzi's use of language unique was not only the variety of signs he used but his ability to comprehend spoken English. For example, when Savage-Rumbaugh asked him to "put paper in the trash," Kanzi comprehended the instruction and completed the task.
The fact that Kanzi learned language without being explicitly taught suggests that apes have some innate capacity for language acquisition. They can learn through observation and imitation, just like human infants. However, some critics of the Kanzi experiment suggested that his ability to comprehend language was exaggerated. They argued that Kanzi was only using his knowledge of signs to make guesses about what humans were asking him to do.
The experiments of Washoe and Kanzi indicate that apes are capable of learning and using language to communicate complex ideas. However, the depth and richness of their language use are not the same as those of humans. This suggests that although the ability to acquire language is not unique to humans, the way that we do it is different and more advanced.
The views of Jean Piaget, a prominent cognitive psychologist, help to explain how humans acquire language and the differences between their acquisition and that of apes. For Piaget, language is a product of cognitive development and the ability to think abstractly. Humans acquire language through a complex interaction between their cognitive capacities and the social environment. In other words, language is not only a means of communication but also a tool for thinking and problem-solving. Piaget argued that before children can start speaking, they must develop the cognitive abilities necessary to understand language. These abilities include senso-motor skills such as hand-eye coordination and object permanence and mental representations such as symbols and mental images.
Noam Chomsky, another prominent linguist, proposed a different perspective on language acquisition. Chomsky argued that humans possess an innate ability to acquire language. He suggested that there is a universal grammar that is hardwired into the human brain and that all human languages are built on a set of underlying rules or principles. Chomsky argued that even before they start learning a language, children possess a set of language acquisition principles that enable them to learn any language they are exposed to.
Although Chomsky's theory of language acquisition is controversial and has faced criticism, it suggests that human language acquisition is different from that of apes. While apes can learn language and use it to communicate, their language abilities are limited and do not reflect the complex systems of human languages. The critical point is that language is a tool for thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, and the evolutionary mechanism of language acquisition in humans is significantly different from apes.
In conclusion, the experiments of Washoe and Kanzi, the views of Piaget and Chomsky, and other studies have shown that apes are capable of acquiring and using language to communicate. However, their language abilities are not on the same level as those of humans. Humans have a unique and sophisticated way of acquiring language that involves the interaction between cognitive development and the social environment. Although apes possess some innate capacity for language acquisition, they do not have the same complex language abilities as humans, which suggests that language is innate in humans but significantly different from that of apes. These findings have important implications for understanding human evolution, development, and cognition.
