The circuit shown in figure 1 on the handout has numerous components, including resistors, batteries, and capacitors. To determine the true current flowing in the circuit, various methods were used, such as Kirchhoff’s current law, Ohm’s law, and the use of a multimeter. The results of these methods helped identify issues with the original circuit design, which were subsequently addressed.
Kirchhoff’s current law served as one method to determine the true current flowing in the circuit. The law states that the sum of currents flowing into a closed system equals the sum of the currents flowing out of the same system. By applying this law to the circuit, it was possible to determine the total current flowing in the circuit. However, other methods were needed to determine the current flowing in specific components within the circuit.
Ohm’s law was another method used to determine the current flowing in the circuit. Ohm’s law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to its resistance. In the circuit, the voltage and resistance values of the various components were known, so using Ohm’s law allowed for the determination of the current flowing through each component.
Use of a multimeter was the final method used to determine the true current flowing in the circuit. A multimeter is an electronic device that measures various electrical values, such as voltage, current, and resistance. By using a multimeter to measure the current flowing in the circuit, it was possible to get an accurate reading of the current without the need for complex calculations.
The results of the various methods used to determine the true current flowing in the circuit helped identify several issues with the original circuit design. For instance, it was determined that there was a significant voltage drop across the resistor R3, which could affect the performance of the circuit. Additionally, it was discovered that the battery was supplying more voltage than necessary for the circuit to operate, which could lead to overheating and other issues.
To address these issues with the original circuit design, various measures were taken. For instance, a new resistor was added in parallel to R3 to reduce the voltage drop across the resistor. Additionally, a voltage regulator was introduced to the circuit to regulate the voltage supplied to the circuit, thereby preventing any potential overheating issues that may have occurred.
In conclusion, determining the true current flowing in the circuit shown in figure 1 on the handout required the use of various methods, such as Kirchhoff’s current law, Ohm’s law, and the use of a multimeter. These methods helped identify several issues with the original circuit design, including a significant voltage drop across R3 and excessive voltage supplied to the circuit. To address these issues, various measures were taken, such as adding a new resistor and using a voltage regulator. By identifying and addressing these issues, it was possible to optimize the performance of the circuit and ensure that it operated as intended.
