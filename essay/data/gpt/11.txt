Following the Second World War, the political landscape of Europe was changed forever. The communist Soviet Union emerged as one of two superpowers, along with the United States, who saw themselves as the defenders of democracy and capitalism. These two opposing ideologies came to define the Cold War, which lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, the seeds of the conflict were sown immediately after the Second World War, as Eastern Europe came under the control of communist governments, and the West sought to contain the spread of communism. This essay will examine the different post-war political situations in Eastern Europe and how the western powers responded to them. Additionally, the essay will explore the different factors that led to the eventual communisation of Eastern European countries.
Following the Second World War, Eastern Europe, which consisted of countries such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and East Germany, was in a state of disarray. Their economies were destroyed, their infrastructure was in shambles, and their populations were struggling to recover from the devastating effects of war. The Soviet Union, which had suffered heavily during the war, was quick to capitalize on this situation. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, saw an opportunity to expand Soviet influence by installing communist governments in Eastern Europe. Stalin believed that the best way to protect the Soviet Union from future attacks was to surround it with friendly governments. As a result, he encouraged communist parties in Eastern Europe to seize power and establish socialist states.
In Poland, the communists seized power in 1947, after rigged elections. Similarly, in Hungary, the Soviet Union installed a communist government in 1949, which led to a series of purges and executions of anti-communist politicians. In Czechoslovakia, the communists came to power in 1948, after a coup d'Ã©tat, which saw non-communist politicians arrested and imprisoned. In Romania, the communists came to power in 1947, and the following year, the monarchy was abolished and replaced with a socialist republic. Bulgaria saw a similar process, with the communists taking full control in 1947, after rigged elections.
The western powers, led by the United States, were alarmed by the spread of communism in Eastern Europe. They saw it as a direct threat to democracy and capitalism and believed that it was their duty to contain the spread of communism. The Truman Doctrine, announced by President Truman in 1947, called for the United States to provide military and economic aid to countries threatened by communism. The Marshall Plan, which followed shortly after, provided economic aid to Western European countries, to help them rebuild after the war and resist the spread of communism. In addition, the United States established NATO in 1949, a military alliance between several Western European countries, the United States, and Canada, to deter Soviet aggression.
Despite the efforts of the western powers, the communisation of Eastern Europe continued. There were several factors that contributed to this process. One of the most important factors was the Red Army, which was stationed in many Eastern European countries. The Red Army was not only a military presence, but also a political one, as it ensured that the communist parties remained in power. Additionally, the Soviet Union implemented a series of economic policies that were hostile to capitalism, such as nationalisation of industries, central planning of the economy, and the collectivisation of agriculture. These policies left Eastern Europe heavily dependent on the Soviet Union for economic support, making it difficult for these countries to break away from communist control.
Another factor that contributed to the communisation of Eastern Europe was the weakness of Western European powers. Western Europe was still recovering from the war and was unable to resist Soviet expansion, particularly in regions where the Soviet Union had a military presence. This was evident in 1956, when Hungarian citizens rebelled against the communist government, only to be crushed by the Soviet military. The western powers were unable to come to Hungary's aid, and the Soviet Union successfully quelled the uprising.
In conclusion, the post-war political situation in Eastern Europe was characterised by the rise of communism, which was facilitated by the Soviet Union. The western powers responded to this by attempting to contain the spread of communism through military and economic aid and the establishment of military alliances. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful, and the communisation of Eastern Europe continued. The factors that led to the eventual communisation of Eastern European countries were many, including the Red Army's presence, Soviet economic policies, and the weakness of Western European powers. Despite being a long time in the past now, the dynamics that led to this make the study of history an important tool even in the present day to help better understand the root causes of some modern day conflicts and ongoing geopolitical struggles.
