Hip fractures are a common cause of injury in the elderly population, with significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly individuals, especially those with comorbidities, face a complex set of issues when it comes to hip fractures. Upon presentation to A&E after a fall, the differential diagnosis for an elderly man who presents unable to move his leg or walk is usually a hip fracture or a spinal cord injury.
Hip fractures are the most common cause of immobilization in the elderly. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint, and therefore the most common type of hip fracture is a femoral neck fracture. These types of fractures can be further classified into displaced or non-displaced fractures. Displaced fractures have a higher risk of complications such as non-union, avascular necrosis, and increased mortality. Non-displaced fractures, on the other hand, have lower complication rates and can be managed non-operatively.
Another type of hip fracture is the intertrochanteric fracture. This is a fracture of the greater trochanter and is usually the result of falls. Unlike femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures have a lower risk of complications. They are also easier to treat surgically, and the patient usually has a quicker recovery time.
The treatment of a hip fracture depends on the type of fracture and the patient's general health. For most displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly individuals, surgery is necessary to ensure proper healing. While non-operative management of non-displaced fractures is possible, the complications of non-union and nonhealing are common. In those with other health problems which might make surgery riskier, non-operative management is recommended. Intertrochanteric fractures, on the other hand, are managed by surgery in most cases.
Age and living situation of the patient can have a significant impact on the potential risks and the need for social care input after treatment. As a patient gets older, his or her general health status may deteriorate, leading to increased risks during treatment. Elderly individuals with pre-existing medical conditions are more likely to experience complications after treatment for a hip fracture. The ability of the patient to function independently before the fracture plays a significant role in determining the level of social care they will require after treatment.
The incidence of hip fractures in the UK has been increasing over the years. It is estimated that around 75,000 hip fractures occur in the UK each year, with women three times as likely to suffer a hip fracture than men. The underlying causes of hip fractures in the UK include osteoporosis, falls, and an aging population. Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for hip fractures, and the increasing prevalence of the disease is predicted to result in more hip fractures in the future.
The treatment of elderly hip fractures requires a multi-disciplinary team approach. A team approach ensures that the patient receives the necessary care and support required. The team should consist of healthcare professionals from different disciplines such as orthopedic surgeons, geriatricians, and physiotherapists. The orthopedic surgeon plays the critical role of surgically treating the fractures, while the geriatrician helps manage the patient's overall health. Physiotherapists are utilized to help the patient regain mobility and strength after treatment.
In conclusion, hip fractures in the elderly are a common cause of immobilization and hospitalization. The differential diagnosis for an elderly man who presents unable to move his leg or walk include hip fractures and spinal cord injury. The type of fracture determines the treatment approach, with surgery being recommended for displaced fractures. Age and living situations of the patient are crucial considerations for social care input. The underlying causes of hip fractures in the UK include osteoporosis, falls, and an aging population. Treating elderly hip fractures requires the collaboration of healthcare professionals from different disciplines.
