In the field of philosophy, arguments about the nature of the mind and its place in the physical world are centuries old and continue to be fiercely debated. One of the most famous of such arguments was presented by philosopher Frank Jackson in his thought experiment about Mary, commonly known as "Mary's Room." This essay will explore Jackson's thought experiment about Mary and the challenges it presents to the concept of physicalism, as well as his use of the example of Fred to further his argument. The essay will also examine Jackson's claim about the existence of non-physical facts, his explanation of the concept of qualia, and his response to arguments against this concept.
The thought experiment about Mary presented by Jackson centers around a hypothetical scenario in which a woman named Mary has been raised in a black and white room her entire life. She is an expert in the field of color vision and knows everything there is to know about the physical properties of colors and how the brain processes them. However, she has never actually seen colors herself. One day, Mary is released from the room and sees colors for the first time. Jackson asks the question: does Mary learn anything new about the nature of colors and their subjective experience when she finally sees them in the world outside of her black and white room?
According to physicalism, also known as the materialist view, all that exists in the universe can be explained in terms of physical entities. This view suggests that mental states, such as experiencing the color red, can be fully explained in terms of physical states, such as the firing of neurons in the brain. Jackson's thought experiment challenges this notion by suggesting that Mary does in fact learn something new about the subjective experience of color when she sees them for the first time, despite her extensive knowledge of the physical properties of colors. This suggests that mental states may not be reducible to physical states.
Jackson further strengthens his argument by introducing the example of Fred, a colorblind man who is surgically given the ability to see colors for the first time. Like Mary, Fred had no prior experience of subjective color experiences, yet he learns something new about the nature of colors and their subjective experience. This shows that subjective experiences cannot be fully explained in terms of physical properties. Jackson argues that there are unique subjective experiences associated with mental states that cannot be fully captured by physical descriptions.
Jackson's argument suggests that there are non-physical facts about the world, which cannot be explained in terms of physical properties alone. He argues that subjective experiences, or what he terms "qualia," are an example of such non-physical facts. Qualia can be defined as the subjective, first-person experiences associated with mental states, such as the experience of seeing red or feeling pain. Jackson argues that qualia are subjective experiences that cannot be fully explained by physical properties alone.
Critics of Jackson's argument often challenge the idea of qualia, suggesting that they are nothing more than an illusion created by physical processes in the brain. They argue that subjective experiences are simply the result of physical processes, and there is no need to posit non-physical facts to explain them. Jackson counters this argument by pointing out that the subjective experience of qualia is not the same as the physical processes that give rise to them. While physical processes can be measured and quantified, subjective experiences are highly personal and cannot be fully captured by physical descriptions alone.
Jackson's thought experiment about Mary and his argument about qualia raise important questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical world. His argument challenges the notion of physicalism and suggests that non-physical facts, such as subjective experiences, exist. While there are those who argue against his concept of qualia, Jackson's arguments provide a compelling case for the existence of non-physical facts and their importance in understanding the nature of the mind and consciousness.
