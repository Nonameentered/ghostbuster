The lab that I recently completed was a fascinating exercise in programming and hardware design. In this lab, I was tasked with controlling two 7-segment LED displays to display a count when specific switches were pressed. The lab was challenging, but ultimately it helped improve my knowledge of coding and the M16 development board.
To begin with, the procedure for controlling the two 7-segment LED displays involved a few key steps. First, I had to set up the M16 development board. This involved connecting the appropriate cables to the board and ensuring that all the necessary components were properly connected. I then had to program the board so that it could interface with the switches and the LED displays.
Next, I had to write the code that would control the displays. This involved using a series of if-else statements to determine which switch had been pressed and incrementing the count accordingly. Once the count had been incremented, I had to use another series of statements to display the count on the LED displays. This was done by setting the appropriate pins on the board to high or low, depending on the digit that needed to be displayed.
Finally, once the code had been written, I had to test the program to ensure that it was working as expected. This involved pressing each switch and verifying that the count incremented appropriately and that the correct digits were displayed on the LED displays.
Overall, this lab taught me a lot about coding and the M16 development board. Perhaps the most valuable lesson I learned was the importance of careful planning and debugging. At the beginning of the lab, I had a rough idea of what my code would look like and how I would interface with the hardware. However, as I began writing the code, I quickly realized that there were a lot of details that I had overlooked.
For example, when I first tried to display the count on the LED displays, nothing happened. After checking my code, I realized that I had made a mistake in the pin assignments. Once I corrected this mistake, the program worked perfectly. This taught me the importance of taking the time to double-check my code and test it thoroughly.
Another valuable lesson I learned was the importance of asking for help when I needed it. There were several times during the lab when I encountered problems that I couldn't solve on my own. In these cases, I reached out to my instructor or my classmates for guidance. By working collaboratively, we were able to solve each problem.
In conclusion, the lab that involved controlling two 7-segment LED displays to display a count when specific switches were pressed was a valuable learning experience. Not only did it help me improve my coding skills, but it also taught me a lot about hardware design and debugging. By the end of the lab, I felt much more confident in my ability to work with the M16 development board, and I was eager to take on more complex programming challenges in the future.
