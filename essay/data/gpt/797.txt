The events of September 11, 2001, have had a significant impact on the way that many people view Arab-Muslims. Arguably, the dominant narrative in the media and government since these attacks has emphasised a link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism. This narrative has undoubtedly had an effect on people’s automatic and explicit prejudices towards Arab-Muslims. In this essay, I will explore the relationship between exposure to a stimulus emphasising the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism and automatic and explicit prejudices towards Arab-Muslims. Additionally, I will examine the role that research has played in understanding the processes by which negative automatic attitudes are strengthened, and how valid the Implicit Association Test is in measuring implicit attitudes towards racial groups.
Exposure to a stimulus that emphasises the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism can have a powerful effect on people’s automatic and explicit prejudices towards Arab-Muslims. In a study conducted by Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001), participants were exposed to an article that either emphasised a link between Arabs and terrorism or did not mention Arabs at all. Following this, the participants completed the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure their implicit attitudes towards Arabs. The results showed that participants who had read the article that emphasised a link between Arabs and terrorism had significantly more negative automatic attitudes towards Arabs than participants who had read the other article. This study demonstrates how exposure to a stimulus that emphasises the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism can have a rapid and significant effect on people’s automatic attitudes towards this group.
Further research has suggested that this effect can also extend to explicit prejudices. In a study conducted by Levin and McDevitt (1993), participants were asked to make a judgment about a target person who was either Arab or non-Arab. The results showed that when the target was described as a “terrorist” or an “extremist” rather than simply being described as Arab, participants were more likely to view the target negatively. This suggests that the emphasis on a link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism can have a negative effect on people’s explicit prejudices towards this group.
It is important to note that the relationship between exposure to a stimulus emphasising the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism and automatic and explicit prejudices towards Arab-Muslims is not straightforward. A study conducted by Nosek, Banaji, and Greenwald (2002) found that although there was a link between explicit and implicit attitudes towards Arabs, this link was weaker than expected. This suggests that while exposure to a stimulus emphasising the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism can have an effect on both automatic and explicit attitudes towards this group, there are also other factors that can influence these attitudes.
Research has begun to shed light on the processes by which negative automatic attitudes towards racial groups are strengthened. One way in which this happens is through the exposure to images and messages that reinforce negative stereotypes. In an experiment conducted by Fiske, Lin, and Neuberg (1999), participants were exposed to either positive or negative images of racial groups, followed by images of guns or everyday objects. The results showed that participants who saw negative images of a racial group were more likely to identify guns as quickly as possible in a subsequent task. This suggests that exposure to negative images of racial groups can increase the speed with which people make associations between that group and violent or threatening stimuli.
Another way in which negative automatic attitudes towards racial groups are strengthened is through the generation of affective responses. In a study conducted by Dovidio, Kawakami, and Gaertner (2002), participants were shown faces of people from different racial groups and were then asked to rate the extent to which they experienced positive or negative emotions in response to the faces. The results showed that participants who were high in racial prejudice showed more negative affective responses to faces of racial outgroup members. This suggests that negative automatic attitudes towards racial groups can be strengthened through the generation of negative affective responses to members of that group.
The Implicit Association Test has been used extensively to measure implicit attitudes towards racial groups, including Arab-Muslims. The IAT measures the speed with which individuals categorise stimuli in response to specific categories. The theory behind the IAT is that people will be faster at categorising stimuli when the categories match their implicit attitudes than when they do not. However, there has been some debate about the validity of the IAT in measuring implicit attitudes towards racial groups, particularly when social desirability effects are present.
Social desirability effects refer to the tendency of participants to give answers that they think are socially desirable, rather than their true beliefs or attitudes. This can be a problem in research on implicit attitudes, as participants may be aware that expressing negative attitudes towards racial groups could be seen as socially unacceptable. This could result in participants giving responses that do not accurately reflect their implicit attitudes. However, research has shown that the effects of social desirability on IAT scores are small and do not significantly affect the overall validity of the test (Forscher et al., 2018).
In conclusion, exposure to a stimulus emphasising the link between Arab-Muslims and terrorism can have a significant effect on both automatic and explicit prejudices towards this group. However, this relationship is complex, and other factors can also influence these attitudes. Research has begun to shed light on the processes by which negative automatic attitudes towards racial groups are strengthened, including through exposure to negative images and the generation of affective responses. While the IAT has been used extensively to measure implicit attitudes towards racial groups, there has been some debate about its validity, particularly when social desirability effects are present. Overall, this research highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying negative attitudes towards racial groups, and the potential impact of media and public discourse on these attitudes.
