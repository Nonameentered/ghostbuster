Introduction
Hospitality is one of the most fundamental human traits. It is the act of welcoming and accommodating strangers or guests with a friendly disposition. Over time, the concept of hospitality has been commercialized, with various industries thriving on providing the service to tourists and visitors. However, the meaning and operations of hospitality have been subject to different viewpoints as different cultures, societies, and industries define it according to individual circumstances and capabilities. This essay seeks to explore the different viewpoints on the meaning and operations of hospitality and evaluate the success of the commercial sectors in achieving their intentions.
Viewpoints on the Meaning and Operations of Hospitality
Hospitality has been subject to different viewpoints over time. The concept has evolved over time, with the modern interpretation primarily revolving around providing commercial services. However, the traditional definition of hospitality emphasizes welcoming and taking care of visitors on a personal level. The traditional perspective is observed in many small cities and towns, where people still welcome strangers into their homes and provide them with food, shelter, and a peaceful environment. In such communities, hospitality is an inherent part of their culture, ingrained in their everyday lives.
In contrast, the operations and meaning of hospitality have evolved into a commercial enterprise in urban communities. Hotels and resorts are now the primary providers of hospitality services, and their objective is to make profits through pleasing guests. In the commercial perspective, hospitality is more of an art than a science. It involves creating a great environment where visitors can feel relaxed and entertained, making sure that their needs are catered to, and that they enjoy every moment of their stay. The hospitality industry has a set of rules, expertise, and strategies that have been perfected over time through its vast and diverse range of operations.
Moreover, cultural and social differences have had an immense impact on the meaning and operations of hospitality. Culture has a significant role in shaping hospitality, with different norms, customs, and social practices influencing the way guests are welcomed, cared for and entertained. The cultural influence on hospitality is evident in the way service providers cater to guests' needs. For instance, in Japan, traditional inns have set prices regardless of the number of guests in a room. So, by the Japanese culture, the cost of a room is not increased with extra occupants, unlike the like guest in a hotel.
The Inadequacy of Commercial Sectors in Achieving Their Intentions
Despite setting out to provide the best hospitality, the commercial sectors have not always achieved their objectives. Many service providers prioritize profit-making over guest satisfaction. In the commercial hospitality industry, high-end hotels often differentiate their services to tailor to specific high-end clients while turning away other potential customers. Such hotels focus on specific client profiles and cater to the needs of individuals who are willing to pay the highest prices. However, such pricing strategies often deter visitors who do not fit the "preferred" clientele profile, which contributes to a lack of inclusivity.
Additionally, the commercial sector has various shortcomings contributing to a negative client experience. Despite marketing itself as customer-centric, the commercial hospitality industry sees customers as consumers. Such an argument implies that customers are only in their presence to spend money. Consequently, the industry focuses on upselling customers to increase their sales volumes, often disregarding the customer experience. Further, such strategies have contributed to the development of a "cookie-cutter" model, where services, facilities, and amenities in different regions are essentially the same.
Another substantial inadequacy of the commercial sectors is their negative impact on the environment. Massive commercial hotels consume vast amounts of energy, water, and other resources. Besides, the generation of waste and pollution affect their host communities, contributing to environmental degradation. Greenwashing has become a common practice, with hotels painting sustainability initiatives to appear eco-friendly, but in reality, they are doing nothing to protect the environment.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the meaning and operations of hospitality have been subject to various viewpoints, with different cultures, societies, and commercial sectors shaping how the concept is understood and executed. Hospitality has evolved over time, with the current commercial interpretation focusing on maximizing profits derived from providing excellent customer service. Despite providing essential services, the commercial sectors have fallen short and contributed to dissatisfaction among guests. Through negative consumer-centric approaches to business, the rise of cookie-cutter hotels, and negative environmental impacts suggest that the commercial sectors still have much to improve on. Therefore, the commercial sectors need to incorporate sustainable principles into their core operations, minimize carbon footprint, and reinvent their strategies to cater to broader clientele, thus achieving the true meaning of hospitality.
