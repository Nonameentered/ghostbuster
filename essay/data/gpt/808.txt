The tourism industry has always been an integral part of the economy in the United Kingdom. As such, British Airways has played a key role in facilitating the transportation of tourists and business travelers to and from the country. Over the years, the airline has faced numerous challenges in its operations, including the rise in oil prices, fuel surcharges, and strikes by employees. These challenges have had both short-term and long-term effects on the company's finances and reputation. In this essay, I will discuss the trends and challenges facing British Airways in the transport sector of the tourism industry, and how the company can address them by focusing on its human resource management practices.
The rise in oil prices has been a major challenge for airlines, including British Airways, over the years. The airline industry is heavily reliant on oil as a key input factor for its operations. As such, fluctuating oil prices have a significant impact on the cost of operating airlines. In recent years, we have seen an upward trend in oil prices, which has resulted in increased operating costs for airlines. This has forced airlines to implement measures to reduce fuel consumption, such as reducing the weight of airplanes, and minimizing fuel wastage during flights. However, these measures can only go so far in reducing fuel costs.
Another challenge facing British Airways in the transport sector of the tourism industry is the use of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges are additional fees that airlines charge passengers to offset the increased cost of fuel. While fuel surcharges have been controversial, they are a necessary evil for airlines to remain profitable in an environment of rising oil prices. However, the use of fuel surcharges has contributed to a decline in customer satisfaction levels, as passengers feel that airlines are exploiting their need to travel in order to make extra money.
The impact of strikes on airlines cannot be overstated. Strikes have a significant negative impact on the finances and reputation of airlines. In the case of British Airways, strikes have led to the cancellation of flights, which has resulted in lost revenue and increased customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, repeated strikes have a negative impact on the reputation of the airline, as passengers view the company as being unable to resolve labor disputes.
These challenges facing British Airways in the transport sector of the tourism industry have both short-term and long-term effects on the company's finances and reputation. For example, the rise in oil prices and the use of fuel surcharges have led to increased operational costs for British Airways, and reduced customer satisfaction levels. Furthermore, strikes have resulted in lost revenue, and tarnished the reputation of the airline, as passengers view the company as being unable to resolve labor disputes.
To address these challenges, British Airways needs to focus on its internal functional areas, particularly human resource management practices. Human resource management practices are critical to the success of British Airways because they are the foundation upon which the company can build a high-performance workforce. High-performance workforce entails employees who are engaged, motivated, and willing to go above and beyond their job requirements to meet organizational goals. Thus, British Airways can adopt human resource management strategies to improve employee engagement, motivation, and performance, which will ultimately lead to improved customer satisfaction and profitability.
One way British Airways can improve its human resource management practices is by implementing an employee engagement program. Employee engagement programs seek to improve the level of employee involvement in the organization's goals and objectives. Through an employee engagement program, British Airways can provide its employees with a sense of purpose and belonging. This can be achieved by involving employees in decision-making processes, providing continuous feedback, and recognition for performance. Furthermore, employee involvement can help to create a sense of ownership among employees, which can lead to improved performance and productivity.
Another way British Airways can improve its human resource management practices is by adopting a rewards and recognition program. Rewards and recognition programs involve providing employees with incentives for good performance. The incentives can range from financial rewards to non-financial rewards such as promotion opportunities, training opportunities, and flexible work schedules. This can help to create a sense of motivation among employees, which can lead to improved performance and increased job satisfaction.
In conclusion, British Airways is facing several challenges in the transport sector of the tourism industry, particularly in relation to the rise in oil prices, the use of fuel surcharges, and the impact of strikes. The company can address these challenges by focusing on its human resource management practices. By implementing an employee engagement program and a rewards and recognition program, British Airways can improve employee engagement, motivation, and performance, which will ultimately lead to improved customer satisfaction and profitability.
