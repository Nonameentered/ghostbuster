Henrik Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and Federico Garcia Lorca's "Yerma" are two plays that showcase the struggles of women in patriarchal societies. Both plays examine gender inequality and societal expectations placed on women. While society views women as inferior to men, it also places limitations on them that often lead to frustration and unhappiness. Both plays portray women who are confined by societal expectations and limitations, but the ways in which Hedda and Yerma react to these limitations differ significantly. This essay will compare and contrast the portrayal of women in both plays and analyze how societal expectations and limitations impact the women and their lives.
Hedda Gabler, the protagonist of Ibsen's play, was born into an upper-class family. Society expects women of her caliber to be nothing more than decorative pieces in their husband's mansion. As a result, women like Hedda are forced to live their lives under the control of the men around them. They are expected to marry well and devote themselves to their husbands and children. Society expects women to be submissive, obedient, and nurturing.
Hedda struggles with these societal expectations and limitations. She is not content with a life of submission, obedience, and servitude. Hedda's bitter and sarcastic nature is a manifestation of her frustration with a society that expects her to be something she is not. She rebels against the social norms that limit her freedom and independence. For example, she is jealous of the life her friend, Thea Elvsted, leads. She envies the fact that Thea has control over her life and does not need to adhere to societal expectations. However, because of her position in society, Hedda is unable to achieve the same level of freedom Thea has.
Hedda's husband, George Tesman, is the epitome of the patriarchal society that dominates the play. George is ultimately preoccupied with his academic career, which leaves Hedda alone with nothing to do. George is a reflection of society's expectations for men, which is to work diligently and earn wealth and status. George treats Hedda more like a possession than a partner, and this only serves to fuel Hedda's frustration and resentment towards him. She is unhappy and bored with her life, unable to get what she wants, and the societal limitations placed on her only serve to exacerbate her misery.
Yerma, the protagonist of Lorca's play, is a peasant woman living in rural Spain. She and her husband have been married for several years, but she is unable to conceive a child. In her culture, motherhood is the ultimate goal of women, and not being able to bear children is considered a woman's greatest failure. Despite her repeated attempts to become pregnant, she remains childless. Society views her as inadequate and incomplete, and this brings immense shame and misery to her life.
Yerma's inability to conceive a child limits her in more ways than one. Her husband and the people around her expect her to procreate. When she fails to do so, her husband shames and belittles her. Her husband, Juan, has no problem sleeping with other women and having children with them, showing the hypocritical nature of their society. Yerma's husband actually reinforces the patriarchal societal expectations placed on women, and it is this narrow-mindedness that keeps Yerma from achieving her own personal goals and desires.
Yerma is desperate to have a child, and her desperation leads her to seek out various remedies and treatments. She visits healers and even goes so far as to visit a witch in hopes of finding a solution to her infertility. It is clear that society's expectations for women have left her feeling desperate and hopeless, despite her attempts to fulfill them.
The two plays differ in the ways the female protagonists react to the societal limitations placed on them. Hedda is characterized by manipulation and cruelty. She wants power and control over her life, and the frustration that she experiences leads her to lash out in destructive ways. She shows no regard for other people's problems and is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve what she wants, which includes manipulating the lives of those around her.
Yerma, on the other hand, is characterized by her longing and desperation. She desires nothing more than to have a child and become a mother, and her desperation drives her to desperation. But while Hedda looks at her situation with bitterness and contempt, Yerma looks at it with an intense yearning that is both sincere and desperate. Yerma is unable to let go of her desire to have a child and this leads her to take increasingly desperate measures, even resorting to infidelity, although indirectly. 
In conclusion, Hedda Gabler and Yerma are two plays that explore the struggles of women living in patriarchal societies. Both plays showcase the limitations and societal expectations placed on women, but they differ in the way the female protagonists react to them. Hedda is bitter and manipulative, while Yerma is desperate and yearning. The two plays are an excellent analysis of how gender inequality impacts women, and they remain relevant today, as gender inequality and societal expectations women are still prevalent in our world.
