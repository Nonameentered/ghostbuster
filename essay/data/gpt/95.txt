Introduction 
Human beings are social creatures who constantly interact with other individuals. At home, school, work, and in different social environments, people encounter varying forms of interpersonal communication that impact their behavior, performance, and decision making. The presence of others can either positively or negatively influence individual behavior. Research has shown that the presence of others can change individual behavior, perception, emotions, and motivation. The study of how individuals perform in the presence of others has been an area of interest for researchers for more than a century. 
This essay provides an in-depth analysis of the influence of the presence of others on individual performance, decision making, and behavior. It also explains how research on this topic has developed since the pioneering study of Norman Triplett in 1898. Different theories that have emerged to explain how the presence of others affects individual behavior, performance, and decision-making will also be discussed. 
The Influence of the Presence of Others on Individual Performance 
Research indicates that the presence of others affects individual performance. Over a century ago, a study conducted by Norman Triplett in 1898 illustrated the impact the presence of others had on individual performance. He conducted an experiment on cyclists and found that they performed better when they were competing with others than when they performed alone (Tripplet, 1898). This study marked the beginning of the emergence of research on social facilitation.
Zajonc (1965) later explained social facilitation, which he defined as the mere presence of others enhancing individual performance on simple, well-learned tasks, and impeding performance on complex tasks. The presence of others results in greater physiological arousal and can positively influence the performance of well-learned tasks and negatively influence the performance of complex tasks (Zajonc, 1965). The classic study of Zajonc demonstrates that the presence of others enhances individual performance when undertaking a simple task, while it hurts performance when undertaking complex tasks (Zajonc, 1965). 
Social facilitation has been found to be dependent on task difficulty, individual skill level, and the size of the audience watching the individual perform (Allen & Wilder, 1974). A study conducted by Allen and Wilder (1974) showed that individuals performed better when undertaking difficult square root calculations in the presence of others than when alone. Individual performance was impeded when undertaking simple arithmetic problems (Allen & Wilder, 1974). 
Another study by Baron and colleagues (1983) found that the presence of others could influence an individual's emotions, resulting in increased arousal in tasks that were high in anxiety and task difficulty. Participants who worked on difficult puzzles or problems in front of others showed increased arousal and stress, which negatively impacted their performance (Baron, 1983). On the other hand, people who worked on less demanding tasks in front of others had elevated mood and arousal that positively contributed to their performance (Baron, 1983).
The Influence of the Presence of Others on Decision Making 
The presence of others can also impact an individual's decision making. The presence of others can either help or hinder individual decision-making processes. Social facilitation impacts individual decision-making in that it can lead individuals to feel motivated to perform better in the presence of others. In contrast, social inhibition entails individuals' reluctance to perform specific activities or apprehension to be evaluated by others (Latan√© & Nida, 1981). 
Social loafing is another phenomenon that can occur when making decisions in groups. Social loafing occurs when people reduce their effort when working on a task in a group compared to when they work alone. This happens because individuals assume that someone else in the group will complete the task, and the individual's effort may not be required. A meta-analysis of seventy-seven studies indicated that social loafing is more evident in individualistic cultures than in collective cultures (Karau & Williams, 1993). 
Group polarization is another phenomenon associated with group decision making. This occurs when a group's decision is more extreme than the individual members' initial views' average. In general, group polarization occurs because individuals feel more confident in their opinions when they receive validation from others (Myers & Lamm, 1976). 
The Influence of the Presence of Others on Behavior 
The presence of others can impact individual behavior, leading to a group dynamic within social environments. In social environments, individuals tend to conform and adapt their behavior to fit the group's behavior. People's behavior can either be positively or negatively influenced by the presence of others, depending on their perceptions of group norms. 
Social norms can impact individual behavior in social situations. Social norms dictate what is considered acceptable and what is considered unacceptable behavior within a social environment. Individuals conform to social norms, whether they are explicit or implicit (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). For instance, studies have shown that people tend to litter more when they encounter an environment where littering is the norm (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990). 
Another phenomenon that emerges in group behavior is deindividuation, a process where people engage in antisocial behavior because there is a reduced sense of personal responsibility when in a group (Zimbardo, 1970). In such instances, individuals may experience a diminished sense of accountability resulting in behaviors that they would not typically display when alone. Studies have shown that individuals may engage in behaviors such as vandalism, group aggression, and looting when they are part of a group (Prentice-Dunn & Rogers, 1989). 
Myers and colleagues (1975) conducted a study that illustrated the impact group size can have on behavior. They found that as the group size increased, individual accountability decreases, resulting in reduced participation in the group task and an increase in social loafing and deindividuation (Myers, Gibbs, & Findley, 1975).
Conclusion 
The presence of others has a significant impact on individual behavior, performance, and decision making. The research conducted since the pioneering study of Norman Triplett in 1898 has demonstrated that the presence of others can impact individual performance positively or negatively, depending on task difficulty, individual skill level, and the audience size. Research has also highlighted that the presence of others can influence decision making, where group polarization occurs when individuals feel validated in their opinions. Social norms can impact individual behavior in social situations, leading to social conformity. Group behavior can also result in deindividuation, where individuals engage in behaviors that they would not typically engage in when alone. 
This essay has identified different theories that explain how the presence of others affects individual behavior, performance, and decision making. Social facilitation, social inhibition, social loafing, group polarization, deindividuation, and social norms have been discussed in this essay. Understanding these phenomena provides insight into how the presence of others can impact individuals' performance, decision making, and behavior within different social environments. 
In conclusion, the presence of others has a substantial influence on individual behavior, performance, and decision making. Research on this topic has developed significantly over the years, and different theories have emerged to explain the different phenomena associated with it. It is essential to understand how different social situations can impact individuals and develop strategies to mitigate negative influences that may result from the presence of others.
