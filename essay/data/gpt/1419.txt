The Millennium Declaration signed in 2000 by the United Nations committed member states to a set of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Goal 7 was focused on ensuring environmental sustainability. It intended to integrate sustainable development principles into national policies and programs; reduce biodiversity loss, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions; increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation; and reduce the number of people without access to basic energy services. As the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) points out, "sustainable development is a critical component of human development: without it, human development achievements are at risk of reversing," and this is particularly true for women, who are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and face gender-specific barriers in accessing environmental resources and decision-making processes.
In this essay, we will examine how a women-focused human rights-based approach can contribute to the achievement of Goal 7 of the Millennium Declaration, and what challenges need to be overcome to bridge the gap between gender-neutral international environmental instruments and the realities of women's daily lives.
Women are affected by environmental degradation in different ways than men. They have a closer relationship with natural resources, such as water, land, and forests, since their traditional roles as caregivers and food providers put them in charge of managing these resources. Women also face a higher burden of environmental health risks, such as exposure to indoor air pollution caused by cooking with solid fuels, and are more vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, due to their limited access to information and resources. Moreover, women are frequently excluded from environmental decision-making processes and policies, leaving their perspectives and priorities underrepresented.
A women-focused human rights-based approach recognizes that women should be active agents in environmental management and decision-making, not just passive beneficiaries. Such an approach demands that any environmental policy, program, or practice is implemented with a view to advancing gender equality and addressing the specific needs, priorities, and rights of women and girls. In practical terms, this would mean:
- Ensuring women's participation in environmental decision-making at all levels, from local to global, and involving them in planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of environmental projects.
- Recognizing women's rights to natural resources, including land, water, and forests, and protecting them from discriminatory or exploitative practices.
- Promoting women's access to and control over environmentally-friendly technologies, such as clean cookstoves and renewable energy.
- Addressing the gender-based environmental health risks faced by women by providing access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and health services.
- Raising awareness about gender and the environment among policymakers, the media, civil society, and the general public.
If implemented effectively, a women-focused human rights-based approach has the potential to accelerate the achievement of Goal 7 of the Millennium Declaration, by promoting more sustainable and equitable development patterns. By involving women in environmental decision-making and ensuring their access to natural resources, clean technologies and basic services, women can become empowered and contribute to a more sustainable development model that takes into account the interlinked social, environmental, and economic dimensions of human development.
However, there are challenges to fully implementing such an approach. One challenge is the lack of gender-disaggregated data, which makes it difficult to design informed policies that address the specific needs of women and girls. Additionally, environmental policies are often gender-neutral, and their implementation may not take gender gaps into account. There is also the challenge of ensuring that women's participation in decision-making is meaningful and not just symbolic, as women may face resistance from traditional power structures or lack resources to participate. Finally, there is the need to advocate for more gender-transformative approaches, which seek to challenge the root causes of gender inequality and empower women to influence environmental change and development more broadly.
In conclusion, a women-focused human rights-based approach is critical to achieving Goal 7 of the Millennium Declaration's focus on environmental sustainability. The approach recognizes the unique ways that women are affected by environmental degradation and aims to address these specific challenges. To bridge the gap between gender-neutral international environmental instruments and the realities of women's daily lives, several challenges must be tackled, including the lack of gender-disaggregated data, the gender-neutrality of environmental policies, the meaningful participation of women in decision-making processes, and the need for more gender-transformational approaches. Efforts to address these challenges will increase the effectiveness of environmental policies, promoting more sustainable development patterns that benefit both women and men.
