The epic poem 'Iliad' by Greek poet Homer is regarded as one of the greatest works of literature in the history of the Western world. The poem is about the Trojan War that took place between the Greeks and the Trojans. 'Iliad' is not just a war story, but it also portrays the characters, their traits, and the ideas of heroism and leadership. One of the main characters in 'Iliad' is Hector, a Trojan prince, and warrior. Homer uses the character of Hector to depict heroism and leadership in times of war in Book 12 of the 'Iliad.'
Hector is a warrior who leads the Trojans in battles against the Greeks, and his character is essential to the theme of heroism and leadership in the 'Iliad.' Book 12 of 'Iliad' focuses on the battle between the Trojans and the Greeks. Homer portrays Hector's leadership skills by describing his actions during the battle. In the first few lines of Book 12, Hector motivates his troops to fight with strength and courage, stating, "Be men, my friends, and guard your town and your wives, and get your children home safely." (Iliad, Book 12, lines 14-15). Hector's statement is a clear indication of his leadership qualities as he not only encourages his troops to fight but also emphasizes the importance of protecting their town and families.
Homer further highlights Hector's leadership skills in Book 12 by showing him leading the charge against the Greeks. During the battle, Hector leads the Trojan forces and takes the initiative to attack the Greeks. Homer says, "Hector called out, and the Trojans came on with a roar, led by Hector, glorious in his savage rage." (Iliad, Book 12, lines 52-53). This quote shows how Hector's leadership skills and heroism inspire his troops to fight with courage and passion.
Furthermore, Homer portrays Hector as a brave and skillful warrior who leads by example. During the battle in Book 12, Hector fights with his full might and demonstrates his battle skills. Homer says, "Hector was leading, upholding the perfectly mad assault, thrusting left and right with his spear, his glittering helmet flickering like an unholy star." (Iliad, Book 12, lines 151-153). This quote shows how Hector's bravery and battle skills inspire his soldiers to follow him into battle.
Moreover, Homer portrays Hector as a compassionate leader who cares for his troops. During the battle, Hector notices one of his soldiers severely injured, and he goes to rescue him. Homer says, "But Hector leapt from his chariot to the ground, and ran across to save his friend, Aesi, son of Hippotas, from brutal death." (Iliad, Book 12, lines 435-436). This quote portrays how Hector not only cares for the safety of his troops but also demonstrates his selflessness by putting himself in danger to help his fellow soldiers.
Furthermore, Homer uses Hector's conversations with his wife Andromache to illustrate his leadership qualities. In Book 6 of the 'Iliad,' Hector has a conversation with his wife Andromache, where he expresses his concern for her safety and his people. During the conversation, Hector explains, "But Paris is helpless, and a poor warrior too. If only he could have died! Death would have been honorable for him."(Iliad, Book 6, lines 485-486). This statement shows Hector's concern for his people and his desire to lead them to victory.
Additionally, Hector's interactions with his family show his humane and compassionate side, which further enhances his heroism. In Book 6 of the 'Iliad,' Hector interacts with his son Astyanax, and the exchange shows a different side of Hector's character. Homer writes, "Andromache met him as he came, came running to meet her great Hector, his baby son in her arms, the darling of both! Hector smiled at her, but he did not say a word.". (Iliad, Book 6, lines 390-393). This scene portrays Hector as a loving father and a family man, not just a brave warrior. These interactions with his family and troops suggest that Hector is more than just a military leader, but also a person who cares about his family and his people.
In conclusion, Homer uses the character of Hector to depict heroism and leadership in times of war in Book 12 of the 'Iliad.' Homer portrays Hector as a courageous leader who inspires his troops to fight with courage, leads by example, puts the safety of his troops first, and cares for his family and people. Hector's character epitomizes the ideal of heroism and leadership in ancient Greek societies. Through Hector's character, Homer shows the importance of leadership in times of war and how a leader should be brave, selfless, and concerned about his people's safety. Hector's qualities resonate with the audience, and his character continues to inspire people about the virtues of leadership, heroism, and compassion.
