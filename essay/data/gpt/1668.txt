As a health professional, the assessment of a patient's mental health is crucial. When evaluating Deirdre, a 65-year-old woman with depression, it is important to use proper assessment tools and considerations. She has responded well to electro-convulsive therapy, but has a potential for relapse and difficulty with memory and concentration. Therefore, a comprehensive and thorough assessment must be done to ensure that she receives the best possible treatment and care.
One of the essential assessment tools for evaluating Deirdre might be a mental status exam (MSE). The MSE is an evaluation of a patient's mental and emotional function. It may include a series of questions that assess an individual's mood, thought patterns, memory, and cognitive abilities. This evaluation can help determine Deirdre's current mental state, identify any cognitive or behavioral changes, assess her level of insight into her condition, and help identify any potential symptoms of relapse.
To further evaluate Deirdre's risk of relapse, other measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression might be used. These standardized questionnaires can provide a more specific and detailed analysis of her depression symptoms. They can help identify the severity of her depression, monitor her progress, and help identify any potential triggers or warning signs for a relapse.
In addition to the aforementioned assessments, it is also important to consider Deirdre's medical history and any potential physical causes that may be contributing to her depression and memory loss. A comprehensive physical exam, along with laboratory tests, can address any potential underlying medical issues that contribute to depressive symptoms. For example, thyroid disorders may cause depressive symptoms that mimic depression. Hormonal changes that occur during menopause may also cause depression. A detailed review of Deirdre's neurological system can rule out other possible causes of memory impairment. 
Moreover, assessing Deirdre's past life history, as well as examining the impact of her husband's death on her emotional state, will be helpful in understanding her depression. This could include asking her about her family history, previous mental health experiences, past and current relationships, occupation, and any current stressors in her life. This information can help identify any potential triggers, as well as signs of social isolation or lack of support, which can increase her risk of relapse. 
Finally, working collaboratively with Deirdre to identify her goals for treatment can help determine which treatment approaches will be most effective to prevent relapse. The treatment plan should be tailored to her specific needs, preferences, and limitations. It should be a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, such as psychotherapy, support groups, lifestyle changes, and stress-reduction techniques. Consideration should be given to Deirdre's potential for medication interaction, her ability to tolerate side effects, and her preference as to treatment modalities. The treatment plan should be reviewed and updated regularly, depending on Deirdre's progress.
In conclusion, the assessment of a person's mental health is a critical component of patient care. When evaluating Deirdre's depression, using standardized assessments, examining her medical history, assessing her social support system, and working collaboratively with her to identify goals for treatment are all essential considerations. By using comprehensive assessment tools and considering all the necessary factors, Deirdre can receive the most effective treatment for her depression and reduce the risk of relapse.
