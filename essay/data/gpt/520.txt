Introduction:
The question of morality has been the foundation of human society since the dawn of civilization. It has been studied by many philosophers and scholars throughout history. Some believe that morality is objective, and there are objective moral truths, while others believe that it is subjective and relative to one's culture, society, and personal beliefs. The distinction between these two beliefs has been a matter of debate for centuries, and neither view can conclusively answer the question of whether or not morality should be private.
Objective Moral Truths:
Objective moral truths refer to the idea that there are universal and moral rules that apply to all individuals, regardless of their culture, society, or beliefs. It is the belief that there are certain things that are inherently right or wrong, and these values cannot be changed or altered by personal beliefs. For example, the idea that murder, rape, and stealing are always wrong, no matter the context, is an objective moral truth.
Philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, believe that morality is based on reason, and that objective moral truths are derived from the application of reason. In Kant's view, individuals should act in accordance with the "categorical imperative," which is the idea that individuals should act in a way that would be acceptable if it was made into a universal law. In this way, objective moral truths are based on the universal principles of reason.
Supporters of objective moral truths argue that they provide a sense of structure and consistency in society. Objective moral truths are not determined by personal preferences or cultural norms, which can vary from society to society. Instead, they are based on universal principles that apply to all individuals. This view also suggests that people have a responsibility to act in accordance with these objective moral truths, regardless of their personal beliefs.
Moral Relativity:
On the other hand, moral relativity holds the view that morality is not universal but relative to one's culture, society, and personal beliefs. It suggests that there are no objective moral truths, and that morals are based on subjective human experiences. In this way, what is considered moral in one culture or society may not be considered so in another.
Some proponents of moral relativity argue that it allows for diversity in society and respects the individual's personal beliefs. They argue that morality should be based on personal experiences, rather than universal principles. According to moral relativity, individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their actions based on objective moral truths, but rather on the norms of their society or culture.
Can Either View Answer Whether Morality Should be Private?
Both objective moral truths and moral relativity have their strengths and weaknesses. However, neither view can conclusively answer whether morality should be private or public.
Objective moral truths argue that morality is universal and applicable to all individuals, and therefore, should be public. However, this view ignores the role of personal beliefs and experiences in shaping moral judgments. It assumes that there is a single, objective truth to moral questions, which may not always be the case.
Moral relativity argues that morality is relative to one's culture, society, and personal beliefs. Therefore, it should be private, and individuals should not be judged based on the objective moral truths of others. However, this view neglects the importance of universal principles in shaping moral judgments. It also suggests that there is no shared morality in society, which can lead to moral relativism and ethical conflicts.
There is no definitive answer to whether morality should be private or public. It depends on various factors, such as cultural norms, personal beliefs, and the context of the situation. However, both objective moral truths and moral relativity can help us navigate ethical dilemmas and make judgments about what is right or wrong.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the distinction between objective moral truths and moral relativity is a matter of debate, with both having their strengths and weaknesses. However, neither view can conclusively answer whether morality should be private or public. The question of whether morality should be private or public depends on various factors and is context-dependent. Therefore, it is essential to consider different viewpoints when making moral judgments and to be mindful of the impact of personal beliefs, cultural norms, and societal values.
