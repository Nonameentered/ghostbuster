In Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," the author explores the concept of degeneration through the characters and their actions. The idea of degeneration, popularized by Cesare Lombroso and Max Nordau in the late 19th century, is the notion that certain individuals are predisposed to deviant behavior due to their physical or mental traits. Wilde's novel provides a commentary on this concept of degeneration, showing how it operates in society and how individuals can be corrupted by their impulses and desires.
Lombroso and Nordau believed that degeneration was a result of evolutionary regression, where certain individuals are unable to keep up with the demands of advancing civilization. Lombroso argued that physical features such as facial asymmetry, abnormal cranial size, and other physical abnormalities were signs of innate criminality. Similarly, Nordau argued that certain mental afflictions like hysteria, melancholia, and hypochondria were also symptoms of degeneration. He also believed that art and literature were contributing to this degeneration, as they encouraged individuals to indulge their base desires and emotions.
In "The Picture of Dorian Gray," Wilde explores these ideas through the character of Dorian Gray himself. Dorian is a handsome young man from a noble family who becomes infatuated with the idea of beauty and youth. He is introduced to the hedonistic lifestyle by his friend Lord Henry Wotton and becomes increasingly interested in indulging his desires. Over time, Dorian's physical appearance does not change, but his moral character deteriorates as he becomes more selfish, callous, and eventually murderous. His actions, however, are not simply a result of his physical or mental makeup but are also influenced by the society in which he lives. Dorian is depicted as a product of his environment, corrupted both by his indulgent lifestyle and by the standards of beauty and youth that society values.
Wilde's novel reflects Lombroso’s and Nordau’s ideas about degeneration in several ways. First, Wilde employs physical traits to create the idea of degeneration in Dorian Gray. In the novel, Dorian's portrait ages and grows more grotesque as he continues to indulge in his hedonistic desires, reflecting the physical degeneration that Lombroso believed accompanied behavioral regression. Dorian's beauty, which is emphasized repeatedly throughout the novel, is also depicted as a corrupting influence and a sign of his impending doom. For Lombroso and Nordau, beauty was a sign of decadence, and in "The Picture of Dorian Gray," it becomes a metaphor for the moral decay that plagues Dorian's soul. The emphasis on beauty and youth as societal values is also a reflection of Nordau’s argument that culture upholds and encourages degenerate behavior.
Moreover, the characters in the novel are themselves implicated in the idea of degeneration. Lord Henry, for example, espouses ideas about the supremacy of beauty and youth that drive Dorian further into his nihilistic and self-destructive behavior. Henry is depicted as a nihilist who advocates a life of limitless pleasure and individualism, and his influence on Dorian is clear. Dorian comes to believe that beauty, youth, and pleasure are the only things worth living for and that society's condemnation of these things is a sign of its own decay.
Likewise, the society that Dorian inhabits is implicated in the idea of degeneration as it is depicted as being highly corrupt and hypocritical. The novel's critique of society reflects Nordau’s argument that the culture itself contributes to the decline of civilization. The highbrow society depicted in the novel is a highly judgmental and hypocritical environment, where individuals are valued more for their wealth, status, and beauty than for their character. Dorian's inability to break free from the society's expectations and values leads to his eventual downfall.
Finally, Wilde's novel also tackles the question of who is responsible for degeneration. Lombroso and Nordau's theories placed disproportionate weight on biological and psychological factors while ignoring the social and cultural environment in which individuals lived. Wilde's novel, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of society in promoting and encouraging degenerate behavior. Dorian's downfall is the result of a combination of factors, including his own desires, his social environment, and the cultural expectations of his time. The novel suggests that degeneration is not simply an individual phenomenon but also a reflection of the larger social and cultural context in which people live.
In conclusion, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" explores the concept of degeneration as defined by Lombroso and Nordau, and adds an additional perspective to their argument. Oscar Wilde critiques the idea that certain individuals are predisposed to deviant behavior due to their physical or mental traits. Instead, he suggests that degenerate behavior is the result of a combination of environmental, social, and cultural factors. The novel also underscores the importance of morality and ethical behavior in human life, contrasting it with the ideas of pleasure and decadence that underscore Dorian's amoral hedonism. "The Picture of Dorian Gray" provides a thought-provoking commentary on the concept of degeneration and its influence on individual character in the larger context of societal and cultural pressures.
