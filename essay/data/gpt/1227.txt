Egyptian mummies have captivated people’s imagination for centuries. The curiosity about Egypt’s ancient culture and their way of life has sparked interest in scientists, historians, and archaeologists. Out of all the discoveries and findings that have been made about ancient Egyptians, mummies have been the most intriguing. Until recent years, mummies have primarily been regarded as macabre artifacts to attract tourists or as relics to be displayed in museums. However, with modern scientific methods, researchers have been delving into the true nature of mummies. As a result, mummies have proved to be a goldmine of information for us. The study of mummies has helped researchers reveal many aspects of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as the lifestyle, beliefs, diet, and health of the Egyptian people. Moreover, the research has also enabled us to link it with ancient trade practices. In this essay, we will discuss the various ways in which scientific investigation of Egyptian mummies has revealed information about the lifestyle and beliefs of ancient Egyptians, including their diet, health, and methods of embalmment, and how trade can be linked to these findings.
Egyptian mummies were one of the most important aspects of ancient Egyptian culture as they saw life as an extension into the afterlife that was full of riches and joy. Thus, embalming of the body was an essential religious act that helped preserve the body’s remains for the afterlife. To successfully achieve this goal, Egyptians used the latest technology and knowledge of human anatomy available at the time. The process involved the removal of internal organs for ritualistic purposes, preserving the body with various chemicals and packing it in salt to draw out moisture. The body was then wrapped in linens, which had been soaked in resin, and a cover was put on the face, head, and hands, often resembling the person’s face. All these elaborate steps suggest a well-organized, powerful, and sophisticated civilization. However, the true nature of the Egyptian mummification practice has been uncovered through modern scientific methods.
The science of Egyptology is an interdisciplinary field that uses various techniques such as X-rays, computer tomography scans (CT scans), and chemical analysis to study mummies. Through the use of these methods, scientists have gained knowledge about various diseases that affected ancient Egyptians during their lives. Dental problems, fractures, degenerative bone diseases, and some infectious diseases are all injuries that researchers found while studying mummies. Further analysis of mummies has revealed that the Egyptians suffered from parasitic infections, intestinal and digestive problems, and dental caries. The diet was another aspect that the scientific investigation of mummies could uncover. The diet was mainly plant-based, and the meat diet was restricted to portions of fish and occasionally some red meat. Many mummies have shown signs of iron deficiency anemia, which could indicate a limited meat intake or a lack of nutritional knowledge. 
Trade is an essential aspect that links these findings with their practices. The ancient Egyptians were a dominant force in the Mediterranean trade, and their way of life was deeply influenced by their trading practices. Through these, they got access to exotic spices, valuable metals, and precious stones, which they used as offerings to their gods and to make their artifacts more valuable. The trade also influenced their dietary habits, and through it, they could get different types of food items that they could not create themselves. According to Korinthia Klein’s article, “The trade-in spices was advantageous to the Egyptians as they could exchange their timber, ivory, and pottery for cinnamon, cumin, coriander, and other spices which were used to flavor their food and drink.” Thus, trade played an essential role in shaping the diet of ancient Egyptians.
The advancements in the investigation of mummies have led to numerous findings about ancient Egyptian’s beliefs and lifestyles. It has been found that ancient Egyptians believed that after death, their spirits traveled to the afterlife, which they considered to be a perfect replica of their present life. That being the case, they heavily relied on the preparations of the body, religion, and culture to cope up with the challenges that lay ahead. Thus, their life after death was a central theme that influenced their daily activities. The embalming process focused on preserving the body, not just for preservation purposes but because they believed that the body was still essential in the afterlife. The cult of Osiris was one of the most important cults in ancient Egypt, and in it, the god Osiris was celebrated as the ruler of the afterlife. The god’s body had been embalmed, and therefore, Osiris’s corpse was treated with reverence as the ancient Egyptians believed that through Osiris, they would attain eternal life.
Apart from the cult of Osiris, the ancient Egyptians were also great believers in a multitude of gods, and they built elaborate structures to honor them. The pyramids incorporated various astronomical features, and through the pyramids, they hoped to facilitate the king’s journey to the afterlife. The tombs were decorated ostentatiously, and the funerary objects left at the tombs symbolized the journey to the afterlife. They also believed that while in the afterlife, their bodies would need sustenance. As a result, they prepared elaborate gifts of food, including meats, bread, and wine. Cornelia Römer’s article, “The Tomb of Ankhmahor,” states that “Food would have been left for him in the tomb, and offerings would be brought to it on a regular basis to ensure that the ka would have enough sustenance… In addition to food, the tomb was filled with a variety of objects including furniture, pottery vessels, cosmetic containers, amulets, jewelry, weapons, and textiles. Together, these items would enable him to live well in the afterlife for eternity.”
In conclusion, the modern scientific investigation of Egyptian mummies has significantly contributed to our present understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. It has revealed information about the lifestyle and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, including their diet, health, and methods of embalming. The practice of embalming or the mummification process, previously regarded as a religious act, also indicates an advanced knowledge of human anatomy and preservation practices. Through proper examination of the embalmed mummies, we can state with great confidence that scientific knowledge was present in their society. Their way of life was shaped by their trading practices as the exchange of goods and services allowed them access to different foods, spices, and exclusive materials. As such, Egyptian mummies reveal their beliefs, the kind of lives they led, and some of the practices they followed. Moreover, they also confirm the advanced nature of Egyptian society and provide valuable insight into the religious, cultural, economic, and social aspects of ancient Egyptian civilization.
