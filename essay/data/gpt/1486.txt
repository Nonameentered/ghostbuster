Expansion is a major milestone for any business. It signifies growth, prosperity, and enhanced opportunity for the company. The Lakeside Group has experienced tremendous success in the retail business, and by seeking expansion into the hotel and restaurant market in Kenya, the company can establish itself as a leading brand that meets all the needs of their customers in Africa. However, before making the move, the company must consider various factors that will contribute to the success of their expansion.
Kenya’s business and economic environment is a dynamic and promising one. The country has made significant strides in economic growth, political stability, and social reforms over the last two decades. The Lakeside group should consider key indicators such as inflation rates, political stability, availability of infrastructure, consumer behavior, and competition in Kenya, before embarking on their expansion. This essay will evaluate the key factors that The Lakeside Group should consider before expanding into the hotel and restaurant market in Kenya, and explore the strategies they can adopt to succeed in this new environment.
Political Stability
Kenya has been dogged by political instability over the years, caused by political corruption, tribalism, and nepotism. However, the country has experienced remarkable political stability and security in recent years, which has boosted investor confidence. Political stability is essential for The Lakeside Group to establish their presence in the hospitality sector. The business must research political events and trends to ensure that they don't invest in regions that are susceptible to political unrest. This includes analyzing political dynamics in different regions of the country if the group decides to expand to different areas. 
Infrastructure
Infrastructure plays a crucial role in the success of any business. It determines the ease of operations, consumer experience, and cost-effectiveness. The Lakeside Group will need to evaluate the existing infrastructure in Kenya, including transportation, communication, energy, and water supply. The group can achieve this by collaborating with local authorities or experienced consultants who can advise them on the most viable locations and infrastructure setup. In Kenya, there are areas with adequate infrastructure and services, while others may not be as developed. Evaluation of such factors can help the group identify areas that will allow them to set up their business cost-effectively and ensure consumers receive optimal satisfaction of services.
Consumer Behavior
Consumer preferences vary depending on the region and culture. The Lakeside Group should evaluate consumer behavior in Kenya before expanding. This will involve conducting a market research, consumer segmentation, and understanding the consumer’s buying habits and preferences. Conducting market research will help the group determine what services are most required by Kenyan consumers, and how they should tailor their business model to meet the needs of consumers. Understanding the cultural differences in the Kenyan market can also help The Lakeside Group identify the appropriate marketing techniques to use, such as language preferences and aesthetic appeal in order to show a level of appreciation of Kenyan culture and lifestyle.
Competition
Kenya’s hospitality market is one of the most competitive in Africa. The Lakeside Group will need to conduct rigorous research and analysis to identify the competition they will face in different regions. Competition analysis will help the group determine the size and nature of the industry, the service providers, and their brand positioning. Knowing the level of competition will aid the group in choosing a unique business model and tailor their service offerings to ensure that they stand out. The Lakeside Group must, therefore, invest in nurturing staff excellence as an alternative way of standing out in a crowded market.
Possible Strategies for Success
Kenya's fast-growing economy is an excellent opportunity for The Lakeside Group to expand its business. In order to succeed, along with researching the relevant factors, the group must adopt some strategies in each area to set themselves apart.
Infrastructure
The Lakeside Group must assess their infrastructure requirements and tailor their infrastructure to meet those needs. For example, the company should ensure that their hotels and restaurants are located in areas with easy access to airports, highways, and tourist attraction sites. Partnering with local authorities to improve the infrastructure can benefit the community and significantly reduce the cost of operations, thus aiding the growth of their business.
Political Stability
The Lakeside Group can ensure the safety of their investment in Kenya by following the rule-based economy offered by this developing country. Before putting money into a venture, companies should consider the current state of the country’s political affairs. Kenya has recently established an independent judiciary, guaranteeing the sanctity of contracts and has strict regulations on trade and business activities. Therefore, to ensure success, the company should only invest in regions that have demonstrated political stability.
Consumer Behavior
The Lakeside Group must tailor their business model to meet the needs of Kenyan consumers. For instance, restaurants and hotels in metropolitan areas need to have a variety of cuisine options that cater to the diverse preferences of Kenyans and tourists. Equally, it is essential to ensure that their customers feel welcome and acknowledged, therefore customization of services must take into account the diverse culture and unique behaviors of Kenyans. The Group should invest in staff training to ensure the staff is aware of the local culture and customer preferences.
Competition 
Kenya’s hospitality market is highly competitive. The Lakeside Group’s business model must be unique, offering something that its competitors cannot provide. For example, the group can specialize in eco-friendly or sustainable tourism, provide an immersive cultural experience, or focus on the needs of family-friendly activities. Innovative services beyond traditional hospitality could enable Lakeside Group to differentiate from existing service providers in the market.
Conclusion
In conclusion, expanding into the Kenyan hotel and restaurant market requires intensive forethought and comprehensive planning to be successful. The Lakeside Group should evaluate the relevant factors, including infrastructure, consumer behavior, competition, and political stability before establishing itself in Kenya. It is vital for this business to recognize the cultural differences of Kenya and integrate themselves accordingly. The Lakeside Group must establish a unique brand position by identifying what sets them apart from competitors. Finally, to compete effectively, invest in the development of staff excellence and training, and prioritize the satisfaction of customer needs. Success in the Kenyan hospitality market depends on careful consideration of these factors and adaptation of business strategies to take account of all cultural factors involved.
