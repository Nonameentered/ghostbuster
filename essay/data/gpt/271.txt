Henrik Ibsen's play "A Doll's House" is a groundbreaking piece of theatre that examines the societal expectations placed upon women in the 19th century. The play centers around the character of Nora, who is trapped in a restrictive and oppressive marriage to her husband, Torvald. Nora's journey throughout the play represents the struggles of many women during this time, who were forced to adhere to strict gender roles and could not freely express themselves or live their lives as they desired. Ibsen uses Nora's character to critique the male-dominated society of 19th century Europe by highlighting its hypocrisy, the oppressive nature of gender roles, and the false values of society.
The first way that Ibsen uses Nora to critique the male-dominated society of 19th century Europe is by highlighting its hypocrisy. Throughout the play, Nora represents an idealized version of a woman in society- beautiful, charming, and obedient to her husband's wishes. However, as the play progresses, it becomes clear that Nora is not as innocent as she appears. She has been secretly borrowing money to pay for her husband's medical expenses, forging her father's signature on loan documents to obtain the money. Nora is forced to keep this secret from her husband and others in her life, which ultimately leads to her downfall. The fact that Nora has to resort to such covert and desperate measures highlights the hypocrisy of the male-dominated society of the time. Society idealized women as pure and virtuous, but the strict gender roles and societal expectations left many women without any options to express themselves or even survive.
This hypocrisy is highlighted further in the character of Torvald, Nora's husband. Torvald is shown to be a loving and doting husband, but his affection is conditional. He is only kind to Nora when she is obedient and pleasing to him. When Nora reveals her secret, he switches from calling her his "little songbird" to demeaning her with derogatory names such as "a corrupt, miserable woman." This sudden change in behavior and treatment of Nora highlights the hypocrisy of the male-dominated society that idealized women as pure and virtuous. It is clear that Torvald's love for Nora was never unconditional, and he only valued her for her compliance with societal expectations.
Another way that Ibsen uses Nora to critique the male-dominated society of 19th century Europe is by highlighting the oppressive nature of gender roles. Women during this time were expected to be subservient to their husbands, take care of their children and homes, and not express themselves or their desires for their lives. Nora is no exception to this rule. At the beginning of the play, she is shown as a dutiful wife and mother, engaging in tasks such as knitting and caring for her children. However, as the play progresses, Nora begins to challenge these gender roles. She realizes that she has never been allowed to express herself or her desires for her life, and that she has been forced to repress her own interests and beliefs to please others.
Nora's realization reflects the struggles of many women during this time who were forced to conform to strict gender roles. The oppression of these gender roles is further highlighted in the minor characters of the play, such as Mrs. Linde and Krogstad. Mrs. Linde had to sacrifice her love for Krogstad to care for her sick mother and younger brothers, while Krogstad turned to a life of crime in order to provide for his family after his wife died. These characters' experiences show that societal expectations were so oppressive and restrictive that they often left individuals without any options for their lives.
The false values of society are also critiqued in "A Doll's House." Nora's journey throughout the play represents the struggle with the false values of societal expectations. Society placed a great emphasis on materialism and image. Nora is forced to keep up appearances, even if it means borrowing money and hiding her secret from her husband and society. This obsession with materialism and image ultimately leads to her downfall. Her society values her for her beauty and her obedience, but when she challenges these expectations, she is met with scorn and derision.
The false values of society are highlighted in the characters of Dr. Rank and the Helmer's marriage as well. Dr. Rank, a close friend of the Helmers and Nora's secret admirer, is dying of a sexually transmitted disease inherited from his father. Even though he is a kind and generous person, he is shunned by society because of his illness. The Helmers' marriage, which is portrayed as perfect and ideal at first, is revealed to be hollow and empty. Torvald does not truly love Nora and is only interested in her appearance and her ability to please him.
In conclusion, "A Doll's House" is a powerful play that critiques the male-dominated society of 19th century Europe. By using the character of Nora as a representation of the struggles of women during this time, Ibsen sheds light on the oppressive nature of gender roles, the hypocrisy of societal values, and the false expectations that individuals were forced to meet. Ibsen's critique of 19th century European society resonates deeply with audiences even today. The play highlights the importance of challenging societal expectations, pursuing one's own interests, and being true to oneself, even in the face of oppression and ridicule. Today, it is important to continue to reflect on "A Doll's House" and remember the lessons it teaches about the value of individual freedom, honesty, and self-expression.
