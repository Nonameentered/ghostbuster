A floating charge is a common security that is used by lenders to secure their loans. It is a type of security that allows a lender to secure a loan against a borrower's assets that are not yet fixed or identified. This means that the lender is not granted a fixed charge over the specific asset, but instead, the lender is given a charge that floats over the assets of the borrower. This essay will discuss the benefits and limitations of the floating charge as a security and how recent legal developments have impacted its usefulness for small businesses.
Firstly, floating charges provide several benefits to lenders. One of the main benefits is that it allows lenders to secure their loans without requiring any specific asset as collateral. This means that lenders can secure their loans against a wide range of assets, including stock, inventory, and future assets. This flexibility makes it easier for borrowers to obtain financing, as they do not need to pledge specific assets as collateral. It also reduces the transaction costs associated with collateralization, as the lender does not need to take physical possession of the collateral.
Another benefit of floating charges is that they are relatively easy to create. The process of creating a floating charge is simple and requires only the consent of the borrower and the lender. This makes it a practical solution for small businesses that require quick access to financing. It also reduces the need for expensive legal documentation and procedures, making it a more affordable solution for small businesses.
Furthermore, floating charges provide some advantages to borrowers. Unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge does not restrict the borrower's use of assets that are subject to the charge. This means that borrowers can continue to use their assets in the normal course of business, without impairing the lender's security interest. This increased flexibility allows borrowers to obtain financing for their business needs without interfering with their operations.
However, floating charges also have some limitations for both lenders and borrowers. One of the main limitations is that they provide weaker security for the lender compared to a fixed charge. In the event of insolvency, a floating charge ranks behind a fixed charge and other preferential charges. This means that if the borrower becomes insolvent, the lender may end up with a lower recovery rate than if they had a fixed charge.
Another limitation of floating charges is that they can be difficult to enforce. Since a floating charge is not tied to a specific asset, the lender may have difficulty in identifying and enforcing its security interest. This can be especially problematic if the borrower has multiple creditors, as there may be conflicts over the distribution of assets in the event of insolvency.
Additionally, recent legal developments have impacted the usefulness of floating charges for small businesses. The Enterprise Act 2002 introduced several changes to the Insolvency Act 1986 that affected the treatment of floating charges in insolvency. Under the new legislation, floating charges no longer automatically convert to fixed charges upon the occurrence of certain triggers, such as default or insolvency. This change has made it more difficult for lenders to use floating charges as a security, as they may be less effective in protecting their security interests.
Another recent development that has affected the usefulness of floating charges is the introduction of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (FCAs) regulations in 2003. The regulations allow parties to create security over financial assets using a financial collateral arrangement. This includes the use of collateral that is held by a third party, such as a clearing agent or custodian. While FCAs are not specifically designed for floating charges, they provide a more secure and streamlined solution for parties that require security over financial assets.
In conclusion, floating charges provide lenders and borrowers with several benefits, including flexibility, simplicity, and increased access to financing. However, they also have several limitations, including weaker security for lenders and difficulty of enforcement. Recent legal developments have further impacted the usefulness of floating charges for small businesses, with changes to insolvency legislation and the introduction of new financial collateral arrangements. As such, small businesses should carefully consider their options when seeking financing, and evaluate the most appropriate security arrangements based on their specific needs and circumstances.
