Leopold von Ranke is an important figure in the development of historiography. He has been called "the father of scientific history" for his efforts to establish a rigorous methodology for the writing of history. However, it is important to examine his method and philosophy to determine to what extent he can be accurately described as the father of scientific history, as well as his reasons for rejecting the philosophy of the enlightenment. Additionally, it is important to analyze the impact of Ranke's historical philosophy in both German and American historiography.
Ranke's method emphasized primary sources and a focus on the particulars of individual events. He believed that history could be written objectively, without the intrusion of personal biases or interpretations. This approach was a departure from earlier historical writing, which tended to rely on secondary sources and generalizations based on broad themes. Ranke believed that history should be written based on the facts, and that it was the historian's job to "show what actually happened". This approach required a great deal of research and analysis of primary sources, which Ranke believed was crucial to understanding the events of the past.
Ranke's philosophy was rooted in his belief that history was an objective record of events that could be uncovered through rigorous research. He rejected the notion that history could be shaped by personal biases or interpretations, arguing that the historian's job was to "show what actually happened" without any editorializing. Ranke believed that history was a science, and that the historian's role was to uncover the facts and present them as objectively as possible.
At the same time, Ranke rejected the philosophy of the enlightenment. He believed that the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and progress led to a narrow view of history that ignored the complexity of human experience. According to Ranke, the Enlightenment ignored the subjective nature of human experience, which meant that it was unable to fully understand the social and cultural context of historical events. Instead of being driven by a belief in progress, Ranke's philosophy was shaped by a belief in the importance of tradition and the need to explore the full range of human experience.
Ranke's historical philosophy had a significant impact on the development of German and American historiography. In Germany, Ranke's emphasis on objective research and primary sources led to the development of what is known as the "Rankean school" of history. This school emphasized the importance of empirical research and the development of a rigorous methodology for historical writing. The Rankean school was influential in the development of German historiography, and its methods continue to be used to this day.
In America, Ranke's influence was felt through a number of different schools of history. The first was the "progressive school", which emphasized the importance of social and economic change in the development of American society. The progressive school was heavily influenced by Ranke's rejection of the Enlightenment's emphasis on progress, and it emphasized the need to study the social and economic conditions that shaped historical events.
Another school that was influenced by Ranke was the "consensus school". This school emphasized the importance of consensus and the need to understand how different groups in society worked together to achieve common goals. The consensus school was heavily influenced by Ranke's belief in tradition and the importance of exploring the full range of human experience. Finally, the "new social history" movement was also influenced by Ranke's rejection of the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and progress. This movement emphasized the importance of social and cultural factors in shaping historical events, and it sought to explore the experiences of historically marginalized groups.
In conclusion, Leopold von Ranke can be accurately described as the father of scientific history. His method, which emphasized primary sources and a focus on the specifics of individual events, was a departure from earlier historical writing, which tended to rely on secondary sources and generalizations based on broad themes. His philosophy, based on a belief in the objective nature of history and the importance of tradition, had a significant impact on the development of both German and American historiography. Ranke's influence is still felt in historical writing today, and his emphasis on empirical research and the use of primary sources continues to be a fundamental aspect of modern historical methodology.
